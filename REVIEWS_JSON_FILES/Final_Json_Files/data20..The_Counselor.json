        "review_detailed_main": "With three of his novels being adapted into critically acclaimed films, Cormac McCarthy has opted to try his hand at screen writing, and the fruits of his labor can be seen in The Counselor. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film stars Michael Fassbender as a high-priced lawyer who decides to dabble in something a bit less than legal in order to make some extra cash.\n\nAgainst the advice of associates Reiner (Javier Bardem) and Westray (Brad Pitt), The Counselor (whose name is never mentioned) has somehow gotten himself involved in the drug trafficking business, although the film remains ambiguous about the specifics. Motivated by the love of a beautiful woman (Penelope Cruz) and the desire to maintain the lifestyle he's enjoyed for so long, he never takes into account the sort of consequences he may be subjected to, should things not go according to plan.\n\nAs the trailers for the film make abundantly clear, things do not, in fact, go according to plan - at least, that's what we're led to believe, since the details of The Counselor's involvement in said plan are never actually revealed. Despite being warned about this scenario from the very beginning, by nearly every other character in the film, The Counselor remains inexplicably shocked and stunned when things begin to unravel.\n\nRidley Scott's latest directorial effort is peppered with lengthy scenes that find The Counselor engaged in conversations with other characters as they try to impart kernels of wisdom, truth and philosophy. Unfortunately, first-time screenwriter McCarthy fails to realize that he's not writing a novel here. Despite the brilliance of his literary works, he doesn't take into account the fact that living, breathing people rarely speak in monologues, and there's scarcely an ounce of naturally delivered dialogue in any of these exchanges.\n\nIndeed, if you watch closely you can actually see the actors struggling to wrap their heads (and mouths) around these complex conversations that are surely meant to sound intelligent, but come across as anything but. It's hard to find fault with the talented cast, but when working with such messy material, it's difficult to be at the top of your game.\n\nDespite the script's shortcomings, The Counselor provides enough intrigue to keep things moving along for about 90 minutes or so. The problem, of course, is that the film grinds to a complete and utter halt with another half hour still left in the tank, and the final 30 minutes is some of the most excruciatingly boring cinema I've seen this year. It's a frustrating and befuddling experience, and I left the theater wondering exactly what the hell had happened, both in front of the camera and behind it.\n\n-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Normally, I fully appreciate bleak films with utterly despicable characters that leave you thinking rather than leaving the theater with a smile on your face, joyous to the fact that the hero saved the day yet again. Sorry, that's not my kind of story as overdone as it is. I prefer brutal realism where humanity is depicted in a much less phony manner. That's exactly what The Counselor promises as its characters take fairly regrettable paths- flawed people that make mistakes in a criminal environment. Some are more oblivious to it (or outright merciless), and some are much more humane in their methods. At first glance, it seems as if it's impossible for The Counselor to be proved a disappointment from the looks of its amazing cast (the likes of Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, and Penelope Cruz), exceptional director with a credible resume, and a totally prestigious author signed on for his first screenplay. In addition, it appears to be a crime thriller, which definitely commences my adrenaline rush because it's personally my favorite genre.\n\nUnfortunately, this film is a perfect example of \"don't judge a book by its cover\" (whether positively or negatively; people just love positivism so they usually associate the idiom with negativism). To simply put it, the story is a complete mess right from the start. We have our main character who goes by \"Counselor\" (played by one of my favorites, Michael Fassbender) confusingly dropped into this situation. How did he end up in this predicament? Why did he choose to pursue such a perilous and illicit path? Basically, the movie never explains anything. You're left in wonderment, attempting to figure out who is on whose side. Who wants to kill them exactly? Characters end up in random places, and the story never even bothers to explain how the two characters even know each other. The script just conveniently places two movie stars in one scene without an effectively developed context to service it. What follows are countless scenes where characters engage in conversation, vaguely discussing the circumstances.\n\nThe dialogue also feels vastly strange because the characters don't talk like actual people do in reality. Their speech sounds quite literary as they spout metaphor after metaphor, coupled with complex vocabulary. With that being said, I had no issue with it at first. In that, I mean I held no issue with the style of speech. What I did have an issue with was the way the characters spoke in a way that fully befuddled the viewers. It's like only the characters are in on it the entire way without the audience's understanding. In essence, it makes for an inconvenient and confusing experience.\n\nSpeaking of the cast, Javier Bardem was really the only one that stood out to me. Frankly, Cameron Diaz had me bewildered. She's supposed to be from Barbados with an accent- See, I wasn't even sure whether she was sporting an accent or not. At times, it felt like she had an accent going on, and then in other moments, she was speaking fluent and clear English; so I have no idea what was going on there. Even then, the film could've easily hidden all these flaws by presenting us with a thrilling and suspenseful plot, but it actually turned out to be incredibly uneventful. The scope didn't feel as exciting as it was supposed to be, and it definitely wasted an incredible amount of potential. So yes, I'm absolutely saddened; this was one of my most anticipated films of this year, if not my most anticipated, and it ended up falling embarrassingly flat.\n\nThere were a few disturbingly violent scenes that boosted the film's tone, for lack of a better term, literally, and reminded us of the excellence of No Country for Old Men. You're also met with an outrageous sex scene that's equally disturbing and sexy for some, and those scenes might be the only snippets of The Counselor remembered down the road. The ending was also not very reassuring, cutting to the credits unexpectedly shortly after another monotonous and ambiguous conversation. The only decent element of this movie was its soundtrack, but then again, its quality could've just been determined in comparison to the oddity and nuisance that the rest of the film consisted of. In sum, the best way to describe The Counselor is \"brutally unsatisfying.\" I felt no sense of satisfaction by the time it drew to a close, and everything simply felt so meaningless and forgettable. There's no question that it left a bad taste in my mouth, and I sincerely hope that Ridley Scott ups his game sometime soon."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counselor is one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen. Ever since it came out I was intrigued how it got very mixed reviews when it had such an amazing cast and crew. But now I know. I'll start with the positives because there actually is plenty to like in this movie. The acting first and foremost is phenomenal, particularly Fassbender and Bardem. It's the only reason you care about anything that's happening. The directing is slick and stylish, and there are a few scenes that are actually brilliant to see unfold. Some lines of dialogue are powerful. Cameron Diaz was good. I'm already running out of positive things to say so let's get right into it.\n\nThis movie is a hot mess. There are a hundred characters in this damn thing, it's over 2 hours long when it shouldn't have been, every scene could've been cut in half and the movie would've been all the better for it. It's hard to keep up with all the crap going on because it's so scatterbrained in its storytelling. And that's weird to say because Bardem's character tells some really captivating and hilarious stories. But the movie itself is so wordy and self-indulgent that even if you want to keep up with everything that's happening, there's no good reason to. It's an exercise in tedium after a while. It's like the writer said, \"Let's see how many words I can squeeze into this scene before the audience has no idea what the f*ck it's about,\" and he did that for every damn scene. And again, there are glimmers of brilliance, hell the actual story is really interesting, but goddamn that just makes it all the more frustrating.\n\nThe plot can be boiled down to a lawyer getting himself in a bad situation with drug guys and how he tries to get out of it. It sounds like a focused plot, but the movie complicates it beyond comprehension. One minute I'm totally entranced by what's happening on screen, anxiously awaiting what's going to happen next, and then the movie will jump to a scene with random characters we've never seen before talking about nonsense, and they just keep talking and talking until I forget what I was entranced with in the first place. Seriously, if every scene in the movie was cut in half, it could be an excellent crime thriller. There are some truly brutal moments in the movie, and some thought-provoking ones, but they get stretched out and morphed to the point of bewilderment. Some of the lines in this movie are cringe-worthy. Like, did they really have to repeat what the other person said in five different ways? No? That's what I thought. And that's why this movie pisses me off.\n\nThe Counselor will definitely impress some people. If you can handle an absolute clusterf*ck of a movie with a few amazing scenes and superb acting then you'll probably enjoy it. But even that makes it sound better than it is, because the great scenes are so few and far between you're left thinking, \"Why on earth did they go in this direction? They had something great here!\" It's a baffling movie, really, and the more I think about it the more it upsets me because of how great it could've been. Its potential was so clear, it's like they tried to make it as convoluted and stupid as possible.\n\nWorst of all, the movie takes itself dead seriously. It thinks it's so great, and again for the millionth time, IT COULD'VE BEEN. But no, The Counselor refuses to take other people into consideration. It's so in love with itself it gives no one else a reason to love it, let alone care. Watch at your own risk."

        "review_detailed_main": "With a star studded cast, featuring the likes of Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt, and directed by Ridley Scott, with a script from one of the greatest American novelists alive, Cormac McCarthy, obviously I went to see \"The Counselor\" on face value alone. Admittedly, aside from the fact that this is not a very cinematic endeavor, the first half of this film is pretty bad. That is to say the first act and a half is far too cryptic for its own good, with dialogue that is in love with its own double entendres and lines which sound as though they would be more at home in a novel than spoken aloud by human beings. But, if you're patient enough to stay with this film until the second hour, you will be rewarded by witnessing how McCarthy and Scott weave this almost action-less tale together, quietly guiding audiences into a brilliantly disturbing and hypnotic finale.\n\nThe performances (the standout coming from Bardem) are all fine here. These are all great actors, so what else would you expect? Same goes for the direction. The wildcard with \"The Counselor\" was always McCarthy's transition from novel to feature film scriptwriting; a transition that was a first act failure on the grounds of dialogue alone. In that same breath, his high caliber story of a lawyer who gets involved in drug trafficking and his masterful construction redeems him almost entirely by the time it's all said and done.\n\nAs I alluded to before, there is not much action here, which may give the illusion to some that sequences are occurring but nothing is progressing, which may also promote watch checking. But within this conversation based film, as much as I would have preferred the dialogue to have been handled with more subtlety, the subtext is always interesting, gaining its momentum from the converging stories within the second half.\n\nFinal Thought: \"The Counselor\" is the film equivalent of an artichoke. You either like it or you don't. And both are understandable. Maybe one day, once all of the critical heat dies down, history will look more kindly on this movie. But for now, there will be flaws within it that a majority of mainstream audiences just won't be able to forgive.\n\nWritten by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counselor is the work of a fantastic director, an incredible writer and an A+ cast but sadly it just wasn't put together well enough to be an effective movie. It was written by the talented Cormac McCarthy, this is his screenplay debut and his lack of experience shows, he seems to forget that he is writing the script of a modern film and not a novel or a play. Many of the scenes are lengthy, one on one exchanges between two characters who speak in long extended monologues. The dialog itself is sharp, cryptic and original, I loved hearing the characters' philosophical banter about death, religion, sex, acceptance etc. The simple yet tragic story however is muffled by the heavy abstract dialog, which seems to be trying to be as far from expository as possible. It's hard to make out the details of what's actually happening and you constantly find yourself asking, what's the point? I did however enjoy the writing, it was dark and beautiful and I'd love to see McCarthy return to this style in another, perhaps more illustrative script.\n\nThe characters, who are portrayed by some of the most talented actors out there, are all ambiguous, intellectual, bad-asses. It's fun to see slick, eccentric characters like these, but there is no variety, everyone is simply a beautiful and sadistic human being and it becomes very boring to watch. Nobody is lovable, or realistic, or funny or imperfect. It is also impossible to become invested in the characters or the story line. Just a bunch of cool people wearing expensive sunglasses saying and doing cool things, which is enjoyable, but not for a solid two hours.\n\nThe cinematography is exceptional, each shot has the aesthetic quality of a well thought out photograph. There was clearly a lot of thought put into camera angles, and where characters and objects were placed within the frame. I was never bored admiring the exotic, luxurious locations captured with such skill.\n\nAll in all, the ambitious dialog, the beautiful cinematography and the very capable cast, coupled with a very intense soundtrack made for a film that successfully created a very dark, poignant tone. Unfortunately the story was unclear, despite being very basic. The characters did not contrast each other at all, and it was hard to give a damn about any of it. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in film since I did have a good time and I think there's a lot to take away from it. As a film maker, it's interesting to see a group of people who are all masters of their craft, sincerely try there best, and make something that is so completely ineffective."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first heard about this film and its pedigreed credentials: Director Ridley Scott, Starring Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt, I was excited to see it. However, because of the very poor reviews and box office performance Stateside, I have tempered my expectations before I went to see it. And so should you.\n\n\"The Counselor\" refers to the nameless character played by Michael Fassbender. He appears to be a very successful lawyer, happily engaged to a gorgeous, church-going girl (Penelope Cruz). However, for some reason this film never really completely discloses, he still felt the need to get himself involved with a Mexican drug cartel for additional cash, peppered with colorful characters, like the wild-haired Reiner (Javier Bardem), his slinky girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) and the urban cowboy Westray (Brad Pitt). Will the Counselor get away with both the girl and cash?\n\nWhen I saw in the opening credits that the script was by Cormac McCarthy, who was responsible for \"No Country for Old Men\" (which I did not exactly like), I braced myself for one puzzling and boring ride.\n\nHowever, it was not exactly all boring after all. There were those pockets of incredible tension and violence involving necks which you will not soon forget.\n\nMichael Fassbender was okay as the titular Counselor, but there was nothing about his character which was fully-explored. He is obviously greedy enough to risk everything he had to get himself involved in nefarious criminal activities, but we do not see why. So we end up not caring at all about him. We actually see other characters counsel him, than him counseling others.\n\nCameron Diaz's femme fatale character Malkina was unexpectedly well- developed. She is certainly no dumb blond bimbo here. Her scenes though were the most perplexing as to where she was coming from. She has a scene on the windshield of a luxury car that was as head-scratching as it was sensually acrobatic.\n\nJavier Bardem is really very comfortable playing these cool sinister types. Penelope Cruz is too good to be true. I expected more out of their characters than what ended up in the final edit we saw, which was disappointing.\n\nI found the character of Brad Pitt the most interesting one of all. Every time Westray was on the screen, the story perks up and even the long conversations he has with the Counselor actually made sense. Too bad Pitt was only in about a third of the film or less.\n\n\"The Counselor\" comes across as a slick action-filled crime caper film at first glance. However as you watch it, you will realize that it was actually mostly long-winded, unrealistically philosophical conversations and monologues from the most unlikely of characters. I think the main problem is the turgid and generally lifeless script which the talents of the director nor the actors could save."

For me the slow gradual build up was a snowball of tension.

Reiner's woman Malkina (Cameron Diaz) is wild and outrageous. Meanwhile the drug cartel is transporting drugs in an old liquid waste tank truck. The Counselor has a client Ruth (Rosie Perez) in prison. Her son is connected to the drugs and he bails him out of a speeding ticket. Then things go terribly wrong.\n\nI don't know what Cormac McCarthy wrote but what director Ridley Scott put on the screen is a mess. None of the four main characters are compelling. Fassbender projects no emotions. Bardem is way over the top still with a bit of Bond villain in him. Diaz is at least interesting, but Cruz is lost in this innocent sweet character. Brad Pitt comes in for a nice cameo. The story feels disjointed. There are bits of great ideas dispersed throughout the movie. However the bits don't add up to a compelling movie. All the A-list stars step on each other. It needs a grittier dirtier style to make this realistic and exciting. The action comes in a little too late.

The best dramatic writers thrive on creating a story filled with intricacies, multi-faceted characters, mis-direction, and a complex interweaving of sub-plots. Cormac McCarthy has proved he is one of the best such writers through his highly successful novels ... some of which have made the transition to the screen: All the Pretty Horses, The Road, and of course, No Country for Old Men. This, however, is his first attempt at an original screenplay. Describing it as a disappointment is a severe understatement.\n\nThe cool parts of this movie: Bruno Ganz as a diamond dealer in Amsterdam and the two live cheetahs.\n\nThe parts of the film that could have been interesting: the wardrobes of all main characters, Javier Bardem's Brian Grazer-inspired hairdo, the line-up of luxury vehicles (Bentley, Ferrari, etc), and the \"bolito\".\n\nThe parts of this movie that were never going to work: the opening scene with Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz frolicking under the sheets, dialogue that is too poetic for the characters, Brad Pitt as his grown up scammer from Thelma and Louise, Fassbender's Texas accent, and Cameron Diaz.\n\nThe part of this movie that is an outright disgrace: Cameron Diaz doing the splits while having intimate relations with the windshield of Bardem's Ferrari ... maybe this idea came from Joe Eszterhas after being rejected as too outlandish for Showgirls.\n\nChances are viewers will fall into two camps: thinking this is a wild and crazy ride inside the Mexican drug cartel, OR believing this is one of 2013's sloppiest, messiest, most pointless and confusing wastes of time in a movie theater. I am solidly in group two and can't even recommend you see this to determine where you fall.\n\nThe cast is filled with A-listers: Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz. The writer is a renowned novelist. The director is three time Oscar nominee Ridley Scott. How could it miss? Even the best actors can be miscast. Even the best writers have work best left unpublished. Even the best directors lose control of a project.\n\nI guess the best running joke throughout the movie is that Fassbender's titular character is constantly receiving counseling, rather than offering it. At its core, the story is just another drug deal gone bad (do any movie drug deals ever go \"right\"?). With it's unusual visuals, unrealistic conversations, and convoluted sub-plots, this one would have played better as a slideshow. Instead, I am left with this: I'll never look at a smudge on my windshield the same again."

It is rare to see more than 2 characters on screen at the same time. I won't bore you with the plot, such as it is apart from to say it is as predictable and clich\u00e9d as it is full of holes. There are no surprises, there are no twists, there is no humour, there is no tension, there is very little action, just a bunch of blah blah blah which is in itself completely unrealistic, who talks like this anyway? No one, and that's exactly who should waste there time with this drivel."

I consider Brad Pitt to be one of our finest American actors and Javier Bardem has done some excellent work as well.\n\nWith all this in mind, I was anticipating The Counselor to be superb.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nYes, there were some amazing plot twists, gritty violence and good acting. Yes there was wisdom in some of the lines, especially by Ruben Blades and the diamond merchant in Amsterdam. But all in all, it is underwhelming. I could not buy into the motivations of the main character - the Counselor - and wanted to know why he needed to get involved in this deal in the first place. I assumed it was his lavish lifestyle (sports cars, tailored suits, 4-karat engagement rings, etc), but why not tell us? I ended up not really caring what happened to him. Brad Pitt did his best in a limited role, but there wasn't much there to sink his teeth into. Bardem was actually funny in a wasted and weirded-out way, but this was certainly no Anton Chigurh for him.\n\nPenelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz...meh. Michael Fassbender... meh.\n\nI don't know who to blame - the scriptwriter Cormac McCarthy or the director Ridley Scott. Probably both."

But with powerful dialogue & superior acting taking precedent over Michael Bay type action sequences it didn't sit so well with the majority of film critics and nationwide audiences, ultimately receiving an abundance amount of negative reviews. From the opening scene legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott sends a crystal clear message to its viewer that in this violently seductive, harrowing nightmarish roller coaster ride \"ANYTHING GOES.\" If you're still feeling skeptical towards watching the movie I highly insist that you take this final statement to the bank. \"THE COUNSELOR\" takes home the gold for one of the most bizarre sex scenes and one of the most heinous murder scenes in film history!"

        "review_detailed_main": "THE COUNSELLOR is an odd film from director Ridley Scott. While his direction remains exemplary and is difficult to fault, the script from novelist Cormac McCarthy (THE ROAD) is very poor and difficult to fathom. I don't think it's a good idea for novelists to attempt to write such scripts, because novels are nothing like screenplays and such films sometimes come across feeling false and too wordy. That's the case here.\n\nAlthough the plotting in this film isn't too convoluted, it's the dialogue that really drags this down and makes everything feel twice as long as it really takes. Everyone in here is some kind of moral philosopher, given to sitting down and spouting long treaties to the other characters. None of what they say is very interesting, and much of it is rather dull. Hollywood seems to have a real problem in making films about drug trafficking; like SAVAGES, this one misses the mark.\n\nThe problem lies with the characters; there are a lot of them, often played by popular actors, but none are good. Michael Fassbender's lead feels extraneous in the story and is one-dimensional throughout. Cameron Diaz is miscast and really struggling, and Penelope Cruz is there for the glamour alone. The only one who comes out of it with his head held high is Brad Pitt, who makes things feel as effortless as ever. The rest of the cast seem to show up to do a scene and then disappear again for good. This isn't what film-making is about."

Best of all, it's a movie that takes familiar material and shakes it about in unconventional ways. In the acting stakes it's Pitt and Diaz who own the picture which certainly didn't deserve the critical thrashing it got at the time and is now ripe for reassessment."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I'm pretty skeptical about the goodness of the good.\"\n\nThe Counselor is without a doubt one of the most divisive films of the year. It has received a lot of hatred, but at the same time some people absolutely loved it. I understand why this film has caused such a reaction because it doesn't follow your normal narrative structure and is heavy on the philosophical dialogues. I've liked most of Ridley Scott's films, I was one of the few who actually loved Prometheus, and I also think that Cormac McCarthy is a great novelist (No Country for Old Men being his masterpiece) so when I heard the two were going to work together I couldn't help but add this to my watchlist. My expectations took a blow when I read all the early reviews and so I went into this expecting a complete flaw. To my surprise it wasn't as bad as I was lead to believe (I can think of at least 50 films I've seen this year that are far worse) and I ended up slightly enjoying this. Despite its heavy loaded philosophical dialogues and lack of characterization, there are some great scenes in The Counselor and some great performances. This film easily has one of the most memorable murder scenes I've seen all year, but at the same time it has many scenes that really felt out of place (like the scene involving Cameron Diaz and the yellow Ferrari). The Counselor feels more like a McCarthy film than a Ridley Scott movie, and his dark humor and anti climatic scenes are all over the place here in this suspenseful thriller (if I can really call it that because it isn't really generic at all). The Counselor isn't an easy watch and at times it feels too preachy, but it kept my interest nonetheless. McCarthy's message about facing the consequences of your sins was loud and clear in The Counselor.\n\nThe plot is pretty simple actually as the film focuses more on the dialogues than the actual events. Michael Fassbender plays a successful lawyer who is known simply as the Counselor. He falls deeply in love with Laura (Penelope Cruz), a girl of simple tastes, but in order to give her a dreamy life the Counselor decides to enter a one time deal involving drug trafficking. His business associate, the wealthy Reiner (Javier Bardem) who spends most of his time drinking expensive whisky in the mornings and watching his pet cheetahs hunt down rabbits, warns him about the dangers involved in this deal. Reiner has been in this business for a long time and knows how the cartel works, but the Counselor decides to team up with him nonetheless. Reiner's girlfriend, Malkina (Cameron Diaz), is a very smart woman who is kind of shady as Reiner never knows what she is up to. The middle man involved in the transaction between the cartel and Reiner is Westray (Brad Pitt) who also warns the Counselor about the world he's getting himself into. The deal is an apparently simple one as the cartel uses Reiner's trucks to carry the drugs to Chicago, but an unfortunate accident puts everyone's life in danger.\n\nThe Counselor, who ironically in this film is always receiving advice from everyone, learns that greed isn't a good thing. The film focuses on greed and evil, but there is way too much talking at times which makes it feel too preachy at times. I think that much of the criticism this film is receiving has to do with the high expectations that people had about it considering the talented cast and crew involved int his film. Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, and Brad Pitt actually lift this film in my opinion and make their characters bearable to watch on screen. These characters aren't people we would care for in any other film, but the actors make it tolerable. I especially liked Fassbender in this film and I think he gives yet another powerful performance. The weakest link here was Cameron Diaz who never felt natural in my opinion, but that perhaps was part of McCarthy's plan. She isn't as strong as Bardem was in No Country for Old Men, but she kind of plays that same character that McCarthy tends to include in his novels. This is the first time that McCarthy writes an original screenplay since the other films were based on his novels, and this is definitely more his film than Scott's. If you are a fan of his work than you will probably like this film more than other people. I think one of the key McCarthy moments can be seen through Ruben Blades's monologue about how our decisions ultimately set our fate. There are just too many memorable scenes in this film for me not to give it a passing grade. The Counselor isn't an easy watch, but if you go into it with your expectations lowered you might actually be in for a surprise."

        "review_title": "Just Tag Along",
        "review_detailed_main": "There is one very important rule of seeing The Counselor, always remember that its screenplay writer is Cormac McCarthy. And the thing about this writer is it's the words that bring pizazz to his stories. People may jump in to the film expecting more of the horrifying consequences that the characters will get, but most of it are just scenes of discussions mainly about moral dilemmas and their other interests. It's a somewhat strange film, but it's also thoroughly fascinating, only when you have the right idea what experience you're going to get.\n\nThe film already falters by lacking any sort of momentum and having a pretty obvious message, even at the very start. There isn't really much going on with the lead characters at the first half other than conversations, but then it's not about them doing anything. Their fate actually depends on what's happening behind their business, where cartels have to feud for the shipment. As a result the danger happens like a snap, where they probably didn't see coming. Surprisingly there is hardly any tension created within those scenes, it just describes whatever effect it will cause when you get to involve in a dirty work.\n\nAgain, it's all about McCarthy's words. Paying close attention to his dialogue is really the best advice here, just tag along with the subjects he wants to talk about so you may leave yourself interested throughout the plot. Some parts of the script can be too laughably silly, but there are also plenty of fascinating things to think about. And for its surfaces, there are plenty of obvious McGuffins to notice. Obsession with diamonds, cheetah obsessed antagonists (basically because they're predators), sex, and violent consequences. In spite of all of that, it still doesn't built any subtlety, but it's probably an addition for personality.\n\nThe filmmaking works well enough. Ridley Scott's direction is predictably stylish, and it decently blends with its gritty violence. The grainy camera quality fits perfectly to its tone. And for the acting, it's not a nuance for Michael Fassbender, but he handles the character well and he is, as always, charming. Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt share the same feat with Fassbender. The least impressive among is Cameron Diaz who occasionally hams it up, but that seems what you'll get if you have an intensely ruthless villain.\n\nConventional viewers will find it hard to consider The Counselor as entertaining, but it is quite reasonable. It's not meant to be exciting, nor subtle. There is no nuance to be found either. Despite of being almost uncinematic, it's still ridiculously gripping and provocative. Yes, whatever McCarthy is trying to tell us is too crystal clear, but it's all spiced up. In the end, that's it. Just follow whatever the writer wants to say on screen. Anything else are portraits of their ugly, cruel world and it brings more effect to the story. The Counselor can be a troubling experiment, but it seems to work as it wanted to be."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counselor is quite the interesting film. I saw the trailer to it and thought it looked great. When it came out in theaters, I heard pretty bad things about it. I just recently picked up the bluray to give it a chance. While I do certainly have gripes with it, I actually liked it more than I expected I would.\n\nI'd like to start with what I liked about it, since most people just rip the film apart. First off, I thought the visual style and atmosphere that the visuals help build was really good. It's a nice looking movie, and that can't be denied. It also has a plot that had me interested. In one way it's something we have seen done before, but something about the way the characters come together worked for me. It's also quite the dark film, and I can appreciate that since many films don't go as dark as this. I also think Fassbender gives a very good performance. Even Penelope Cruz is good in a role that makes you almost fall in love with her yourself.\n\nNow, onto the negatives. One huge issue is the script. It's been said before, but it seems like it would work better in a book than it does on film. It was written by Cormac McCarthy who has written many great books, some one which have been adapted to films. But this is just too far on the literature side of things than it is the film side. But one thing that really changes my view of this is the fact that I watched only the unrated extended cut. A lot of the sequences that I had issues with were ones that weren't in the theatrical cut, only the extended cut. But at the same time, these scenes felt like they were needed. The reason why I feel this is because while these dialogue scenes didn't add anything to the main plot at all, without them we wouldn't get enough scenes with the characters. These scenes are simply people telling stories that at the end of the day are just random unrelated tales. Some of the stories added in the extended cut also add an element of foreshadowing that becomes so heavy that we almost know exactly what will happen at the end, ruining some of the suspense. It's as if even though they don't develop the characters, we need them in order for those specific characters to have enough screen presence for them to matter at all. Obviously if these scenes had been replaced by really good character development, the film could have been improved drastically.\n\nThere's also a few sequences in the extended cut that really don't seem to add much, even if they are kinda cool on their own. There's a phone call between Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz that I like, and there's even an extended opening sequence with Fassbender and Cruz that is extremely erotic and I think works amazingly well to establish their relationship from the start. It's hard for me to say whether the film is vastly improved by this extended cut, or if watching the theatrical cut without them would be better. I really don't know, but perhaps I will write a review of the theatrical cut if I ever watch that.\n\nA big mis-step for me is letting a certain character come out on top. I won't spoil who, but the character whom I hated the most (and the actor who played the character) ends up kind of coming out unscathed. I think with a better actor, the characters actions and the ending itself would have been good, but in this case it just doesn't work. It reminds me a lot of the ending of Trance (2013) where a certain character comes out on top, but it just doesn't feel satisfying because of the actor in the role, and it instead angers you.\n\nAt the end of the day, I did like this film. It has many things working for it. It's just disappointing because you can see exactly where it fails, and if those things had been fixed, the film would have been incredible. I would still say its underrated considering how much crap people give it."

We do not need details of who, what , where or when regarding the drug deal, we only need to see the greed and the evil it leads to, play out.\n\nYes the dialogue is metaphorical, gloriously so, and the actors deliver this as it was intended to be delivered by the writer and the director. This dialogue is superb in setting the ominous tone for the film, we do not need to know who is picking up what and delivering to whom, we only need to know that it didn't happen and somebody has to pay, pay a price beyond imagining! While there are moments of amusement, it is a deadly serious morality tale that does not play out to our long established preconceptions. Decisions today can make for impossible decisions and terrifying consequences tomorrow.\n\nDo not judge, rate or review this film within the traditional confines of typical Hollywood movies, as it barely applies, maybe it does to the star power but not to the content nor the execution.\n\nI really cannot wait to see this movie again, I give this an 8/10."

I trust Ridley and after Prometheus I would think they would trust him too.\n\nThe veterans all put in worthwhile performances and it for that reason alone I give this movie a 6. Fassbender, Cruz, Bardem (stories alone worth it), Pitt, Blades, all were fantastic and seemed to be in a different movie than the mess they were surrounded by.\n\nUnfortunately its basically unwatchable to an average viewer. Editing is a complete nightmare, Cormac's dialogue is a blur, its like a damn speed reading competition, the conversation between the motorcycle guy and that random lady was fingernails on a chalkboard to a native Texan, no one on earth talks like that. It wants to be dense and wordy but it goes by too quick to be understood properly.\n\nAt its heart its trying to be an extremely grim philosophical crime thriller, in the same vein that No Country for Old men is an extremely grim crime thriller, but the weight of the words is under-cut by the fact they edited out every damn second of silence, this movie cant wait for you, if it stops to think it all unravels.\n\nWhich brings us to Diaz. Its.....complicated, I can see what she was going for and I think she mostly pulls it off, its an extremely challenging role, and there's few believable man hunters in the game but I think a subtler hand would have been better, she over-sells a little too much and it's clunky and bizarre, not helping an already clunky and disjointed movie.\n\nHaving said all of that, maybe that's the point. Its flawed, nihilistic, and unflinching. Like its characters."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been lurking on IMDb for years, always curious to see what the interwebs thinks of certain movies or films. And most of the times I can abide with the ratings. Not in this case however. Seeing that this movie is closer to the 6 than to a 4 I just had to register and rate this awful piece of pretentiousness.\n\nWhen a movie gives you the feeling that your intelligence is failing you - several times I wondered if this is what it feels to watch Pokemon at the age of 75 - , something must have gone horribly wrong. Judging by the cast, the director, the writer, the shots, the locations and the props it's fairly safe to say that it wasn't a matter of budget.\n\nThe story itself has potential to be interesting, it is not super-original, but originality doesn't have to be the most important aspect of a good film. The way the story unfolds, or the characters develop can suck you in. But the pace of the movie (and I can enjoy slow movies very much so) is awful, the scenes are non-sensical and the dialogues are pompous. The highlight of the movie: Javier Bardem and the scene with the car had me laughing out loud, but Im pretty sure that wasn't the effect the makers had in mind.\n\nSave your money and fight this piece of horrendous 'art'."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start this off by saying that I am not picky when it comes to movies. I will enjoy anything from Disney teen chick flick to war documentary, from action movie to drama. It all depends on the message the movie is trying to give. Is it a reminder of something? A moral? Or just pure entertainment for a lazy day? \"The Counselor\" tries to be philosophical as well as action and have a moral, and ends up being a disaster. From start to finish, the plot is confusing, weird and unspectacular. Michael Fassbender's character (The Counselor) is a lawyer who gets into a cocaine deal. Javier Bardem plays some rich guy who's mixed up in the deal with him, and Brad Pitt is another rich guy in this deal. The aim is to import cocaine from Mexico to Chicago, sell it there and split the profit. Then everything starts to go wrong. It isn't clear why these men are involved in the deal - obviously because of greed, but the counselor himself has some money trouble we will never know the details to. The characters are all connected to each other, but it's not clear how they're connected. Some Mexican gangs are involved as well. There's killing and shooting, but mostly it's just babble. Cameron Diaz plays her strangest role ever. With all these great actors/actresses, you'd expect some great acting, but there's little to be found. The moral of this movie seems to be: \"Don't go to Mexico, you'll f-cking die.\" One star for the movie, one star for Penelope Cruz's beauty and one more star for Cameron Diaz's tattoo, which is pretty cool. Do not waste your time on this trash."

That is because as a reviewer I look for flaws -- much the same same way one of the characters in this film first looks at a diamond.\n\nAnd I found none. The cinematography, casting, acting, scripting, direction - all perfect.\n\nThat such a perfect film was created to tell an abstract story will be a loss to some viewers but a gain to others.\n\nThe script, pound for pound, almost has more memorable quotes than Godfather. I have seen a lot of films -- too many -- but will never forget the dialog about \"coincidence\" or \"grief.\"\n\nHighly recommended. A great film, but not an easy film.\n\nAnd as good as Fassbinder is -- and he is -- Cameron Diaz steals the movie even with minimal screen time, using her eyes like a weapon, as far from her role in Charies Angels as the earth is from the moon."

But this is not a conventional action film, except for brief excerpts: in the main, it consists of its very cool characters having highly stylised conversations (typified by the fact that the hero is only ever referred to eponymously as \"Counsellor\") about action that is mostly occurring off screen. Or, as Mark Kermode put it, reviewing for the Guardian, \"an A-list cast speaks B-movie dialogue with C-grade effects\", playing \"the kind of philosophising drug-dealers that even Tarantino would stay clear of\". And while this is harsh, it's not altogether untrue. The rhythms of this movie do grow on you over time; but it's simply not as clever as it thinks it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Counsellor' is an all-star cast, comprising of Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz (excluding the numerous cameos by other well-known actors). Not only is it completely 'A-list,' but it's also directed by Sir Ridley Scott. With a cinematic pedigree like that, how could it fail? Well, it does its best.\n\nIt's far to say that most people who have watched it have hated it. And it's not hard to see why. For a start, if you've seen the trailer, you may feel a little mislead. The trailer markets it (or at least a fair proportion of it) on 'action.' However, if you've watched the trailer, you've basically seen every car chase, punch and gunshot the movie contains. Basically, it's over two hours of people talking to each other.\n\nMichael Fassbender plays the titular character, known only as 'Counsellor.' We never learn his name. Why? No idea. He's *surprisingly* a counsellor, but has decided to do a drug deal. Why? No idea. So he travels around the world talking to one dodgy character after the next. And when I say talk, I really mean TALK. He doesn't just chat, he does a form of monologue which, in real life, is completely alien to how normal people interact with each other. Then, when he's finally shut up, the person he's come to see responds with an equally cryptic speech. And so it goes on, occasionally interspersed with *seemingly* random characters doing their own plot line.\n\nIt's a tough film to watch all right. You really have to be in the mood for something totally 'talkie.' Yes, the actors are as good as their reputations suggest, but the dialogue they're forced to speak does come across as a little forced, even from them. The film is pretty watchable as the multiple monologues to lend a certain depth to our understanding of the characters, but, after a while, it does wear a little thin. The film is over two hours in length and the last half an hour is an even harder watch than what's gone before.\n\nJust don't expect wall-to-wall excitement and make sure you're in the mood for a slow two hours if you possibly hope to get the maximum out of this (although, fans of Cameron Diaz may get a little bonus when they see what she does with yellow sports cars!).\n\nhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

        "review_detailed_main": "THE COUNSELOR is a visually stunning movie with good performances by its star-studded cast, but the overly talky nature of the film made it feel like a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive movie. The story is rather simple: An unnamed lawyer, referred to only as \"Counselor\" (Fassbender) gets more than he bargains for when he enters into a one-time drug deal. Most of the movie is composed of these philosophically heady conversations and salacious anecdotes. While I would expect a movie to have some of these attributes, having a movie almost entirely composed of them starts to wear down on you a little bit. Fortunately, there were a few moments that moved the story along. Even still, they were few and far between (especially with the extended cut I watched). One part I thought was slightly miscast was Cameron Diaz as Malkina, Reiner's (Bardem) cheetah-loving mistress. There was an icy quality to her character and performance, but I didn't really buy her as somebody who wasn't American (she was supposed to be Argentinian). There are also several glorified cameo roles where they show up, talk for a little bit and then exit the picture. Most of the what they said had nothing to do with the story at all, and only served as mouthpieces for Cormac McCarthy's heavy-handed dialogue. Speaking of the dialogue, the script was the first one written by McCarthy directly for the screen, and it shows. He may be a high-caliber novelist, but he sorely needed someone to keep his style in check (like the Coen Bros. on NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Ridley Scott did an impeccable job as usual in delivering a visually compelling film, with a few great action sequences (as well as one scene with Cameron Diaz which I will not spoil...suffice it to say, you won't have seen anything like it before). However, the script supporting it just isn't disciplined enough to the make the movie work like it should. One other nice thing I could say is that I enjoyed the score, which punctuated at all the right moments and was never overpowering. Generally speaking, I count this as an interesting misfire. It's definitely worth one watch, but no more."

I saw it and got it as it was directed by Ridley Scott, written by a great author and had a decent cast list. I never saw any trailers or reviews and just had the briefest of description of the story. I'll tell ya, its the only way to go. On the other hand this can also backfire with some movies....a lot of movies...so it is not worth pursuing but for this particular movie it was one of the real pleasures of movie watching. The film is one of the best I have seen for a long, long, time. From the direction, to the story (Holy man what a script, absolutely brilliant) to the superb acting all round, it had everything...and in buckets. As an example each of the main characters gets a chance to make a speech and all do well (my favourite being Bruno Ganz's)and if people were left totally bemused by the film after watching the trailer then you need to stop watching trailers. I have not watched any for this and probably for the better. As for the points about the plot going nowhere are the story being disjointed I would say to these people ...... stop watching trailers! Everything is very well explained by the Mexican drug barron near the end and funnily enough probably at the beginning by Javier Bardem. If you want a movie about drug violence and explosions and murders and the rest there are plenty out there. This is sooo not the movie for you. Just to sum up this is a brilliant movie and worth seeing on the fly. All the actors give probably one of their best performances in their roles and Scott's direction is fantastic as always. But where the movie really stands out (and really how movies should be first judged) is in the script. Highly recommended. 10/10"

What I don't understand was why the Counsellor himself seemed so dumb. He acted totally unaware that he was dealing with the Juarez Cartel and some other pretty dangerous people. The look on his face was like a whimpering puppy for most of the movie. He has his sweet innocent girlfriend (Cruz) in a world where the mob rules and he acts like everything is OK. Cameron Diaz is bad but there wasn't really the sense of an evildoer behind all the action. Brad Pitt was OK in a Thelma and Louise sort of way; sexy cowboy.

        "review_detailed_main": "Once upon a time Ridley Scott was an innovative director of ground-breaking projects, but those days are long gone. There's nothing new or remarkable about 'The Counselor', which chronicles the trials and tribulations of a lawyer who goes into business with a bloodthirsty drug cartel in the US Southwest. The film has an star-studded cast and a screenwriter with a big reputation as a novelist, but the end result doesn't add up to anything more than a routine suspense thriller masquerading as a cautionary tale.\n\nAs far as plot is concerned, the corrupt attorney soon gets out of his depth among the drug smugglers, hit-men, wicked women and a couple of cheetahs, but Scott provides little reason to care about the fate of his characters. Whatever sympathy one might have considered wasting on such generic types soon disappears when they start making pompous speeches to one another in between the shoot-outs, betrayals, kidnappings and assassinations. Scott tries to glamorize this criminal community with couture clothing, exotic vehicles, gruesome deaths and fatuous sex fetishes, but 'Breaking Bad' did it all far better for a fraction of the budget."

        "review_title": "A cold, niche film. Prometheus for the crime genre.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Ridley Scott has become something of a misunderstood director recently (see the mixed reaction to Prometheus). Audiences seem to keep expecting action adventures (more the style of his bother, the late Tony Scott) instead of the moody, cerebral take on life and fantasy that Ridley so often produces. For every Black Hawk Down, he's given us an Alien, for every Gladiator a Blade Runner...\n\nThe lukewarm reaction to The Counsellor, judging from the rumblings I've heard, come down largely to this repeated misconception. Scott's latest offering is a good film with a great cast but it's going to bore you senseless if you're seeking car chases and gunfire.\n\nThe Counsellor (or The Councilor for US audiences) is cold. It's harsh and at times sickening. It's rarely fun, it saunters rather than sprints and there aren't many characters in it that you'll find yourself rooting for. But, trust me, that's a good thing here. My full appreciation for The Counsellor grew on the journey home when I'd had time to mull it over. It's a film that sinks in slowly and the horror of the protagonist's predicament chills thoroughly with time and will repel many audiences from the outset. But for those familiar with, and appreciative of, the work and style of Cormack McCarthy, his first original screenplay may prove to be a memorable and rewarding experience.\n\nThe Counsellor in question (played by Michael Fassbender) sees the opportunity to make a serious wad of cash through drug trafficking with Reiner (Javier Bardem with distinctive hair). Sickeningly happy with his fianc\u00e9e, Laura (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), life is good until he meets up with middleman Westray (Brad Pitt), who tells him the deal is going south and happiness may be in short supply very soon. Throw into the mix a snake in female form, Malkina (Cameron Diaz), and you have a nasty business indeed.\n\nThe Counsellor unveils the hopelessness and futility of morality within the crime world. It's a harsh existence and, though there's little point in feeling sorry for him for his foolish but conscious choice, it's difficult not to pity the counsellor when his world falls irrevocably apart.\n\nThe warmth, such as it is, comes from the performances. It's an absolute pleasure to watch so many actors at the top of their game. The action is largely in the dialogue and the reactions rather than though stunts and scenarios upon the screen, though there are sufficient of those to punctuate the conversation.\n\nAs for memorable moments, both Brad Pitt's final scene and Cameron Diaz's antics with a certain car will remain with the viewer almost as vividly in the aftermath as they occurred on the screen.\n\nBut occasionally The Counsellor is a dull film and those dull moments blunt the intensity of the dialogue and the underlying sinister tones. In the hands of, say, Paul Greengrass, this would have been a crowd-pleasing thriller, just as Aliens satisfied the gung-ho masses. As it is, Scott delivers a Prometheus for the crime genre that will disappoint many and but fit beautifully into a niche.\n\nFor more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

Again, this is a series of random, only mildly interlocked scenes with almost nothing tying them together. You see the same actors, but upon reflection, nothing puts together scene \"A\" with the next scene \"B\", except there are the same actors. Please do not watch this movie.\n\nI wanted to like this movie, it has a powerful list of actors. But honestly, the story is so contrived, so meaningless, so much ado about nothing, that you really don't care about any of the characters. And the last thing you want is for drug dealers to spend many minutes explaining morality and ethics to you, trying to be Mexican and American Buddhist monks. Because the beginning of the movie is agonizing to watch, and because at the end of the movie, you've gone no where, I highly recommend avoiding this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film may be judged upon different merits. Technically, it is a thing of great beauty in the style of super-crisp cinematography and high-level production values frequently seen in Scott's contemporary films such as American Gangster and Prometheus - there is nothing to be faulted in this area of the film's construction. I believe that the writing is that which has created the vast disparity in professional reviews. The New York Times (?) reviewer gave the film her highest marks whereas others viewed the film as being sub par or even disastrous. How could this be? Perhaps because of the origins of the script, from the hand of McCarthy, a literary master. I was recently watching a Tennessee Williams play adapted for the screen by Kazan, and I could feel the weight of its literary origins. This was how I felt watching TC. The plot, setting, and, more generally, the world, McCarthy creates are vehicles for the theme, that of the human condition, man's striving, reaching, cunning, and ultimately, his animal nature. This was the risk taken by Scott in allowing such a heavy-weight to pen the script, that the film would be driven by theme rather than plot, and that it would not quite fit in with today's banal, CGI-infected cinema culture, which, perhaps, it pretended to be by its glossy exterior. The \"overly-long\" dialog was especially trying for short attention spans but those who may have enjoyed the great cinematic classics over the past century will adore this creation. Through thematic contrivance is created a jungle filled with various inhabitants. Through a form of Darwinian selection, the weak are slowly exiled from this unforgiving world until only those with an appetite for blood and an intolerance for weakness are allowed to remain. There is enough blood and perversion to keep you smiling, but the weight of its humanity will grip your soul. Please ignore the critics, Mr. Scott, and continue allowing your cinematic muse to light your path, even if Hollywood keeps telling you that you must help pay the bills. (See Mr. Welles, not Mr. Spielberg.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counselor could have been one of my all-time favorite flicks. I've watched it twice and I'll see it again before I die. I'd rather watch a single ambitious failure than a dozen safe successes and this is a hugely ambitious failure. What draws me back time and again is the challenge of understanding why it doesn't work. The cast is stellar and the script crackles with taut, witty dialog and some thought-provoking philosophy. There are even some very funny jokes. Why wasn't Jesus born in Mexico? You'll have to watch the movie for the answer. The photography is gorgeous, the south west locations unusual and that wonderful French confection, the mise en scene, on the face of it perfect. After two viewings, I'm beginning to understand the problem. There's an odd lack of energy. That's always a danger with an ensemble piece or a story that's centered on an everyman and Ridley Scott's been down that road once before. Kingdom of Heaven had the same issues and it's instructive that the director's cut was ultimately the much better version. So, here we have another ensemble piece built around an everyman. Instead of Orlando Bloom, we have Michael Fassbender but here Fassbender, whose acting credentials are pretty damn good, is oddly uninvolving. Of course, his performance is authentic, restrained and everything you'd expect from an actor of his calibre. But he's shallow. Right there, we get to the heart of the problem. He is shallow. He is an everyman, caught up in a nightmare created by his own weakness. But we never learn the root of that weakness, why he needs the deal so badly and that's what's missing from The Counselor. It's like watching an accident that happened years ago to people you never knew. The rest of the cast? Everyone delivers. Badem hams it up shamelessly, Cruz is as good as always, Ganz has the best cameo, Pitt proves yet again that he's a far better supporting actor than starring and Perez is perfect. The oddity here is Cameron Diaz. She's not miscast as other reviewers have argued. She's actually spot on. The beautiful, smart survivor who's reaching her sell-by date as a rich man's toy and knows it. That it isn't a wholely successful performance is not, I think, her fault. She has perhaps the meatiest and most nuanced role as the real architect of Fassbender's downfall but the script doesn't give her the material to explore her character to the full. This is a flawed film, part thriller, part tragedy, part comedy and part shaggy-dog story. I will watch it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was extremely disappointed that I spent two hours of my life watching this disjointed compilation of excessive dialogue, unnecessary scenes and unexplained characters appearing and disappearing without warning. In my view, the average person watching a movie, one who is looking to be entertained, will feel this movie is a major letdown. While most are not opposed to a thought provoking movie, and would even probably prefer a movie to have a message and to have interesting intellectual material, I believe this movie goes WAY too far in trying to weave in themes, metaphors and complex dialogue, at the expense of developing the plot and the characters in the movie to a satisfactory extent.\n\nProbably the best feature of the movie is the performances from its actors, in particular Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem and Michael Fassbender. However, while not a bad performance, the decision to cast Cameron Diaz as a woman from Barbados leads to a rather unconvincing performance in that respect. When she makes her few brief attempts to put on an accent it is rather laughable because she speaks with a plain American accent for the majority of the film. Aside from the accent, however, she does provide a reasonably good quality performance.\n\nHowever despite the attempts from the cast, the dialogue and scenes they are given to work with are strange and often simply irrelevant to the story as a whole. The bulk of the movie is made up of large chunks of dialogue between two characters, and one of the two characters is often in only one scene in the whole film, entering and leaving without any development or explanation. This dialogue consists of various extended metaphors and attempts at philosophy as characters present their own thoughts on life and the human condition. Unfortunately, at least in my view, it often comes across as simply trying far too hard to sound like the work of an advanced philosopher without being particularly convincing. There is no real core theme that is pushed more than others because each character provides different perspectives and metaphors.\n\nOverall, the movie comes across as disjointed and seems to have many plot holes and points requiring more explanation. I think the average viewer will regret wasting money and time watching the film. That said, if you're the type that enjoys movies which attempt to be more deep and less entertaining instead of finding a balance, it's probably worth giving it a watch and deciding for yourself. If you're not the type to be an intellectual snob about film, however, I would strongly recommend staying away from \"The Counsellor\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counselor was a promising movie with an ensemble cast and a famous director in Ridley Scott. Unfortunately, it seems Scott is trying to be more of a Tarantino or Scorsese with dialogue heavy scenes that are kind of strangely pieced together and often rambling in nature to the point my mind would start to wander. This movie could have been better had the story flowed a little smoother, but I felt it was watchable and an interesting take on the Mexican Drug Cartel\u0085 The acting was done well, but I felt like perhaps the editing or writing was very weak. There are some scenes that are kind of confusing (perhaps I'm just missing the point), and I'm not sure they were necessarily placed in the most effective order. This is too bad, because the overall story was engaging and the general flow of the story was interesting from beginning to end.\n\nI think Fassbender does a decent job playing the \"Counselor\". He has to go through an emotional roller coaster and he does a good job of taking you on that ride with him. Cruz plays his fianc\u00e9 Laura. She does an effective job in the role, but I think they could have done a better job with her because you don't really seem to feel the emotion that supposedly exists between her and the Counselor. I think they try to build her up to be very important, but I never got to that point with her.\n\nBardem and Diaz both do a good job. I liked Bardem's fast talking Reimer and his scenes felt more engaging to me. The only problem was some of his dialogue scenes kind of fell apart at the end, but I think that had do with the writing more than the acting. Diaz is still very sexy and she oozes sexuality in this film as Malkina. Some people may disagree because she's not in her 20s anymore, but I think that was supposed to be the point here.\n\nPitt does a good job as Westray. He is more of a secondary character, but like Bardem, he is able to carry the dialogue heavy scenes well.\n\nSomething was definitely wrong with this movie. Maybe it was bad editing, or bad writing in some parts, but the overall story was very interesting and most of the acting was able to hold it together. If you go in with this in mind, you should enjoy the movie and the story it tells."

This time however, Mr McCarthy (80) was the screenwriter, not the writer of a novel on which the movie was based, and oh, what a difference it made. Perhaps the choice of Ridley Scott (76) as director was not the best either - with this movie he emphatically continues the decline that started with 2010's \"Robin Hood.\" I soon found myself gazing around the cinema during some of the lengthy, shallow dialogue, pondering the existential question: \"Why are we all enduring this?\" As the movie progressed I began to eagerly await the action sequences, hoping to extract some welcome relief and illumination, only to find that they had been already signposted in garish verbal detail about 45 minutes before: \"Oh Westray (Brad Pitt) is being garrotted by a mechanical device in the middle of the street... exactly the way Reiner (Javier Barem) described it in such explicit detail earlier... riiight.\"\n\nBrad Pitt, by the way, is basically an older version of the character he played in \"Thelma and Louise,\" complete with white cowboy hat, and Cameron Diaz is the requisite cheetah, quite literally, with all the physical markings and the one-dimensional personality to match. By the time the credits were rolling, I was really wishing I could take Reiner's advice to the Counselor (Michael Fassbender) and \"forget the whole story,\" but unfortunately I can't, so here I am, trying to purge it all with this pitiful review. And so I find that just like the Counselor himself, I have to live with a horrendous mistake. It seems that when it comes to film-making, particularly in the case of Messrs. McCarthy and Scott, Hollywood should really be no country for old men."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is not recommended.\n\nEven with its line-up of big name stars, a distinguished director at the helm, and a first-time screenplay by renown novelist, Cormac McCarthy, the majority of critics have universally panned The Counselor unmercifully. But was all the negativity justified?\n\nYes, and then some.\n\nThe Counselor is a mess. With its over-convoluted plotting, repellent characters, and graphic violence, the film never makes much sense. The story is baffling and pretentious as various acts are set in motion in a multitude of places: In Mexico, a shipment of cocaine is on route to the United States. In Amsterdam, a man (Michael Fassbender), only known as \"the Counselor\", is buying an engagement ring for his sweet and loving girlfriend (Penelope Cruz). In Texas, a party is hosted by a rich drug dealer named Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his kinky, slinky gal named Malkina (Cameron Diaz). Later, the Counselor meets a business associate named Westray (Brad Pitt) and wants in on the drug deal. Of course, we know that something must go wrong to up the ante and it does. Of course, we also know when there's talk about snuff films, be-headings, and garrote devices, there's a strong chance that those things will somehow be a part of the story, and it does. (Let's face it, those subjects rarely come up in one's average conversation, at least, with my social crowd.)\n\nSo many characters are introduced, centrally used in one or a few scenes and never seen again. By the film's end, none of the character's motives or criminal activity is ever really explained to one's satisfaction. They all speak in banal platitudes and purple prose, spouting philosophic ramblings that one would never hear in any real life situation. Some examples of ripe dialog: \"The truth has no temperature.\" / \"\"You cannot buy anything with grief because grief is worthless\" / and my particular favorite, \"I liked to forget Malinka f**king my car\". (Yes, this does actually happen in an unintentional laughable scene with Ms. Diaz spreadeagled on the hood of a Ferrari and gyrating into orgasmic ecstasy with a shocked Bardem gaping at her positions, looking ultra bug-eyed and perplexed. (Almost, and I said almost, worth the price of admission.)\n\nThe actors involved throw themselves into their roles, especially Ms. Diaz, all bedecked in leopard tattoos, gaudy jewelry, and the tightest of form-fitting outfits. Truth be told, it is a fierce and bold performance by the actress. Fassbender is also good in the title role. Just as his character remains nameless, this fine actor is blameless for his participation in this misfire. Pitt plays his supporting role with some flair, but Ms. Cruz is used as mere window dressing. Also wasted in their non-existent roles are such talented actors as Ruben Blades, Natalie Dormer, Dean Norris, Rosie Perez, and John Leguizamo.\n\nRidley Scott livens up this crime drama with some solid direction and production values are strong. The director delivers a well-crafted film, but why this film was ever made remains a mystery. The fault must go entirely to McCarthy's incredulous script, a screenplay lacking in any character or story development. Perhaps, on the written page, the whole enterprise seemed like a good idea. But on the big screen, the film is just an incoherent and joyless exercise in style. The Counselor simply needs a lot more guidance.

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me make clear right away that Ridley Scott's latest venture is not entirely awful as reviews seem to suggest, but I cannot but feel disappointed as The Counselor comes up limping. This film boasts a high-profile cast and a renowned screenwriter in Cormac McCarthy. My opinion is that McCarthy and Scott do not match. The main problem here is the story. It's dull, boring, and ultimately quite confusing. However, there are some very memorable scenes including one involving Brad Pitt's neck and a refreshingly disturbing sex scene involving a car. The cinematography, while bleak, effectively sets the tone for the film.\n\nRidley Scott's film is about a dude referred to as the Counselor. The Counselor recently got engaged to his beautiful, traditional girlfriend. However, he feels that is not enough. He meets a drug kingpin named Reiner who puts him in the drug business. But of course things go very wrong and now The Counselor must fear for his and his loved one's lives.\n\nOne of the strong points of the film is the acting, as they try to elevate the story. Michael Fassbender was decent as the Counselor, although his motives are left unexplained. Brad Pitt was excellent as the middle man and he has some of the best lines of the film. Javier Bardem and his crazy hair also was great. Penelope Cruz was decent as Laura, The Counselor's fianc\u00e9e. Finally, Cameron Diaz was actually quite good and intimidating as Malkina, the girlfriend of Reiner.\n\nOverall, The Counselor could have been so much better. It has a great premise and cast plus a prestigious director. The one thing that held the movie down into mediocrity is the story that truly has no spark to it. It's a confusing mess, and that is being kind. McCarthy is an excellent writer, but not a great screenwriter. Although I did like some of the dialogue, which happens to be quite literary. Ridley Scott has done better films, but this isn't a total failure at least. The acting and the technical side to the film are worth noting. Plus don't forget about those cheetahs. I rate this film 5.5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counselor, like previous McCarthy adaptations, is gorgeous to behold, but unlike No Country and the others, this one is unnervingly bright, lensed in iridescent yellows and grungy grim tones. It lacks the scope of a Gladiator or a Kingdom of Heaven, instead acting as a somehow intimate, character-driven (or perhaps \"dialogue-driven\" is better) tale. It is, one could say, Ridley Scott's first fable (yes, Legend notwithstanding).\n\nAllow me to explain. The story, like most McCarthy tales, is simple: a nameless lawyer (Fassbender), madly in love with his fianc\u00e9e Laura (Cruz) and seeking to provide for her and give her the life she deserves, decides to get in a once-and-I'm-out deal: namely, to get involved in a venture dealing with twenty million dollars worth of drugs being ferried to the States from Mexico. The counselor's associates in this job are the flamboyant Reiner (Javier Bardem, returning to McCarthy's bleak world yet again, though this time sporting a Brian Grazer-esque hairdo instead of Chigurh's pageboy) and middleman Westray (Brad Pitt, sporting a Tom Petty style), both of whom warn the counselor that this deal will change his life in ways he cannot fathom. The film also focuses on Reiner's Argentinean squeeze Malkina, played by Cameron Diaz. Malkina is a glammed-up diva in the Donatella Versace vein (comparable to Kristin Scott Thomas's equally diva-like turn in Only God Forgives; they could be sisters), sporting a cheetah-spot design tattooed to her throat and a felicitous feline sneer everywhere she turns (she even owns a pair of cheetahs that she sics on desert jackrabbits for her and Reiner's amusement).\n\nOf course, as is wont to happen in McCarthy's world, something goes wrong, sh_t hits the fan, and the lives of every character hangs in the balance. Characters are sliced, diced, shot and (in one gruesome instance) subject to a weapon of grim ingenuity that involves a motor, a loop of unbreakable wire, and a jetting gout of blood. Yet the film also brings levity to it in spades, to the point that The Counselor could almost be considered a black comedy. Much of the film's action is \"interaction,\" as the counselor deals with the other characters that warn, judge, and even blame him for the capricious trick of fate that has sealed their own. McCarthy's penchant for cipher-like monologues is in full play here, and it can bog down an unwary traveler. That said, for all of its deep soliloquies and terse warnings, the film is not indecipherable, and at times McCarthy's caustic wit comes across brilliantly.\n\nScott and McCarthy manage to coax some pretty impressive work from their cadre. Michael Fassbender, whose character is himself little more than an archetype (the \"good man who f_cks up once and pays for it dearly\"), is actually quite good here, and I'm probably in the minority when I say that I prefer his turn here over his acclaimed performance in Shame (a film I respect but have little affection for). Cruz makes the most of a rather lightweight part, and even though her character exists as little more than an ideal, it still works. Bardem is, for once, the comic relief, playing an entrancingly funny motormouth who is the polar opposite of his last McCarthy character. He is the one who has the most fun with the dialogue and despite English being his second language, he nails Cormac's every nuance. Pitt's Westray is laid-back yet high-strung, and seems an easy fit for the actor, giving every line a wry twist. But the true revelation is Diaz's against-type turn. She is the character audiences will remember most of all, and not just because of her fornication with a Bentley (it makes sense in context . . . I think). There is a hard, wicked steel in her performance, almost predatory. There are other memorable turns, like Ruben Blades's one-scene wonder and even Dean Norris of Breaking Bad fame, that make this a truly sumptuous ensemble.\n\nThe Counselor is not an easy watch, both because of its violence and because Scott and McCarthy (I have to credit both men; it feels like such a collaborative creative effort) don't dumb it down. It's a simple story, but it's also one that feels like Scott's most mature work. It isn't without its flaws (certain scenes run on a bit long, while others feel a bit short-changed), but The Counselor results in a perverse viewing that is, in a word, unforgettable."

I watched it till the end and I was thinking \"really, that's it?\" The only amazement I had was how talented the actors are to remember such long and complicated lines and the acting was excellent but that was it. If this was his attempt to be like pulp fiction then he failed miserably. Aliens had short dialog and yet it was one of the most unforgettable films ever, but this is just boring and will be forgotten very soon. Id go back to what you do best Ridley.

        "review_detailed_main": "Remember the 90's? That was a fantastic decade for neo noir thrillers such as the usual suspects and seven. It saddens me now that the label of thriller is usually given to films such as Taken which involve high speed chases, gunfights, fist fights and explosions. This film reminds me of those brilliant 90's thrillers with its slow burning character focus and I am happy to see Hollywood take risks and deviate from their tried and tested formula. On that basis I certainly recommend picking up this film.\n\nThe story is simple, involving a lawyer becoming involved in a drug smuggling operation when things go wrong and he finds himself in way over his head. We've seen it before. But this film distinguishes itself by focusing on the characters rather than the story. Fassbender plays the role perfectly as the arrogant lawyer who gradually finds his spirits crushed and his perfect life crumbling around him. Along the way he meets some very interesting characters and I have to tip my hat to Brad Pitt who plays the pragmatic middleman in the drugs business. He is cool and intelligent and it comes off with such charm. However the main theme of the film is choice and consequence. We've all been there, made a seemingly harmless choice for selfish reasons which backfires in a way we could not anticipate, leading to consequences far beyond our control. This theme is played out in a mature and very tense way. There is very little action so don't see it looking for shooting and high speed chases, there are so many films I could recommend for that. But this is pretty unique by today's standards.\n\nThe film isn't without its flaws which seem to mainly come from the writing. McCarthy wrote the film as if it were straight from one of his novels with philosophical dialogues which speak to the audience and heavy symbolism. In a book, this writing would have made this an instant classic but unfortunately it comes off as rather pretentious, lacking in subtlety. Due to its rather unnatural flow, it becomes clear at times that the actors are struggling with it at times.\n\nOverall, this film is good. It is a dark and somewhat powerful look into the theme of choice and consequence, grief, death and hopelessness. There are many people on this site who really hate the film and I understand that given the writing. But I urge you to watch it and judge for yourself as it is a thought provoking and solid film that certainly deserves the label of thriller."

I so wanted some redeeming plot twist to occur, but it just fell deeper into a black hole of despair.\n\nThere was no-one, nothing to cling to in an effort to pull you out of the quicksand of nothingness. Just nothing.\n\nAnd if you read all of this, then you might just find meaning in the diatribe spouted by the meanest muvverfukker on the phone to Fassbender as he puts the last nail in the coffin of hope.\n\nNot recommended whatever mood you're in."

On the outside it looks like a thriller, and it does have the set up of a good thriller, but its more just a dark brooding and sometimes darkly humorous drama that has thriller like moments. I'm fairly certain if you liked No Country for Old Men the style won't be all that different to you, since it is written by Cormac McCarthy like the source material for that one was, except The Counselor was personally written by his hand alone. I've read reviews complaining its too predictable but I feel like that's the point, as it involves a relatively \"good man\" getting in bed with a drug cartel and everyone kind of tells him to be sure that he understands, that bad things could/will happen. I don't see this as a complaint, since A.) real people get involved in this stuff knowing bad things can happen despite all the warnings heard ahead of time and B.) some of the obvious foreshadows have great pay offs, and C.) knowing what's to come and watching anyways has a sort of knowing dread about it. Anyways, I've read a couple reviews offering it high praise and a lot of them completely bashing it, I'm somewhere in the middle but leaning more toward the former positive critique. It is a slow moving film, with lots of dialogue, and every character seems to get a lengthy monologue."

You need to watch this movie with undivided attention and an open mind. Sure the story has holes and leaves things unspoken, but I think that is fully on purpose. It emphasizes the s***-storm that \"The Counselor\" finds himself in in my opinion, but I leave the rest of the interpretation up to you.\n\nThere's not much to say about the acting and the cast. I mean, names like Fassbender, Cruz, Diaz, Pit, they all speak for themselves. They probably haven't been challenged on set a lot. The characters they play...let's say you have seen them before and everyone of these actors can play them asleep. Which doesn't mean they are bad. I find them entertaining and that is what the movie does. It entertains you and makes you think. The writing is really good and again, it will make you think!

Was he that stupid to get involved with those guys with so much on the line? His character didn't seem well-developed. Also, I hate to say it, but casting Cameron Diaz as a sexy bitch was a bit much for her age. She really looked bad, and the scene where she was on the car was also gross. What was the point? Women don't do this. In short, it is to vivid and not believable. Such a digression from Mr. Scott's earlier films."

        "review_detailed_main": "***********THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE EXTENDED CUT*************\n\nMichael Fassbender plays The Counsellor, a wealthy lawyer who is due to marry his fianc\u00e9e Laura (Penelope Cruz). However, these plans go on the back burner when The Counsellor gets involved in a drug trafficking operation. A serious of events occur which puts him and everyone around him on the wrong side of The Cartel.\n\nEven though the idea behind this film isn't particularly new, I'm not the sort of person who will put the boot into a film just because it isn't original. However if it isn't original then the writers should try to help their audience forget this by at least telling their story in a way that is both entertaining and interesting - this fails on both counts.\n\nFor me, the story is far too talky and nonsensical. The first hour probably consisted of about 55 minutes of rambling and about 5 minutes of plot development (that's probably being generous as well). There were lots of scenes that were either drawn out or pointless (or both on some occasions) - the scene where The Counsellor buys a diamond ring, the scene with Diaz and Bardem and the Ferrari. You could also add the opening scene as being a long drawn out pointless scene, but I'm prepared to let that one slide because Penelope Cruz is hot. There was so much rambling and pointless dialogue with very little plot development that it pretty much gets to the point where you're past caring what's happening.\n\nBrad Pitt is supposed to be an integral part of the operation, but he's probably only on screen for about a fifth of the running time (and most of that time is towards the end of the film).\n\nThe film's very basic strengths are in that it is ultra cool and slick. The cast are all cool and the film is also quite well-made and also contains some rather nice cinematography.\n\nSadly though, a handsome cast and some pretty visuals & sets aren't going to be enough for most viewers and unfortunately without these things you're left with a rather incoherent rambling mess of a film that takes so long to go anywhere that you'll find yourself past caring long before the film ends. It's a bit like looking at a really beautiful painting - you'll start off looking at it, enjoy looking at it for a short while, but eventually you'll get fed up and walk away. Those were pretty much my exact feelings when the film ended. A bit of a waste really."

        "review_detailed_main": "The critical reception for THE COUNSELOR - in Britain at least - has been generally negative, with objections raised in particular to the film's awkward combination of static dialog and apparently excessive violence. This view seems particularly unfair, as Scott and writer Cormac McCarthy conduct a searching examination into the nature of sexuality. The action centers around a power struggle between different protagonists: two \"movers and shakers\" (Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt), one powerful female (Cameron Diaz) and the eponymous counselor caught in between them (Michael Fassbender), who tries his best to appease all of them while making a living for himself. As the action unfolds, each one of these main characters is disposed of, leaving only two at the end. By then we are left in no doubt as to who the strongest character actually is. Many of the film's set pieces - notably a scene where Diaz's character is shown making love to an automobile - are inspired by this desire for sexual and social mastery. With its Texan/ Mexican settings, THE COUNSELOR is very much reminiscent of other McCarthy films, notably NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. However director Scott's visual style is very different to that of the Coen Brothers, with the emphasis placed on visual panoramas intercut with significant close-ups. There are certain places where the action slows to a halt, as the character engage in long passages of dialog, but once again these sequences can be seen as part of the characters' struggle for power. All in all an entertaining film - not perhaps one of Scott's greatest efforts, but worth a look at nonetheless."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counselor seemed like it was going to be one of this year's best movies. It had everything: a good director, a writer famous for writing the novel No Country for Old Men, and a cast of talented actors including Micheal Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Brad Pitt and\u0085 uhmh\u0085 Cameron Diaz. Unfortunately, after watching the move I must say The Counselor wasn't as great as I expected it to be. Also, labeling The Counselor as 'not-really-that-great' could be somewhat of an understatement; it would be more precise to say that The Counselor is, to some extent, a bad movie.\n\nThe movie mainly follows Michael Fassbender's character \u2013 who is never addressed by his name, only by his profession (he is, surprisingly, a counselor) \u2013 who proposes to his beautiful girlfriend Laura (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz). However, he is short of money, so he goes into an illegal drug job with his acquaintance Reiner (Javier Bardem). Reiner screws a woman named Malkina (Cameron Diaz) \u2013 not that it matters very much in this content, but she is one of the key characters in the movie. Also, Brad Pitt is somewhere in the movie, playing a character named Westray.\n\nYou might notice in my summary that I was very vague in describing the movie's plot, because that is precisely the movie's main problem \u2013 it is rather vague. It is never established, during the whole movie, the connections the characters have with the actual plot, or even the connections among the characters. The audience is never involved in the characters, or the illegal drug job that inevitably goes bad, and therefore can't have an emotional reaction when things go wrong. In that aspect the movie is vague, underwhelming and even tedious sometimes. And while the overall bleakness of the movie might have some (in lack of a better word) stylistic charm, this vague nature of The Counselor is often unnaturally abrupted by some rather specific scenes that lead absolutely nowhere. So, if you hate conventional narrative devices and just want to watch a movie that has completely pointless scenes, like the one in which Dean Norris and John Leguizamo talk about a dead body in a barrel, I've got good news for you.\n\nSpeaking of vague writing, I had some problems with the movie's dialogue, which was occasionally clingy \u2013 mostly the lines spoken by Cameron Diaz. I'm not a big Diaz fan overall, and she even did quite a nice job in The Counselor, but the way she sometimes delivered the lines made me giggle. The rest of the cast was good likewise, which isn't a surprise since they are all experienced actors, and I won't spend much time talking about them. As for Ridley Scott, I'd suggest he retires and stops making movies which are not bad, but are ultimately utterly disappointing. And that's what The Counselor is \u2013 utterly disappointing.\n\nRating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/"

As the deal goes bad, the nameless attorney has to pick up the pieces and try to either put his life back in place or flee the vanity that he has slowly become accustomed to.\n\nThe second the screen went black, I knew I hadn't seen a great film. But I also knew I hadn't seen a bad film. The Counselor has brief moments of genius that flash as bright as any classic, but also shares pedantic, drawn-out scenes that seem like filler. It boasts an A-list cast turning in terrific performances, but none seem to know exactly what they are doing, or what their purpose is to the story. There is no doubt that The Counselor has a profound message, but the message gets bogged down in the confusion of important questions the script has no answers to.\n\nWritten by the incredible author Cormac McCarthy, who wrote a similarly simple and violent book-turned movie called No Country For Old Men, the script follows five characters; the aforementioned, Reiner's oversexed girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz), and the mysterious cowboy middleman Westray (Brad Pitt). Reiner and Malkina's flamboyant and malicious relationship is a perfect counter to the comfortable, unexciting romance between the title character and his fianc\u00e9. The Counselor and Laura's unexceptional wardrobe is no comparison to Reiner's expensive suits and cropped-up hair, or Malkina's leave-nothing-to-the-imagination dresses.\n\nMichael Fassbender is on a career roll, almost guaranteed an Oscar for Twelve Years A Slave, later this year. Yet his performance is surprisingly bland, more a reactionary character than one deciding his own fate. Brad Pitt does particularly fine work here as Westray. Clad in garb (cowboy hat, boots, cream or watermelon-colored jacket) you would see in every El Paso street corner, Westray is an unassuming and cautionary man who, in the film's first half anyway, seems to be guiding the story more than being part of it. Westray's fate at the end is certainly surprising to any viewer thinking Pitt was cast as simply another name to round out the cast. Pitt is likely the best performance in the film.\n\nThe problems with the film do not lie in performances or direction. The photography is stunning, with beautifully shot locations in El Paso and Mexico. Reiner's glamorous home is taken right out of GQ Magazine, with its lavish pools and party atmosphere. The scenes in Mexico show a gritty, violent place where money rules, but so it also does across the border. What McCarthy is trying to convey from his work is present in the film, but a few lines on certain aspects of the plot would be helpful. For instance, how exactly was Fassbender involved? How was Reiner? The Wire Man was an imposing and violent force, but who was he? Who did he work for? And who was Malkina, really? As you watch the film, you will see such unanswered questions.\n\nIf you are a fan of Cormac McCarthy, as I am, you will probably leave the theater with the same emotion I did; one of confusion. The Counselor is not a bad film, but it is far from great. At the same token, the finished product could be great to another viewer, and I would understand why. It may require a second viewing and a more in-depth analysis of the complexity of the film to understand exactly what was going on. A rating of \"five\" is the best rating I can give. It seems as if half of the The Counselor was there, and half of him was not."

Been waiting for this kinda film for years.\n\nFrom the beginning, i got intrigued by the opening rather long scene which is not usually elaborated on in Hollywood Films. I was anticipating action and more violence however started to feel the scenes were slowing the film down.\n\nThe scenes of philosophical dialogue were difficult to comprehend if you weren't listening carefully to the audio. The dialogues were too intense to immediately comprehend due to various interpretations of history and hearsay. This is not the kinda film for those whom haven't lived the high life or been on the edge. I felt the film lacked mega action however seemed to concentrate on an onslaught of philosophical dialogue between the Counselor himself and his fellow protagonists in the film. I didn't realise this was going to be the case prior to watching the film.\n\nI feel it would be better to watch the film on your own in a dark room away from everyone. Its that kinda film. You may not understand it straight away. I wish the dialogue was not quoted so fast and for so long but i think this is Ridley Scotts characteristic of the film. In light of his brother Tony Scotts suicide-perhaps this film was an emotional consequence and relevance of what the last days of ones life can come to when you have it ALL. I think the message of this film is a portrayal and reality check from knowing the fact that from when 'Your Time is Up' and no matter what you do.. Your definitely Marked for Death and there is nothing in the world you can do about it. The film must be credited for its on set locations, real life portrayals of bandits, deception, double crossing and criminal code. The film is not too far fetched from reality in my opinion however i was quite impressed with Cameron Diaz's character portrayal.\n\nIn a nutshell-quite a cast, quite a comedown if you expect fast paced thriller but watching it again makes you realize its quite a skill to make an abnormal movie to what it first appears like."

Aren't there enough other dump blonds out in the world who are trying to become an actress in Hollywood? Also all the other actors have been doing way better jobs before. I guess they thought they could rely on each other. So they only gave 50% of there energy. I had to give only one point. Just to lower the average points because there are actually people who think this movie deserves eight points. They are probably blind or saw a different movie. Well I should stop calling it a movie. Pointless mix of boring film scenes would be a better description of what I just saw. It's to sad nobody will ever read this.

Great cameo from Brad Pitt and Natalie Dormer but the real star of this was Cameron Diaz and her cheetahs. Ice cold minx. Money obsessed and she was the one who came out best.

The only purpose of the film I could come up with was a medium for Cameron Diaz to once again prove she is the sluttiest woman in Hollywood. Job well done.\n\nThis film starts out contorted and totally disjointed. It makes no sense in the beginning, the middle or the end. The opening scene is totally ridiculous and only explained by Michael Fassbender paying off writer Cormac McCarthy big time. I guess it just foreshadowed we were all going to be going down big time before the movie was over.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott obviously forgot to lay off the cocaine while directing. I cannot even imagine what the plot or storyline was supposed to be. There is no likable character. There are no laughs. There is no suspense. You just get plenty of sweaty Mexicans and gore. The message? Lay off drugs whether practicing law or directing a film.\n\nWhat is really weird is this film was billed as a \"thriller.\" The only \"thrills\" were the action between Penelope Cruz' legs and Cameron Diaz and the windshield of a sports car. But frankly, the way Diaz pulled it off and the way Bardem later described the encounter might make any straight guy consider going gay.\n\nEveryone in my theater got up and shook their head or wanted their money back. I have had a better time draining my dogs anal glands or playing around on the Obama Care website\u2014all three of these experiences will leave you feeling pretty disgusted."

I loved Heli, and I loved the Counsellor, this is why.\n\nI went to the cinema to see \"The Counselor\" expecting to watch a crime movie almost as entertaining as the old school Scorcece. It ended up being a fantastic and sublime meditation about the process of dehumanization that drug trafficking detonates (I'm using the word 'sublime' here in its Kantian definition: Any phenomena that surpasses our imagination and make us watch in anguish or awe). Fantastic dialogs, which although unlikely because we will never find lawyers and killers as poetic as the ones depicted on this movie (Cormac McCarthy, after all, is a great writer) summarize and propose precise reflections on how little we really understand about the violence and brutality of drug trafficking. It's not cryptic dialogs as some suggest, you just have to pay close attention to the details.\n\nAdding that the violence displayed in the film is unbelievably cruel considering that this is a AAA movie ( big budget, great director, big-name casting, famous writer, etc), this become the most pleasant surprise I've watched this year. And the most politically incorrect: You never submit a AAA's audience to this kind of dialog and cruelty, yet Scott risk it, with great results.\n\nI do not recommend it as a film that intents to be realistic. Scott never wanted to do that. The intention of this film is to be a poetic articulation of the distance between humanity and inhumanity and the process that transforms one into the other.\n\n10/10 The movie of the year for me.\n\nI don't care the critics are destroying it. This is one of those moves that will make me seem like a hipster (Maybe I am one): People are simply not getting it."

For his capability this movie was a below par, that's what everyone meant. As for the theme of the story, it was a phenomenal, but the screenplay is what failed very badly. To me, some of the scenes in the movie were impressive, enough to stick around the end. As has been a gangster related subject, Midas touch lacks and surprises how a great director make it slip away.\n\nHandling a tough situation, following the instinct and the facing outcome of the final result is what the movie to say in a one liner. Obviously, roles were perfectly distributed to the respective cast by the filmmakers and they had given their best as well. So no blame game for the movie's fall in that matter. In my perception it was the dull moments in the movie that acquire more than the best parts. When it was overhauled to build the story and develop characters, never showed signs of recovery.\n\nAs I am a movie maniac, after seeing a movie, I always think of a sequel to follow only if it was a good one, or I pray for no sequel if it was terrible. I thought the same about this movie as well, after seeing the way it ended. I am now curious what if a sequel makes the way and impacts better than this. Because in the history, so many sequels had excelled than the previous movies. Whatever, I respect this film, not because of the director or actors, but like everyone says it should have been little better in a few areas, that's all. A movie fanatic sees the effort and appreciate it even it was not that good, but a critic sees only flaws and criticise as usual.\n\n6/10"

Or the lack thereof. The Counselor is written by Cormac McCarthy, a novelist who specializes in leaden stories highlighting the corruption of humans, and who rose to fame as the author of No Country for Old Men. Although untested as a screenwriter, McCarthy as a screenwriter just seemed to gel as an idea. Herein lies the problem; McCarthy does not alter his method of writing and The Counselor's screenplay is delivered akin to a novel. The result is a film completely devoid of a narrative, meaning the story an background of the characters is non-existent.\n\nThe result is a collection of scenes happening in some sort of ham- fisted, incoherent jumble, and the characters in the movie just react to their surroundings. There is both a lack of description in the attempted story and a disquieting air of self-satisfaction that permeates throughout the film. Ridley Scott's effort to woo you with pseudo- prophetic dialogue and kitsch is downright insulting, and completely unbecoming of the director of Blade Runner and Alien. (Two of the greatest films of all time.) In other words, Counselor neither as incisive nor as blunt as it could have been.\n\nOn the flip side, I can't think of a better vehicle to prove that film is an art. On paper, The Counselor has everything going for it; the cast, the director, screenwriter. And yet, the result is a failure\u0085 Film, like anything that can be considered art, is the collaborative effort of a collective idea. The Counselor is a jumbled mess that tries to be everything, and ends up being nothing. What a waste of talent."

All this has worked well for Coen brothers and Steven Soderbergh, for example, but as for the movie in question, the outcome is too complex, lengthy, and with odd approaches, and - with the exception of Reiner perhaps - the characters lack wittiness and peculiarity the ones introduced by the Coens or Quentin Tarantino do always have. For example, it is difficult to believe that universal human relation issues are touched in a long phone conversation between a dishonest lawyer and drug lord... And there are twists in the plot the reason and nature of which was never explained.\n\nThus, all this is probably the \"fault\" of the screenwriter, but somehow many good and famous actors expressed their desire to participate in this mediocre creation. But at least they played the movie better, and Reiner's part performed by Javier Bardem, and Malkina performed by Cameron Diaz are really different from their \"normal\" roles. Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Brad Pitt were good as well, although not so distinct. Some other good actors were somehow used in small roles only.\n\nAll in all, The Counselor is an okay movie for the admirers of the said director and actors, but do not expect light and catchy entertainment, but a pseudo-erotic story where pondering on and over dominate clearly over thrilling moments."

In this film it was obvious that they thought \"ok lets take some star names, a well known director and screenwriter, Bardem always does the trick with \"crazy\" characters, add a lot of (unecessary) violence, two beautiful women and some \"intellectual\" quotes and we have a movie that will attract both a sophisticated audience and those who love violence.\n\nWell it doesn't work like that.

The irony was that he was inadvertently \"betrayed\" by an act of kindness/compassion. This could have been a classical masterpiece, on the level of ancient Greek or Shakespearean tragedies, but degenerated into an overwrought, perverted vehicle of cheap gore and sex. Frankly, I find the morality hard to swallow, being preached by some drug-trafficking mafia don. Instead of a cautionary tale of tragedy and irony, what hits you between the eyes is the utter ruthlessness, cruelty, and evil of the criminal world.\n\nThe writer's lofty aspirations backfired, in my opinion. The moral tale was laid down, it seems to me, by a number of questionable characters, a diamond expert, a middle-man of sorts (a \"respectable\" man of legitimate standing but with connections to the criminal world), and the crime lord (an evil person who wants to teach me \"every action has consequences\" and \"mistakes cannot be undone\"?) To hear high-sounding \"sermon\" coming out of the mouths of sleazy characters is just ludicrous.\n\nHearing a description of the brutality and sex is already quite enough, to add those extra scenes of indirectly explicit sex and explicit gore is certainly overkill, to the point of revolting.\n\nWhat a waste!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Cormac McCarthy's first original screenplay directed by Ridley Scott.\" Legends colliding. Hopes were unashamedly high, and that doesn't even account for its star-studded cast with Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. In the early months of 2013, Oscar predictions for Best Picture were not without The Counsellor, some even for the win. No Country For Old Men is both an instant classic and still in recent memory, yet McCarthy didn't win a trophy for that and Scott still hasn't won Best Director, despite one of his films winning Best Picture. I was guilty of having it as my most anticipated of the year at one point. But then people saw it, and all was lost. Not only was it disliked, but hated, called the worst of the year. Could it really be that bad? The trailers came in and I started to believe it. The acting looked laughable, the production inconsistent and the story uninspired. I lost interest.\n\nI ended up going anyway due to my 2013 obligation but with extremely low expectations. Fortunately, the first thing that struck me is that it was absolutely dripping with atmosphere. Ridley Scott's last film Prometheus suffered severely from its script, but I forget how impressive it was at least visually. The Counsellor too has great suspenseful cinematography. However, as my fears suggested, it isn't consistent. There are some dialogue-driven scenes where it felt amateur in the way it was shot and edited. Perhaps they were the victim of not enough time on the day of the shoot but that's no excuse. It results in a film that feels rough, loose and raw, which benefits its themes, but it does feel a little unprofessional. At least the good scenes lift the whole film up. It is a clich\u00e9d premise in many ways but it approaches the story in a very different way. This is McCarthy's comfort zone, and his comfort zone subverts all expectation.\n\nHowever, its main flaw is the eponymous counsellor. The one mystery the film does not solve is what he had to do with the central crime and that's a big mistake. His characterisation is paper thin until the last third where we see glimpses of how far he'll go to survive, which is just a few lies. Fassbender really struggles and too often feels out of tune with the rest of the film, taking me out of the moment. It could have worked as if he was like an idyllic child in a man's body but that should have been established more. Otherwise I was pleasantly surprised to find myself intrigued with the other characters, particularly Javier Bardem, of whom feels like a caricature at first and is suddenly humanised in the most hilariously bizarre way from the infamous Diaz car sex scene, of whom was close to delivering the performance that was hyped for us earlier this year if not for her voice which still sounds like she's 20. Takes a lot away from the character.\n\nWhat really makes The Counsellor is its profound existential ideas on death. There's a great phonecall scene from a one off character who talks about the last few days before death and its inevitability. What can someone do in that situation? Perhaps Fassbender's mistimed tears are accurate. While many people may die in the film, in memorable gruellingly sinister scenes at that which are a break from the dialogue-driven ones, it only takes one seemingly insignificant death for the others to spiral out of control. A lot to chew on. The Counsellor is an unusual, flawed yet endearing film that feels like it's living in its own little world. It's a disappointment from earlier expectation but a pleasant surprise from that vicious initial reaction due to its shining strengths. All I have to say is, if you truly know McCarthy you should see that ending coming.\n\n7/10"

The version we saw on cable was just about incomprehensible. There's a septic-tank pumper truck full of barrels of coke (I think) headed from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to Chicago; hit squads dressed as cops and creepy assassins ply their trade; the truck gets hijacked, then hijacked back, and somehow the nebbishy title character is on the hook to the CJ cartel for the whole twenty mil.\n\nThe mechanics of constructing a coherent narrative seem to be of little interest to McCarthy. Unfortunately what does seem to be of interest are the long, tedious monologues on the meaninglessness of life (and related themes) that he assigns, seemingly at random, to the less-purposeful characters played by the big-name cast members, who do little to advance the plot but get most of the screen time. Of these, Cameron Diaz, as the polymorphous bitch goddess with the brace of cheetahs and the caked-up eye makeup, is by far the most annoying. Ridley Scott does a fine job with the brief action sequences, for what that's worth. Great cast (have Bruno Ganz and Rosie Perez ever been in a movie together?), great cinematography; I found out about a great poem by Machado (\"Caminante, son tus huellas el camino...\") that's quoted, untranslated of course, in one of the narcos' long, pointless monologues, so I can't say the experience was a total loss"

I love it and I hate it at the same time.\n\nThere are two very distinct sides of this movie. One is the film as a story and the other the film as art. By art I mean meaning behind the story. Most movies these days are all story, with little art behind that story. Think of the big blockbusters or even the big Oscar movies like Argo. There is only the plot, behind it there is either nothing or very little. The Counselor is the exact reverse. The story is there, but it's so thin that at times it almost feels like it's missing all together. At the same time, this movie perhaps more than any other this year makes you think. It is a philosophical piece, with weighty dialogue and big questions. I always enjoy a movie that makes you think, especially because there're so rare. But that is not enough for a movie to stand on its own. There has to be a compelling story. There has to be something to keep the viewer involved in the film, and in this regard The Counselor somewhat fails. The plot is slow moving, it doesn't keep focus and it is generally confusing and convoluted.\n\nThe cast does an admirable job with the material they are given, but in general I don't think they were given enough license for us to truly understand their characters (except Diaz's Malkina). For example, the audience is supposed to believe that Fassbender's The Counselor and Cruz's Laura are madly in love with each other, but it would appear from their scenes together in the film that their relationship is purely sexual and there are really no hints of a deeper relationship. But as I said the cast does a good job for what they are given. Except for Cameron Diaz. Her character is the most realized in the film, but Diaz looks like she's just reading her lines from cue cards off screen, with little intensity or passion that a part like this requires.\n\nOther things to be said for the film include it's amazing cinematography as well as it's fantastic score by Daniel Pemberton. I will also give props to the legendary Cormac McCarthy for the many lyrical monologues sprinkled throughout the film that really do stir the soul when listened to. But perhaps his prose would have been better served in novel form rather than as a screenplay."

Ostensibly a sexy, gritty crime thriller, but in fact a frustratingly oblique drama about greed, sex and power, The Counselor sees Fassbender's out-of-his-depth lawyer chased by a ruthless Mexican drug cartel after a deal goes sour. A few rare memorable sequences - Diaz \"appreciating\" a luxury car, a deserted-road shootout - can be found, and Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is superb, yet it's impossible to really enjoy, or engage, thanks to the smothering pretentiousness of Cormac McCarthy's first original screenplay. The story aims for an unrelentingly grimy realism \u00e0 la No Country For Old Men (adapted from McCarthy's novel), however comes off as forced, silly and entirely false. The first rate cast are fine, with Pitt's enigmatic middle-man and Diaz's sultry schemer standing above the rest, but the extended supporting cast - Edgar Ramirez, Toby Kebbell, Bruno Ganz, et al - are completely wasted in glorified cameos.

        "review_detailed_main": "Cormac McCarthy's 'No Country for Old Men' may have made a gripping Coen brothers crime thriller, but his first produced screenplay after earning the love of Hollywood from subsequent adaptations like 'The Road' and 'All the Pretty Horses' proves that it is one thing to be a writer and quite another to be a screenwriter. Indeed, the characters in his self- penned 'The Counselor' not only talk a lot (and we might add, too much), they also do so with such pretentiousness that it's hard to imagine any of them actually inhabiting more than a McCarthy novel.\n\nThe titular character remains unnamed throughout the film, but Michael Fassbender plays him as a respectable American lawyer who is tempted by his financial circumstance to enter into some illegal business involving a Mexican cocaine cartel. The overwritten script brings in a whole lot of other characters with shady motivations \u2013 there's Javier Bardem's Reiner, a business partner of the counsellor who is instrumental in hooking him up with the wrong people; Reiner's girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) who turns out even more conniving and malevolent than Reiner himself; and last but not least, Westray (Brad Pitt), a shadowy figure whose involvement remains obtuse throughout the movie.\n\nMcCarthy's idea of building character relationships is to get them to engage in lengthy conversations and wax philosophically about his signature themes of greed, death, choices and consequences. The eloquence however rings phony and hollow, sounding exactly as if a writer typed them \u2013 though admittedly if listening to lines like \"truth has no temperature\" from Diaz when she is accused of being \"cold\" gets you tingling, then you will be in for a treat. Otherwise, the dialogue is affected as can be, not least because there are at least two lengthy expositions on morality, mortality, regret and even Heavenly redemption.\n\nIn the midst of all that capital W writing, the venerable Ridley Scott seems genuinely lost and befuddled. There is hardly any visual momentum to the scenes when all the characters are doing are primarily talking, and because the manner in which they talk makes it seem as if they could go on and on, the transitions in between scenes feel awkward and unwieldy. In between, Scott prettifies the images to show off his character's lavish lifestyles, which his 'Prometheus' cinematographer Dariusz Wolski ensures are a sight to behold. But when he does get a break from the prose, Scott indulges the borderland noir with casual violence, staging not one but two bloody beheadings that we warn you are pretty graphic.\n\nSpeaking of beheadings, you probably won't care much for one of them, but the other, set in a busy street in the heart of London, will probably take you by surprise \u2013 not just for how bloody it is, but also why that said actor would agree to such a sequence. But we suspect, most of the actors probably signed on because of the pedigree, and then realised how lacking in clarity and plausibility the script was. Still, they make the best of what they have, though in different ways. Fassbender tries hard to convince, but his earnest intentions are somewhat undermined by the sheer cartoonish nature of Bardem's over-the- top getup as well as Diaz's similarly overdone femme fatale.\n\nAnd so despite a script by a Pulitzer prize winner, a terrific ensemble cast and Ridley Scott at the helm, 'The Counselor' is a frustrating example of under fulfilled potential. One sort of guesses what McCarthy intended with this screenplay, but his own indulgence and lack of familiarity with the language of film just makes this a writer's exercise and nothing more. It isn't Scott nor the cast's fault that the movie unfolds with a distinct lack of drama, urgency or purpose. Like we said at the beginning, it's one thing to be a good writer and quite another to be a good screenwriter. McCarthy clearly isn't yet a jack of both trades."

On the other hand, if you are among the diminishing number of movie-goers who actually enjoys deeply portentous dialog (this is a GOOD thing), first-rate acting, and a story line leading to a denouement that that will leave you wanting to see this film again and again, then this is a film for you. It contains (but not by design) probably one of the most effective \"anti-drug\" messages since \"Traffic\"; but more interestingly, it is so well told that I sincerely hope you ignore reviewers here who don't agree with me that it is a Ridley Scott masterpiece. 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Unfortunately, \"The Counselor\" proves that you cannot out act a terrible script.\n\nSurprisingly, Cormac McCarthy, despite his previous great efforts, managed to write a horrendous script. The dialogue is appalling.\n\nThe characters frequently talk about sex, money, drugs and women, conversation which would generally entertain me in most other drug trafficking films, but nevertheless, McCarthy somehow succeeded on boring me on some of the most interesting topics of dialogue. I am not sure why the dialogue is so bad, maybe because it is so unrealistic and unnecessarily complex or maybe it is because it is some kind of modern Shakespearean riddle through every scene or maybe more likely it is because it is a combination of both.\n\nThe plot of the movie is alright, at best, but the lack of understanding by the viewer for the actions of each character, especially the Counselor, makes it very difficult for me to feel anything towards any of the characters.\n\nThe actors do their best to save this film, especially Javier Bardem, who is in an acting class of his own, but the dialogue was so bad that there was no resurrecting this mess. Even for Cameron Diaz, who I could not even differentiate if her acting in this movie was just as bad as the script or if the script in fact concealed her acting capability. Diaz's lines were by far the worst and I don't think any actress could have made it slide half decent. Every single scene Diaz was in I just wanted to look away.\n\nIf I want to go further, which I will, this is probably the biggest waste of Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt's acting talent. Both actors were given terrible roles and prevented from using even half their huge acting potential.\n\nI give the movie a 6/10 for some good, brutal killing scenes (thanks to Ridley Scott), a plot that had potential, but destroyed in the face of terrible dialogue and a list of fine actors doing their best, especially Javier Bardem who stepped out on a limb to save this mess."

It tries to a tell story with honesty. However, Cormac McCarthy's Screenplay is a mixed bag. The film appeals in parts, only. The characters do offer diversity, but their ambitions & intentions aren't the sort that would keep the viewer engrossed thoroughly. Ridley Scott is a master at his craft & he, to an extend, Directs 'The Counselor' with brilliance. Cinematography & Editing are passable.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Michael Fassbender delivers a believable performance in the central role. Javier Bardem is remarkable. The Oscar-Winning Actor owns the film & portrays his part to perfection. Penelope Cruz is adequate. Cameron Diaz is effective. Brad Pitt is functional. Rosie Perez is electrifying in a cameo.\n\nOn the whole, 'The Counselor' is so-so fare."

The film was so badly put together that constant hints about the future had to be given eg methods (of killing people) used by the drug gangs explained early on, only to reappear 40 minutes later....

Every weekend there's nothing but \"mindless entertainment\" playing at the theaters. People complain about this. They write reviews that go something like \"it was what I expected, mindless entertainment.\" Yet these movies make hundreds of millions of dollars so my only options are teen novels turned into movies, comic books turned into movies, 80's movies turned into crappier movies or high budget sci-fi movies that usually miss the mark.\n\nThis sub-culture(I refer to them as)of movies are my all time favorite and I get one every couple years now. The 90's movies were my favorite. Some of these would obviously include Pulp Fiction, Boondock Saints, Natural Born Killers, Thursday, Trainspotting, etc. Then I liked Requiem for a Dream, Departed, No Country for Old Men, Spun, Savages, Domino, etc. Drive has been my favorite one in a long time. There's a few I'm leaving out for sure.\n\nThe point I'm making is if you do not like these type of fantasy, sub- culture, everyone is bad, noir-ish, violent drug movies then stop watching them and writing bad reviews. And for those of us who do, we need to support them more because before long the few that do get made will turn to zero and we'll be left with shite at the theater...\n\nOh wait- we already are."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counsellor is more than simply a film about drugs and drug deals - it has characterization and design. The stories criss-cross and form a whole and it a fascinating watch with a superb cast. While Ridley Scott never manages the multiple story lines with complete mastery it is a deeply fascinating film about the nature of how corruption, greed and mega-wealth all warp these protagonists into a schizophrenic norm of unimaginable hedonism and a palpable paranoia where life as a moral imperative really holds no sway.\n\nThis is a film that has depth and meaning, though it does clearly lack clarity - and it is certainly one of the more interesting films about a multi-billion dollar industry that uses up humans at all stages without a thought. It does remain a very good watch. While it is clearly not the greatest crime movie ever made - it is a surprisingly thoughtful and original look at the top echelons of the drug world at work and play.\n\nThis is Ridley Scott's 32nd outing as a director - he has been directing films now since the 1960s and several: Thelma and Louise, Blade Runner, Gladiator are iconic. However, his crime movies: Black Rain (Yakuza 1980s), American Gangster (Harlem 70s) and now The Counsellor (Mexican Cartels) don't hit home in the same way. Let me straight out say, this is not, in any sense a bad movie but compare this to Scorsese's deep understanding of the criminal as an integral part of the American story and we sense that Scott enjoys telling stories but his focus is never as clear. The fault here maybe that Scott wants us to care all along about his characters in a way that Scorsese never does - and so loses the absolute impact that the inevitable implosion deserves.\n\nThis is a crime film worth your time: Fassbinder, Bardem, Cruz, Diaz, and Pitt are not acting light here - there is depth, some would argue too much and I get that, but this is a film that takes up deeper into the mindset of their world than most, and it is worth your time."

I guess they figure they can market anything as long as well known names are involved. I guess it has become very difficult to tell a compelling story.

The shrimp, the chicken, the peppers and the marinara sauce. It looked good, it smelled good, but you know when I went to taste it, for whatever reason it was 'blah'. Same goes with The Councilor. All those good ingredients are there. There is good acting all around (or almost all, sorry Diaz). The plot excites and I even like Scott's directing (although his last couple films were both major letdowns). But, at the end of the day I cannot say it is a good movie. It is just, 'blah'. The plot is simple; 'The Councilor' (interesting no name is ever given) is in love with a woman and getting into some pretty heavy illegal activity to make a quick buck (why, who can say). Things go bad (as they always do). Simple enough, except we never really know what activity he is getting involved in, we never really know what goes wrong, and we never really know what the role the \u00bd dozen major characters has to do with the plot. The acting is good. I always enjoy Pitt, and the rest do a solid job. Scott has each do a series of monologues that speak to the nature of man in one sense or another, yet these acting gems do little to add to the movie, feeling more like a film school project. Pitt waxes about the nature of friendship and Bardem recalls an anecdote from last night's club. But, if there is a message or point to these it is lost on all but the most profound audience. This feels like a movie that should have been done by the Coen Brothers, a cross between No Country for Old Men and Traffic. But the film lacks the presentation and humour of No Country, and the plot of Traffic, leaving a bit of a mess. It tries to be philosophical, but does not have much else to back it up. A shame really. Some might argue that is the beauty of this movie \u2013 that it truly does imitate life \u2013 it is random, unexplained, beautiful and ugly, confused and bored. Events happen, some have purpose, and some do not. I on the other hand need a movie a bit more grounded, exciting and logical. I did leave me something to think about, and that is always a plus."

It seems, the movie is about a drug deal gone south, but you have no idea who masterminded the deal, who plotted the drug deal heist, or why all of this was done.

It disarms you from the beginning with the extensive normality in it's engaging dialogue, it's interesting characters and even humor, especially one scene involving a Ferrari. But even knowing this I doubt anyone would be prepared for where it takes them, unless they come from this world. Written by Cormac McCarthy, it's very similar in tone to his best known work, \"No Country for Old Men\".\n\nI know some will disagree (well, many already have with the lukewarm ratings and disappointing box office it's getting--the R ratings crowd apparently opting for MTV's \"Bad Grandpa\", sigh), but I think this is Ridley Scott's best since \"Gladiator\". The cast is superb, especially Diaz and Bardem; and I gotta plug Natalie Dormer whose character has a small part but makes a tremendous gesture that sets her above the otherwise maleficent current to the story.

Of course it's no Smoking Aces or no Running Scared, but not so far behind. I liked the general ambiance of the movie, contrary to Killing them Softly. Cameron was not as bad as some people claim. Fassbender showed great emotion and the rest of the cast was nothing less then acceptable. For some reason I loved the septic truck. All the scenes including it were disgustingly beautiful. Now for all the people who claimed there was no link between many scenes, I don't know what you people were on when you watched the movie. I was a little high (as always when I watch a movie) when I watched it and to my memory there is not one scene that doesn't have a purpose to the plot. Obviously I have small deceptions, per example, the first hour of the film would have needed at least one action scene. Unfortunately they had us waiting more then half of the movie before there's violence. ***SPOILER*** Another thing is that when Reiner died and the cat come close to him they make us think its gonna eat him. Thats not the problem. The problem is after you realize the cheetah just takes a sniff at his body before running away, I was expecting/hoping that the cat would find the guys who killed him and avenge his master. Maybe I have a bit too much imagination...\n\nAll in all, not a bad movie. Good dialogues (better then Killing them softly) good feel to the whole thing.

She is past her prime and is no longer selecting roles, but taking anything she can get. There was so much in this script that did not need to be there.

Anyway, she's lapping it up (strictly speaking though, he is.).\n\nSo far, what's there not to like? Cruz looks ravishing as she approaches 40. My wife tells me Fassbender always looks ravishing.\n\nIt's a gentle opening to a movie that at times is anything but.\n\nIt's been deeply criticised in many reviews I've read for the quality of the stellar cast's acting and commitment (Cruz, Bardem, Pitt, Fassbender and Diaz) but I enjoyed each and every performance.\n\nIt's also been deeply criticised for the script. Now that, to a point, I can hold sway with.\n\nAs the world's greatest living fiction writer, frustrated by his screen adaptations (No Country for Old Men and The Road), Cormac McCarthy felt it was time to put pen to screenplay paper for the first time.\n\nIn many ways he shouldn't have because whole scenes are impenetrable guff. And the plot is nothing short of labyrinthine.\n\nAnd yet. It works.\n\nIt's a languid, stunningly shot (Dariusz Wolski Prometheus/Sweeney Todd) modern day mafia movie/Western set in El Paso,Texas and at times in Mexico.\n\nThe film's plot centres on Fassbender (The Counsellor) who gets himself embroiled in a drug deal that essentially goes wrong. It gets messy but that's not really, for me, the soul of the film.\n\nThe soul of it is about female power; their power over men, both sexually and emotionally, and that's what actually makes it both a superior movie but also leads to some of McCarthy's excesses. They might have worked in a novel but appear clunky on screen in places.\n\nDiaz and Cruz present opposite ends of the female control spectrum (Cruz womanly and traditional, Diaz a ball breaker). It's interesting casting because Cruz smoulders in her advancing years and plays the \"girl next door\"; Diaz, by contrasts, often looks a bit blokey (yes - come on, she's always been one of the boys - There's Something about Mary)\n\nShe's ageing (sorry to be so frank but she looks more than her two score years and one in this) but that kinds of adds to her menace. For pets she keeps cheetahs. Cheetahs that hunt Jack Rabbits on the Texan plains. She likes the kills.\n\nThe scene by the pool in which Diaz grills Cruz oh her taste in men clearly positions Diaz as the Alpha female and so the movie goes on to prove.\n\nThere's lots of A list men in this movie but Diaz is the power broker.\n\nIn conclusion. Don't believe all the negative reviews. This is a flawed gem that has much to recommend it.\n\n7.5/10"

But this one seems clear - the script is horribly pretentious and murky.\n\nI don't mind that characters don't know what's going on - that's like real life. But as the viewer, I want to know what's going on. (My favorite movie is Blood Simple, in which almost nobody actually knows what is going on, or even who is dead and who is alive.)\n\nThe whole PREMISE of The Counselor is contrived: we spend hours with this guy, in scenes where he is almost ALWAYS conversing with someone, and NO ONE ever utters his name? Not even his girlfriend/wife? What does this conceit add to the dramatic art of the work? The author is way too in love with men who are ghostly presences....\n\nI never thought I'd hate a sex scene, but the 2 in the film did nothing for me. They add nothing to character development or plot, nor were they very sexy (in Diaz' scene with in (and on) the Ferarri, I only knew what she was doing because Bardem was describing it to Fassbender while we watched a flashback. On the other hand, there's a sunbathing scene in which the amoral animal played by Diaz gets just a little bit touchy-feely with the shy, almost-virginal character played by Cruz. Now THAT would have been interesting, dramatically. To watch one of these characters ensnare another would have been an improvement.\n\nDemonstrating the adage about the \"gun in Act One, corpse in Act 3\", we have one character killed using a novel weapon that was completely gratuitous. The time taken to describe it to us earlier, and then show it to us later, was time wasted.\n\nSome of the scenes in which a character goes on and on philosophically have the small virtue of at least fitting the plot: someone has sought someone's help, or asked someone's opinion, and they get it, albeit at great length. But the scene towards the end where Cameron Diaz dines with Goran Visnjic is a total waste of everyone's time. Her long oration tells us only things we've already learned about her."

        "review_detailed_main": "With \u0084The Counselor\" we get an unusual concept, which centrum is not definitely the title character, and with that the whole storytelling is set in two directions: The world with The counselor and his accompanies' eyes and the \u0084real\" world's members' (kinda metaphorical sentence).\n\nThe realistic mob world depicted here is in an exotic environment, which symbolisms are set into materialistic-ism, hence we get the picture about priorities of these people, but even the desires of theirs, which get them into dark corners of this \u0084real\" world.\n\nThe story from the Counselor and his accompanies' view is normal, same as we would see the world from their place: naive, reachable opportunities which can be get by money, power, intelligence, 'friends'. The other view is from the mob's eyes: only the fittest survives, no rabbit should mess with the jaguar (it was jaguar in the movie, right?), and these 'newbies', un-experienced lifes are expendable. From these double standards we get the movie in two tastes: The dramatical, tragical and the materialistic, \"death is only a part of business\" ones. Furthermore with these mixing with each other the overall movie is \u0085 odd.\n\nBut let's talk about the more objective part of this product; The visual is fancy, exotic, colorful, from the aspect that it's kinda realistic and set into real world. The actors present quite solid performances, which with the comprehension of the story is on solid basis. The soundtrack is one of the factor which represents the \u0084exotic\" environment, on the other hand it's pretty good. The story is the most difficult phase of this motion picture, because it's language is like a woman's: it's always \u0084around the bush\" so it's kinda with many secrets and no points in sight. Many people in the audience may be frightened about the movie's unusual structure, but it shouldn't scare anyone, because it's purpose must be understood first and then being judged, however many do in the other way.\n\nSo as far as I can see, this motion picture has a classy presentation BUT with an unusual storytelling, which gives us some refreshing moments yet as a whole may be misunderstand-able, therefore leaves more disappointment then enjoyment for many people. So \u0085 I liked it, and will gonna watch it again several times."

As the film goes on you have lengthy scenes of people talking about life, philosophy, diamonds, poetry, sex, death and even torture. Some of it may even rebound on our characters later as if the writer and director wish to impart a connection but its just obvious signposting such as the contraption that strangles people or references to snuff videos.\n\nAnyhow with all this talking, various characters popping up for seemingly no reason a plot emerges and then suddenly The Counsellor along with Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt are all in danger from the Mexican Cartel. You might say the novelist has yet to figure out that writing a screenplay had a different skill set.\n\nThere is little by way of exposition. The Counsellor is suddenly out of his league but he was never in the league in the first place.\n\nThe actors are doing their best speaking their lines but its characters in search of a plot."

I had not seen Rosie Perez in a film in forever. The graphic violence would be excusable if the plot worked. I just found the film flaccid. A waste of time. Ridley Scott should be ashamed."

Well...about 1 minute in me and my brother turned over to look at each other say \"Is this really necessary\"? Unfortunately, that wasn't the last time we felt that way. This film has a great cast but had nothing to offer. Kind of like a coffee in the morning before work to give you some energy to start the day but there is no caffeine in it and it is 2 weeks old to boot. The Counselor felt like that. There was no plot and not only was there no plot, 99% of the time I didn't understand what was going on. No characters were explained at all, they just appeared and then if you were lucky enough left quickly. There was also so much unneeded sexual scenes/dialog, as well as a couple instances of incredibly graphic violence that just seemed to be too much. Now violence and sex do not bother me so much when it has a point, but there was just no point in this movie. The only regret I have is that me and my brother waited till about 10 minutes left in the film to leave the theater. After we left my friends who stayed for the entire film said how they wish they would have never even seen this movie. So unfortunate considering the director of this film has made so many great films."

        "review_detailed_main": "There have been some notable films recently about the state of Western capitalism following the crash of 2007, including Andrew Dominik's bleak and humorous Killing Them Softly, which also features Brad Pitt's splendid hair. If you thought that film was heavy-handed, just wait 'til you get a load of this equally bleak but not so humorous Cormac McCarthy-scripted thriller.\n\nIt was nice of Ridley Scott to offer us the British spelling of \"counsellor\" in the credits, but we could have done with a better film off the back of it. The plot is a simple story of an essentially decent man (the titular counsellor; a reliably solid performance from Michael Fassbender) drawn by greed into a deal with the devil. The devil in this case is a Mexican drugs cartel. After endless cautionary soliloquies, things go awry, and suddenly everyone associated with the counsellor is being violently picked off. Then the soliloquies turn to the nature of grief.\n\nOn the page, McCarthy is a rambling storyteller, and it works in a kind of bitter-old-man-beside-a-campfire kind of way. His style translates to the page when it is drawn visually (No Country for Old Men and, to a lesser extent, The Road), but for his first screenplay it's like he's chosen a book reading. The result is dialogue \u2013 and this is a film driven by dialogue \u2013 which ranges from the ripe to the risible.\n\nAs a painter of the modern soul, McCarthy proves that it's possible to be romantic in tone without being hopeful in outlook. As the malevolent Malkina (Cameron Diaz) reflects, there is elegance in the narrative she oversees \u2013 but that doesn't mean that the good guys will necessarily win. The brutal reality of the capitalist system is that it is set up to ensure the failure of those who would do what is right, or even those who would take pause before doing what is obviously wrong.\n\nAs the drugs are passed from lorry to chemical-cleaned lorry toward the crystal-glassed tablecloths of the elite, we're left in no doubt that this is a film about the money laundered to the top of our society today, and the distance of those who enjoy it from its ugly source. This is a powerful and relevant metaphor, but what's wrong with it remaining a metaphor? Why spoil it with unconvincing monologues which reduce every character to a nameless narrator? With a cast like this, the performances are just about enough to carry it through. I particularly admire what Penelope Cruz makes of a fairly thankless role, while Cameron Diaz is unforgettable... for a variety of reasons. Brad Pitt shows up carrying the same steely serenity as Jon Voight's Nate from Heat, while Javier Bardem shows up carrying another memorable hairdo \u2013 but neither has a chance to get to the bottom of their character while speaking dialogue this overcooked.\n\nIn concept and cast, and in the odd individual scene, this isn't a bad film. But it goes to show that while the meeting of talented minds might on paper look sure-fire, the result sometimes just doesn't hang together as a whole."

The plot was disjointed and sloppy and seemed like a vanity play for the actors involved, particularly Cameron Diaz and Javier Bardem. The dialogue was dreadful in this. Just the pits. This is easily one of Ridley Scott's worst efforts and doesn't bode well for what his twilight years as a filmmaker will bring us."

        "review_detailed_main": "It saddens me deeply to report that every bad thing you have heard about this box office bomb and film turkey is true, if not even somewhat too kind in the reports of its trashy badness. Make no doubt about it people, The Counselor will go down in history as one of the biggest let-downs of potential, waste of talent and a low point for many involved in the project.\n\nSetting off proceedings with what can only be described as one of the worst openings to a film in recent memory, and arguably all-time, one thinks that things can only get better for the film, a thought process that is as far off the mark as Javier Bardem's wardrobe stylist. Rambling on from scene to scene, The Counselor never once gives the audience any connection to its main players, and throughout the film one will be wondering more than once just exactly who is who or what is what giving the film a very nasty disjointed feel, and raises the question of exactly who is to blame for this mess? Straight off the bat some forgiveness must be paid to the actors who all do about as much as possible with their roles, although all have been seen on much better form in previous films. One actress however who cannot be excused is Cameron Diaz, who is surely just biding time until she picks up her Razzie award for an absolutely atrocious performance that includes this year's worst scene involving a hapless and innocent car windscreen. With the actors somewhat forgiven, the majority of the films atrocity's must fall upon (and I say this with regret) the great and legendary word smith Cormac McCarthy, whose script will also more than likely get the Pulitzer Prize winning author a Razzie. McCarthy's script is that of a man set on creating metaphorical and hypothetical jargon that looks to act as a deep and wise thesis on love, life and sin yet comes off as pretentious and weirdly amateurish.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott has been in the cinematic doldrums for some years now, but all those that thought low points had been reached with such cinema scum like A Good Year, Robin Hood and the overblown mess that was Prometheus can now add The Counselor to that ever growing misfire list and perhaps sit it atop of Scott's worst films. With 2013 so far offering up more than its full quota of disappointing films one can only hope that such talent is not wasted in vain again, for once you have watched this film there is no coming back from its dark depths of horrible.\n\n1 catfish out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

Since most movies aim at the 20 to 30 year old male movie goer, it is not a surprise that this movie is not doing well. To see a movie that takes you on a philosophical adventure is a rare occurrence, and certainly one that uses a vocabulary higher than a 12 year old might have. It is important that the viewer know in advance that every word is critical to the conclusion of the movie. The dialogue written by Pulitzer Winning, Cormac McCarthy, is so wonderfully tight, and it is more like observances than people discussing a topic. This is a true love story where the writer wants his audience to know that love is what life is about; not money; certainly not money from dealing drugs. It is a warning to those who neglect their lovers and choose a life where they worship things (not uncommon nowadays). I feel like this is a movie to warn everyone that some choices they make cannot be undone."

Seemed pretty pointless to have a high-paid actor like Brad Pitt in a movie when he had such an insignificant role - I am thinking they put him in the movie solely to attract viewers because there was nothing else attractive about the movie.\n\nMight I note, I am no movie expert, so if you are a hard-core movie person, you may enjoy it.

The film is not so much a plausible unfolding of events as it is a vehicle for its characters to act as oracles in the midst of impending catastrophe.\n\nMany of these sequences are quite good, for instance, the conversation between Jefe (Reuben Blades) and the councilor (Michael Fassbender) and that between Malkina (Cameron Diaz) and her banker in the closing scene.\n\nThis is a good film, which seems to have the skeleton of a great film but was never fleshed out. Probably there is good reason for this, although I don't know if all of it had to do with deadlines, funding, and organization."

By the way, I thought Cameron Diaz did her part very well in spite of some negative criticism shown here on IMDb. But that's it people. That is all you gonna get, glued by the most crappy-pseudo-intellectual dialogs you can imagine. A plot? Really, was there a plot? Sorry, if there was one it just passed unnoticed.

Several scenes of dialogue rivals Robert Shaw's Indianapolis speech in Jaws. Technically amazing and a fantastic reality of the drug trade, corruption, violence, power and greed. Cormac McCarthy is an incredible visionary. Ridley Scott you are a true artist. Amazing cinematography. Highly underrated gem but apparently only if you are a film fan with a IQ above 70."

Instead, Ridley Scott steps back and allows McCarthy's complex and severe dialogue to take center stage. The film is bleak and uncompromising, always captivating, but never generating any real interpersonal or philosophical heat, except at the very end. I want to defend Cameron Diaz's performance, which has been criticized even by those who liked the Counselor. She may not be \"good,\" but she is unsettling; for some reason, her face, limbs, and voice do not seem to belong to the same person. Given what her character represents in the movie, it is an effective embodiment."

The plot meanders without direction for what seems like hours, with only minimal interruptions for some gratuitous violence or sex. The language isn't as bad as other drug syndicate movies (such as Runner,Runner) but the temptation to get up and walk out was just as great. This is probably the kind of movie that will get rave reviews from folks who like to think of themselves as sophisticated intellectuals, but for the rest of us unwashed heathens who just like good entertainment, this is not it."

        "review_detailed_main": "SPOILER ALERT -- ! In this review, I reveal important plot details regarding \"The Counselor,\" \"Blood Meridian,\" and \"No Country For Old Men.\"\n\nA lot of people are trashing Ridley Scott's new film, \"The Counselor\"...but honestly, I think they're misunderstanding the film's characters, monologues, and themes -- chiefly because they're not familiar with Cormac McCarthy's style, outlook, or world view. I think they're expecting something mostly Scott...instead of something wholly McCarthy -- and I say that because I felt that \"The Counselor\" was mostly the product of McCarthy's (first) screenplay rather than Scott's direction.\n\nMy good friend's criticism was simple enough: \"I saw everything coming! This movie was way too predictable!\" But again, because he's so unfamiliar with McCarthy's \"universe,\" he didn't enjoy the film.\n\nFor the record...I have read EVERY (published) McCarthy novel and I have seen MOST of Scott's films (I never saw \"A Good Year\" or \"Legend\" or a few others not worth mentioning)...so I feel that I'm in a very good position to offer my opinion concerning \"The Counselor\" -- perhaps the best film I saw in 2013.\n\nTo my friend who said that \"The Counselor\" was too predictable...I will agree; upon second viewing, this film is FILLED with not-so-subtle hints that death and misery will befall its main character, the Counselor. Like other McCarthy works, certain characters WARN other characters of impending (and highly probable) death...but the warnings always go unheeded...and the characters (in this case, the main character's love interest) suffer GREATLY.\n\nIn \"Blood Meridian\" (Cormac's greatest work of the '80s) an old Mennonite warns the soldiers (and the main character) not to go on their journey. The men are slaughtered later. Later in the story, a juggler tells fortunes using tarot cards...and later, the men are killed in various ways.\n\nCameron Diaz's character, Malkina, like the Judge from \"Blood Meridian\" or Anton Chigurh from \"No Country For Old Men,\" orchestrates death...and ultimately finds immunity from it. Many who read \"Blood Meridian\" surmise that the Judge is a god. Chigurh is certainly a \"prophet of death.\" Now, I'm not suggesting that Malkina is a goddess...but a \"prophetess...of death\"? Certainly. Malkina is certainly a McCarthy character -- but sadly, Diaz is the weakest link in the cast.\n\n\"The Counselor\" is FILLED with other \"McCarthisms\" that I found noteworthy:\n\nDeath is meaningless and any attempt to avoid or escape it is futile. (\"You can't stop what's comin'.\") Death befalls those who don't necessarily deserve it; death, justly or unjustly, is often the result of choice by somebody other -- i.e. our choices will kill US...or kill those we love.\n\nAll in all, Scott's film is excellent -- but definitely more enjoyable if you LOVE McCarthy's writing style and his character's philosophies. The Jefe (played EXPERTLY by Ruben Blades) delivers an amazing monologue about how our choices CREATE our world. It's a timeless lesson."

As everybody who watched Breaking Bad knows, Mexican drug lords get very upset when somebody messes with their drugs, so rightful revenge ensues.\n\nUnfortunately, in this case the revenge is not fair and the Mexican guys should know. In one of many weird scenes, we see a main player spying a conversation between the Counselor and Reiner, during which it is spelled out that the Counselor is innocent. And yet the ax will fall on him and on his beloved Laura.\n\nThe violence is disturbing but predictable. When Reiner and the Counselor coolly discus about decapitation devices, you can be sure that someone will be decapitated before the end credits. The same when they talk about snuff movies\u0085\n\nCameron Diaz playing femme fatale Malkina is especially disturbing. Sporting appropriate sprayed-on clothes and super high-heels, with huge sculpted cheekbones, she is supposed to convey fear and mystery. But I just found her cheekbones too distracting to be afraid."

It is specially shocking the Mexican characters, all of them presented as the worst Latin clich\u00e9, lacking of any given skill nor intelligence. Bardem, a very talented actor is a joke in this film, and I feel sad for him cause work with one genius as Ridley in it's worse play is something hard to deal with. I believe, Ridley as many others have been influenced by the ambiance and situations recently nailed by Breaking Bad, and wanting to do his take on the border's legends and fables has failed big time. I rather be watching his epic historic flicks or science fiction classic masterpieces than this kind of stories..."

Lets not forget about the fake Sheriff that takes out the pickup truck from 100 yards with an Uzi like he was shooting a mini-gun....stupid.

I quite liked the philosophising gangsters but agree with others that it's fairly \"talky\"in general and with some unclear motivations on show.\n\nIn particular, Fassbinder seems too blank for any empathy, Cruz looks wasted and Bardem looks like he decided that the way in to his character was to overact wildly - which is a shame for Diaz as she tries to broaden her range with a fairly serious role.\n\nIMHO it's also a weird comment on the state of censorship these days that this film can open with the least erotic, nudity-free sex scene and yet later contain copious violence including not one but two decapitations.

Life is seldom linear and people do not behave rationally, at times their irrationality is predictable on a group level but up close and personal, when and where it counts, it seldom is. If you know the author's work in film then you can expect some recurring themes. The nature of evil, the consequences of choice and free will. Rarely films produce memorable lines of dialog that I take away and dissect word for word to reveal a kernel of visceral Truth. Occasionally films produce imagery so vivid with remarkable characters played by amazing actors that once seen it cannot be unseen. This film does both. Ridley Scott gives life to a screenplay written by writer unequaled in both film and literature. This film is indelible, disturbing, brutal, ugly, and unforgettable. It is also beautiful, but never pretty. Forget what you know before you take your seat, you are not in control of the boat. The river will flow where it will flow and you will get there when you get there."

I'm saying all of this upfront because I don't want the rest of the review to put anyone off watching the film. I'm sure we all read reviews then watch a film and think the reviewer was too harsh, so I should say right now the film IS watchable and entertaining, my issue is with the screen play.\n\nSo with an all star cast in place, The Counselor already gives us a certain level of expectation and to be fair each actor works well within the confines of the script. The sets, costumes and overall painting of excess shine out at you like a combination of Grand Designs and neon sign on a tacky strip joint. Ridley Scott really has made his glossy mark on the film, the trouble is there is no real substance, the characters are two dimensional and my biggest issue with it is the dialogue.\n\nAs a writer myself (the published kind not merely a fantasist) writing is a craft. Whilst I wouldn't know how to make a great film I do know what is good and what is poor writing and I'm afraid the screen writing in this film was dire. Since watching, I've discovered the author of the book was using this film as his first attempt at a screen play. As a writer I empathise - as a viewer I cringe. With what I'm certain was a massive budget, I cannot understand why either a pro screen writer wasn't hired - and the author made an executive, or the other way around.\n\nSome of the characters are believable some not. You get the feeling someone decided Pitt had to be in the film then added him at the last minute, he is surplus to requirements and has no screen presence at all. Diaz is EXTRAORDINARY and if you don't want to watch the whole film just skip to the bit where she jumps on a car bonnet, without spoiling it I have to say it was a mind-blowing and mesmerising performance. Fassbender is as gorgeous as ever but you are left wondering how this Bentley driving, already successful lawyer, with little taste for conflict, ever had the need let alone the courage to get into the mix in the first place. This makes any kind of empathy difficult. Cruz is a sexy as ever (and I'm a straight woman talking!) but again the overall sense is her church going character is only there to show how bad others are. Bardem's performance is witty and engaging yet sadly the writing gives him a story line that makes him neither tough or clever, that's a real shame because he does either exceptionally well given the right content.\n\nIn one scene Pitt is given a long monologue talking in riddles and an endless vomit of philosophy, you're left thinking, where did that come from? Then another character does the same although to be fair he DOES pull this off (without spoiling anything I will simply say this was a mob boss. The timing and subject of this moment are done to perfection). The problem is, later there's a THIRD scene with an almost identical vibe and you start to realise that the screen play dialogue is simply trying to be clever - yet it just ends up becoming annoying and unbelievable. The writer has clearly taken thought provoking thought processes contained within the book and tried to weave them into unconvincing speech patterns, leaving you with a cross between a Shakespeare soliloquy and one of Johnathan Cainer's puzzling horoscopes.\n\nThe plot doesn't have much of an arc, it just kind of moves along at its own pace, although it does have a dramatic, emotional punch at the end, in fact I note with amusement one of the awards categories this film won was entitled \"Movies You Wanted to Love, But Just Couldn't\"\n\nThe Counselor is shallow, hollow and yet somehow still spectacular. If you don't need a film to offer you intelligence or culture and love a sex and shoot-em-up movie, or you just like shock value - you MIGHT like it..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I admire Ridley Scott as much as the next guy. He's great with actors and he's a great visual artist, but if there's one vice he suffers from, it's this. Scott has a penchant for picking bad scripts to film. He's *always* been wildly inconsistent with that, not merely in his last ten years, and in plenty of non-negligible cases, has had to go so far as to use his direction to mask the flaws of the writing. This was especially the case for films like Hannibal, 1492, Legend, A Good Year, and the notorious plot holes of Prometheus. I respect him for always trying to stretch his versatility, but his scripts don't do his strengths justice, and his last decade alone has been even patchier than Tim Burton's.\n\nThe reason I say that is because The Counselor is yet another example of this. I know Cormac McCarthy is a great author (in fact, he wrote my favorite book, No Country for Old Men), but what makes him great in literature doesn't make him so in cinema. His script feels like it was originally meant for a book but trimmed for the screen, and it shows. The film expects us to immediately accept the reality of the situation, shorting us on crucial details behind the relationships of characters, something that even the awkward exposition can't fix. These characters are so middlingly established that I simply can't care about them. Another indication that it was meant for the page is that the script is incredibly busy and needlessly convoluted. It feels like several different movies are going on at once with nothing tying them together, and full of elements that go absolutely nowhere. As a book, this could be easily expanded upon and you could get away with this kind of busy structure, but in film, it's talky, dull, and loaded with redundancy (We get it, Cormac, actions have consequences). That even extends into the visuals with repeated imagery of cheetahs, no doubt to foreshadow the hungry predators about to descend upon the unwary prey of main characters... SYMBOLISM!\n\nRidley Scott is trying his best to wrangle it all together, but no matter how hard he tries, he just can't generate any suspense from this film, and one of the only good scenes is setting up the wire on the road, because it's one of the few moments with no unneeded dialogue. There's too few of those tense moments present in the film, and despite the best efforts of the cast members, great actors can only elevate bad material so much (none dumber and more horrendous than Cameron Diaz screwing a car), and it makes for yet another blunder for Scott."

I love crime thrillers and I rushed to see the movie after seeing the trailer, not even thinking it will be so horrible. Unfortunately, it was.\n\nThe acting is flawless, Michael is really great. Everyone did a great job really, and I felt very bad that it didn't save the movie. I get the idea that this was supposed to stand out from other clich\u00e9d movies with similar plot. Somewhat I liked the idea of unhappy ending. Abstract dialogs and storytelling were supposed to make this movie smart, but they just made it a total mess.\n\nThe movie had a lot of useless scenes, dialogs and plots. It didn't even tell why something is happening and how anybody knows anyone. It leaves the audience with a lot of questions and unexplained events. This is just not enjoyable.\n\nBottomline, it's not watchable movie. Save your time and money and skip this."

Nevertheless, great actors performance, raw RS style visuals, brutal story, intense adrenaline rush make it cool. And even one time sarcastically \"funny\" episode , when evil heroine (Cameron Diaz) having intercourse with.. Ferrari car windshield - superb performance! Although two hours are not enough to clarify details and reveal the case. This film story is complex and enigmatic, but must be squeezed into movie theater time-frame jar, unfortunately.. Dialogs are very long and \"meaningful\" (especially Brad Pitt's) and deeply controversial (Mexican drug lord tirade), but those are ALL important ingredients for true film aficionados. Art of Cinema unique piece. So who is this soulful right man in a wrong place, who is THE COUNSELOR? Watch story and decide yourself. I know the answer already.. IMHO, of course! (copyrighted)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is so disgusting, vulgar, immoral, and horrible in every way that in my opinion it ranks at the very bottom. No, I take that back, it is far below the bottom. Somewhere in some deep subterranean pit of evil, it writhes, a creature of the cesspit. Ridley Scott is the director, and if I could think of one good thing to say, I might consider doing so, but truly I believe the man needs professional help. I should make clear that I am talking about the extended director's cut as available on the DVD. I presume many of the most disgusting scenes must have been cut from the cinema version, or at least I hope so. One example of a scene of unrivalled depravity is the ludicrous scene where Cameron Diaz 'makes love to a car'. Javier Bardem complains that he has to wipe the vaginal fluid off with his socks before he can continue driving, and he criticizes her for being 'too gynaecological'. And do we not have enough decapitations in the real world at the moment without having to watch two of them in this film? In one scene, a man is riding a motorcycle and runs into a wire carefully strung across the road which neatly decapitates him. The killer then picks up the helmet, shakes the severed head out of it, which rolls along the road, and reaches up inside to find the concealed object he is looking for. He then drives away saying on the phone to his colleagues that he must get away quickly because there are bodies in the road (yes, there are always plenty of bodies strewn everywhere in this film). And then there is Brad Pitt who ingloriously agreed to play a part where we see him being decapitated and his head rolls along the street, but not before his carotid artery has been severed so that lots of blood spurts up like a fountain, and of course we have to see a close shot of Brad Pitt's hand with his fingers chopped off as well. This gore-fest of a film has no justification, it is merely a deranged series of visions of evil which ramble along in a kind of mad and meaningless sequence of extreme violence. All of the characters in the film are despicable people, drug dealers who deserve what they get, and they get plenty. Cameron Diaz plays an extremely evil plotter and betrayer, and she actually tries to be a psychopath because her character is one. We are meant to feel sorry for the other psychopaths whom she betrays because they, poor things, are a little bit less crazy and jollier than she is, whereas she simply has no sense of humour. Jolly, laughing Javier Bardem tries to create a likable drug dealing psychopath. Well, what a laudable ideal as an actor! Yes, why not aim so high as that? What on earth possessed all of these people including Penelope Cruz to appear in this despicable film? The salacious scene between Penelope Cruz and Michael Fassbender which appears before the credits is not only pointless, it is so crude and vulgar that Penelope Cruz has terminally demeaned herself by appearing in it. She was a nice wholesome girl before she went to Hollywood, told me she was a Buddhist. Well, that is some Buddhism. Having survived Scientology and Cruz, has she decided to try Satanism, perhaps? Since this film may well be the most horrible and vile film ever made, shall we award it the must suitable Anti-Oscar? I suggest one made of something unspeakable, which even Bardem's socks cannot deal with."

These are not even sentences!! These are just random words put together!! One question that will always remain unanswered to me; why did the Counsellor got himself involved in such a deal simply for the money while he drives a Bentley, wears Armani first line, flies to Amsterdam to buy a ring of more than 100k and owns an apartment that is as big as Boise?"

There is a lot of Stating. Long, Sometimes Incomprehensible, Wordy Nonsense about Sex, Drugs, and the Rock n' Rolling of the Universe. Or Something like that there.\n\nRidley Scott is a Visualist, if Nothing Else and the Film is Strikingly Garish and Mesmerizing to Look at. It Vibrates on its Own Frequency. All the All Stars Manage to Bring their Personal sort of Chutzpah to the Movie with Cameron Diaz and Javier Bardem the Most Compelling. Michael Fassbender's Frozen Face is Hardly Worth Much as He comes Across so Petrified. It Appears, much of the Time that He got High on His Own Supply, although We are Assured He doesn't do Drugs. How Noble this Weeping Hero.\n\nThe Dialog is the Thing here and if this Didacticism Stimulates than so be it, but Much of it is so Thick and Deep it is Wise to take a deep breath before Swimming in this Cesspool of Monologues that can be Insightful but most of the Time are Confusing and Rambling and Perhaps on Page where One can Study the Prose is More Affecting.\n\nOverall it is one for the Eggheads and Thinkers and those Expecting a Thriller-Thriller may be Disappointed. There are Spurts of Violence and a Few Sans Dialog Scenes that make for some Dark and Offbeat Neo-Noir Bad Behavior. But the Method to this Madness, and Mad it is, Relies on Modern Philosophical Rants."

It's weighed down by too many threads which are 'conveniently' left to the audience to tie together. It felt like it reached, knew it was falling short and was edited/packaged into a \"Are you clever enough to figure me out?!\" challenge. I think where it went wrong, is that it would have worked far better as a series, developing characters unrestrained by the allotted two hours. If I chose one of the threads to pick apart as an example, it's the lack of exploration of Diaz's central character; a sociopathic, Salome/Fury which could have led into the topic of toxic femininity; a worthy, complex subject. Apart from breaking the over-worked, soft porn 'victimized female gets revenge and all is well with the world,' the idea of exploring hardcore feminine madness, justified or not, without bending to some Hollywood hypocritcal \"it's all because of men!\" spiel, although inferred, is not evident enough. I. E. Diaz's ruthless, immoral, hunter killer by proxy role with her 'possible' long-game murder of Cruz, 'possilby' initiated by her disgust and 'maybe' jealousy at the couple's reciprocated love. From the 'possible' wide angle. Advance setting-up of all the men involved, to the macro focus of the 'bolito' decapitation, which was 'possibly' shared with her by Bardem's character as he did with Fassbender; is just a smidgeon of all the 'possibles' and 'maybes' that left me feeling like i was being lead to surmise, to cover for the films failed overreaching ambition. Because of this obfuscation, Diaz's stone-cold killer character is compromised, and with the added 'acceptable' and facile bloodletting of the 'patriarchs,' it left me feeling that the film's 'morality' was mired in contradiction and disenguous preaching."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ridley Scott's The Counselor (2013) offers a visually striking and morally complex journey into the world of crime, greed, and betrayal. The film features an all-star cast including Michael Fassbender, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, and Brad Pitt, all of whom deliver compelling performances in their respective roles. Fassbender plays the titular counselor, a lawyer who gets entangled in a drug cartel's dangerous business, and the film explores the consequences of his decisions in increasingly devastating ways.\n\nThe screenplay, penned by Cormac McCarthy, is sharp and often poetic, filled with philosophical musings on human nature and morality. The dialogue can be dense and cryptic, which might leave some viewers scratching their heads, but it also adds a layer of intrigue that challenges the audience to engage deeply with the story. McCarthy's trademark style of blending the existential with the violent is certainly present, but it can occasionally feel overly cryptic and detached from the emotional beats of the film.\n\nVisually, The Counselor excels, with Ridley Scott's direction ensuring that every scene is meticulously crafted and atmospheric. The desert landscapes, sleek interiors, and tension-filled moments come together to create an aesthetic that's both stylish and immersive.\n\nHowever, the film's pacing is uneven, and its tone swings unpredictably, leading to a sense of disjointedness. While some scenes are tense and gripping, others may feel unnecessarily drawn-out or disorienting. Additionally, the film's nihilistic outlook may not resonate with all audiences, as it presents a rather grim view of human ambition and greed.\n\nIn the end, The Counselor is a film that may not appeal to everyone, but for those who appreciate a dark, thought-provoking narrative with strong performances and striking visuals, it's worth a watch. Though it falters in some areas, it's an intriguing exploration of the dangers of getting caught up in the world of crime-if you're willing to embrace its ambiguity and bleak worldview."

The film has recently been getting many bad ratings and comments due to the turn Cormac McCarthy and Ridley Scott have taken, the muddled storyline and terrible acting.\n\nThere are a few points to consider. The first being the film is not something you'd expect from Cormac but it is unique and fits perfectly with Ridley Scott.\n\nThe plot is about a man who invests in drug trafficking therefore making him wealthy but choices sometimes have consequences. Now the film isn't happy nor exciting. It's dark and gripping. Related around drugs it's probably targeted for adults. The storyline may not be as clear due to scenes relating in and out of context but however the storyline does in fact pull you in. It story gives you hints of what's coming next yet it is subliminal.\n\nMany people were attracted to this film due to it's cast. I mean surely the acting couldn't be bad. But it's the truth. The acting was neither bad not good. I'd say Cameron Diaz did not blow us away this time. The acting is sometimes dull and I do agree as to it may be over-acting and a bit too subtle.\n\nComarc McCarthy's screenplay for the film may have been exaggerated to some viewers. However the writing of the film is detailed and clear. The role of each character and the personality of each character can be told by what they say and that is what impressed me. There are many moral quotes in this film and many people argue that it has been exaggerated and it probably has due to it being too much of fancy in-depth style writing. But this is the style Cormac wants you to see and he has certainly done that.\n\nIn conclusion, the movie isn't as bad as they say. So don't be scared to waste your money to see it. It has many morals and a wise in-depth study on how choices can have consequences. The movie didn't amaze me but it sure did impress me."

I took it back without watching it, but i was still interested in watching it, so i looked for reviews and all i found were bad reviews saying how bad and underdeveloped this movie was and how none of it made sense, so ofcaurse my expectations were severely lowered. Well i finally watched it today and i can say While the movie does indeed not make sense, it was very entertaining, a lot of it was interesting. overall this is not at all what i expected but i was entertained by it and while the end made me thing WTF i must say i don't think it was as bad as a lot of reviewers have said. Maybe if i was as hyped for this as i was Savages i would have been disappointed but this movie wasn't as bad in my opinion as other people think it is."

        "review_title": "A Dark and Enigmatic Descent into Moral Corruption",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Counsellor, directed by Ridley Scott and written by Cormac McCarthy, is a dark and thought-provoking thriller that delves into the moral complexities of greed, betrayal, and the consequences of one's actions. With its gripping performances, mesmerizing dialogue, and haunting atmosphere, the film delivers a chilling exploration of the human capacity for destruction.\n\nBoasting an impressive ensemble cast, The Counsellor showcases the talents of Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, and Brad Pitt. Fassbender delivers a compelling performance as the titular character, a lawyer who becomes entangled in a treacherous drug deal. Bardem mesmerizes as the eccentric and hedonistic Reiner, while Diaz delivers a chillingly seductive portrayal as the enigmatic Malkina. The cast's chemistry and their ability to inhabit complex characters lend credibility to the film's morally ambiguous world.\n\nCormac McCarthy's screenplay weaves a web of mesmerizing and enigmatic dialogue, evoking existential questions and philosophical musings. The conversations between characters are rich in subtext, exploring themes of morality, desire, and the pursuit of power. The script's poetic language and introspective nature add depth and intellectual weight to the film, elevating it beyond the boundaries of a conventional crime thriller.\n\nRidley Scott's direction is atmospheric and visually arresting. The film's cinematography, courtesy of Dariusz Wolski, captures the dark underbelly of the story, juxtaposing starkly beautiful landscapes with moments of brutal violence. Scott's meticulous attention to detail enhances the film's mood, creating a palpable sense of impending doom and moral decay.\n\nThe Counsellor is not a film for those seeking a traditional narrative structure or a neatly tied conclusion. Instead, it poses challenging questions and explores the consequences of greed and moral compromise. Some viewers may find the film's slow pacing and enigmatic storytelling frustrating, as it prioritizes contemplation over action. However, for those willing to engage with its philosophical themes, The Counsellor offers a haunting and intellectually stimulating experience.\n\nWhile The Counsellor's exploration of moral decay and its consequences is gripping, it occasionally loses momentum and feels disjointed. The intricate plot can be challenging to follow, and certain narrative choices may leave viewers longing for further clarity. However, these elements contribute to the film's enigmatic nature, inviting interpretation and encouraging discussions long after the credits roll.\n\nThe Counsellor is a captivating and darkly introspective film that delves into the depths of moral corruption and the high cost of one's choices. Its remarkable performances, poetic dialogue, and atmospheric direction make it a standout entry in the crime thriller genre. For those seeking a thought-provoking and atmospheric cinematic experience, The Counsellor offers a haunting journey into the shadows of human nature."

The whole plot takes its time but was never boring to me at least,this story does not go the way you might conventionaly expect, the brutal climax being the confirmation of this. If you like intelligently well written plots well acted and a non reliance on action then this is a really good watch,im not sure what the negative posters expected, perhaps it helped i had no preconceptions."

It's impressive how the actors are able to memorize so many lines but COME ON! When one of the characters gets going they just go on and on and on and on. And not in simple English either - nope, they ramble like a modern version of Shakespeare. And the rambling lasts forever! It's like every character in this movie all have a masters in philosophy.

Being blonde, reasonably skinny and tall doesn't necessarily make a girl good looking, please stop asking her to act beautiful. That is as true as Ridley Scott directing decent films in the last 30 years.\n\nPoints made, this film is meaningless, predictable and dull and Cameron Diaz' acting is as subtle as her chin."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 2007, Michael Bay created a mega, summer movie blockbuster event that brought some incredible advances in special effects, a slew of unnecessary sequels and most importantly, made famous the incredibly sexy, sweaty grease-monkey character Mikaela Banes, also knows as Megan Fox. If there is anything Michael Bay did right in that film, was give audience members as well as pop-culture enthusiasts one of the most memorable cinematic stills since Marilyn Monroe in 1954\u2032s The Seven Year Itch. Leaning on the sizzling hood of Sam Witwicky's 1976 Chevrolet Camaro's hood, allowing the heat from the engine to soak Mikaela's body with sweet sweat, Bay created eternal movie magic with that iconic scene. Since then, audiences, as well as critics alike, never thought that the day would come when an overly fetishized, sexual image involving a car would ever come. Oh, it came!\n\nThe only difference between Diaz's Malkina's outrageous car scene and Fox's iconic heated scene is that, Diaz and company wish they had as good a movie as Transformers on their hands and a film that people will actually care to watch and recommend, and that's putting it nicely.\n\nThe Counselor seemed to have no advising or counseling on it at all, because director Ridley Scott and company deliver what is surely going to be one of the worst decisions in their careers in a long time. What looked like a thrilling game of cat and mouse, quickly becomes a dry, careless piece of gorgeous snuff.\n\nThe Counselor follows, well, the counselor (Michael Fassbender) as he navigates the waters of his first ever, illegal and immoral business venture of drug trafficking from Mexico across the United States boarder. That is pretty well everything you need to know and everything that is really told. Just like the lack to give a name to the lead, The Counselor is a cold, informal and perplexing film of too many characters and not enough explanation or purpose.\n\nThe Counselor shows the relationship between himself and his gorgeous wife Laura (Penelope Cruz), his relationship with people in the underworld including Westray (Brad Pitt) a middle man between professionals and the cartels, Reiner (Javier Bardem) a man of means, and Malkina (Cameron Diaz) the lavish girlfriend of Reiner. Other than that, things go from bad, to worse, in both the narrative of the film, and the film itself.\n\nLacking any real storyline or empathetic characters, The Counselor serves as an ill-advised example of the power within Hollywood. Following in the footsteps of other complete disaster ensemble films like this year's Movie 43 and The Coen Brother's 2008 tragedy Burn After Reading, the film serves no purpose other than Diaz's amazing showcase of acrobatics, sensuality and unexplained perversion.\n\nThe film itself is a stylized and beautifully shot piece of work. Sadly, pieces of art share more of an emotional response than this film does. The film is flooding with lost scenes, pathetic foreshadowing and unflinching action/reaction shots.\n\nOne of the most noticeable disappointments of The Counselor is its script. Acclaimed author Cormac McCarthy is a recognized and respected writing force. So many of the most striking narrative feature pieces of the last decade, including No Country For Old Men and The Road, have used McCarthy's work as source material and enhanced the characters and narrative of McCarthy's narrative worlds. In his first venture as feature screenwriter, McCarthy overcompensates with nonsense, directionless and often sleepy dialogue. I'm unsure if McCarthy was pulling inspiration from Shakespeare or Hemingway, but instead of delivering on precise, metaphorically driven, analogical monologues and conversations between characters, McCarthy simply loses his audience and instead allows his talented actors to give long-winded, spoken word lullabies.\n\nEvery so often, there comes a movie that really makes me scratch my head and wonder how and why all the talented individuals involved could possibly sign on to a movie like this. The Counselor is well on its way to being one of the worst movies of 2013. Strangled with boredom that even scenes of decapitation couldn't possibly help make it even a bit interesting, The Counselor is a failed attempt for everyone involved but Diaz. Diaz will surely be remembered for years to come for her scene atop a bright yellow Ferrari, a vacant golf course and a priceless face made by Bardem, who encompasses the feeling of the whole movie, with one facial expression. Disbelief is the best way to describe it, or gynecological, if that even makes sense, because nothing in this film attempts to make sense. This film is in desperate need of some professional help.\n\nNight Film Reviews Rating: 2/10 Stars (Just For The Ferrari Scene)."

He was warned of the danger, although not specifically by Pitt. There was enough there to walk away, but he was addicted to a lifestyle he could no longer sustain, and he went forward. Diaz was incredible. Pure sexy. Fassbender and Bardem also stellar. I love Ridley Scott, and his movies always have a feel that others do not. Stop complaining. This was riveting.

Even Brad Pitt couldn't inspire, and I can't blame him. Like I mentioned: all dialogs were cold, and B-movie-like. Propably over-directed, and some of the scenes so ridiculous I asked myself where he got his inspiration from and what it actually contributed to the movie. Actually... nothing. Cameron Diaz is playing a slut who is trying to confess for the first time, and Penelope Cruz the most innocent catholic girl in the world who fell in the wrong hands. Brad Pitt is the crook who you saw in the A-team before and Fassbender... I don't what to think about him at all...

        "review_detailed_main": "For those Cormac McCarthy fans this film will probably be disappointing. Cormac's novels bask in run-on sentences, philosophical tangents and just smart ideas while they accompany the well-paced story. This, however, is a straight screenplay, not an adaptation of one of his books, and therein lies the problem. If sitting still through endless conversations about grief, the meaning of life, the impact of loss on the human soul etc entertain you, then you'll love this very slow film. If that kind of thematic dialogue calls attention to itself purely for the sake of 'profound thinking', then perhaps you will be disappointed with a film packed with excellent actors but lacking a credible story. Examples of seated dialogue: 'I suspect that we are ill-formed for the path we have chosen. Ill-formed and ill-prepared. We would like to draw a veil over all the blood and terror that have brought us to this place. It is our faintness of heart that would close our eyes to all of that, but in so doing it makes of it our destiny... But nothing is crueler than a coward, and the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining.' And more: 'When it comes to grief, the normal rules of wealth do not apply. Because grief transcends value. A man would give entire nations to lift grief off his heart and yet, you cannot buy anything with grief, because grief is worthless.' When isolated and read (as in McCarthy's fine books) it works well, but place these words as a substitute for dialogue and it pretty much crashes and burns.\n\nThe region is the El Paso/Suarez border. A rich and successful lawyer, the Counselor (Michael Fassbender), is about to get married to his fianc\u00e9e Laura (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) but soon becomes entangled in a complex drug plot with a middle-man known as Westray (Brad Pitt). The plan ends up taking a horrible twist and he must protect himself and his soon to be bride as the truth of the drug business is uncovered and targets are eliminated. The other characters who walk on and off the set include a diamond dealer (Bruno Ganz), a wealthy questionably legal dealer Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his all important mistress Malkina (Cameron Diaz), the jailed mother (Rosie Perez) of a druggie biker (Richard Cabral) \u2013 but they all have so little to do with what's going on (whatever that is) that they remain interesting cameos. Ridley Scott knows better. So does Cormac McCarthy. Next time, plan ahead."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was not going to review director Ridley Scott's new movie THE COUNSELOR, because of my aversion to Pulitzer Prize winner Cormac McCarthy's pretentious dialogue in this, his screen writing debut. But I changed my mind because I yearned to write a \"cautionary\" review. I listened to what was fumblingly coming out of the mouths of actors I respected in this \"morality\" tale and felt patronized. Short pithy philosophical thoughts were floating from their tongues, hovering in the air lifeless before falling ineffectively to the ground.\n\nThe film opens with the lovely Penelope Cruz under tousled white sheets making love to Michael Fassbender \u2013 the Counselor \u2013 who is never called by any other name. The erotically charged love scene quickly collapses under the weight of their asinine conversation, a forecast of what I will have to sit through for the next 2+ hours. Next the camera quickly cuts to the \"dark\" side of Mexico, where high-stakes drug deals are under way, and then we jump to Amsterdam, Columbia, Chicago, and continue hurtling back and forth to various sites on the Tex-Mex border.\n\nOur Counselor \u2013 a avaricious newbie at the drug game - is about to do a deal with some \"bad\" boys \u2013a strange Javier Bardem with an even more bizarre hairdo, and Brad Pitt, a mysterious man who is at ease with the under-world and seems to smoothly snake his way through it, unscathed and a step ahead of calamity. For me the star of this den of reptiles is Cameron Diaz who I found fascinating as the cold, shrewd, wildly evil and often mesmerizing mistress of Bardem, Diaz, is often guarded by two muscular and sleek Cheetahs (who are tamer than their master,) appreciatively observing them hunt innocent prey. She is the best part of this movie \u2013a carnal and hard beauty with tattoos of Big Cats' paw-prints adorning her body.\n\nSuffice it to say the deal goes bad and the Counselor is in a dangerous dilemma. Having been apprised by his \"partners\" (part of the metaphysical drivel) as to the capriciousness of doing business where there are no guarantees \u2013 all of the warnings come to fruition. What I found most ineffectual about THE COUNSELOR was the attempt by Scott and McCarthy to make a weak character the archetype for greed and arrogance in a \"game\" against seasoned predators. I did not care about The Counselor at all \u2013 he was whiny, vain and as shallow and lightweight as the stream of conversations we the audience had to endure."

I was hoping it would be good with the promising casting but the major flaws of the film were\n\n* Plot - didn't make sense in some parts, plot-holes were left open and no character purpose was explained fully to the viewer. * Pace - It just felt like a slow film consisting of too much dialogue that makes you wonder what the character means (not saying I dislike monologues but it has to have a point, meaning and a deep perspective of what to be stated).\n\nThe only positive factor I can give the film is the casting, they all gave the best performances despite a poor script and character development.\n\nI think for once this is the first time for me to be on the 'other side' of the audience that hated this. Find something else better or stick to 'No Country for Old Men' as its a stronger and better film."

Ridley Scott respected the storytelling of Mcarthy in such a way I can only assume the screenplay was almost untouched. The movie played like a novel. The character development and especially the dialogue felt like it was ripped from the pages of an unpublished Mcarthy book.\n\nOn a raw level, this film tells the story of a lawyer who embraces greed and decides to take a path which leads him into a world of violence and deception. Masked by a world of glamor and glitter, his vision and decisions are clouded and he is unable to accept what consequences might be in store for him.\n\nTo look deeper into the film it is filled with symbolism. Greed, betrayal, life and death. Death has no meaning. This is a concept Mcarthy incorporated heavily in \"No Country For Old Men\".\n\nI expect this movie to do horribly at the box office. I attended a midnight screening alongside \"Bad Grandpa\". \"Bad Grandpa\" had a full theater. A crowd of mostly men in their early twenties. (I should note that I am also in my early twenties). I was accompanied in my theater with four other people. Two of whom I think I heard walk out. I wanted to clap at the end. Instead the theater was silent as the credits rolled. It's almost a shame. This film is a masterpiece of cinema. Examine it as thus and you will enjoy yourself.\n\nDavidScottFilms.com @DavidScottFilms"

They are very deep conversations and although you probably can follow them partially, after a while they become really difficult to understand. This all adds to the confusion surrounding the plot.\n\nThe two things you will remember from this film are :\n\n1) A very very unusual sex scene (that has nothing to do with the plot really)\n\n2) An extremely grotesque murder towards the end. (I've seen a lot of horror and blood and gore flicks in my time, but this scene had me turning my head away from the screen, it was that bad.)\n\nSo sorry counselor, you had a great cast, but the confusing plot and dialog, the \"over the top\" scenes and at times over-acting, means that this film will probably go down as a major flop."

        "review_detailed_main": "We were told about this ahead of time, that in the Last Days it would become very dangerous. Two of the things that make the days dangerous are that men become lovers of Self and lovers of Money. Selfish and greedy are the kind of people that are on display here. They are experts at their craft, with all of them at the top of their game. Including the writer and director. That is part of what they want us to see. There are no hero's or heroines, only wolves and one queen of the damned. She thinks herself a predator of predators, but she is only full of pride. Two odd events occur because of it, one with a Ferrari the other speaking to a priest. As with Hannibal Lecter, she does these things out of sheer contempt for others.\n\nThe only virtue was murdered in a snuff film and thrown out with the trash. You don't see it, but more than implied; it is clearly understood. If you know what you are looking at. You are in fact expected to. It speaks only the language of those in the know. This is a sharp slick well heeled and highly polished view of the way we are now. At least at the top of the food chain of those that devour each other. How we have become as a people and a society who placed acquiring things above the saving of souls, more than a century ago. You don't have to be a drug dealer to fit in here, just shallow and materialistic. A very west coast ethos is portrayed, especially that of Southern California.\n\nBy the end of the film evil is speaking of its own purity. Which is a flat out lie because the position it is taking is a false position. It does no exist. Its false premise is that of Evil being the equal opposite of Good, which is dualism. Not Christianity. Many who do not perceive the difference between them think the two are the same thing, but they are not. The difference is vast. Lucifer is a fallen archangel who was created good and of his own free will became bad. God is not his opposite, God does not have an opposite. The opposite of Lucifer would be Michael, another archangel. The one who kicked him out of Heaven.\n\nGood and evil are not opposites and they are not equal, not even a little. Evil is a parasite of good. A bank robber, a drug dealer or a murderer are all going after good things. They are just going about getting them the wrong way, that's what is evil. Choosing the wrong way to get what you want. Because there is a right way. Houses and cars and money are all good in themselves. Evil needs good just to exist, good does not need evil at all. Any more than you need some parasite sucking your blood or eating your organs. You would be much better off without them. That's what the next world is about, all of the Good none of the bad.\n\nMoney is not the root of all evil, the Bible does not say that. It says the Love of money is the root of all evil. This film is an excellent portrait of that. It would be a mistake to think this only applies to drug traffickers. This kind of thing is done in business every single day by men and women throughout the entire world, among the rich and the poor. Men are stabbing each other in the back and cutting each others throats by the millions, in normal acceptable business practices. Criminals are just much more straightforward about it. More visceral more immediate, more honest. They are just very very mistaken.\n\nMost convicts don't think they deserve the punishment they got, their only regret is that they were caught. What we keep seeing here is a bunch of people who haven't been punished, living their lives as though there won't be a reckoning. The darkness does not comprehend the Light. It never has. The Judgment will change all that. Nobody you know has ever gotten away with anything, and nobody will. It's not over yet. There are some nuggets of truth here and there, it is as well written as Mamet or Clancy. But it's not the truth that sets you free, that's another fractional misquote from the Bible. It is only the truth you know that sets you free. Let me give you a little. Jesus said\n\n\"This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" John 3:19-21 (NIV)\n\nNobody is getting away with nothing\n\nhttp://fullgrownministry.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/hero-4/"

SPOILER WARNING: Some Semi and Reverse Spoilers follow. That is, I talk about how the people behaved in the movie and some of the things they did NOT do. Also, if you dare to continue, my references start with the most vague and progress to the less vague.\n\nThe ruminating dialog of babble is what you would expect from... people doing drugs. (duh!) And while it is obvious that the dialog is intended to impress us with its intellectual sophistication, its like listening to Mephistopheles talking to Dr. Faustus - a primitive slap in the face when our poor naive protagonist cannot get one syllable of advice from his friends.\n\nAnd the other glaring unbelievable reality is that the drug dealers are not interested in getting their drugs back, but instead killing everyone involved. That is laughably ridiculous since their NUMBER ONE objective would be get the millions of dollars back! Cheap \"press our buttons\" boiler plate to make one squirm in their seat.\n\nSo how \"smart\" was the Tarquin Biscuit Barrel that wrote this? With all the talk of Snuff and Decapitating Machines - I could only hope that Diaz would get hers. But since its clear by this time that the writer was aiming for nausea, there was no chance of that happening.\n\nNOTE: But I do confess if Diaz's sex scene was shot from inside the car, it might have been worth my time. Why let Sharon Stone have all the cred? Ridley Scott, the director of Blade Runner, how could you do this???"

The Counselor's self-inflicted annihilation has all the ingredients of a quintessential Shakespearean tragedy, save its contemporary setting.\n\nFilms have been known to glorify murders as well as the brutal designs the perpetrators employ to manifest the figments of their gory imaginations. The Counselor depicts two such horrific designs, both of which rely on the ingenious use of alloy wire to terminate the victim. The cruelty involved in both these designs transcends imagination. It's heinous. It's insane. And, yet, it's no less glamorous. While the first design results in an instantaneous death, the second makes death look like a grand spectacle, just the kind of material that Peeping Tom would have cherished. As per the first design, an alloy wire, tied at an optimum height between two poles on the opposite sides of the road, is used to decapitate a speeding biker. The second design uses a throttling apparatus called a \"Bolito,\" wherein a loop of alloy wire is slipped over the victim's head, and a small, battery-run motor attached to it, steadily and irreversibly, tightens the loop around the throat until the carotid artery is severed. Speaking of the art of killing, there is a chilling scene in which Westray (Brad Pitt's character) gives a graphic account of a hapless young girl who was slaughtered by one of the drug cartels in order to make a snuff film for a rich client who even went on to rape her headless corpse.\n\nVintage Ridley Scott, McCarthy's cynical world is on full display here, in all its glory. It's essentially a treacherous realm inhabited by shifty, savage beings capable of doing the most depraved deeds. McCarthy's trademark motifs of greed, lust, malice and death are omnipresent. The dialogue is gritty and replete with philosophical and spiritual overtones, a facet which makes it daunting for the viewer to imbibe it completely during the first viewing, thereby making multiple viewings essential. Here, this critic would like to draw your attention to two conversations in particular. The first takes place early in the movie wherein the great Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, playing the part of a Jewish diamond dealer, delivers a haunting lecture in philosophy. The second takes place towards the end of the film during which Rub\u00e9n Blades' character Jefe demystifies the true meaning of life and death for the Counselor. Barring these two exchanges the movie has several interesting interactions that the Counselor has with Reiner (Javier Bardem's character) and Westray. The Counselor serves to be a highlight-reel of some of the most graphic and gory scenes every filmed in cinema. And, while these disturbing sequences may enthrall a serious film-goer or a lover of the crime thriller genre, they are bound to repulse the uninitiated lot. Perhaps, it's one of the reasons why the movie failed to impress at the box office. Then, there's the movie's ending that may not seem satisfactory to everyone. But, despite its serious nature, the material is not devoid of humor and sex\u2014a great respite for the casual viewers who are liable to get restless when exposed to a relatively heavy dose of material.\n\nOverall, The Counselor comes across as a multifaceted work of cinema that underlines what a team of a seasoned director and a gifted writer is capable of delivering and yet so rarely delivers. A star studded ensemble cast, for once, doesn't end up overshadowing the movie's narrative and, if anything, it only strengthens it. Michael Fassbender, who plays the titular role, delivers yet another gutsy performance during which he goes through a gamut of emotions, once again demonstrating his remarkable acting range. Cameron Diaz is an absolute delight to watch as the quintessential mobster's moll. As Malkina, she is the epitome of feminine villainy and charm. To watch the coldblooded Malkina go about her business is to witness a bloodthirsty predator playing with its helpless prey. Diaz delivers the definitive performance of her career; it's indeed sad that despite giving such a thorough performance she has gone completely unnoticed at this year's major award functions. Javier Bardem, never the one to disappoint, looks exquisite in the role of a sybaritic drug kingpin. Pen\u00e9lope Cruz looks steaming hot as the Counselor's love interest, Laura, especially in the opening bedroom scene she shares with Fassbender. Brad Pitt gets limited screen time but steals every scene that he is a part of. The final scene featuring Westray with a Bolito around his neck is truly unforgettable. The Counselor's explicit gory content makes it a difficult film to watch. The movie requires patience and an intelligent viewer will savor it for a long time to come. Just make sure that you go for the 138 minute long extended cut. A must watch!\n\nA more detailed review can be read at:\n\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

At the very end of the movie you find yourself waiting for more because it couldn't possibly end that way????? I'm extremely sick of stories without adequate conclusion and it seems as if only the \"artsy\" people find them interesting which is far from the average person.

Well, I admire Ridley Scott and I think that he has put his name as a director, but actually someone else did the directing. I can't accept that this is a Ridley Scott's movie, I feel deceived."

I gave it the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe I just wasn't ready for it; or maybe I was expecting too much from it. Fast forward to 2022, almost 10 years later, and I found myself with an opportunity to watch it again (coincidentally, after having a weird urge to watch it after some random memory of it.) thanks to HBO max.\n\nSo, round 2, 10 years, I'm sitting here and it's not as bad as I felt it was back then...but...I still hate it.\n\nThe dialogue was worse than I remembered; like, who talks like this? It sounds like a cheesy novel reads. (The beginning scene is a perfect example...who says that stuff??) They acted the heck out of this movie though, so you know they believed in it and probably really felt like they were doing something special, but it was almost a waste of talent. This storyline with a more believable dialogue, would've been almost great though.\n\nAnd Cameron Diaz's character is wonderfully wicked, aside from that windshield scene.\n\nAnd as much as I wanted to love Fassbender in this, his fake American accent with this dialogue just didn't win. It felt too fake and forced and his character suffered because of it. He's so much better than this.\n\nA plus is having Javier and Cruz in a movie together though. Love them, even in a movie like this. (Javier's character was an eye roll as well, though. But not as bad as Brad Pitt trying to be \"Mr. Cowboy cool\". Sighs on both) And loved seeing Rosie Perez...even if briefly. She played her part well.\n\nI really wanted to like this movie...even after a decade, some growth, and with a different perspective and mindset, the same flaws from the initial watch stand, and even feel more ridiculous at times. But...on a positive note...the story they were trying to tell *was* intriguing."

        "review_detailed_main": "My wife and I decided to see this movie since nothing else in the theater looked good. Other than a brief synopsis on the movie theater website, I didn't know anything about this movie. But it looked intriguing with a great cast.\n\nLooks can be deceiving, and that was certainly the case here. What looked like it should be a good movie turned out to be a confusing film that goes everywhere, yet nowhere. All the dialog between characters was filled with language which apparently was supposed to be deeply profound and philosophical, but came off as either confusing or silly. People just don't talk like that in real life.\n\nThe other problem with the movie was the fact that very little is explained. We don't know why the Counselor (couldn't they give the main character a name?) wants to get involved in a drug deal, especially since he's rich enough to drive a sports car and fly off to Amsterdam to buy a 3.8 carat diamond for his girlfriend's wedding ring, but it's revealed later (as much as anything in this movie is revealed) that he got into the deal for money. Of course, we are not told what his involvement in the deal is, nor anyone else's.\n\nIn the middle of all this heavy dialog between characters, we're shown scenes of a truck full of drugs coming into the country. A truck which gets stolen and therefore the drug cartel thinks the Counselor and everyone he knows is responsible. So therefore the movie turns into an effort for each of the main characters to survive, yet all but one seem unconcerned that they might be killed by the cartel members.\n\nThis is just where the movie starts to get interesting, yet there are so many continuity errors and plot holes that the movie which was confusing before just becomes silly. Are we really to believe that Westray, who said that he could disappear and not be found, would be tracked to London and then hook up with a beautiful woman from New Mexico (when all the previous action took place around El Paso) and would allow her to steal the password to his computer? I knew she was a plant when he met her at the hotel desk. Are we to believe that instead of driving around with a couple of bodyguards when a drug cartel is after him, a drug dealer is just going to drive around alone with a gun in the glove box? Are we also to believe that the Counselor, after throwing his cell phone away so he wouldn't be tracked, would apparently just run down to the Verizon shop and get another phone? Are we also to believe that instead of going into hiding, he goes down to Juarez to talk to (I'm guessing, that character is never explained) a drug kingpin who instead of just telling him that he's screwed, goes into some pseudo-intellectual philosophical soliloquy? And after talking to this guy, instead of leaving and going into hiding somewhere he just walks around the streets and falls asleep in a restaurant? Are we to believe that Cameron Diaz's character is from Barbados? Why do we even need to keep following the subplot about the truck after the drug cartel goes after the main characters? It's like that part was kept in to fill time and provide some more gruesome on screen bloodshed. And Brad Pitt's character wasn't even really needed in the movie.\n\nAfter seeing this movie I understand that a well-known novelist decided to write a movie script, and this movie is the result. That explains the improbable, convoluted dialog between characters, so much missing from the plot, and why character development was lacking. Best to leave novels to the novelists and leave screenplays to the movie writers.\n\nThe movie wasn't totally bad, since there were a couple of scenes of people getting killed in interesting ways and a funny sex scene involving a woman and a car windshield. But the confusing plot, lack of development, and ponderous dialog make this movie hard to watch. And the ending is a total letdown. This is a movie I don't really care to see again."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Counselor\" is a flamboyant exhibition of attitude and style coupled with sociopathic behavior, and it becomes readily apparent that its style doesn't mesh with its content. Despite being ultra-violent and bleak, the movie's dialogue is brimming with long-winded philosophical conversations that will alienate as many viewers as it pleases. \"The Counselor\" suggests that humanity at large is too self-centered and broken to overcome the solitude of our existence, while it simply throws up obvious signposts of symbolism for what lies ahead. Working as a screenwriter for the first time after years of seeing his novels successfully adapted to the big-screen --\"No Country for Old Men\" (2007) and \"The Road\" (2009) -- Cormac McCarthy is stretching his powers of language, his razor-thin storyline, and the cast of characters way too far.\n\nSet along the Texas/Mexico border, the counselor (Michael Fassbender) is an El Paso lawyer who decides to finance a major drug deal through one of his clients, nightclub owner Reiner (Javier Bardem). There is no back story for the counselor, except that he's in love with a sexy woman named Laura (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), and he has undefined money troubles. It's the usual routine for a lifelong law-abiding lawyer gone bad: one major drug heist and I'm out. His clients who are now turned partners, Reiner and Westray (Brad Pitt), orchestrate the cartel delivery from Mexico to Chicago. They also make clear to the counselor that Mexican drug cartels don't mess around, in case anyone wasn't aware. Naturally, the deal goes bad due to a coincidence, and the counselor scrambles to make things right, only to face the severity of his one bad decision. The movie quickly identifies the person pulling all the strings, Reiner's scheming, cheetah-obsessed mistress Malkina (Cameron Diaz). There's nothing left to do now but wade through the numerous decapitations, shootings, and sexual perversity.\n\nThe movie revels in painting the bizarre, outlandish behavior of its wide-ranging cast of characters. There are an endless array of enigmatic conversations along with the constant inclusion of supporting characters and distracting cameos that are never fleshed out to satisfaction. The bulk of the film consists of wordy meetings where characters interact using dense philosophical dialogue about the nature of their actions and greed, crimes and punishment, all while suggesting that the counselor will be the one to eventually take the fall. A major issue with the movie is that the thin plot is obviously predetermined, and there is little point in seeing it through to the end. Both the counselor and his girlfriend are so bleakly fated from frame one they might as well have \"victims\" tattooed on their forehead.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott seems so infatuated with the script written by McCarthy that the pace of this sketchy story is in complete shambles. Cormac McCarthy suffers in his first cinema-born effort of trying to insist on his themes too insistently through only the dialogue. Here, characters deliver lines like \"The truth has no temperature\" and \"grief transcends value\" -- and when spoken by people, the words ring hollow and overly theatrical. \"The Counselor\" must have looked great on paper, but it doesn't translate well on the big screen. Except for an unforgettable scene with Cameron Diaz who gets off on the windshield of Reiner's convertible, we can only wonder what could have been."

Despite a bevy of talent in director Scott, screenwriter Cormac McCarthy, and a skilled cast, this is a confusing, self-important, supremely boring and hilariously ill-executed bummer.\n\nIt follows a group of bad people doing bad things. They live extravagantly and decadently, but it's never really explained how they got to this point\u0085.in fact, nothing in the plot is ever made clear. Instead, Scott and McCarthy spend all their time making sure we understand the childish philosophies of the characters through awkward, clunky dialogue. For a story centered on people trying to stay safe, there's no real sense of urgency. Instead, it lingers on these poorly written characters delivering hackneyed ideological dialogue. It's fine to have a conversation driven film, but the dialogue, characters, and/or mood must be more interesting or engaging .\n\nThe few high points here are the cool weaponry, gorgeous landscapes and action scenes, and a doing-his-damnedest performance by Fassbender. Sadly, these get lost in the lifeless, bloated rubble, leaving moviegoers unwantedly asking themselves, \"What exactly is going on here?\""

There were silly errors such as one decapitation showing one blood what so ever and the next the blood was spurting everywhere. This is a very poor mistake from such experienced producers and directors. I can't really say much more, except I wish I hadn't bothered watching this trash."

The action didn't really show up. Similarly I thought in Brad Pitt's \"Killing Them Softly\". Dean Norris (Hank) from \"Breaking Bad\" was in one scene!

        "review_detailed_main": "Actors and production values are of really good quality, you get to see memorable scenes and some good acting as well - but all in all, this movie is less than bland: it drains.\n\nThe script about a drug deal gone wrong, a greedy lawyers ruining his otherwise perfect life - that could've been an excellent thriller. But this movie doesn't thrill. It has extreme graphic violence, intense and intimate sex scenes, car chases, well planned and executed murder, luxurious settings - but it doesn't thrill.\n\nIt has good and highly paid actors, an excellent director - but the characters don't come to life, they feel like cardboard cutouts.\n\nThere is one big fault this movie has, and that's its script. Wordy monologues (and it has half a dozen) don't make a movie bad or boring, if they fit in well. The monologues here don't. Gangsters with philosophical musings can be funny, entertaining, tragic or sometimes even believable - here, it doesn't fit. (The list goes on, I better stop.)\n\nNow, Cormac McCarthy is know to be an excellent author, at age of 80 still writing stories that win awards. Some of his books have been made into great films - after professional scriptwriters adapted them into movie scripts. This is the first script he wrote himself, and maybe he tries to learn scriptwriting now; but I'm afraid it will be a long way. Todays funny-zombie-movies or run-of-the-mill action flicks have better dramaturgy and dialogue than the script of The Counselor. There are different rules for what makes a book work, and what makes a movie work.\n\nAvoid this movie, and watch \"No Country for Old Men\" instead. It's based on a Cormac McCarthy novel, the Coen brothers adapted it, and it turned out excellent. \"The Counselor\" - did not.\n\nPS: The Counselor in this movie receives counsel from about everybody, from inmates to Mexican barkeepers, but himself never gives counsel. Was that intended as a joke? Didn't make me laugh."

This resource resulted in some nice moments but it mostly made the characters too caricaturesque and contributed to the lack of clarity.\n\nMy biggest disappointment is the fact that I have great admiration for all of the main actors and the director.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counselor is a film that trades in coherent storytelling for metaphoric dialog that ultimately amounts to nothing special. While having metaphoric dialog is not a bad thing, having the most direct line in the film be \"these guys are the cartel\" is. The Counselor will have you rewinding every ten minutes just to understand it, which is rather frustrating considering there is a really great film underneath the glossy dialog and Cameron Diaz. Unfortunately for us, this great film that I believe exists never sees the light of day. Instead, the film transitions from one scene to the next without giving rhyme or reason as to what the characters are doing. We, as the audience, are left befuddled by the end of it's 2 hour running time, walking away with a film to decipher instead of a film we could enjoy. Now, there is nothing wrong with a film that makes you think but in a film such as this, thinking is what we should be doing WHILE the film is progressing. And this film is about as progressive as the Great Recession of 2008. The players here turn in great performances, Fassbender is thoroughly watchable while Bardem gives a careful performance as a simple middleman hoping for a score. The rest of the cast falls into normalcy, Cruz gives a good performance but her character is extremely undercooked. Diaz is a weak link in a film filled with Oscar winners and nominees, despite looking seductive, her performance is greatly overshadowed by a really poor accent that goes from being Argentinian to sounding like an American desperately trying hard at a Spanish accent. In any regards, it is complete trash. Brad Pitt portrays Westrey, a sneaky and conniving businessman, very well and turns in a good performance but it never really stands out as great. While there is a lot wrong with this film, there are a couple truly unnerving scenes that keep the film from being a complete bore. A sequence involving a car chase towards the end is specifically intense but never capitalizes on the suspense it spent two minutes building. Instead it ends rather abrupt without any payoff.\n\nRidley Scott directs his actors and the scenes well, but what this film suffers with is proper transitions into scenes and cryptic dialog that gets entirely too ridiculous by the end of it all. This is more of a rental than anything if you're a fan if Cormac McCarthy, but this is a film trying to be far too intelligent for it's own good and instead comes off cheap and wasteful."

Even the soundtrack added to the excitement.\n\nI don't mention Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt due to the fact they are not great and to be honest they suck a lot of intensity out the film with their drab acting. And it is their lackluster performance which contribute to the films downward spiral. Yes, it is apparent that instead of spelling it out for you, it instead opts for cryptic like conversations and every scene is a piece to the puzzle, but it isn't exactly cluedo like. I knew (as i'm sure everyone did) exactly who was the mastermind. Maybe it was meant to be obvious, but the film had this mysterious aura about it throughout, so when the culmination comes you are left thinking....well i already knew that. There is no payoff. And normally i don't mind a film that just takes a scenario and gives you a realistic outcome, but with this is just seemed flat. And as i said before a lot of that flatness is to do with Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt. They are so past it, in terms of passion. They both comes across very unnatural, and in a film like this they need to be more convincing.\n\nThe dialogue is great to listen to and Javier Bardem and Fassbender where great but the meaningful(yet meaningless) conversations and their efforts unfortunately can't save this film from being a failure."

The plot has three stages: in stage one we're introduced to the main characters - Javier Bardem oversharing details of his sex life and spouting a lot of pseudo-philosophical nonsense about women; Cameron Diaz posing and making duck face; Fassbender as a lawyer who may or may not be straitlaced (its impossible to tell at this point whether he's a nice guy or just pretending to be a nice guy) who wants to join the drug trade; Brad Pitt the seemingly third leg of the drug dealing trio.\n\nEveryone lectures Fassbender about life, fate, greed, often making little sense and getting lost in non sequitors.\n\nIn stage 2 we see some kind of drug deal unfolding which is then hijacked by (I guess) a different cartel. Since we don't know what the plan was to begin with, its hard to judge whether the events we're shown are important or not, and who the different criminals are supposed to be working for. But I gather a drug shipment goes missing and somehow Fassbender - despite having entered the drug trade for the first time only 2 days prior, and knowing basically nobody and nothing about nothing - is blamed. The trio (Fassbender, Bardem, Pitt) are marked for death bc that will definitely bring the drugs back, I guess.\n\nStage 3 has Fassbender on the run; Bardem and Pitt too. Somehow Diaz is involved but how is never really explained. We just know she's a criminal mastermind because she is rude to people on the phone. Ultimately \"fate\" catches up with everyone and there's a \"7even\" type ending for Fassbender.\n\nPoor Fassbender acts his heart out at the end and its a real pity he had to do such grueling work for such a piece of garbage film. John Leguizamo would have been a much better choice than Bardem as Fassbender's flashy, unstable, lovelorn drug dealer business partner. Instead Leguizamo is used as an extra in one scene, while Bardem is utterly unconvincing as someone with enough energy and intelligence to run his multiple \"businesses.\"\n\nThe nonsensical lectures continue to the very end of the film, wasting everyone's time. People say things that are flat out wrong as though they are timeless truths (example: a priest agrees that every woman who goes to confession talks about sex. Lol). It hovers on the edge of camp but ultimately it is too slow moving to be so-bad-its-fun.\n\nAvoid at all costs."

It kills to survive, like animal predators, and is very good at it. When Ridley Scott makes films without an Alien monster the people in it are also predators but they are also much worse. Unlike animals or Aliens they torture each other both physically and mentally and are gleeful about it. This is excruciatingly difficult to watch for us fairly well adjusted folks. But not for Ridley Scott, who, in all his movies loves to watch people suffer.\n\nAlso, more disturbing for me, is Ridley Scott's attitude toward women. Other than Sigorney Weaver in the first Alien no woman character in his films is anything other than a paper cutout, either a sex goddess, a evil greedy wife, a overly subservient wife, or any other stereotype that he can populate the set with. Because the women in Scott's films are only there to entertain the male viewers including Scott himself. And they must know their place. Either to be desired or hated or both. Ridley Scott makes films for men. Men only. Even Weaver had to do the final scenes in Alien in her underwear.\n\nAs to this trainwreck of a film, the plot, implausible and preposterous, does not matter. Only that the men are as stylishly evil and grotesque as possible.\n\nWhy bother to make a film like this? A massive amount of money was spent on it with big name actors but why? What is the purpose? I guess the same purpose people have slowing down as they pass a fatal car wreck.\n\nRidley Scott has gotten a lot of kudos as a film maker. But does he deserve it? I think not. No film he has made has inspired any one, including a Biblically wrong film about Moses.\n\nOne other thing. What was Brad Pitt doing in this mess? Pitt is an example of a wasted talent if there ever was one. Taking parts where he will look good rather than act. Other than Moneyball and a film about Jesse James no one saw Pitt has not lived up to his potential. And he's not getting any younger."

My brother ended up leaving in one of the first scenes (a sex scene) and I left shortly after that. I thought that the idea was STUPID! This movie is awful and not recommended for someone under the age of 25+ because of drug smuggling, a lot of strong sexual content, violent images, and strong language. MY parents absolutely HATED it, we spent $35 on it (we bought i tin Blu-ray) they want to give it away."

Making me smile persistently though, Michael Fassbender coolly wanders through the film looking askance at all the stereotypes around him. Alas, one particularly ghastly scene involving one character in the film does not justify a generally uninteresting movie. One feels this is a vanity project for Ridley Scott - much as 'Savages' (2012) was recently for Oliver Stone. A similar sort of waste of time from an old master director."

Even the few clever lines are said without intonation and with a kind of hum- drum droning sound which is really disappointing from actors of A-list caliber. The characters are under-developed and hard to care about. The women are just there for sex. The plot is lost in boring dialogue that loses the point of why the viewer should care. Argh!

        "review_title": "HK Auteur film review - The Counselor",
        "review_detailed_main": "To give the simplest summary of the latest film from Ridley Scott and first-time screenwriter Cormac McCarthy, the Counselor (Michael Fassbender), deeply in love with his fianc\u00e9e Laura (Penelope Cruz), tries to make a quick score in a one-time drug deal with Reiner (Javier Bardem), his girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) and middleman Westray (Brad Pitt). The deal backfires, and now The Counselor is wrongfully targeted by a Mexican drug cartel. So Cormac McCarthy, Ridley Scott, Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz in a monumental cinematic failure, what happened?\n\nLet's be clear. The true author of The Counselor is Cormac McCarthy, not Ridley Scott. The artistic choices that McCarthy is attempting with the script are evident. He seems to have a disdain for exposition, as most of the scenes start and end before the typical story movements in a plot. What remains are these existential conversations that occur after a lot of the action has taken place.\n\nMcCarthy thinks that by removing story explanation, the film's themes and ideas will float to the surface. The dialogue just drones on and on and on non-stop, having the viewer scratching their heads trying to keep up with it. As a result, there is no time to absorb the themes and ideas that McCarthy is trying to communicate. Audiences can tune to a different syntax (i.e. Yoda or Nadsat from A Clockwork Orange) and absorb heavy themes, but it is hard to do both at the same time.\n\nMichael Fassbender carries the film sufficiently on his shoulder by adding as much believability as possible and together with Penelope Cruz make a good solid emotional anchor with their love story. Javier Bardem does his trademark brand of 'psychotic hair acting', fashioning a spiky hairstyle that looks like he is forcibly pulling out his hair with hair gel. Brad Pitt's character just seems like an odd combination of character quirks that comes off more shallow. It is hard to buy Bardem and Pitt's characters because gangsters would never philosophize and advise their underlings like old wise sages.\n\nCameron Diaz is the odd one out and it is hard to judge her performance. It took me a while to realize that Malkina character was from Barbados, and apparently she put on an accent for it, but it was undetectable. The role is something we never seen from Diaz before and it is a wild explosive left-field character. I just don't know what to make of it. Every actor is delivering on what is written, but it's hard to judge if it's good or bad acting because the performances do not add up to the sum of its parts. The actors are not to be blamed.\n\nThe final conclusion I can draw is that director Ridley Scott and the cast believed that Cormac McCarthy has written something great and have proceeded to honor it by acting it out unedited as if it was Shakespeare. Had they been more critical about the screenplay and its mechanics, something more profound definitely could have been made. From what McCarthy is trying to say with these themes, he would have done better by just writing a philosophy paper about greed and corruption. As a bleak morality tale, it is not at all compelling.\n\nThe Counselor is not a film I would recommend people to see for leisure, but anybody with an interest in screen writing should give it a watch to study the forensics and learn what not to do, even if you are a critically acclaimed novelist."

It was so incongruous that I went to check if I'd left the tv on in another room. What on earth was Ridley Scott thinking? Let's, take some of the finest actors in Hollywood, give Cameron Diaz an opportunity to break with Hollywood typecasting and be the ruthless villain (think successful movies like something about Mary, bad teacher, Annie) and throw in Penelope Cruz as the sweet, nauseatingly innocent love interest (think successful movies like blow, Vicky Cristina, bandidos). Fassbender...who has smouldered and simmered in the likes of hamlet, the light between oceans and shame was completely miscast. His character was completely dislikable and as dull as dishwater and couldn't muster up a smattering of sexual chemistry with Cruz, so awkward it was toe curling and please don't get me started on Brad's Stetson or Xavier's ludicrous haircut and wardrobe.\n\nThis could have been a great movie but was a train wreck.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Counselor\" was misguided in so many different ways that it needed some major counseling in effective filmmaking, very pronto!!! Director Ridley Scott, who by great scott is a legendary film auteur, should have canceled his \"counseling\" plans in helming this picture; this just might be the worst directorial effort in Scott's career. Ridley, believe it or not, but it's true. This atrocious movie stars Michael Fassbender as a (yea, you guessed it) a counselor lawyer who gets involved with some shady dealings involving luxurious diamonds, a Mexican cartel, and a nasty-looking murdering instrument. It's so ridiculous how everyone called our leading protagonist Counselor and not by his real name; It did not add any mystery to the character just some bad old formulaic tactic. The movie co-stars Javier Bardem as Reiner, a conniving businessman whose electric-follicle look reminds me of Young Einstein's cerebrally-challenged uncle. Cameron Diaz also gets into the counseling scene with her role as Malkina; Reiner's lady-friend who might or might not have some bad teaching up her sleeve to the counselor and many others. Penelope Cruz, Bardem's real life wife, also pops in here as the Counselor's girlfriend Laura. Brad Pitt, yes that Brad Pitt, is in the supporting plan also playing Westray, a west-end urban cowboy who ends up in one of the most outlandish gruesome gore scenes I have seen in a movie, and I mean that in a \"pitiful\" way; sorry Brad. Yes, these are all well-acclaimed actors who have shown their thespian worth, but not here. However, to give them the benefit of the doubt, they were all entrapped with a profoundly silly screenplay by Cormac McCarthy. Yes, that same McCarthy that wrote the great book \"No Country for Old Men\". Unfortunately, McCarthy's scribe of \"The Counselor\" was not meant to entertain any old or young men; and of course women. It has to be the worst screenplay of the year! Yes, I said it! Are you gonna excuse me now of McCarthyism!!! I am still trying to figure out what \"The Counselor\" was all about, not because it was a cerebral challenge but because it was cinematic bore. So my good counseling \"movie tip of the day\" is to not seek counseling from Ridley Scott's \"The Counselor\". ** Needs Improvement"

This is a Christian movie about choice and consequences in a fallen world - sad to see, that the decadence of our time has left the viewers disconnected to the wisdom of the gospel and the spirit on witch the west was build. The Counsellor is at the end a movie about the downfall of the west, by greed, decadence - and open home being ravished by the evil that men do. \"What good is wisdom, if it brings no wisdom to the wise\" - I believe is said to Mickey Rourke by Robert de Niro's Louis Cifer in the old masterpiece \"Angle Heart\" - that movie about the loss of ones soul is being quoted by Pitt in the bar-scene. Excellent movie this is. Overlooked and misunderstood."

Directing McCarthy's first original screenplay is Ridley Scott who, with a cast that includes Brad Pitt, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz and Michael Fassbender, should have all the ingredients of something very special. But this is quite a muddle of a film, and one that must have lost something considerable in the translation from page to screen. Set in New Mexico, the aloof plot of The Counsellor concerns a drug deal gone wrong and the consequences of the actions which led to that. There's few what's, why's or wherefores, with little exposition as we're introduced to a world of shady characters who surround Michael Fassbender's counsellor. Those include Javier Bardem's ostentatious gangster, his predatory moll, played by Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt as an underworld trader/dealer of sorts. Nothing here is actually made clear, including the reason any character does just about anything in the film. Which is by design, of course, especially with this leaning more towards character study than narrative. But with no hook and nothing to hang on to, The Counsellor becomes an increasingly protracted and pointless film. And it's not as though the direction is poor or that the performances are bad, simply that the themes of the film undermines the entire movie. Whilst, some truly risible dialogue and glaring plot-points only serve to hammer home an exercise in the banal. File this under \"could do better!\""

It's extremely heavy on dialogue, sparse on action, very stationary and would have served better as a novel. It doesn't take advantage of the visual side of movies at all, a baffling failure on Scott's part, and tries to cram too much into its running time. This ends up meaning that none of the characters have clearly established motives, we don't identify with any of them and in the end we don't care what happens to them. They do talk a lot and some of those conversations are rather unique and interesting. And yet, there is a way to have a lot of dialogues in your movies without it seeming this tedious. Just look at Quentin Tarantino.\n\nAll that being said, I cannot call it a bad film. The script isn't well-suited for film, but the story itself has merits. It's suitably dark and grizzly, doesn't pull its punches and even manages to surprise you every now and then. Plus, the cast is unbelievable. Michael Fassbender, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Brad Pitt. This is what we call an ensemble cast and they're all utilized extremely well. Bardem's character is easily the most memorable, but they all give great performances.\n\nIn the end this leaves us with a conundrum. Can a film be called any good if it isn't structured like a film? Do we have here a film or a visualized novel? Does it matter? Personally I think it comes down to a matter of taste. If you can deal with dialogues only, then this is an excellent dark thriller. But if you believe a film should be more than mouths flapping on screen, then this one might leave you a bit cold."

At the end of the movie I still had no idea what had happened and why. Not because it was a complicated storyline.

        "review_detailed_main": "The marketing should be blamed here. For misleading poster which is just indifferent, and those typical thriller-like trailers. That kind of promotion does not deliver a single message about the real tone of that movie, about it's theme. Instead, my thoughts were guided into realm already well established in my head - thriller/action/tension expectations.\n\nBut 'The Counselor' is not a thriller in the way we are accustomed to. It's rather an allegory dressed up as a thriller. But firstly I was also disappointed - the lack of action and the bizarre, hard to follow plot made me regret the screening. I hated the movie. I felt my evening was lost by this nonsense, absurd, chaotic hoax with no thriller-like vibe at all.\n\nBut somehow I couldn't forget about this movie. Why? If it is so bad, why do I recall some scenes, mood, individual shots, dialogues? Why I'm still 'held' by this film, even so long after the premiere?\n\nAnd I think I got it. That's why I decided to write the review.\n\nThat movie speaks kind of its own language. You have to be prepared to focus on characters, their stories, their vibe and the heat slowly rising without apparent reason. The plot is almost irrelevant - the 'thrills' come from observing complexity of human behaviours instead. The dirty money/cartels context is just an excuse, just a McGuffin, just a vessel for the tension coming out from character's choices and hearts. You can just feel those circumstances surrounding characters, not understand them perfectly and that's enough to be able to tell yourself who are you observing right now - the Thief, the Wise Man, the Pure Beauty, the Devil, the Jester. All of those almost mythological characters are drowning in the big pool of evil and greed. Their choices vary - from adding the dark water to the pool by mistake or deliberately, desperately pouring it out, just having fun in it, or panicking, etc.\n\nThat movie is great not in genre-specific categories. It is great because of using those well known formulas to tell not a story, but rather ...a truth. The story gives you, the viewer only a chance to observe. Of course, you can tell that about almost all of the movies out there. But this one is a bit different - it changes the balance in favor of the observation of characters' attitudes, leaving the story in the role of very shady, but not particularly important context of pond of evil. You can observe how people react to this evil. How evil is born, and raised in them, how it is avoided or how it can't, how it's used for cruel hedonistic fun or to fuel the ego, how you can treat it strictly as a work environment. You can feel 's philosophical and a bit theatrical approach - dialogues are written boldly in rich, sophisticated language, mysterious tone and with elegant rhythm. And the director and actors seem to exactly know why. I feel they trusted the script and are somehow humble before it. Cormac McCarthy therefore seems to direct this movie from the back seat. And I like it.\n\nI highly recommend this title to all of you who seek something different and mature, told with style and respect for subtle nuances of human soul. It's hard to forget this lesson."

In so many ways the film wants to be a success. Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt both act their parts trying to give the film character and color, but in the end, the film plays as an uninteresting, sex crazed, overly polished and stylized, garbage bin for ideas and perceptions of human conflict. No connection can be found to any of these people. This film is what drug smuggling and cartels would be like if Hollywood ran them. Great haircuts. Too many explanations for why violent things are happening. Lack of drama because they are trying to be dramatic. I hated this movie not for the fact that it was unoriginal and it covered no new ground in terms of material, I hated it because it did so blatantly with obvious disregard for pace and artistic texture. Sound, cinematography, editing, all these things should have been better. Awful."

The nitro charged story and uber-chic characters, bring accessibility to this gruesome tale of a drug deal gone bad, although this movie is not for the fainthearted. I had visceral reactions to some scenes. The Counselor, played by Michael Fassbender, ironically, is the one needing advice after he becomes the prey of an relenting pursuer, scheming to intervene in a one-time drug deal he has set in motion. This deal, set up through Badem's and Pitt's characters, sees the Counselor's life spiraling out of control to a heart-rending climax.\n\nThe Counselor's choice to enter into a world where he is unable to negotiate the brutal new rules, causes a devastating ripple effect through so many lives, even he is unaware of, until they are revealed. Westray: \"It's not that you're going down Counselor.. it's what's going down with you\"\n\nThe production must have been a stylist dream. Check-out some of the jaw dropping outfits hanging off Cameron Diaz and Badem's character.\n\nHairstyles and fashion aside, this story demands we understand that our individual choices do affect others, that the world is connected with fine filaments, invisible to the human psyche. Choices we make every day, can affect others in ways we can't predict.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will become an iconic fable, representing the morality of the choices we make . The way the story is crafted, the dialogue, and the stylistic way the story has been told will last the test of time.\n\nThe beauty of The Counselor is that, it's not until you step away from the film do you see the \"big\" picture."

Can make you look at the film under a different \"angle,\" you start to peer at the film, search, then what is invested in it. Although the film looks slightly in what is not finished, it probably happened because of the tragedy in the family of Ridley Scott. This does not cancel out the pros of the picture. If we consider the film as a thriller, then it is necessary to evaluate very relevant musical inserts, forcing the atmosphere \"the atmosphere of the approaching train\", the excellent game of Javier Bardem and not the bad game of other actors. I regard this film as social in which my attention was drawn to the problem of the value of life in the countries in which people are forced to survive, due to the connivance of the government, and these countries are exploited by the governments of the more developed states, ultimately militants and criminals from less developed countries become a problem Countries \"exploiters\".\n\nIn the scene of choosing a stone, the adviser is told about finding faults in the stones, which is the essence of the jewelry business, and about the desire to come into contact with the fate of the stone of the person who chose it.

The adviser and his lover are the only living in the center of a monolithic stone system. Do not make a counselor a good deed for your client, thereby creating a flaw in a non-clean deal, things could have been different, but there would be an outcome to others. This question leaves an open conversation at the end of the adviser's film with the head of the cartel, and an illustration of a corpse in a barrel sent Together with drugs. After all, criminals living in the country on the brink of survival, where the government has drug cartels and corruption is flourishing, where they shoot and then look at whom they shot, they think quite differently ..."

Why did he agree to get involved in this drug deal? The movie told us almost nothing about this, either before or after he agreed to do it. It had to do with money, and that's about all we know. Attorneys are famously cautious. When and why exactly did this one stop being cautious? No clue. For that matter, why and how did he end up being appointed to defend Rosie Perez's character? He definitely didn't seem to have the demeanor of a criminal defense lawyer, so that one needed a little explanation.\n\nIn summary, it seems like this would've done better as a three-part six- hour miniseries. That would've allowed for more backstory and character development."

The acclaimed director did his best with what he had to work with. A vague plot and completely unnecessarily lengthy and puzzling dialogue. A dialogue so lengthy Tarantino would be proud of, or in this case, not proud of, since Tarintino's dialogue has the ability to grip you.

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometime before I saw it, I read a scathing review of \"The Counselor.\" The critic thought the movie inept, and particularly disliked Cameron Diaz's car love scene, stating that Ridley Scott had lost his filmmaking touch. Now that I have seen the movie, I think he had a point.\n\nThe story concerns a lawyer - a counselor - played by Michael Fassbinder who gets involved in a serious drug deal with help from his business partner, Reiner (Javier Bardem), and another associate, Westray (Brad Pitt). Cameron Diaz plays Reiner's scheming girlfriend Malkina, and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz plays the counselor's girlfriend, Laura, the only innocent person in the story.\n\nHollywood loves movies about drug dealers, in fact, movies featuring drug cartels have replaced movies about the mafia - when was the last time you saw a movie featuring the mafia? Anyway, along the way, Mexican drug cartels become involved with dire consequences for the counselor. From that point on it's all about everyone getting their just desserts - or nearly everyone.\n\nIn dealing out such a succession of punishments, Ridley puts the viewer in the position of the crowds that attended public hangings at Newgate Prison or those that watched heads roll off the guillotine during the French Revolution. And speaking of heads rolling, doesn't Ridley love a decapitation? This is becoming a trademark if \"The Counselor\" and \"Prometheus\" are anything to go by.\n\nAlthough much of what happens is hard to follow, a couple of sequences in the film are actually exciting. I was beginning to wonder what annoyed that critic so much, but then the movie meandered on without much change of tone - except for Cameron's 'sc\u00e8ne d'amour d'auto'. The film also finishes with a particularly blah ending. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it - Ridley has already taken care of that.\n\nEven movies as heavy as this need a lighter touch here and there, and maybe a little wit. However, one thing I've noticed about Ridley's movies is that he doesn't do light and he doesn't do funny. The truth is that he handles sombre historical epics and science fiction opuses better than he does urban thrillers and dramas. \"Matchstick Men\" worked, but it was such a good idea (from a novel), that it would have been hard to screw it up.\n\nAs for Cameron Diaz having sex with the car? It's a bit like the shower scene in Psycho, you don't really see much, and it's only Bardem's narration that fills in the details. I don't think it is as ridiculous as some critics suggest, but it is tasteless. I wouldn't have felt comfortable if I was on a first date when that unfolded on the screen.\n\n\"The Counselor\" is a downer. I am amazed that concerns weren't raised that could have changed its course before it hit the screen. I think we get a little snarly about movies that bomb when we have such high expectations of the filmmakers. In all honesty, unlike \"Prometheus\", which also seemed to disappoint the fans, \"The Counselor\" is so irrelevant and forgettable that it may not stain Ridley Scott's reputation too much at all."

There was a sense of intensity throughout the movie which kept me interested for a while, but once the characters started the useless speeches about nothing, I totally wanted to switch it off. Ridley Scott really wasted a great cast, who are not to blame for the film because there performances wasn't to bad. It's really the concept that was disappointing and in some ways, boring. It's a shame, because I did have high hopes for the film after seeing the cast and the fact that Ridley Scott was directing it, but I was totally let down. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up: Brad Pitt really hasn't made anything that amazing recently, which is a shame because the guy can act, but his bad choice of movies are becoming a bit of a habit. I did like his little cameo in 12 Years A Slave, which also starred Fassbender, but he hasn't headlined a blockbuster which has blown up the box office. As for Fassbender, well he is on fire at the moment. With the new X-Men coming out in the cinema and the weird Frank, which does look funny, I doubt that this disappointment with hurt the flow of his blossoming career. I did like Javier Bardem's character, who was a bit of a rich show off, but I wasn't that impressed with Diaz who was a complete bitch. Anyway, I was expecting much better from Ridley Scott.\n\nBudget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $71million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there crime, thriller about a drug deal the goes terribly wrong. 3/10"

The Borg successfully assimilated every actor in this high production value, stylish movie with such totality that you won't care what happens to any of the wooden robots that clunk their way through this tired story.

McCarthy warns us that these forces are intrinsically woven into our everyday lives, yet we choose not to accept it, avoiding the harsh truth that we are all witness to and therefore part of the horrors that happen in the world.\n\nWhether buying diamonds born of savage war or partaking in drug use and fueling the violence in Mexico, this movie is a slap inn the face to the human race.\n\nThose looking to be entertained won't find it here. I am amazed to see an overall rating of 5.5 as the Counsellor is quite brilliant. Perhaps like John Carpenters The Thing, the world isn't quite ready to accept the ominous warning that McCarthy delivers through his poetically menacing script. Ridley Scott delivers his best work since Gladiator and the result is a movie that has had me thinking for days."

So he talks with his close friend Reiner (Javier Bardem) and is put in touch with Westray (Brad Pitt), a middleman who is instrumental in organising a cocaine deal. Meanwhile, The Counselor visits a woman in jail whose son has been arrested after speeding on a highway and being found with a lot of money in his crash helmet, along with a device used to steal some cocaine from a truck which belonged to a Mexican drug cartel. This will be instrumental in sending the lead protagonist down a dark and deadly path to self destruction.\n\nI have tried to describe the basic premise of Ridley Scott's latest, lavish film in as accurate a detail as I can, and I think I got it right, but not without a lot of mental wrangling and incomprehension. Scott, despite his ups and downs in terms of delivering solid work, has never been a director who has tried to include any subliminal meaning or subtext in his films, but that's the best guess for what's going on here, in this staggering misfire of a film, a colourful, all star offering that just leaves you overwhelmed and not in a good way.\n\nSomehow, even in the most abstract situations, Scott usually nails the dialogue perfectly and captures it in the most real and natural way possible. But no one speaks like a real person in this film, and all the prose seems completely laborious and overly heavy, drowning the viewer in a sea of incomprehension. But if the dialogue doesn't wear you down, the incomprehensible plot almost certainly well, where you're never really sure how one thing connects to the other or why the main characters are behaving the way they do given their position and situations. You get the feeling it's aiming for something deep and meaningful, but it never rubs off on anything, least of all the viewer.\n\nScott has managed a real 'what the hell happened?' piece here, that revels in human tragedy and shocking violence, but gives you nothing to justify it in terms of the pay off. *"

They may not relate to drug cartels directly, but it is moreso related to man and lengths he would go to to achieve what he wants in life. Cameron Diaz is breathtaking and gives a chillingly haunting role. Watch her throughout the movie. The rest of the cast is excellent and push the story forward. The story is not as deep as you would think, but it definitely is a story that needs to be told. The conversations are what push this movie forward.\n\nHighly recommended.

Could we at least understand who all the different bad guys are and their separate motives to explain there actions? Even if the Head Cartel guy spouting the meaning of life might make you think that's all irrelevant.(?)\n\nI get that McCarthy feels explanations aren't necessary when an entire film is meant to be a metaphor for life - you don't need to know the motives and backstory of each character and the why of the plot if every character is merely a vehicle to explain the consequences of choice and the hollowness of existence but this isn't abstract expressionism either, we shouldn't need a drama critic to explain McCarthy's meaning and we shouldn't need a cryptologist to decipher the plot."

The director is Ridley Scott the author of 'Alien', 'Blade Runner', 'Thelma & Louise' and 'Gladiator', the screenwriter is the successful novelist Cormac McCarthy at his first original script but the author of the novel that inspired the wonderful 'No Country for Old Men' , and the cast includes Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, Bruno Ganz - each of them a reason to make a film in which they feature a 'must see'. And yet, this drama that takes place in the world of the cartels of drug traffickers at the border between Mexico and the United States, although well garnished with violence and sex, fails to capture and retain the attention of viewers and leaves an impression of confusion and of a terrible waste of talent.\n\nThe 'counselor' (Michael Fassbender) is an ambitious lawyer whose name we never know. In the desire to raise his standard of living and to please his beautiful fianc\u00e9e Laura (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) he enters the service of the mob that transports drugs on both sides of the border. One of the transports goes wrong and the Counselor will be suspected by the Mexican drug cartel that he is reponsbile. The punishment for traitors is terrible. Moral decay and complicity in crime can only lead to disaster - this would be the not-so-subtle moral of this story.\n\nIf the moral intention is obvious, the story is quite complex and could be interesting, but the way it is told makes it unnecessarily cryptic for viewers. The film is difficult to watch, many characters appear and disappear and not all of them have a reason to be on screen, there are no details that link the episodes of the story and give motivation to some of the characters' actions. I believe that to blame here is the fact that Cormac McCarthy's script (he is a valuable novelist, but for the first time a screenwriter) does not seem to have been - surprisingly - advised and corrected by the director to make the film clearer to the public. Maybe there was an intention that escapes me, but the fluidity of the story I was expecting from a director like Ridley Scott is missing. Worse, some of the main characters are reduced to being nothing more than their own stereotypes, including the two gangsters played by Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt. Pen\u00e9lope Cruz is a wasted talent in this film. The same can be said about Bruno Ganz, from whose role it seems that essential parts fell out on the editing table, parts which can be seen only in a special version of the director, but not in the standard distributions. Michael Fassbender copes quite well with the complex role of the Counselor, but I missed something in his interpretation as well, perhaps precisely because the moral of the story is too predictable. The most interesting role is that of Cameron Diaz, who seemed to me the only one who manages to transform Malkina's character from the gangster girlfriend into the pivot of the whole story. The concentration of talent involved in making this film far exceeds the result."

The movie shows that in this world of crime there is no escape from your wrongly done actions and the consequences are there to come.\n\nThe screenplay is great, the director work is great the cast is super duper great! The suspense element in the movie is beautifully done by Ridley Scott. I would recommend to watch this movie without searching for a perfect story line but to enjoy the play."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a very strange movie one of the strangest I have ever seen. It has great actors, a plot impossible to understand, murders and death, sexual perversion, able cinematography, philosophical villains and disgusting morals.\n\nThe point of the movie is very simple.Evil rules human life and the more evil you are the best chances you have to survive. The most moral character of the movie meets the worst fate, the worst character prevails. It seems the whole movie was made to vindicate the worldview of the Marquis De Sade! All this is rather simple really and it does not need to be explained in literary platitudes. Neither it is something original. What's the point of having a stellar cast and an obviously big budget to reach such a humdrum conclusion?\n\nObviously some people, the screen-play writer whom I did not know but who seems to be rather famous, have a morbid fascination with the human propensity for evil and perversity. I do not want to create spoilers but if you watch the movie with some attention the kind of fate at least two of the main characters shall meet latter becomes more than obvious, this movie have the subtlety of an hippopotamus.\n\nI mean it simply is as plain as having wolfs making sermons to seep about the futility and brevity of life before they eat them. Does this thing make for great art, subtlety and insight to the human condition as quite a lot of reviewers state or imply?In my opinion no although my view may be in a degree conditioned by the fact that I find the morality of the movie repulsive and therefore I punish the whole movie based on the wrong criteria.\n\nI did not like this movie I had a bad feeling leaving the theatre. On the other hand I liked the actors. They weren't characters they were human allegories for the passions of the soul. Cameron Diaz symbolized the naked will to prevail and sexuality without confines. In Freudian terms the urge for aggression and the sexual urge unhinged by any moral constrains. The prosperity of vice to site one of Sade's novels. Cruz was the Lilly of the valley that was the prey of a cruel and perverse world. The Counsellor was the good man who took a wrong path and was destroyed(although there is no explaining which was his motive for evil-doing despite the continual warnings to do otherwise-the only conclusion is that he did for kicks for its own sake).Two other characters exist played by Bardem and Pitt who are very colorful in terms of character as well as in terms of stylistic choices. They are the ones who warn the hero of the fate that awaits him.\n\nYou could say that all this has allusions to Elizabethan tragedies and drama but this is an overstatement. And one must note that the way Mexicans are portrayed confirms all the Wasp stereotypes about them.But one thing is certain, this film will gain a cult following among all those who pride themselves for having understood the true workings of nature and society under the hypocritical facade of the JudeoChristian ethic. Their self- satisfaction will gain an immense boost- as if one had slapped the Pope publicly the moment he went to bless the public in St Peter's Square after his election...."

        "review_title": "Beautiful but unsatisfying",
        "review_detailed_main": "No spoilers here, but I think there are two major flaws in The Counselor. The most serious flaw is in the writing. We never really know why the Counselor character does what he does. What's his motivation? Greed? Gambling debts? Child support? Boredom? Deathwish? All of the above? We don't know, and without that crucial detail we don't really understand the Counselor character. The audience is kept at arm's length, shut out of the main character's inner life. We are never pulled into his world. And that kills off any chance of building emotional truth in the film.\n\nThe second major flaw is in the editing. Yes, there is always room for good actors to show their chops in the occasional big scene. The key word being \"occasional.\" But several such big acting scenes just feel too long. All the main actors and several of the supporting actors are given at least one long speech with keen observations about the human condition and/or heavy emoting. Too few of which contribute to moving the plot forward or enhancing the overall story. Some of these big acting scenes could have been shortened or cut entirely without hurting the narrative or character development (such as it is.) And the time saved could have been used in other ways to advance the story or add more depth to the characters or provide more cinematic texture to the film. Instead, we sit through quite a few stagey and long-winded expositions that don't help the movie.\n\nOn the surface, The Counselor is a thriller. But it lacks the clear motivations and efficient crispness of a good thriller. Yes, Ridley Scott's attention to that surface gives us a beautiful looking film, with some gritty and punishing action sequences, and some very good performances by all of the actors. But all the components don't hang together well enough to be truly satisfying."

When I watched the trailer for this movie I wasn't impressed. It looked like it could be really boring but with this cast I was hoping that that would help. I was wrong. The movie was really just too slow for me to get into. The main problem for me was that the movie was nothing more then 10-15 min scenes of long dialog conversations that were so jumbled that halfway through it just became confusing. It could just be me but each scene didn't seem to connect smooth to the next one and it was just too confusing to follow. There were a few scenes that held my attention but overall I can't really tell you what the movie is about no can I totally recommend it. I will say that the acting was great though and I really thought that Cameron Diaz did a great job. Overall, another example of a movie that proves just because you have a great cast it doesn't always mean you will have a great movie. I hate to do this with a cast like this but...I give this a C."

Scott might be good at TV commercials but as far as movie making is concerned its thumbs down on this one. The plot is 70% dialogue, most of it pointless in its confusion \u2013 meaning: I had no idea what anybody was discussing most of the time -- even the almost pointless explanation about the quality of diamonds: \"Looking for the flaw\" from Bruno Gans did nothing to add to the plot. Dialogue in screenplays \u2013 \"Keep it short and to the point, one page (one minute) max.\" This is something Mr Scott ignored totally. Dialogue is something the viewer hears but doesn't subconsciously take it as the 100% truth, for the simple reason that people tell lies; this logic follows when watching movies. The action, however, is believable as it is visible, dialogue is left open to interpretation and as we know, opinions differ, so, in movies, all we have is action -- as dialogue is only there to inform, amuse and confuse. In this so-called movie, apparently one money-greedy guy orders drugs from the \"Cartel\". The goods are transported to a depot in the USA for collection, but, the drugs are \"stolen\" \u2013 twice - which means \"He\" can't sell and he can't pay the cartel. There is total confusion as to who finishes up with the goods, and the Cartel (I think this is the point Scott was trying to get across) make a point of punishing people for their mistakes and other people's wrong- doings, as if there was some justification for doing so. No thrills, no suspense, not even Carmen Diaz could raise the standard (and certainly not mine) of this drivel. This means I add another director to my \"caution\" list. In other words a waste of viewing time."

Can it be possible that this man lives in a world where there was no \"Breaking Bad\"? First of all, in my life I've never heard dialogue like this. AWFUL. I don't even know how anyone spoke it without laughing. At the end of the film, two characters have a dialogue -- well, one does all the talking: \"The extinction of all reality is a concept no resignation can encompass. And then, all the grand designs and all the grand plans will be finally exposed and revealed for what they are.\" And this guy's native language wasn't even English. What claptrap.\n\nAnd the plot. Sketchy, as if most of the story was left out. If only it had been.\n\nSo what are we left with? Eroticism, which is fine but just kind of thrown in there; visual horror, which was disgusting and gross; and no attachment to the characters. Plenty of horror was to be found in \"Breaking Bad,\" but it was a compelling story with fascinating characters.\n\nThe actual story is quite interesting but badly handled. I won't bother talking about the acting since these poor people had enough problems.\n\nI look around this site and I see that some people thought this was a really good film. I am going to bet that a good 95% of them, if not more, are men. And why not -- gorgeous Penelope Cruz, gorgeous Cameron Diaz, lots of leg, some sex. And for this they assembled a big, important cast and spent $25 million. And flopped. Given what's been going on in the world lately, not the film to see. I can watch this type of thing on underground news shows."

The movie seems to try to get the viewer to focus on a narrow point of view in order to tell a story about death having greater meaning than our lives. By doing this, much of the details about whats happening and how the situation escalated were simply left out. The ending leaves the viewer to assume what happens, but as the main character is a \"counselor\" I would believe there is some hope for justice... in whatever form. This is not to say that the movie is unrealistic, merely narrow minded. Not an uplifting movie by any means."

It's a first-class film with extraordinary characters and great filmmaking skill.

Javier Bardem's performance stands out as a flamboyant drug kingpin whose calculating and sinister wife (aging sexy Diaz) masterminds the ultimate betrayal. Fessbender the main protagonist fights for his life both literally and in terms of performance among a cast of heavyweights and is a bit out of his league.

        "review_detailed_main": "Drug trafficking has been the source of countless movies, even before \"Scarface\" Tony Montana invited his assassins to \"say hello to my little friend\". And it's easy to see why Hollywood has returned to this subject so many times since. Drug dealers represent a shadowy underworld full of danger. This sub-genre easily lends itself to great drama \u2013 almost too easily. While many of these movies might blend together in your memory with their similar plot lines and interchangeable characters, the 2013 entry into this crowded field stands out. \"The Counselor\" (R, 1:57), treats the drug trade as background. The film emphasizes its human drama, making its characters practically pop off the screen in vivid detail.\n\nThe title role is played by Michael Fassbender. He's a lawyer who has worked with some pretty unsavory characters and has decided to participate in a Juarez to El Paso drug shipment that promises a very big payoff. He becomes engaged to his girlfriend Laura (Oscar winner Penelope Cruz) and seems to want to give her the best of everything. The Counselor is in league with men like Reiner (Oscar winner Javier Bardem) and Westray (multiple Oscar nominee Brad Pitt) who have seen it all and done it all. They offer advice on how to deal with the dangerous world he's entering, but they don't have a lot of answers when things go south and the local drug cartel thinks that The Counselor is trying to steal their shipment of cocaine. He learns that whenever you're in business with bad people, bad things can happen at any moment and even minor mistakes can be deadly. The mayhem feels simultaneously real and symbolic.\n\nThis is a thinking person's drug movie. The plot develops slowly as we see various characters doing things and having conversations that seem unrelated or inconsequential, but the great cast and the very smart dialog keep you engaged and make you eager to see how all this will come together. When it does, you can feel the danger the characters are in and the remorse they have, both for poor choices and for misunderstandings that carry life-altering consequences. The outstanding acting (especially by Fassbender) and the film's superior score draw you in and then propel you through plot points that you may see coming, but still generate suspense. This movie makes us think \u2013 while putting together the puzzle, once all the pieces have finally been revealed, and in the film's life lessons, both implied by the plot and insightfully expressed by the characters. I think that \"The Counselor\" builds too slowly and doesn't explain some characters' actions clearly enough, but Cormac McCarthy's script is generally well-written and Ridley Scott's direction is excellent. \"A-\""

As for highly esteemed writer Cormac McCarthy - perhaps at 84 it's time to hang up his pen. Character motivation is largely unexplored and the situations bounce from one glib, almost impossible to understand circumstance to the next.\n\nThe highest ideals for any of these characters run in the order of greed, avarice, booze, drugs and obsessive sexual obscenity of the most perverse nature. Cameron Diaz is beginning to look as ugly as the foul morality she tends to represent, Penelope Cruz basically appears to represent little more than a woman for a bed - shared by Michael Fassbender in an unnecessarily overdone opening section. Brad Pitt's by-the-numbers role is not much more than a station on the way and could have gone to any number of lesser names.\n\nFassbender's ridiculous decision to play for deathly high stakes with merciless drug cartels offering a deal with a 4000 x return rate (yes you read right!) at least it gives him a chance to show some fear- filled remorse - with possibly one of the better performances in this jigsaw puzzle with too many missing pieces. If your most endearing inspirations for living are superficial greed, perverse sexuality, fashion, drugs or how many people you can cruelly murder, then you could find something to identify with here. Otherwise, save your brain and time, find something else to watch and leave this to the criminal element and biker gangs but, even they may prefer to go ridin'."

If something is mentioned it the beginning it DOESN'T have to have a meaning in the end.\n\nThe violence and the ending really sets a dark tone.

There can be absolutely no question marks. If you think this way as well this is not a movie for you. You get thrown in events that is a part of a mans life (The Counselors life) and you follow him from that time without flashbacks. Simply put: You don't get much background, but there is no need for it either, it rather lifts the movie up, and as an exception to almost all other Hollywood productions, you get the chance to think for yourself.\n\nThe majority of the reviewer also seems to think that you have to understand every word, every sentence and every message in the movie without thinking twice, to give it a good review. I believe that most of the reviewers are to full of themselves and doesn't have enough self distance to understand that he or she probably isn't the smartest person in the world and can't understand every little thing that is said in a movie.\n\nIf you feel like an idiot when leaving the theater, it's maybe not the movie that's the problem...?"

He is constantly telling sexually explicit jokes and stories that just wind on for minutes. Ugh. I literally fast-forwarded a couple minutes when I saw that he was starting a new one. Three minutes I had to fast-forward. And, mind you, these stories and jokes he is telling are not in any way part of the movie, but there are many of them.\n\nThe acting is actually great, which is very noticeable in contrast to the material that the actors had to work with. The dialogue between characters is usually pointless and nonsensical, with a lot of fake hyperbole thrown in. Like, a whole conversation with pop-psychology one-liners. You'll have to slog through a ten minute lewd conversation, and then at the very end they will say something important that only takes five seconds, like, \"Okay, the money will be there on Thursday.\"\n\nFor those who are fans of Breaking Bad, you'll like the feeling that it gives you (besides all the lewd talk). If you liked Sicario or Traffic, you'll also like this movie - again, somewhat. It's more than two hours long, but the portion of the movie that actually dealt with the crime was probably less than an hour.\n\nSeriously, if someone made a machete cut of this movie, and just edited out all of the lewd and pointless dialog, and all of the extraneous characters, it would be an extended Breaking Bad episode. Anyway, feel free to fast-forward through any scenes with Cameron Diaz or Javier Bardem in them - which kills me on the inside to have to say that."

It's almost as if the cast knows they're in a movie that will serve as a broken down gas station on their career paths, and they just want to get it over with. Do not waste your time on this - Ridley Scott has so much better to offer."

This movie is all theme and no substance, and there are too many A-listers for comfort. Inevitably they're going to get in each other's way.\n\nFassbender is the titular Counselor, a lawyer (curious title for a lawyer, no?) getting involved in drug dealing and about to reap the consequences. His contact is a dealer called Reiner (Javier Bardem, looking perfectly ridiculous), married to the vulgar, seedy blonde Malkina (Cameron Diaz, miscast). There's also Penelope Cruz as the Counselor's fiancee and Brad Pitt as an intermediary. Bruno Ganz has a small part as a diamond merchant, garbled English as always. We also get a couple of leopards sashaying around. If this was meant to bring up memories of Hepburn and Grant in Bringing Up Baby, well, it didn't help to be reminded of that screwball comedy in this drama of sewage, kidnapping, and decapitation.\n\nActually, what this really made me think of was 2000's far superior Traffic, by Steven Soderbergh. I begin to think Soderbergh is as underrated as Ridley Scott is overrated. Or even The Constant Gardener (2005, dir. Fernando Ferreira Meirelles) because of the grief theme. Those are movies carrying more flare and more depth of feeling. With a film like this, The Counselor, one is on the outside looking in, struggling to cope with Bardem's and Ganz's, and even Pitt's enunication, and unable to find anything to take away from the seedy story other than the message that people are foolish, conniving, and despicable. Even the introductory sex scene, supposedly a scene of happy accord, is full of distasteful ego.\n\nA dismal outing. Rent TRAFFIC instead."

Despite all drawbacks, The Councellor makes most sense of all three.\n\nIt is my impression that the pivot of Cormac McCarthy's work are images on which he builds his stories. This i say without reading the books, merely after watching movies based on them. In The Councellor this has been driven to the extreme.\n\nThe movie is built written as a series of scenes that happen a specific location and involve a couple of characters. There was almost no connection between them and they are so slow paced that i started wondering what the point was.\n\nThe cast was fine, except Cameron Diaz, whose looks couldn't compensate the sub-par performance."

He seemed clueless to what job he was going to do, just like me.\n\nAnd then, the climax of the film, he becomes responsible for something and yet I'm not sure why!!

Yeah, that's about it for the positives.\n\nNegatives for The Counselor (2013): First off, I am wondering how in the hell is this a Ridley Scott movie because it doesn't feel like a Ridley Scott movie. Despite having an awesome ensemble cast, it feels like no one gives a damn if they're in this movie. For the 2-hour runtime, nothing is happening on screen, it's just people talking to each other and the movie is way too long and boring.\n\nOverall, The Counselor (2013) is one of the most boring movies I've seen in my life and I refuse to believe that Ridley Scott actually directed this movie."

I try very hard to watch this film and understand and enjoy it but I'm fighting a losing battle. Usually when I see a film more than once I can join together the dots that maybe did not add up the first time around. A prime example of this is Assassins creed I went to see it twice and although I understood most of it the first time anyway it made even more sense the second time round. But I'm sad to say The Counsellor was a whole different kettle of fish. The plot is bleak, the dialogue although clever at times is down right confusing and doesn't explain what is going on properly at all in certain scenes. It's like they are talking in riddles and the plot is hard enough to follow as it is. I like to be challenged at times when watching a movie but this is taking it a bit too far. Characters just pop up and it doesn't explain who they are or what side they are on. It pains me to give a Michael Fassbender movie a negative review because I genuinely love the man & his talent. But this is a difficult watch. Sometimes I'll still stick it on in the background while I do other things because as I say it's worth it for the Fassy eye candy. But as for trying to concentrate on what's happening...I don't think it'll ever happen."

A film which boasts a blockbuster cast with a legendary director, is not only disappointing but it is actually horrendous. In fact this film is almost a wonder in itself given all the positive ingredients, it served up a dis-tasteful, bland and shockingly nauseous dish of utter garbage. The writing was on the wall from the opening scene, with Michael Fassbender who was pathetic throughout, sharing an almost pornographic scene with the cheap under-used Penelope Cruz. Their was occasional style in some of the scenes but as the movie became more and more disjointed and boring, even the style dried up. Full marks to Cameron Diaz who had the only worthwhile role in this hapless movie with a nice cameo from Brad Pitt. I surely hope the novel by Cormac McCarthy was better than this laughable, crude and confusing adaptation of a plot so dull and dreary that even it's overdue climax left no impression. Ridley Scott must be bored of making movies if this is the best he can offer at this stage of his career. Forgettable and pathetic !"

One phone conversation almost gives it some character, if the speaker had any personality.\n\nComing in between Prometheus and The Martian in the career of Ridley Scott, you could excuse him for thinking that adapting a novel from the writer of No Country for Old Men would result in a good movie, that becomes the blockbuster.

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a devoted, long time fan of Ridley, so long and so devoted to his work that it isn't easy for me to offer the sort of criticism I immediately wanted to share after viewing 'the Counselor'. Even worse, I have viewed the Director's Cut only, or in other words the improved version he would like us to see.\n\nThe good news, this is a very pretty, stylish and well edited movie. Great photography of things like sunsets and big cats. but, as Brad Pitt might add at the end, don't lose your head yet.\n\nThe bad news, where do I begin? How about this: scene after boring scene where characters go on and on and on...yet say in every three sentences what they could have said in one. There must be a formula here, take the minutes of each scene, divide by three and...oh, my...not good news. In addition, much of the dialog is spoken in such a flat and odd cadence that at times it appears the actors are reading from TelePrompTers.\n\nThere is a great deal of philosophy offered in the wordy scenes, kind of like what you might expect in a good Kung Fu movie. Huge life lesson stuff, if you know what I mean, where the obvious is overstated and then there are 'gee whiz' moments of silence allowed so that we viewers can ponder the essence of who-knows-what. I am afraid I never got into it, much like those characters speaking line after line in mechanical earnest, like robots issuing instructions for life.\n\nThe Director's Cut opens with a scene that is tedious, unnerving and too long. I have read in other reviews that this version has 'extended' scenes that are intended to improve the final product. Don't be fooled as I was. Scene one is just an entr\u00e9e to a movie with scene after scene where the key players talk too much without effectively advancing something worthy of Mr. Scott's reputation. I kept watching and hoping but it never got any better.\n\nOh, well, it is pretty\n\nCasting is a real problem. There is no 'lead' actor present in the movie. Yes, the titular character is Mr. Fassbender, but his role never rises to a 'lead' position. Ridley never allows that to happen. Penelope is just window dressing and Javier is as bombastic and quirky as ever, but we all know he will never rise above a super-character actor slot. And, Brad? Well, he is there but don't lose your head expecting him to rise above his supporting role. Then, there is Ms. Diaz. Her role could have been filled by one of several actresses available. A better choice might have been Gong Li, Julia Roberts or one of your recently middle-aged cousins. Instead, Cam got the part and walks through it like someone in a narcolepsy study.\n\nThe cast is like a football team without a quarterback, so to speak. Before release I read about the 'powerhouse, dream cast'. Add a lead to the mix, take away the teleprompter and recast Fassbender and Diaz and I might agree.\n\nOne might think that the wordy scenes and overbearing dialog would at least paint a very clear picture of what is going on in the movie - OK think again. Transition periods from scene to scene are sometimes 'fill in the blank' for viewers, as the movie progresses. Better take notes if you can, that could really help."

        "review_detailed_main": "The consequence of watching this heap of mess is that your precious time, patience and intelligence would all be wasted in a two hour ordeal where literally nothing cohesive occurs. Greed drives us to consequential behaviour. Greed makes us unlikeable. Greed, for a lack of better word, is actually bad. Forget 'Wall Street'! This sin leads to loss of life within a few days of manifestation! At least that's what McCarthy's pretentious dialogue alludes to, almost Shakespearean in theatrics. Yet somehow, somewhere, in production, Scott's mechanical directorial vision and McCarthy's bleak lessons in morality separated themselves like fire and ice. Two polar opposites that had no chance in forming a cohesive feature, marking an almighty low point in both careers.\n\nMuch like the film's narrative, this \"review\" will be segments of wordy rambles that believe to have some self-importance attached to them (and yes, I did just insult my own work for comedic purposes). Nevertheless, the challenge to analyse this embarrassment has been accepted. After proposing to his girlfriend, a lawyer simply known as \"The Counsellor\" becomes entangled in a drug deal that rapidly becomes awry. Scott has some of the finest award-winning actors in his arsenal for The Counsellor. Michael Fassbender. Javier Bardem. Penelope Cruz. Brad Pitt. Cameron Diaz. Heck, even Bruno Ganz makes a brief appearance. Yet this exercise proves that no matter how much star power is thrusted into a project, the outcome is solely dependent on the director who provides the vision for audiences.\n\nScott has been one of the most well-known, acclaimed and popular directors for decades. Tackling a variety of genres with effortless technicalities. So, the fundamental question raised here is: what the hell happened!?\n\nFor starters, McCarthy's screenplay is riddled with existential monologues that attempt to illustrate the human condition. From a man who provides astute gothic South-Western thrillers, I'm astonished to witness how clumsily written this script was. Every choice in life has its outcomes, whether they are good or bad depends on the decision made. Aside from the odorous self-importance that overwhelms Scott's direction, his screenplay was absent of any structure. The drug deal unfolds without any direct inclusion whatsoever. You couldn't tell if Diaz rubbing her foo-foo on a car windscreen (more on that later, don't you worry) has anything to do with the central plot. I still don't know! Why was that even included?\n\nThe point is, the basis of the story relied on scattershot narratives between a bunch of unlikeable characters that no one cared for. Talking about women as if they're pets. We're supposed to empathise with the titular \"Counsellor\", considering he risks the most and suffers with undeniable loss, but the bleak offset of detestable individuals produced zero emotional impact. Everyone's rich residing in lavish villas, driving luxury cars and taking pet cheetahs out for a walk. What's the point? If none of the characters are relatable, then no investment can be made.\n\nWe then get to the drug deal itself, plagued with double-crossings and sly exchanges of envelopes brimming with dollar, which seemingly went south pretty quickly. But you wouldn't have known that without Pitt and Fassbender's heated conversation, because there had been no focus on the smuggling at all. Supporting characters are introduced in every direction, only to then leave the feature two minutes after their debut. Why? What's the point? They provided absolutely nothing to the plot, so why not just cut them out entirely and have a tighter story? It all comes down to this overwhelming burden of pretentiousness. This is not the Ridley Scott of 'Alien'. This is not the Cormac McCarthy of 'No Country For Old Men'. They are both in way over their heads.\n\nFrustratingly, the cast do give solid performances. Fassbender's breakdown in the car was magnificently performed. Pitt's cool swagger effortlessly shown. Bardem's crazy antics put firmly on display. Then we get to Diaz and that car scene. Did she not learn from dry-humping Timberlake in 'Bad Teacher'? Well, from what I can only describe as vehicular pleasure, she really did outdo herself. Honestly. It was disgusting. Thank God for my homo genes, that's all I'm saying!\n\nIf there is one thing I hate in entertainment, it's wasted potential. The Counsellor is a prime example of wasted potential. It's a film that has no real purpose, no real technical merit, and certainly no solid storytelling. Just a mish-mash of unlikeable characters making bad greedy choices in life. And now I've made a bad choice too, by watching this..."

To give an idea I enjoyed 10 to 15 minutes of the movie. Many scenes like the diamond purchase (even if the conversations has some philosophical points of interest), or the first scene, or...etc...etc...are simply there for...nothing. How come the actors accepted to play in such a movie, I really don't understand. I strongly do not recommend this movie. There is no research for beautiful pictures, no interest in leading you somewhere..."

Audiences these days want and expect to be served a spotless silver platter of simplicity, where tits, ass, explosions, and fight scenes are diced up and served by young, hip, hot-for-the-moment actors, and none of which is to be mixed with a meaningful message. Here, in this film, you get all those pretty-little silver platter pieces, but they're served by veterans, seasoned and ready-made to use all those pieces as accessories to pull in such viewers and drive home the message McCarthy has lined with silver here--dark and bleak as it may be. Those viewers probably loved the \"car f+@&ing\" scene, but loathed the scene where El Jefe breaks down reality with truth, parables, and poetry ... I can only assume.\n\nI've never once written a movie review, but I did so now because I was compelled to say that this film is absolutely brilliant."

This story has potential and definitely should be more elaborate (who, why, what, when and so on). I would call this \"an attempt to make a movie\". And fail.

This movie rates very highly on my all time top 15 movies. In a time when media and film appeal to those with little to no true appreciation for art and true human nature, this film is a great breath of fresh air.\n\nThe many themes are powerful. Sex, drugs, and money masquerade as a front for the deeper consequences of greed, desperation, and ignorance. The story, the dialogue, the entire cast, camera work, the music; the silence; everything is synergistic to produce a beautiful symphonic poem of a movie. If you're used to your Diehards, Saws, or Thors (or even consider them remotely thrilling), please, by all means, look elsewhere.

It seemed like it could have really been a riveting crime thriller. But due to ridiculous, over-the-top performances a dialogue that seemed like it was written by a handicapped person, made it only laughable. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a crime thriller in all my years. It's safe to say, and I can't imagine saying this about a director who had so much talent, but in recent years, Ridley Scott seems to have lost his touch. What an embarrassment, it is very difficult to believe that this is the man that started the Alien franchise. This is the first time I've ever seen such poor screen writing turn Michael Fassbender, one of the most talented actors working today, look like an over-acting, Nicholas Cage-esque, type of actor. This film went on an on, it seemed like this crop fodder would never end. A waste of a ticket"

Perhaps it was to say that if you live on the dark side of the law bad things happen, well okay but that in itself isn't strong enough to make this a great piece of cinema. While the cinematography is outstanding and everyone has nice little character touches and eccentricities that you could well believe in some cases its not enough to rescue you from taking such an arduous journey with them. Scott has already proved he doesn't make everything he touches turn to gold with the over inflated Prometheus. Here the film is even less interesting when in a plot that we fail to really grab a group of people we don't really care about do some bad things to other people we care even less about.

        "review_detailed_main": "I've long thought that Cormac McCarthy was America's greatest living writer and it is astonishing how well he has turned his hand to the art of screen writing. His work has never been for, nor appealed to, the faint of mind and I expect this film to be no different. The depth and nuance of the language can really only be compared to the Bard himself. This film will be worth watching several times over in order to milk every last morsel of thought from some of the denser monologues. The combination of Scott and McCarthy is unrivaled, and I only hope that they will stretch themselves in their next project and create something to address the evils in this world which are far greater than the drug cartels of Mexico and Columbia."

I was impressed by Cameron Diaz, who plays a riskier nontraditional role and knocks it out of the park."

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE COUNSELOR': Four Stars (Out of Five)\n\nAcclaimed author Cormac McCarthy (of such popular books turned movies as 'NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN', 'THE ROAD', and 'ALL THE PRETTY HORSES') wrote his first original film screenplay for this Ridley Scott directed crime thriller. It features an all-star cast including Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt, Rosie Perez and Ruben Blades. The film is extremely dark and gratuitously violent, like all the film adaptations based on McCarthy's work. It's also extremely dialogue heavy, like all other McCarthy films as well. It's received mostly negative reviews due to these things but I think it will long be talked about and remembered fondly (by some genre fans).\n\nFassbender (who also starred in Scott's last film 'PROMETHEUS') plays a lawyer known strictly as 'Counselor'. He's engaged to the beautiful but naive Laura (Cruz, who also co-starred in 'ALL THE PRETTY HORSES') but despite this, and his financial success already, longs for more (out of greed and the fact that his greed has gotten him into a little financial trouble). So he decides to get involved in the dangerous business of drug trafficking with his friend and client Reiner (Bardem, who won a supporting actor Academy Award for his portrayal of the vicious killer in 'NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN'). Through Reiner Counselor meets Malkina (Diaz), a self centered sociopath who's also Reiner's girlfriend, and Westray (Pitt), who partners with Counselor on his first drug deal. Things go horribly wrong and everyone is put in grave danger because of it.\n\nI like Ridley Scott as a director immensely (the film is also dedicated to his late brother, filmmaker Tony Scott) but his films are sometimes mixed bags in quality and entertainment value. I'd say this movie is definitely a mixed bag. It's suspenseful and involving (to a certain point) but none of the characters are likable (except for Cruz) or developed enough. The performances are all good (especially Bardem and Pitt) and the visuals and atmosphere are striking but the film is also overly wordy and slow paced at times as well. It's also extremely dark and disturbing and excessively violent. It's definitely unpleasant and left me feeling down and uncomfortable for quite a long time afterwards (which I do give it credit for but it's not a film I'd be eager to see again anytime soon). It's definitely got it's strengths and reasons to see it but it's also a very flawed film as well.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQkUJbRVsoM"

Very Shakespearian story line with Javier Bardem stealing the show. His scenes with Fassbender were entertaining and very funny. I thought Cameron Diaz was excellent. The opening scene might have unsettled a few but reflected the intensity through-out the movie. I strongly recommend, I knocked great entertainment out of Bardems outlandish anecdotes.

Ppl are too dumb for anything beyond. I am glad I've given it a shot, especially considering Ridley Scott's recent track record(Prometheus,hello). But he sure has redeemed himself ten times over with this film. Thanks to Cormac McCarthy's brilliantly writing. I've never heard so many utterly mind shattering conversation out of any films, other than Roman Polanski's MacBeth. Most of the reviews described this film as \" non-linear\", or \"boring\", or \"pseudo-intellectual\", none of which are true. Quite the opposite, actually. Scenes after scenes of the most amazing dialogues that really rattles my mind. And the cinematography was breath-taking. I've never been a fan of Cameron Diaz but she really shined in her role. Great casting all around. Not sure about \"westray\" initially but I think Brad Pitt did his best here. A very disturbing yet engaging film. \"Truth has no temperature\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't listen to the critics! The Counselor is a bleak and unrelenting thriller of the first order that serves as an excellent companion piece to Cormac McCarthy's award winning No Country For Old Men. If the latter movie traces the beginnings of the drug war in Texas in the early 1980's then The Counselor serves as its inevitable aftermath; the drug trade has made many of its players rich and the competition has made killings far more widespread and fiercer than ever. With more money being made the more dangerous it has become- bankers and unscrupulous politicians are now in on the take and so the stakes have gone past heaven.\n\nIn this potential nightmare scenario exists the title character played by Michael Fassbender, he is a highly successful defense lawyer with a somewhat naive fianc\u00e9e played by Penelope Cruz and his shady coterie which consists of a wisecracking middleman named Westray (Brad Pitt), nightclub owner and part time dealer Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his viper of a girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz). The counselor is in a bit over his head due to his lavish lifestyle and so decides to do one drug deal to pay off his debts. Of course, with these amoral characters the inevitable betrayal begins and we follow each and every one as the downward spiral ends in a bloody orgy of pain and death.\n\nCormac McCarthy's novels have always been about life and death and the decisions one takes that leads to their respective outcomes- his books are perfect analogies of existentialism. With this, his first original screenplay, McCarthy essentially goes over the same territory that he covered in No Country For Old Men but this time everything has gone corporate- the Mexican Cartel now controls the drug trade in the southwest United States and anyone who dares to cross its path will face an unrelenting army of thugs and assassins until they meet a gruesome end. This pervading sense of doom permeates the entire movie and does not let go; I think the reason why most critics didn't like this film is because there is no humor, no catharsis to pull back the nihilism that pervades the entire storyline. Whereas in No Country For Old Men, the Coen brothers were able to inject their dark humor into the movie, Ridley Scott's directorial skills in this film allows no such reprieve.\n\nFassbender is excellent as the title character; its clear that all his skills as a top defense lawyer has come for naught as he gets involved with things way beyond his expectations; seeing his breakdown into a broken man is a thing to behold. Bardem is as quirky as ever as his best buddy Reiner- his tinted eye glasses, psychedelic clothes and puffed up hair is perfect for the role. Brad Pitt is adequate as the knowledgeable Westray (who seems to be playing a variation of the bounty hunter character that Woody Harrelson played in No Country For Old Men) but its Cameron Diaz who steals the show as the cunning and sociopathic Malkina- she seems to be the new embodiment of death- sultry, seductive and deftly using everyone towards her ultimate goal. Even the bit parts are played by popular actors such Dean Norris, Bruno Ganz, Rosie Perez, John Leguizamo, Edgar Ramirez and Ruben Blades."

        "review_title": "A successful art film",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Counselor\" is Ridley Scotts newest film and has been met with literally every rating available. It is understandable that audiences the world over would ponder the strange composition of dialogue and use of overly graphic violence. Some viewers may even find it drowns under the weight of it's own script and misinterpret this brave attempt as a failed action film. I call it a successful art film.\n\nWe're introduced to the main character, throughout the film known only as \"The Counselor\", a successful lawyer who through questionable friendships decides to go into the drug dealing business in an attempt to maintain his lavish lifestyle. The deal, however, goes awry and the counselor quickly finds himself on the run.\n\nWhat at first glance seems like a pretty cool action thriller turns out to be a philosophical look at the consequences of bad decisions and learning to live with mistakes. Each sequence of dialogue is complex and reflects the cinematography in a pretty unusual way. It gives a socially realistic and artistic feel, but lose younger audiences in the process. Especially the opening and closing scenes of the movie are exceptionally shot and testaments to the bravery of Ridley Scott. The movie also implements the use of symbolism in the form of colors and make up, which seems a bit obvious compared to the complexity of the rest of the film. It seems almost insulting to the audiences when Cameron Diaz, who is often referred to as a \"hunter\" and a \"cheetah\" throughout the film is dressed up with claw-like nails and a cheetah tattoo down her back. Even though they don't leave much of the symbolism to the imagination, it gives an unusual and cool feeling that draws you into this world of fast cars, women, drugs and nightclubs. Very unrealistic but unlike anything I've ever seen.\n\nThe film is beautifully shot. The \"closeness\" of each shot seems to draw you through the screen and right into the room with the characters. You feel close to the counselor and care about his struggles and problems, as he tries to navigate his way out of the issues he's made for himself. It is the constant guessing of what will happen to our hero that keeps the audiences interested and on the edge of their seats, but also the moral struggles, self realization and moral redemption he must face. You want a happy ending, and it is that hope that keeps your attention. Otherwise the movie would merely be a series of extremely graphic violence and pointless dialogue.\n\nAs most people know by now, successful novelist Cormac McCarthy has written the script. As several of his books have been made into successful film, it is only natural he would make the transition to screenwriter. It is, however, obvious that it is not his niche. Most of the lines are very long and complex and would have probably worked much better as a book. Not thereby saying it doesn't work great as a film, because it definitely does. It's just not what you would expect when you watch the trailer or see the poster. The movie operates on a much deeper level and explores profound subjects about life, death and consequences.\n\nNeedless to say the acting is excellent. Michael Fassbender who's become one of the most \"in demand\" actors in Hollywood delivers the performance of a lifetime as The Counselor. He simply owns the character and works wonders with a script I imagine have been difficult to get into character with. The same goes for Brad Pitt who doesn't really have anything to prove. He plays \"Westray\", an ice-cold drug runner and business partner of the counselor. It's a shame that his combined screen time doesn't exceed more than 20 minutes or so, because the character is really interesting and probably the coolest in the movie. Javier Bardem is absolutely hilarious as \"Reiner\", a flamboyant club owner and drug dealer who brings some much needed light humor to the table. His scenes are very funny and give you pause to breathe through the waves of dialogue.\n\nAs much as I love Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem and Michael Fassbender, I find it necessary to note how utterly ridiculous Cameron Diaz is. It is impossible for her to carry this ice queen of a character and what should have been an intimidating and dangerous femme fatale ends up being a complete fiasco and a parody of itself. You look at her and can't think anything but \"There's Something About Mary\". I also heard Angelina Jolie was supposed to play her role, which would have been 1 million times better. I'm not questioning Cameron Diaz's acting skills, but she should probably stick to what she knows, which is comedies.\n\nTo summarize, \"The Counselor\" is a very deep, very well played movie with several philosophical aspects put into a modern setting. Sadly it's been marketed as an action thriller in an attempt to reach a wider target audience. It's unfair to judge it on that background because I find this movie revolutionizing in terms of genre. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before and works as it is; an art film."

It clearly depicts a world you do not want to end up in and where only the most ruthless and evil people can reach the top. If they are lucky. Meaningless Death just as a sport and show of force.\n\nWow!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Extended cut - Holy Smoke. I had seen the previous version of this film and it didn't do much for me. Can't even remember it in fact. But a friend strongly recommended the longer cut. This is Cormac McCarthy at his most brutally nihilistic, with his viewpoint on the inescapable trap of human existence. It's not just about the price of greed. It's about underestimating the depths of depravity and evil to which some humans can sink, how their world can take over that of an unwary outsider. The screenplay is brilliant in a very McCarthy way. He wrote it himself and I'm just guessing that Ridley Scott made no significant changes---at times is seems 'literary' in the sense that people don't often talk the way they sometimes do in this film, particularly in the final act. But that's not a problem. I highly recommend this extended cut of the film, especially if you admire McCarthy's vision in his novels, and the Coens' masterful NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Be sure to see the 2 hour, 17 minute extended cut."

        "review_detailed_main": "Story driven, and dialogue driven! As a Cormac fan might anticipate. I am a big Cormac McCarthy fan. But I didn't necessarily like the movie the Road. Not all of his great novels can be translated into films. This is his first screen play for big MP, The Counselor. Huge cast with good acting including a phenom director Ridley Scott. Without giving away too much it's alittle like if Savages was a really good film with much more reality and better, well, everything.\n\nBut I love seeing Hollywood films that are written well and have a VERY satisfying ending. Only people who can't handle films like this, that holds no bars, or can't connect themes to story and characters will disagree. Both story and dialogue are phenomenally well done, but not for everyone, don't expect your typical Hollywood feel good pass on a dark story and theme. Some characters were very good just not enough time to embellish on them. There are few flaws with a movie that is super crafty in it's story and dialogue. The acting and characters are not necessarily the focal point although they all do an amazing job and a couple characters are key points in the plot but its about the themes, reality and story (which the dialogue conveys so well, especially Cameron Diaz at times and key monologues by non-big characters in ladder part of story). It's missing a powerful soundtrack though, considering it's daunting themes and reality, a powerful soundtrack could have made the movie a good 9.\n\nI would give it an 8-8.5 ... Only movies this year that rival it or are better are Gravity (rare feat to have the masses and I love it) and Mud as well was a great movie. Few more to come including Out of the Furnace.\n\nI digress though. Sit down with an open mind, listen up and enjoy the REAL Ride of a journey one should not embark upon."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't think it would be going out on a limb to call Ridley Scott one of our greatest directors, no serious movie fan would deny that of the man who brought us Blade Runner and Alien, and this Cormac McCarthy penned film is a bold new step for him; but obviously, seeing the many hateful reviews, a great many film-goers found this one quite unpalatable. The cast is impressive, no B-List-ers here; these are Hollywood's big guns and they are blazing. The production is seamless and the cinematography lush and glossy with some unforgettable imagery. Love it or hate it, you won't walk away from this one without it following you around for a while. Perhaps this is what provoked such polarized hostility, but I think it may be something more: the flashes of ugliness and violence depict what is an everyday reality in Mexico, something we don't like to think about in America; specifically that our fun-lovin' casual drug use is the intrinsic cause of untold suffering of our neighbors south of the border. I can only speculate that this was Scott and McCarthy's intent. There are no good guys presented here, just a slippery slope of human greed, predation, and strife. Our protagonist, the eponymous 'Counselor' (Michael Fassbender), soon finds himself a pawn in an unwinnable chess game of underworld machinations. In other words, this is perfect film noir fare, and it scrapes the grimy underbelly of our psyche deeply enough to sting a little, but like a good medicine, it only stings because there is a wound there, one neglected long enough to fester. If you are a film noir fan or like a dark thriller that provokes a little more thought than just the slack-jawed ogling of car chases and you aren't afraid of a little dirt, then is might be a good movie for you."

My understanding is that this is a \"slice of life\" film which is only comprehensible after the final curtain. Imagine you're a fly on a wall. You can hear people speaking but you don't know who they are or what brought them to this point unless they reveal it to you in their conversations. You don't get to choose which walls you land on but you can piece together meaning from what you've heard and witnessed. This is, I believe, the modus operandi of this film. All you really need to know is that one person ends up out on top at the end. In short, this is the film that Walter White should have seen before he decided to break bad.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the scene where the \"Green Hornet\" talks with a civilian at a roadside stand about his \"dog food diet.\" The civilian starts up the conversation and there's nothing he says that's particularly threatening to her but you can see in her face that she's increasingly terrified by him but is trapped in carrying on what is nothing but small talk. Great cinema in my book."

All I know comes from certain emotions some films evoke and some don't.\n\nThis film, for me, did the same as \"Killing them softly\" did. A feeling of sheer enjoyment and the pleasure of watching pure craftsmanship. This film oozes style, cool, and visual splendor. This combined with a great story of inevitability and some amazing performances: Never seen Cameron Diaz better then this and Michael Fassbender can't do anything wrong in my opinion anyway, makes for a tantalizing look into a downright evil and pretty much moral less bit of world we will only ever see in movies (at least most of us). I loved it and have the urge to see something similar... There isn't.\n\nYes, you can definitely feel a vibe similar to that of \"No country for old men\", one of my absolute favorite films of all time. And even a bit of \"Fargo\" maybe, but in no way is this copycat material. For me it stands alone as a solid beautiful if bleak tragedy disguised as a slick mean thriller.\n\nCheck it out. I'm sure you will agree, it deserves way more then praise then it's getting now."

Three words that most describe the visual beauty (in its bleakness), the tension and the brutality in this movie...The Counsellor.\n\nFrom start to finish, Cormac McCarthy's script never takes a breath. The dialog is incredible, some of the best I've ever seen. In a time of films where CGI takes front and center and real acting skill is thrown out of the window to incorporate more time for action, movies like this are a forgotten relic. Until now. There is something so very gorgeously poetic about the dialog in this movie, and also to how each scene plays out because of it and the tension.\n\nThe actors all shined, especially when really needed, filling the screen with an ocean of Shakespearean themes, set pieces and morals. We thank you, Cormac, for this event of a lifetime. The intensity was massively important and engrossing, and the story was paced excellently! There are severe shocks in this movie, where the brutal violence is needed, but is certainly not overdone.\n\nRidley Scott's directing is stunning, from the dim to the sunlit surroundings, to the flash and colorful characters, but these were just a small fraction of this movie's soul. The directing made it very realistic, sometimes going unnoticed because of the rich monologues of which the characters would delve into, but it makes the scenes gripping.\n\nMichael Fassbender shines as the cocky, clever (but stupid...see the film to understand), slightly arrogant and certainly suave titular role. Javier Bardem is just mesmerizing as the eccentric and witty Reiner. Cameron Diaz delivers perhaps the performance of her career as the dangerous and mysterious Malkina, and even though Penelope Cruz is a very brief maybe even side tracked role in this movie, she delivers a sense of pure innocence to a world of cruelty and darkness.\n\nAn amazing thrill ride. A poetic adventure. An Elegant portrayal of morality and \" just business\". Beautiful...THE COUNSELLOR."

But if you loved the Coen Brothers' interpretation of \"No Country for Old Men,\" and you want to see another creative take on McCarthy's words in live action, then drop everything and see this film now. Just be sure to pay attention to EVERY damn word, or else you may not give it the credit it deserves.\n\nThe Counselor is the harbinger of a new era in film, in which selective tastes dominate -- thank you internet-- and globalization reveals that America is still the king of cinema, only now it contains both a North ... and a South (see also: FX's \"The Bridge\").\n\nThe truth is, The Counselor is a failed success. As a film, it's brilliant. As a weekend movie, it's not. Thankfully, a new era is upon us, and two years from now, when The Counselor hits Netflix, it'll probably get the 8/10 or 9/10 it deserves."

But the star isn't Fassbender or Bardem or the ladies- but Brad Pitt: a worldy middleman that is seemingly better able to navigate the world of ruthless cartels than his naive co- stars. (After things go wrong- Fassbender calls Pitt. Are you home? No. And I'm surprised you are. *hangs up and throws cell away while walking through airport garage*).\n\nIf I had to describe this movie as a mashup of others I would say it's a mix between 'No Country for Old Men' and 'Killing them softly'.

She's daring, she's sexy, she's bossy, she's stunning, she's powerful and demanding, she's smart and courageous, she's a doll and a great bitch at the same time. She's perfect! Pen\u00e9lope Cruz doesn't appear as much as I was expecting but I guess I prefer this way.\n\nI've read on a movie critic that Michael Fassbender's roll wasn't that great but I don't understand where the doubt is. Fine, I agree... 'The Counselor' isn't the most suitable title for the movie, not even to nickname Fassbender's roll, because he should have been called 'The Advised', but that doesn't make his participation worst... for the contrary. He's just that sexy guy that thinks a lot and gives attention to the woman he loves.\n\nJavier Bardem is the man, as usual, but Brad Pitt is equivalent in this film. Two real gentlemen, the bad guys!\n\nWhat I really loved about this movie that the majority is going to hate, for sure, was the speeches. 'The Counselor' isn't made of cheap lines and sh*t-chat comments, all of the dialogs are art. A complex paradox that makes you think about every line.\n\nIt's very intense and worthy to see."

I wasn't ready for this.\n\nWARNING: Many people will casually pick up and watch this film, noticing the prominent cast and hoping for just another good legal thriller that more or less follows the formula. Those people are in for a big unpleasant surprise. THE COUNSELOR will NOT warm the heart when justice is served in the end. Though gory and violent, it goes no farther in those areas than lots of other films do: It's the story itself that is so bleak and disturbing. Another thing: Depending upon interpretation, certain aspects may seem misogynistic and prove particularly alienating to many women.\n\nThough a true literary genius, novelist Cormac McCarthy is not known for his cheery optimism. In this venture into film writing, he reaches new depths of pessimism that sometimes border on the darkest nihilism. Nevertheless, there are obvious basic morals to be drawn from THE COUNSELOR.\n\nMcCarthy spits in the face of so many storytelling conventions here, creating a tale that's seldom told but is so often true. It's all about the young and recently engaged \"Counselor,\" played by Michael Fassbender, who finds himself succumbing to a shady deal with a more-than-shady crowd. The plot flies in many directions, and the sheer number of characters can be a little overwhelming. It's hard to place where everyone fits in and the game each person is playing. The transitions are abrupt, which seems intentional for some reason even though it doesn't exactly work. In that respect, the storyline is indeed flawed, which is why I give this film eight stars instead of ten. It's essentially a video novel, not simply a film adaptation of a book, something that could hasten the development of a whole new subgenre of filming. Still, let's not forget that the first novels were badly plotted, the first suspense films quite unsuspenseful, the first poems badly rhymed, etc. This early effort in \"video novelization\" or whatever we choose to call it employs techniques that work all the time on paper but are harder to utilize on screen. The character development in particular just isn't quite there.\n\nRegardless, THE COUNSELOR is expertly filmed, well-acted, and compelling. Cameron Diaz especially stands out as Malkina, a character who's hard to forget no matter how much we may want to forget her. The larger-than-life dialogue is arresting in itself. This sort of script is hard to make work. Many films have tried it, but most have failed, and very few have succeeded this brilliantly. The early exchanges of dialogue between all the major sets of characters are important in foreshadowing and allowing the audience some clue of what's going on here and what might ultimately happen. I know that I missed a lot on first view but am eager to watch this again. . .and again."

She's incredibly powerful quick witted, sexy and powerful. She really sets the mood and tone for the movie, by far one of the best performances of Cameron's career. I would argue this is Cameron Diaz's best movie.\n\nThe writing is fresh and Charles McCarthy Jr. deserves more credit. Maybe this movie didn't make as big an impact as No Country for Old Men but it's of the same cloth and equal or greater to in terms of quality. I really hope he keeps writing, this man has amazing talent and the world could use more writers like him.\n\nThe entire cast is spot on and their director gets a superb performance from each and every actor.

        "review_detailed_main": "One year after the release, I have now seen this movie a couple (of couples) of times, and there is something I need to write down about it. In short: I feel this is one of the greatest movies I have seen in a while, and I believe that it will be considered much more relevant than many so-called contemporary masterpieces from tomorrow's critics and audiences. I am perfectly aware of the long list of remarks this movie have received: too many dialogues, don't understand the story, the Ferrari rape, too much overall seriousness throughout the whole thing. All these observations would be quite correct if The Counselor was intended to be a normal movie, say, a drug story with some romance, some action, all of them nicely packaged between a credible beginning and a logical ending. But The Counselor is one of those very rare movies that are done to make a statement, not to tell a story. The statement is not subtle, and should be more than clear already if you have seen the movie, but I will repeat it: evil exists, so beware, because you can choose to stay away from it or to mess with it, and if you mess with evil, then evil mess with you \u2013 to, eventually, prevail.\n\nI believe that in front of certain movies you have to move out from the nerdish attitude, stop looking for flaws in the story and dialogues. The people in the movie do not talk (or behave, btw) like normal people, simply because they are not normal people: they are examples, metaphors, personification of greed, weakness, cruelty, innocence. In this story, on the stage there are not people but some capital sins and (few) heavenly virtues, and they are being acted from a bunch of very talented artists \u2013 unless of course you think they are portraying real people, and in this case the actors really would look like a bunch of clowns.\n\nI have been familiar with Cormac McCarthy writing and themes for many years now. He has a very peculiar look on things, which means that he sees strange things in what everybody else see as normal, and viceversa (more or less in the exact same way Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz misunderstand each other in the swimming pool scene). This peculiarity is very hard to translate on the screen, because is not entirely related to something that can be seen, or shown. That's why people talk so much in this movie, and that's why most of the talk is made by those who in Penelope Cruz world would be called the \"bad guys\". They are trying to give some advice. \"Counselor\" may be the name of the main character, yes, but it's more clearly the name of the movie. After many years of fascination, attraction and understanding with the Dark Side, we are uncomfortable with The Counselor, because The Counselor is, very unusually, Evil advocating against himself: and we should listen closely, because it could represents a chance to understand how to stay out from hell, if not forever, at least a little longer than we are expected to do."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ridley Scott is an awesome director and Cormac McCarthy is a skilled writer, even if the subject matter is usually unpleasant. The story here is told with style, and the layered details imply much while directly stating little. Not a \"happy\" story, as the subject matter deals with many of the ugly realities of the illegal drugs trade, but mesmerizing, regardless. The main characters are played perfectly, especially with their character flaws. The tone was reminiscent of previous works, such as No Country for Old Men. Again, the story isn't a crowd-pleaser, and I believe that's actually the point. In that regard, the narrative techniques are very effective. You, as the audience, very much empathize with the protagonist, the Counselor, at the film's premise: you are strapped-in, and along for \"the ride.\" In short, it's very well done, and definitely worth a watch, but you probably won't want to watch it more than once."

To be a HOT SHOT lawyer I think it is most probably a necessity to have both of these. So this film is about a hot shot lawyer, who is pretty successful and wealthy. He has all the things in life most of us can only dream of and yet he wants more. He's not happy with his lot, so as well as defending scumbag criminals he aims to become one himself. Yes he's GREEDY and this will be his downfall.\n\nI saw this in the flicks on release week and enjoyed it, I then watched it again later at home, and yet again just now this evening. Each viewing pulled me in more and more and more, grabbing me, twisting me, disturbing me. I couldn't care a dam about the characters at first, but on each viewing one couldn't help but have a little sympathy for them. Didn't they all deserve what was coming to them? This is an engrossing and compelling work helmed by the genius of RIDLEY SCOTT and slow burns you until the inevitable CHILLING DARK end.\n\nAll the cast in my opinion did a great job of bringing all these egotistical characters to life and if you ignore the many bad reviews that this film has received then you will most likely enjoy this dark thriller."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counsellor is not perfect, but the virtues in my view outweigh the flaws, one of the latter being the too many lyrical speeches on what amounts to the ethics and exercise of choice. It's not the substance of the speeches that palls but their smugness and their length. The musings of one too many cameo characters on the consequences of a choice to seek profit in crime become much more gratuitous than the highly effective, vividly explicit, and powerfully etched scenes of violence.\n\nThe problem addressed in the script by Cormac McCarthy seems broadly this: In what kind of world do we live where the kind of clinical violence routinely practised by the drug cartels is possible? It's a theme McCarthy addressed in No Country For Old Men, but in The Counsellor from the point of view of much less sympathetic main character, not a small town sheriff at the end of a long career of peacekeeping, but a sleekly urbane young lawyer with extravagant tastes.\n\nLike No Country For Old Men, The Counselor shocks and repels on first viewing. But the film stays with you, and you find yourself several months later wanting to see it again. And then you'll know you're going to be watching this film repeatedly, until you exhaust it's force, the compelling questions it asks, the characters it not so much develops as strikingly depicts, and the savage actualities it tries to address."

I don't know if all the bad reviews are from people wanting special effects and action - but this is a film about acting. And the main cast pull something together here that is unique and edgy. It's dark, it builds up to a climatic ending and it also leaves you wondering. As a Ridley Scott film it certainly has a bit of everything. I think if you allow yourself to be fully immersed in the story, you'll enjoy the film. It's like you're sitting there participating in every conversation that takes place. You're an observer of the underworld and underhand activities that unfold. And that's great directing. The performances top it off. Bardem is really growing on me. And Diaz is as cold as ice can be. But make sure you watch it on a night when you can give the story the full attention it deserves."

Once you know whodunit it all falls into place.\n\nThe scene where the counselor is talking to the cartel man is worth it alone.\n\nThere's the sex, of course, but strangely I didn't find it off-putting. Normally I don't like sex in movies, they detract from the plot, but in this film it seems quite par for the course and appropriate to that world.\n\nIt's also not as dumb as it looks. Once you know, all the clues are there. That's the sign of a well-written plot, where, despite the clues being given to you, still you're never quite sure till the end.\n\nSo I like this film although it may ultimately be for the more discerning viewer. And that may well account for the mixed reception and low score."

For me I am especially speaking of one involving a trash heap. In the same way the \"shootout\" in No Country For Old Men left everything up to imagination in that case instead of playing it out for the viewer this one does the same but in an even stronger fashion.\n\nIt is truly a masterpiece."

An everyday man wants more Money and turns to the wrong people. What Movies, today, are truly original? not many. when making Movies today and especially in this genre/storyline you must tread carefully and try to create interesting characters and get the right actors and a interesting and detailed surrounding. And this is exactly what the creators have done.\n\nBrad Pitt is outstanding although in a minor role, Fassbender delivers a solid performance as usual, all topped with great actors in small parts, Bruno Ganz (der untergang) as a Diamond dealer in Amsterdam and John Leguizamo (Land of the Dead) as a smalltime crook in Chicago for example.\n\nThe Movie is filled with Matrix-style semi philosophy Worth pondering on and great and colorful dialog.\n\nOn the downside is the unoriginal plot and the somewhat predictable tying-up the loose ends part and the ending of the characters. BUT, listen up folks: do not take the critique of the dialog seriously, it is magnificent and is not at all slowing down the pacing of the Movie. However, if you are dead serious about formula one tempo in a Movie...sure, you might find the Counselor somewhat slow, but NOT intimidating or negative at all.\n\nI give it 8 out of 10. To me, the Counselor is definitive buying-on-DVD material. In all, the quality of the Movie is like Traffic, Savages, Payback."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Counselor, directed by Ridley Scott, written for the screen by Cormac McCarthy, is a violent, nihilistic, edge-of-your seat drug thriller. It's not a movie for mass consumption, but movie-goers who enjoy films with literary value like No Country for Old Men and lurid subject matter like Breaking Bad and will enjoy the tension and relentless, layered action and imagery. I walked away impressed.\n\nThe Counselor brings a strong cast that delivers from top to bottom. Michael Fassbender is fantastic and has really established himself as a Heavy-Hitter in Hollywood. Cameron Diaz kills it and is absolutely terrifying.\n\nThematically, it's typical McCarthy, exploring the consequences of greed and a bleak view of the human condition. The themes of greed and violence are not surprising but the exploration of sexuality, as it relates to both the drug world and to man, are interesting, shocking and in one sequence, hilarious.\n\nIt's more literary than your average popcorn flick. The plot unfolds patiently and is unconventional as far as the storytelling. There is an ominous Chekhov's gun moment early on. There are sequences of dialogue that are deeply rich, both in prose and theme, that demand a second viewing, if not a bit dense the first time through. I loved the ending. Loved it. I actually found myself saying: \"what a great ending\" out loud as it happened on screen.\n\nI'm confident the Counselor is going to be on a short list of the best movies of the year for me, but I do appreciate deep, dark, violent movies more than most."

He truly is the best thing about this film as a flamboyant drug smuggler. Aside from that this film has a tendency to catch you off guard with a conceptualized monologue about let's say women(sexist?) or being cautious.\n\nThe look is there, the unexpected death scene is there, but something is keeping it from being a great film."

Unfortunately, The Counselor is a movie that was swallowed by the audience due to the way it was promoted. This is not an escapist film, it's not an action thriller like all of us expected. On the other hand it is not a profoundly philosophical movie for intellectuals. It is, yes, a movie to feel, to enjoy through incredible dialogs and noir performances through a visual study of greed, love, choices and consequences. It is not a definitive movie, it does not deepen what it presents, but it feasts you with excellency, one that will leave you hypnotized and thoughtful throughout. And that is undeniably great film-making. Visit thefadingcam blog on blogspot for more! Also like us on facebook to follow all our reviews."

I would agree that some of the lines are a bit forced, but I feel that the quality of actors in the cast are able to handle them. The lines spoken by \"The Jefe,\" to Fassbender when he was pleading for mercy was brilliant. Cameron Diaz has continued to impress me over the years. The cameo by Rosie Perez was brilliant in it's subtlety; and Javier Bardem shows great character diversity, since his masterful portrayal of evil personified in \" No Country for Old Men.\" Really, among the \"A\" list actors in the cast only Penelope Cruz disappointed me. In this day of blockbusters and sequels, it's nice to hear some dialog. Yes, a lot was left unexplained, but I never got \"lost,\" in the plot progression."

You have to look through the pretentious dialogue and look what's going on. All the actors were on top of their game. I was pretty much the first time I saw Bardem as a \"good\" guy. Well good would be stretching it but he was not the antagonist. Diaz as the crazy bitch who moves the strings of the puppets was great although she overdid it a bit. Fassbender didn't play such a strong type as he usually does. His \"Counselor\" was a bit naive and unsure. Bratt Pitt of course has the whole sleazy thing down.
