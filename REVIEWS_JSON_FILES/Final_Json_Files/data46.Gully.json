        "review_detailed_main": "This film is about three young guys, all who had bad childhoods, going on a rampage. It started out well but quickly went down hill and ended up a bit of a mess.\n\nThe story was hard to follow. The characters weren't particularly likeable, even with their child hardships revealed. It didn't really feel realistic. I also didn't really understand the Grand Theft Auto graphics and fantasy scenes. They seemed like an afterthought and didn't really fit in and seemed quite random. The film would have been much better without them. Although it is a good idea and done properly and throughout the film could have worked.\n\nOverall it was a good story and idea made into a complete mess. It just gets worse as it goes on. By the last 30mins I wasn't really paying attention. I wouldn't waste your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie fails to give a good story, even though it portrays some problems in society.\n\nThe problem with this film is the script, since there is no defined story, there is no conflict to resolve, there is a lack of character development, sometimes it seems that the actors just say random words. The direction doesn't help much as it doesn't clearly expose everything it wants to say. The performances are decent, but not surprising, it seems that it is just a montage of scenes that wants to show some problems in society. Some topics that are touched on, but very superficially, are that the teachings of our parents and the experiences of childhood are what will shape us when we will became adults and will be reflected in our personality and in our actions, also talks about delinquency and society's rejection of certain young people who had a hard childhood. The movie also has flashbacks that lead nowhere and an ending that is confusing and makes no sense.\n\nThe lack of focus of this film causes it to be completely ruined by not being clear about the story to be told, just as the situations that occur are very uncomfortable to watch and very difficult to digest, it is a bad film but not because of the actors and actresses that are part of it, it is a bad film because of the poor script and bad direction that ruins any good idea in the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hyperbole to say the least. I saw this movie pop up on Hulu and I added it to my watchlist when I saw the cast (Kelvin Harrison, Jacob Latimore, Jonathan Majors, Terrence Howard). Then, I looked it up on IMDb, because I'm that person and was appalled to see a rating of 1.4. I have never seen a movie have such a low rating. Ever. So I purposely watched it in hopes of disproving those opinions. And while it was not an Academy Award nom by any means, it wasn't that bad. Not necessarily good, but definitely not that bad. Also, the synopses are trash as well, because there was little to no drug use at all, just a few references, so maybe do better there as well. The movie is about three friends in the inner city of LA that are all going through their own struggles. One struggle overshadows the other, for (somewhat) obvious reasons. The friends decide they will take it upon themselves to fix said problem, and it kind of unravels from there. If anything, the worst part of the movie is the gaping plot holes throughout. Also, a number of characters weren't needed and those that were never had any real development so you're left confused more often than not by some of their actions. Even still, I've seen worse movies and there's no way this deserves a 1.4. I encourage you to watch for yourself and go into it knowing that even though some people didn't care for it, you very well could. I have not rated a movie on IMDb in literal years, but I couldn't just let people trash this movie when there are far worse getting praise on a regular basis."

Even the violence and sex are not anything different to what has been done before and it's easily watchable on autopilot without taking in what has been watched because it really didn't make any difference to the story. The music is just the same old sound that accompanies this same old drama that gets told again and again and inevitably just becomes the normal easily switched off and forget about it film. A good film needs to have impact to everyone. The low scores demonstrate this film has no impact which is a shame as in a good story that has the viewer engrossed in what will happen next, some of these actors could really shine."

It surprised me, but that's only because I read some reviews beforehand. I hope you're not doing that. I hope you are reading this after you have watched the film, and you now know for yourself what a treasure this film is.\n\nYou may disagree, and that's OK. It may not be for you, it was for me. It is for me.\n\nGully is all about life's situations, and the options or choices available to these four friends, some of whom think their lives are summed up thus: \"D is for damned\".\n\nIt is a magical film of hope that blurs the lines between truth and fantasy, but within each scenario is the every present eye in the sky of the police helicopter, or someone somewhere watching.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the fact that none of the main four characters have stereotypical life stories as is usually portrayed in tales from the streets of LA, however all of them are impacted by events in their past that influence their present, and is destined to direct the path to their futures.\n\nThroughout the story it's almost as if they are in a trance at pivotal moments in their lives, with their action overtaken by something they cannot, or do not want to, control. At times, it's like their lives are a game that they are playing, not ones they are living - a way to cope, maybe? They are always looking for a way out. They are all looking to fulfil the promises of a new born life, but constantly dealing with all the things in their lives that are broken obstacles in their paths.\n\nThere are some violent scenes, but also portrayals of beautiful family relationships and neighbourhood friendships; these are particular touches of joy and humour.\n\nTerrence Howard, as Mr Christmas is the reluctant prophet of the film, appearing as and when needed to sprinkle words or either wisdom or warning; he sees and knows more than he wants to and shares from both vessels willingly.\n\nKelvin Harrison Jr., Jacob Latimore, Charlie Plummer, and Jonathan Majors perform well as individuals and as a unit where the business of one is the business of them all; they are loyal.\n\nThis is a dreamlike film, with a haunting soundtrack.\n\nI have watched it twice already."

Imaginative story telling.\n\nThe problem isn't the movie, it's people tuning in because they see actors like Jacob Latimore and Terrence Howard expecting Chicago or Empire. This isn't that. Everything doesn't have to be that. Someone commented \"don't expect Boyz in the Hood.\" Why would anyone expect that or even compare these two films? Entirely different movies, and you can STILL enjoy Gully even if it doesn't fit the urban California drama format.\n\nLOVED this movie. Especially the imaginative ending.

Although they are an extremely voilent trio that you would not like to meet on a night out, their loyalty to each other makes them likable. They are 3 teens with serious pschological issues and poor childhoods who are just up to no good really. This movie is not a happy fairytale but instead an accurate representation of the harsh lives that some of the youth of LA have to lead. Gully also has some beautilly taken classic shots of LA ,fantastic place to see, tough place to live. Give it a go decent film."

That may have been the plan when they walked out their doors but what follows is a violent journey where they commit various violent criminal acts, up to and including murder. Intertwined with this we see flashbacks to their troubled pasts; this explains some, but by no means all of what they do.\n\nI thought this was a solid enough film. It isn't the easiest of viewing as the protagonists aren't particularly sympathetic; even when we learn about their pasts is doesn't justify most of the things they do. Of course that is often the way with real life too; not all stories have to be about good people. The acting may be a little rough around the edges at times but that suits the gritty feel of the film. The violence has a nasty rather than exciting feel; clearly designed to shock and disturb not merely entertain. The locations used gave a good sense of the place; it didn't look like a haven of criminals; it looked like somewhere inhabited by people endeavouring to get by with what little they have. Overall I'd say this was a decent film; perhaps not a must see but still worth a watch."

Everyone should watch this movie and hopefully realize that there are lot of people with childhood trauma that don't have any help and direction in their life . Next time I see kids rolling in stollen Mercedes I'll know ! Thank you for making this movie ."

Who was owner of laundry."

        "review_detailed_main": "Three teens living in Los Angeles, all victims of extreme childhoods, set off a citywide rampage with no strings attached. They take us on a terrifying journey of drugs and murder through Los Angeles.\n\nA heavy film, from the flashback of the protagonists, with different types of abuse and violence, against children or their parents, a faithful portrait of the periphery, mistreated and marginalized, a painful film... Dark photography, flirts with games in good times, very intimate, necessary and revolting... Children from the periphery suffering more than any adult, a dark and frightening reality... Exciting..."

I really wanted to know Jesse's outcome due to his background story...did they figure out or know what actually happened to him...it ended without knowing if...well you have to watch to understand.\n\nOverall, this movie needs a higher rating than it shows...it touched on some very interesting and important issues...some insight as to why some people end up making some bad decisions.\n\nJust watched Kelvin Harrison Jr. In Chevalier which drew me to finding more movies with him. Love Jacob Latimore's work from The Chi he was awesome in this too!! Jonathan Majors...love him in everything...just didn't quite understand his purpose in this one other than....uhmm would be a spoiler if I mention it! Just introduced to Charlie Plummer...great job.\n\nOverall, I found this movie very intriguing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Perfectly encapsulates the disparity between white privilege and black impoverished America. Traumatic childhoods bond three teens tightly together for survival and mutual companionship, unconditionally accepting of each other. They've matured on their own with little to no guidance amid dysfunctional family environments and influences; one raised by a white single mother of two with no functional employment prospects, another struggles with serious mental illness, and the third is victim of a crime of opportunity, kidnapped and held for a decade by a white pedophile from a loving and encouraging mother. A true expose on the reality of how unresolved childhood trauma drives teenage behaviours. This movie connects all the dots, and is sheer brilliance!!"
