        "review_title": "Just don't watch the trailer",
        "review_detailed_main": "One of the biggest faults of this movie, funny enough, isn't anything to do with the movie itself but the promotions for it. If you have seen the trailer for this movie then you've pretty much seen the entire movie, including the big twist reveal, which sucks as the story has so much potential. In the right capable hands, a story of someone trying to find their long-lost family and then ending up in a horror situation can be pretty good but here, it falls flat. The story takes forever to get going and once it does start to pick up the pace the movie was almost over. I know that horror movies need time to set up the setting and dynamics but this movie just did WAY too much of that. I've heard a lot of people say this and honestly, I agree with them that this story would be better as a RomCom. The two leads, more on them later, have chemistry between the two of them that just gets wasted because of the story of this movie. If it had been a RomCom movie it might've been one I actually enjoyed as it would've been a unique movie. I quickly touched on this earlier but my biggest issue with this movie wasn't the story for this movie, I already figured the trailer spoiled the whole movie, but the pacing of the movie. This movie is a horror thriller movie and the pacing for this movie didn't match that one bit. It had slower pacing to it which can be effective in the right kind of horror movie but definitely not here. I guess the slow pacing of this movie was supposed to help keep the suspense of wondering what's really happening in the manor but like I said the trailer already ruined that mystery so it wasn't effective. Also due to the slow pacing of the movie the ending for this movie gets severely rushed.\n\nThe ending for this movie just isn't satisfactory and just leaves the audience scratching their heads wondering what just happened. The ending also leaves on kind of a cliffhanger that doesn't need to be a cliffhanger and I wish it had ended earlier. While watching this movie I was preparing myself to say other than the acting in this movie the cinematography for this movie was great and then the more I thought about it the less I enjoyed it. The part I enjoyed of the cinematography was the set design for the manor. The manor itself was gorgeous and had this unease about it right from the get-go. I feel like I would rewatch this movie just to try and pick up the subtle details in the design work for this manor as I feel like I missed a bunch. Another element that works but only to a certain extent is the lighting for this movie. The lighting for this movie creates a great atmosphere and adds to the gothic nature of the manor but it also has a downside as I said that's because this is a horror movie and horror movies are supposed to have scares in them and due to the darkened lighting it's hard to see them. You can kind of tell based on the shadows if something scary is going to happen but for the most part, you can't see them and it just seems like something in the background. Now, these kinds of scares can work but they need to be directed properly and unfortunately for this movie that didn't happen. Now, I know that Jessica M. Thompson did her best with this movie especially with this being her first feature film but unfortunately there were some questionable directing choices. As I said most of them just surround the scares in this movie but also with death scenes in this movie. I won't fully go into detail about the death scenes for this movie but all I'll say is they don't match the 14A rating at all. I already mentioned this but really the only fully good element of this movie is the acting in it. The acting for this movie both worked for whichever story you decide to watch this movie as. If you decide to watch this story like it's a Vampire romance or a horror movie it is the acting works for both versions.\n\nThis fully steams to the main two actors Nathalie Emmanuel and Thomas Doherty, who plays Walter. The two of them surprisingly had decent chemistry together and made this movie slightly enjoyable. I really enjoyed Nathalie Emmanuel's performance as Evie that even without the romance element she would've stood out the most. She plays Evie in such a modern final girl way and even though she might not be the best final girl out there she still proved how smart she is even with the story does have her making some dumb decisions. But for me personally, the standout performance of the movie is Thomas Doherty. He plays Walter in such a manipulative and conniving way that if you were in this situation you would trust him. When you first meet Walter you can easily tell there's something off about him and if you didn't watch the trailer you're wondering what's fully up with him. Even the side actors were really good in this movie even if you don't get to see them as much. In the end, The Invitation had the potential to be a really good movie but because of the trailer it just falls short. If you go see this movie just play the fun game of switching the genre depending on what's happening in the scene."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was excited to see this because I knew the lead actors for playing support roles only like Nathalie Emmanuel in GOT and fast and furious or Thomas Doherty in high fidelity and legacies. I love how it starts off dark, it's not uncommon for recent horrors to ease you in by starting out like any regular movie before throwing you into the dark. It maintains it's gloomy nature despite the characters having a more cheery aura, but you feel something's off. It's like a blend of midsommer, Ready or Not and Get Out, with a fantasy element to it. Midsommer and Ready Or Not were more bloody thrillers than actual horrors in my opinion while this was actively trying to scare you. It has a more old fashioned horror feel compared to recent 'blockbuster horrors' (I don't know if that's a thing); everything happens in the dark, there's a lot of build up and I loved how 3AM was made the hour the devil comes out to play. It also leaned on it's gloomy atmosphere and jump scares for the horror element.\n\nThere's a lot of build up to most scenes so it was slow paced, I felt some silences were literally just 2s too long. Second twist in the third act of the movie wasn't pretty underwhelming, and this was meant to be the big closer. I also try to avoid trailers but i saw a teaser that ruined the suspense and thrill of one of the scenes, so I suggest doing a better job at avoiding them than I did. For that same reason, when everything unveiled I was pleasantly surprised it's not the genre of horror I thought this was going to be, won't say 'cause I don't wanna spoil it for you but I haven't seen a horror in this fantasy genre in a while so I loved it.\n\nAll in all, I think it's a good movie that was supposed to be better than it is because the climax scenes don't hit as high as they're meant to, with a rushed finale to top that. Otherwise the movie doesn't do much wrong and is worth a watch for me. Somebody said it's a feminist movie, I see where they're coming from but that's such a reach man."

I will agree that the spent a lot of time on the build up and that the ending happened fairly quickly but I honestly didn't mind that. I don't give away any spoilers but sufficed to say, it's a satisfying ending. It's not one of those horror movies with an ending that feels incomplete or hangs in the air. I thought the acting was good and the sets were absolutely beautiful. I also appreciated that it was an hour and 40 mins. So many filmmakers think all movies have to be 2 hours now and this was clearly an example of a movie that did not. I won't be rewatching it, but I still felt like it was a good use of my time."

        "review_title": "You might want to decline this invitation until home release",
        "review_detailed_main": "LIKES:\n\nThe Pace: It's fast, it doesn't get stuck too much in trivial world building, and it gets to the antics very quickly to start getting into the thrills. The Invitation has a lot of things to decipher in the short run time, but it's always moving and seldom slowing down to get bogged in higher order thinking. For those looking for just a way to turn off the mind, this can be a giant plus alongside the appeal of one component of the story.\n\nThe Setting: It's a beautiful world they have shot/created, in this movie. A European centered mansion and castle that is sort of the dark version of Downton Abbey. The rooms they play in are immaculate, both high society, but several holding darker undertones that tell a story almost better than the actual words and story itself. I highly enjoyed the realistic manor and sort of felt like a board game or mystery room feel that could have been used so well.\n\nThe Potential Story: The story is not the worst I've seen, and holds some elements of an engaging character. This film is a neo-gothic style drama with elements of horror and romance sprinkled in to try and live up to the stories of the classic horror films. Paying homage to the tales it references were nice, and there was a lot of quality points they could have used to help guide this to be one of the better tales. Throw in some darker comedy like Ready or Not, and the overall feel of the movie showed there was potential.\n\nThe Lighting Effects: A small and subtle nod to the elements, the lighting really tells much of the story and brings much of the emotion in this film. From the opening scene, every moment has an area of lighting that sets the tone of the moment and suggest the element of the scene. Foreboding dark rooms make the moment obvious, but other elements that blend dark and light each offer a level of safety to dive into.\n\nThe Costumes: Now my second favorite component, the costumes and makeup of the movie are fantastic for me given what I guess was \"lower\" budget production. The Invitation may not be dressing up the groups in superhero underwear, or the most amazing warrior costumes, but the costumes chosen really do blend the modern and traditional well. Fantastic dresses are my favorite, the material holding a lot of design qualities that tell their own story while also really accomplishing the attitudes of the characters who wear them. Male characters often have the shirts found in many English tales, part class and debonair mixed with something more as the story progresses. Throw in the more \"romantic\" moments and the modern blend comes in to help reestablish the timelines. And when makeup is needed for the various events that occurred, once more the effects of mimicking blood, paleness, and injuries continuing to be realistic and incredible.\n\nThe Effects: I can't say much about this without giving away an obvious point. The Invitation has moments that really require certain computer animation effects, editing, and prosthetics to help accomplish the tasks at hand. I loved it, and the sneaking subtle moments give you a taste of the big moments at the end of the movie to come. That blend of using prosthetics and the computer met the balance so many movies fail to achieve and I only wish we had more time with it.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nPredictable: I got it from the trailer even though the clips did not reveal what the twist was. The movie should not be too hard to decipher what will happen as the dialogue plays out. The clues are handed a little too easily, the hints too obvious and of course the subtle things sneaking out a bit to reveal the big twist. Had the other elements not taken a hit because of this, or there had been more story element, this would not have been an issue, but something was just askew that led to predictability being too much.\n\nNot Scary/Suspenseful: They dock it up it as a horror film of the century, but it lacked scares for me in this film despite their best attempts. Much of this has to do with how desensitized I am to the trailer, but the elements don't quite mix well for me to execute the full effect of the horror to be really scary. It lacks a creepy atmosphere, the intensity of the horror is blunted by quick finishes, and the direction eventually takes it to neo-gothic style drama over anything else. Thus, with such changes in style and several other factors, the movie's horror element is dull.\n\nRushed Story: That pace might be good for getting in and out of the theater, and also trying to get to all the parts they want to talk about. However, the story that held a lot of potential also got sideswiped a bit in the process, resulting in of course missing pieces. The Invitation has so many components that a book form would do well to elaborate, build, and expand upon that a movie seemed to have suffered with time limits. The main character Evie, has a lot of potential for uncovering her past, facing her hardships, and fostering bonds, but it's all lost to the fleeting time. Then the mystery of the manor and trying to figure out the truth was robbed even more of the quality, each act feeling like a set up to something big and then just fizzling out. Again so much potential, but lost.\n\nForced Performances: I can't deny this, the acting does at times get too force and lose the presentation that they were doing. Primarily at the end, many actors have to transition into a different kind of acting, one that either did not get rehearsed as well as they could, or was just planned to be this extravagant in the forced gestures, acting, and screaming that comes. It lost the class I was seeing, and the whole conclusion seemed very dropped in a mad rush to get to the end. Some people suffered through the movie itself, Corneliussen playing her arrogance a might too strong, but it's that ending where the cheese factor oozes out.\n\nAn Attempt At Action: I said earlier that the movie tries to incorporate a lot of genre elements into the mix. Well, the ending makes a break for trying add a little excitement by converting it into an action film moment to bring about the full end. The fight is, well it's mediocre at best for me, fitting with the setting, but give the buildup did little to match what other movies of this genre could do. The choreography was extremely limited, the acting forced and awkward, and the time with it was again very limited, meaning it felt like the action in a Soap Opera with slaps and screams, than actual merit. And when the story elements drag in and the dialogue creeps in, this moment just fails outside of a some sweet finishes to heighten the drama component. It wasn't needed to this caliber, and I would have liked to see more strategy or rehearsal come in for it to be included.\n\nThe Lack Of Focused Direction: My buddy said it best, the heart of The Invitation's problems arises in the lack of focused direction for the film and trying to do too much in such a short time. All these elements do give nods to the tropes of the horror theme they were going for, but none of them fully deliver to tie them all well. This comes with time, focus, and in all honesty a mini-series or book to flesh it all out in the proper details and tie ins. Because of that, all the moments are okay and will fill the time with something, but the promise again was sullied by too much at once and becoming more a mess that is just okay.\n\nThe VERDICT: The Invitation shows how ideas have an immense promise and the modern edge of retelling and combination could work if planned out right. There are so many homages and snippets of scenes that work and had me intrigued, but then get ripped away to mediocre finishes and hasty tie ups. What results is an average movie that is more neo-gothic drama with some thriller twists, that should be good for a teenager based audience. Note, there are some moments that might be harder for people to see in the form of boundary violation, torture, confinement, and some rather occult appetites that sensitive people will the. Past that though, the chill and scare factor are minimal and in all honesty quite boring to watch given what the trailers promised. Predictable plots, messy editing, rushed story elements, and other hasty decisions just robbed the full splendor this movie could have been. I can't say this one is a theater visit outside the aesthetics, and would rather watch it at home instead. Thus, this films scores come at:\n\nHorror/Thriller: 5.0 Movie Overall: 5.5."

So I was not really that interested when it first came out because I was tired of seeing all powerful vampires being easily killed just because our characters know they were vampires. However, the interesting thing about this movie, is that it plays like a romance movie mixed with vampire horror. There are a few kills sprinkled to remind you this is a horror movie, but a majority of the time is Nathalie Emmanuel romancing with Thomas Doherty in an aristocratic setting until the vampire horror stuff starts. This is where Emmanuel believably plays victim to circumstances, and she is not become an all powerful heroine who easily kills the villain in the end. She struggles in every thing. Another interesting is how the movie drops hints throughout the story, and you would see how it all fits. But I think the ending was too rushed and not impactful enough. The build up was slow and when it reached the part where the conspiracy unfolds, and everything is revealed, some characters change so inorganically to look menacing but it does not work. Fortunately, Nathalie Emmanuel's character seemed consistent, and many others too. So you even after the reveal, you could understand why they are acting that way. I also like the after credit scene. I don't know if it hints a sequel, or just an epilogue but it is interesting."

At one event she gets a goodie bag with a free DNA Test. The results show that she has English relatives who are well off. A cousin pays for her to come to England to attend a family reunion in Whitby where they are all attending the wedding of their aristocratic acquaintance and patron, Walter DeVille. If we hadn't been forewarned by the prequel we would still reckon there was something creepy about DeVilles stately manor, given the paintings and sculptures, the way the internal gloom counterpoised the gleaming stone exterior. A creepy butler appears to play a part in the disappearance of waitresses hired to cater for the wedding. Wonder eerie cobweb encrusted wine cellars and a dark library room provide the perfect locations for attacks where we can't quite make out the assailant. As the narrative unfolds the nature of the attacker becomes clearer and the horror scenes are more explicit, Some gore is spilled but more is saved. While yiu might guess as to what's going on from an early stage I'll refrain from spoilers here. The mansion itself is virtually a character as are it's environs with some vivid overhead shots of dancing. Not really original but it does try a new angle on an old trope, a romance as well as a horror story, it's well worth a viewing. Directed by Jessica M. Thompson, written by Blair Butler. 7/10."

I went into it knowing nothing but \"horror.\" Finding out what it's about as the story unfolds is part of the reason I had so much fun. I feel bad for anyone who watched the trailer which ruins EVERYTHING. This is why I don't watch trailers.\n\nThis movie feels like an odd mashup of a bunch of other movies. It results in something that oddly feels different. Nathalie Emmanuel continues to prove she belongs. I feel like she's a star in the making. The rest of the cast plays their roles well. The movie has a certain charm about it, and has a good amount of comedic moments. I found myself smiling for most of the runtime. And I jumped more than once.\n\nA few things held it back for me. There are some flaws and typical horror tropes like a couple jump scares that make no logical sense. It didn't finish as strongly as I would've liked. And I wish it was rated R so it wasn't restrained. But in the end, I had a great time with The Invitation. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 8/25/2022)"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Invitation\" sucks! Any review that you read with a score higher than a 5 out of 10 is a straight up lie - and I don't say that lightly; no man, woman, or child can watch this movie and legitimately think that it's good. From the opening scene, you can inherently tell that this movie will be the pinnacle of mediocre, and at least from that perspective it doesn't disappoint!\n\nA self-proclaimed vampire film (this isn't a spoiler, as the trailer literally gave away the entire plot of this film), \"The Invitation's\" first sin is being PG-13. Sure, there are some moments here and there that push the boundaries with little spurts of blood and quickly edited around gore, but other than that - for a vampire movie - this was weirdly bloodless. But I get it! The studio wants to get as many butts in seats as possible; how about making a quality movie first? An R rating doesn't matter as long as the movie is good, but \"The Invitation\" is not.\n\nGod, I don't even know where to start with this, because literally every aspect of this movie was bad. The dialogue! Oh sweet Lord, the dialogue - I wanted to stick needles in my ears to stop myself from hearing the utterly cringeworthy lines that came out of everyone's mouth. The acting? It was fine; everyone was a good actor, it's just that the script dragged them down into the very depths of hell. The action? Ha! What action?\n\nThis movie is an hour and 44 minutes long, and an hour and 10 minutes is spent dragging the plot out through the dirt. I'm not even kidding - I checked my watch; the horror shenanigans start when there is only 30 minutes left in the movie. By that point, the movie is practically over and every viewer is checked out due to the previous hour and 10 minutes of soap opera crap. But fine, if the final 30 minutes was good, then all would be forgiven - but it's not good. The final 30 minutes are not only all spoiled in the trailer but also aren't fun to watch even when expanded upon. Awful CGI, terrible editing, and poorly filmed fight sequences are all you'll be privy to - add the PG-13 rating, and you get nary a blood spurt to enjoy.\n\nAnd speaking of editing, sweet Jesus, it's so bad. Every scene is edited in a tactical, almost methodical way - one that is reserved for direct to TV garbage. There is no skill at play here; it's almost like the entire crew read a \"Filmmaking for Dummies\" book, and took every line to heart in every single aspect of the filmmaking process. Nothing is innovative, nothing is creative, and nothing is entertaining.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this three stars out of 10 is because it didn't bore me - my utter disbelief at how poor this movie was kept me engaged until the end. I didn't despise this movie, but I'm shocked that the studio allowed something of this caliber to be released in theatres. Do I regret my decision to see this? The answer is a resounding yes - don't make my same mistake."

There's a decent supporting cast too and overall a good selection of characters.\n\nAs mentioned though this film never really manages to reach its full potential. I think it has a great concept, and maybe even one that would have been better explored over a limited series than a film.

Thompson & Written by Blair Butler.\n\nPS: Do Not Watch The Trailer\n\nHaving no prior knowledge of this movie, I enjoyed it.\n\nWe see a huge estates castle in the movie's opening scene.\n\nThen we entered the interior in a complete Gothic atmosphere and the lighting was absolutely stunning.\n\nWhen a butler asks his Ma'am to eat because she is weak, she pushes him out and commits suicide by hanging. The special shot reminds me of a movie that started the same way in 2006 named 'STAY ALIVE' directed by William Brent Bell.\n\nAs Evelyn or Evie 'Misandei' in Game of Thrones, she works as a freelancer as an ordinary girl from New York. In addition to her profession, she is also a ceramic artist. She lost her mother to cancer a few months earlier and her father when she was 14 years old.\n\nPreviously unknown to Evie, she got a DNA match with an English cousin.\n\nLater on, she is invited to England's countryside for the wedding of her new cousin.\n\nHere the adventure gets started.\n\nFor a movie rated PG-13, it's really TOP: No much blood, the scares are too mild and not effective.\n\nFrom my humble point of view, The Invitation is a Thriller Romance movie with some Horror elements.\n\nEvie and Walter, interpreted by Thomas Doherty, they had positive chemistry together. I really enjoyed their brief conversations with so much desire in their eyes. The kissing scenes are so sweet and warm, as I said, it's a well-done PG-13 movie.\n\nThis was a good movie in terms of technical characteristics: the costumes were stylish and the lighting was amazing, creating a completely gothic atmosphere that reminded me of Tim Burton's films, interpreted by the famous Johnny Depp, with a very cold and dark atmosphere. Although the film is not a true horror, the production quality is much higher than most of the other horrors.\n\nThe acting and the cinematography were great. If you want to watch a vampire romance movie, I recommend it to you. You'll enjoy it.\n\nEnglish-centered mansion and castle in the countryside of England. This is the decor of most of the movie. The library and the wine cave made me feel like I was a character inside a thriller book. The rooms are well decorated and well lighted: Dark rooms make the moment obvious, but other elements that blend dark and light offer some safety to dive into.\n\nThe story is medium, good enough, and holds some elements of an engaging character. It was the vampire plot line that provided the biggest twist for me because there was a lot of mystery about what was going on in the castle. I watched the movie blind, having never seen a trailer or synopsis. I had so much fun with it and unlike many things, I've seen recently.\n\nGuys thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed the movie review. You can leave a comment under the article asking me questions or suggesting some movie that you want me to a review for you.\n\nThanks."

It was a better romance than it was a horror but, that's not what it billed itself as nor any I went, so that was annoying. Then if course because it's 2022 they made sure the main character and her friend frequently made racist comments about white people. This plus the entitled and arrogant millennial attitude left the main character unlikable. There were no real reaming qualities to make up for this mess.\n\nRent twilight, watch Hallmark and chat with a college student instead. Will save you money and give you the gist."

The acting is horrible, the dialogue is awful, and there is nothing about it his movie that was good. Very little action, no gore, very little blood, and conveniently off screen kills that didn't show anything. They spent so much time trying to push the main character's racial issues that it became offensive and annoying. Boring, cringey, and offensive are just a few of the words that come to mind. They failed miserably and I recommend anyone who actually likes vampire films to avoid it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not sure why the ratings are this low, I didn't really like this movie but it's not that bad to the point that it makes someone cringe to death. The beginning was bad it was straight up really cliche, really forced, boring, and not enough build up or action. The second half was not so bad kind of redeeming itself, except for the ending. The ending was horrible, rushed, and genuinely pathetic that anyone with half a brain cell can agree on how stupid the ending was. Most of this movie was eye candy, we have beautiful landscape, beautiful mansion, the costumes, people, all beautiful. The story is actually not that bad if anything this movie taught me never to take a DNA test. However, if the writers had spent more time cutting out the unnecessary bits at the start, then the ending would not have been so rushed. I'd give it a higher score had it had that. Despite the storyline being okay, the writers messed up big time. Sometimes I wonder how Hollywood writers just don't see the missing dots or plot holes that are incredibly blatant to the eye. It's like they're all smoking something when writing these scripts. I just feel bad for all the people that gave great effort to make this movie, however despite all the bad it is entertaining. That's why I gave it a 7, you just have to turn off your thinking noggin and complain about how bad the movie was at the end of it. If one does not think this movie is pretty interesting. It's not scary at all, but it's got some intrigue. Sure it's predictable as hell, but not so bad overall. I'd only recommended watching this movie when you're doing laundry or something it's more entertaining that way."

But then you see how dumb the main character actually is and overly naive. And then after that you know what's going to happen at the end and who is going to survive.\n\nThere is nothing about it that is remotely interesting. Nothing about it remotely creative. Nothing about it that says... hey lets watch this movie again. Instead is a movie that exists for the sake of existing. Wasting time watching paint dry while seeing how much grass grows in an hour would be more interesting than this movie.\n\nDo yourself a favor... skip it.

Then the movie developed into something like a Hallmark romance approach with some dumb moves and cliche script (though the pairing of the couple was quite good to watch) and just as I was about to fast forward as I usually do when I had to watch a Hallmark romance movie, it took a turn and creeped up to be a horror movie. I like the surprise twist, the cinematography, a bit of black humor, the building of suspense and the revelation of something horrific that would happen. All in all, an entertaining movie with room for improvement."

I wanted to leave the cinema early, I did not and will not get that time back.\n\nSadly, I feel this could have worked, with better casting, better effects and fewer cultural jokes that lacked a depth of quality.

Thomas' role looked like a lot of fun to play. Sean Pertwee is sensational and why don't we see more of him on the big screen? He photographs so well and his father would have been so proud of his performance in this film. The storyline is easy to comprehend even for people like me who are not so keen on 'fantasy' type films. The locations and sets are alluring. There was a great attention to the minutest of details.

All this great pacing, all this build up and then the ending happens and it's like they completely ran out of money/ ideas and the whole thing crumbles. It's so disappointing, I thought we'll I have to review this because it's such a better movie than the reviews let on, but they are pretty spot on.

Grace gives a bag to Evie she got in the party they are working with a bottle of wine and a DNA kit. Evie is an aspirant ceramic artist that has just lost her mother and has no family. When she sees the DNA kit, she learns that it belongs to a company that researches family trees to locate members. Evie submits her DNA and soon she learns that she has a distant British cousin, Oliver Alexander (Hugh Skinner), who is working in New York. They schedule a meeting at a restaurant where he explains the color of her skin, and he invites Evie to go to a wedding of one member of the Alexander family in England. He pays her ticket and Evie travels and meets Oliver at the airport. They go to an isolated manor, where Evie meets the owner, the handsome Walter \"Walt\" De Ville (Thomas Doherty), after a discussion with the rude butler Mr. Field (Sean Pertwee). She is welcomed by her maid Mrs. Swift (Carol Ann Crawford), by the Alexander family, the friendly Lucy (Alana Boden) and the obnoxious Viktoria (Stephanie Corneliussen). Evie and Walt are attracted by each other, and they have sex. But Evie notes that weird things happen in the mansion, and soon she finds the secret of the families.\n\n\"The Invitation\" (2022) is an underrated vampire movie in IMDb. I had no idea that it was a vampire movie, and the conclusion of the story was a great surprise. Nathalie Emmanuel has a good performance and the explanation for the color of her skin for descent of a British family is given along the film, when she meets Oliver. It is hard to understand the haters of such entertaining movie indicated for fans of the genre. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Convite Maldito\" (\"Dammed Invitation\")"

Take that away and you have the same old story, the main character finds themselves in a big old creepy mansion, with people acting strange and the usual strange happenings going on. How many times has this been done ? There is very little in the way of suspense , scares or gore. It takes forever to get going and it doesn't help that the lead is written as kind of unlikable and acting entitled with attitude. Somehow we're suppose to believe her attitude gives her strength and it doesn't work. I did not see the trailer and I still guessed the outcome way before it happened, this film isn't just poorly made, it's completely predictable. The worst part for me was the nose ring prop. Have you ever watched a film in which a bad wig, or lipstick (bad make-up job) on a male character, detracted from a scene because it's all you could look at ? In this film, the choice to give the lead a nose ring in 95% of the film, left me watching the nose ring and little else, not that most of the scenes were all that interesting to begin with. Just one more recent bad stab at horror."

Thompson has given us a unique movie in the horror genre. It starts off a tad bit slow but, the movie picks up in the second half. The jump scares might work for someone who hasn't watched a single horror film. The plot is quite predictable but, the climax is bonkers and no one can guess what's going to happen next. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Nathalie Emmanuel is spectacular as Evie. I'd love to see Emmanuel headline more films & not just play supporting roles. Thomas Doherty is outstanding as De Ville. Sean Pertwee is fantastic as Renfield. Hugh Skinner is good as Oliver. Carol Ann Crawford is perfect as Mrs. Swift. Alana Boden is excellent as Lucy. Stephanie Corneliussen is phenomenal as Viktoria. The supporting cast is good. The Invitation is worth a watch for horror movie fans & Nathalie Emmanuel fans.

Certainly nothing to write home about but still enjoyable. It looked beautiful and the acting all around was great, particularly the main girl and the duke guy. Performances felt very down to earth for a fantasy subject matter. The ending felt abrupt and rushed... I don't know if it was a lead into a sequel or what but it was a tad unfulfilling.

The Furious movies were okay in my opinion if you have some time to kill and want some cheap fun. This movie is about the same. First, let me just say I'm no fan of PG-13 horror movies but there is enough violence and some pretty decent amounts of blood for an R rating. Still, it did feel as though the filmmakers were holding back just a bit so teens can get into a PG-13 flick and throw their money at it.\n\nFirst, the character played by Natalie Emmanuel is someone we've seen before in 2019's Ready or Not. That movie had lots of gruesome fun and this one follows that formula-sorta. Instead of a bride to be we get a woman who has found her family. Turns out this once lost woman who thought she was alone in this world belongs to an elite wealthy family. Not to give away any twists- there are some so I'm not spoiling.\n\nWe get: some stabbing, bashing, interracial loving, same sex kissing, decent amounts of blood, and a pretty gruesome coyote killing with a tire iron. There's some F bombs and a few other profanities which makes me think had this movie been made 20 years ago it would have been rated R. It probably might have been more original twenty years ago too but nevertheless it's a decent thrill ride at about 100 minutes give or take.\n\nWhile it won't win any academy awards, it is what it is, a pretty decent thriller to tie you over until all those Halloween horror movies come out. Plus, Natalie Emmanuel is nice to look at too."

When a certain point of the movie happens near the 3rd act, I was a bit surprised at where the movie was going.\n\nThe gothic mansion the movie takes place in looked cool and was creepy when needed. The violence in this movie can push the PG-13 rating in ways I was not expecting, by the end of the movie I had questions but though it had at least a satisfying ending.\n\nI wanted more explanations on what certain things happen to the main character, and I wanted to know more about the family's backstory. I also wanted more to happen in the middle of the movie, because it was spreading out moments throughout the movie that was part of the story that I wanted more of.\n\nSome people will like this movie, and some will not, it depends on what you are looking for in a movie like this.

Through a series of pleasant experiences, Evie begins to lower her guard, until a sudden revelation of the manor's true intentions are revealed and she has to try desperately to escape with her life.\n\nThe film a decently acted and shot, but the script is fairly predictable. There are some nice scenes of gore, but for the most part, the film seems tame when compared to similar films in the same genre. The special effects are great and the flow is steady.\n\nWorth a watch!"

Going into the movie, I didn\u00b4t had high expectations after reading the description, but wanted to give it a shot anyway. Now I regret it because I\u00b4ve just wasted 100 minutes of my life.\n\nThe movie consists pretty much of the following: Old cliches in a semi - \"new\" disguise, poor dialogues, dull acting.\n\nDo not waste your time on this movie, I\u00b4m sure there are other movies that might be funny at least.\n\nSean Pertwee's acting was the only good thing about this movie.\n\nIt is unbelievable how this movie was nominated for awards and even more so unbelievable that it won 1 award. Absolutely disgraceful 100 minutes of so called movie that the producers and directors should be ashamed of having in their resumes."

We linger on table setting and tension building for too long.\n\nThe awful truth behind Evie's hosts is finally revealed with roughly 25-30 minutes left to speed-run through the final act. It's rushed to the point where defeating what we believe to be an ancient, god-like force is reduced to 'super easy, barely an inconvenience!'\n\nI had fun viewing this in a premium large-format auditorium, but it's not stellar by any means."

The writing was boring and predictable and the acting was terrible because of it. The cinematography was uninspired as well and the lighting for most of the movie making no sense. Actions were done in pitch black and should have been lit. I watched this movie in a movie theater and couldn't see certain important part of the movie because of how poorly lit the scene was. The only redeeming quality to the film is that the colorist did a great job with what they had. Also sound design did a great job. That's it. Don't watch it.\n\nIt's frustrating to see a movie with so many people above the line being women, and this is the movie that is made. There are great movies out there directed and produced and shot my some of the most talented women on earth. But this movie does none of that justice. I hope they get another chance to do something better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mindless and average terror film is packed with thrills, intrigue, suspense, horror and lots of interminable screams with no much sense. It's a so-so and cliched horror movie with plenty of thrills, chills and creepy set pieces . After the death of her mother and having no other known relatives, Evie (Nathalie Emmanuel of Game of Thrones) takes a DNA test...and discovers a long-lost cousin she never knew she had. As Evie is shocked to discover she has a distant cousin she never knew existed. Invited by her newfound family to a lavish wedding in the English countryside, she's at first seduced by the sexy aristocrat host but is soon thrust into a nightmare of survival as she uncovers twisted secrets in her family's history and the unsettling intentions behind their sinful generosity. As she is happily received at New Carfax Abbey (it is the name of the estate purchased by Dracula in the original Bram Stoker's Dracula, so the name New Carfax Abbey hints at the owner's identity) by handsome host Walter De Ville (Thomas Doherty) who sweeps the American guest off her feet .You are cordially invited to a nightmare generations in the making !. This family's dying to meet you !.\n\nSo-so horror movie with a simple and plain plot about the usual story of a young woman invited to a luxurious mansion where is courted and swept off her feet, only to realize a gothic conspiracy is afoot . A gripping film which still packs a punch , but results to be mediocre . It results to be a chiller with all the special effects budget can be created , being lavishly produced ,but also contains several scenes in little sense and no logic. The film contains lush scenarios, high-energy , noisy thrills , love scenes and spectacular set pieces with a predictable climax . The invitation (2022) has various alternate releases : a \"R-rated\" cut of the film will be released in streaming , other version with more gore, blood , guts , violence and nudity and other slight rendition was removed from the theatrical version for a PG-13 rating with less nudism and gory scenes . The picture is thrilling and exciting, though also a routine terror picture with no much sense at times . The Invitation (2022) pays tribute to the known novel Bram's Stoker's Dracula , such as : The old couple that recapture Evie after her escape are named Jonathan and Mina Harker, which are the names of two very main characters in the book Dracula ; Lucy, one of the brides of Vampire Walter , is also the name of Dracula's victim in Bram Stoker's novel, as well as in numerous film adaptations ; Renfiel played by Sean Pertwee turns out to be a prominent role in Stoker's novel ; Walter's surname, \"De Ville\", is a play on \"devil\"; in modern Romanian, the English translation of \"Dracul\" is \"devil,\" further hinting at his true identity as Dracula ; Dracula's name in medieval Romanian is the genitive form of the word \"Dracul\", meaning \"son of the dragon .\n\nHere stands out the colorful and brilliant cinematography by cameraman Autumn Eakin , shot in filming locations from N\u00e1dasdy Mansion in N\u00e1daslad\u00e1ny, Hungary, Budapest, Hungary, P\u00e1risi Udvar Hotel Budapest, Hungary . . As well as frighteing and suspenseful musical score by Dara Taylor . The motion picture was regularly directed by Jessica M. Thompson who was born in Sydney, Nueva Gales del Sur, Australia. She is a fine craftsman whose film debut was : The light of the moon and directing TV series as The End , Unstoppable and various Shorts . Rating : 5/10 , average , but passable ."

Too much of the film counted on a superficial relationship between characters that felt lazy.

The movie gets utterly ridiculous and sheds its gothic horror feel for some silly superhero scenes between dracula's brides with bad CGI. Should have stuck with the gothic horror element."

It definitely changed key once the plot escalated, leaning into camp in regard to fight scenes, one liners, etc. Noticeable, but not off-putting enough to ruin the flow of the movie and enjoyable even as a fan of all the facets of the horror genre.\n\nThe ending felt very rushed and unsatisfying, but I still enjoyed the ride."

The main character does a great job at playing a person who receives an invitation to a wedding for people she's never met and is in another country.\n\nIt's a clever take on a classic love story. I didn't really care for the one British guy who owned the house. The film also missed an opportunity to remake the scene from ghost where they're doing the ceramics. That would have been cool to see that on the big screen again.\n\nAlthough both movies involve ceramics, this film has almost nothing in common with Ghost. For one there's no ghosts, and two there's no one pretending to be a psychic. I also like the scene where Patrick Swayze lifts the penny through the door.\n\nOverall The Invitation has little in common with Ghost, but is still worth watching if you like British accents."

The only thing that kept me going through the movie was honestly the chemistry between Nathalie Emmanuel (Evie) and Thomas Doherty (Walt). In the first half of the movie there are some clever background scary parts that built the thrill and suit the horror element and also make you invest in the story. But as soon as the \"secret\" was revealed it was unbearable to watch! It really made the whole movie look extremely cheap and ruined everything that was good about it in the start!"

It's pretty. It takes itself seriously and that's a good thing.\n\nIt's worth owning on Blu ray upon release. But it's also a great date night movie at the theater.\n\nIt's also worth a second look.

Stop using black people as a prop... The vampire is handsome as hell! Where the hell did he come from, he's gorgeous.

Well if you watched Game of Thrones, you may recognize her, even if she may not have had the biggest role in the show, it was way more than it being a minor part. That said, she is also part of the Fast and Furious franchise - although I could not pinpoint which part was the one she first appeared (as a hacker nonetheless).\n\nI was lucky enough to see her at convention - and let me tell you she is even more mesmerizing in person than what you may think of her when you see her on your screen (or any screen for that matter). All that being said, I would be remiss to say that the movie itself does lack certain things. One of those things may be violence - although I wasn't thinking that while I watched in the cinema, apparently a longer cut will be released at a later date. Which quite likely will include more violence and blood - maybe even some sensual/sexual stuff, but no word on that yet as far as I know.\n\nStill the movie does work as horror movie and the two best friends thing - or rather the dialog between them feels authentic. Maybe a bit too much at times (the movie is over a 100 minutes long and it seems it could have done with cuts, rather being extended - no pun intended) - but you'll be the judge of that.\n\nAs with many at least least contemporary horror movies we start with a bang or scare or whatever you want to call it. To set the tone and mood - and then we slow down, to introduce Nathalie and her friend. And the one thing that sets the whole thing in motion. Quite the coincidence one may say ... but it is what it is and you should not question too many things I reckon.\n\nWhile the movie could have been tighter, the characters are clearly painted. There is a high chance you will be able to predict where the movie is going to go next and even without having read anything about it, it was clear what was happening. But even it being so clear, our main character gets drawn even more into the whole mix/game. There are certain elements of Ready or Not that one may feel can be compared with. Of course this is a very different beast - again no pun intended.\n\nAll that said, the movie might float your boat, if you like horror movies to have a romantic angle to them, but also female power ... well sort of."

        "review_detailed_main": "The whole of cinema could probably be put on a spectrum; one side would represent \"director-driven, singular visions,\" and the other would represent \"committee/studio mandated corporate prerogatives.\" The move from one side to the other, hundreds of thousands of films, would represent an increase or decline in cinematic quality, depending on the direction of movement. This pattern would be largely accurate through the entire history of the medium.\n\nSure, there would be exceptions, your Heaven's Gates, your Death to Smoochy's, your Popeyes. M. Night Shyamalan really throws the experiment on its head. But generally, the trend would hold: artistic, personal visions up top, executive-driven, committee-think drivel on bottom. The Invitation is firmly planted toward the latter end of the spectrum.\n\nThe film follows Evie, a young American woman, who discovers that her great grandfather was the servant of a wealthy British family. Upon reaching out to the family, Evie is invited to a wedding on the grounds of an old English manor, and subsequently falls for Walter, the lord of the manor. As peculiar and ghastly occurrences start to haunt the grounds, Evie must reconcile her love for Walter with the new and altogether alien surroundings.\n\nViewers who rarely watch movies (maybe one every two months or so) could be duped into thinking The Invitation is a meaningful or impressive project. Its direction is flat but sleek, it's cinematography is effectively moody, and its twist is exciting and shocking for those who've never seen a plot thicken. But make no mistake; The Invitation is by-the-numbers, a derivative of a derivative, shamelessly ripping off recent hits like Get Out, Ready or Not, and, less directly, Antebellum.\n\nThe film has the least intrigue, least subtlety, and most filler of any entry in the \"young (oppressed group) goes to (rich place) and must violently fight back against (strawman group.)\" genre, which began in earnest with Get Out. The film is made by Sony's Screen Gem division, and the company has handled the material much in the same way they've handled they're Marvel properties. That is, without care or forethought; the entire film reeks of desperation and checklist ticking.\n\nThe fundamental and persistent problem with The Invitation is its script, written by Blair Butler, who has previously penned masterstrokes Polaroid and Hell Fest. Butler's script is amateurish in every regard: the banter between Evie and her friend Grace is forced and inane, the structure drags even while puffed up by rote slasher filler, and the climax should be the most anticlimactic of the year.\n\nThere are zero surprises in The Invitation, zero laughs, and zero fun or suspense. It is, again, totally uninspired and by-the-numbers. To think of how many writers are languishing in obscurity or hardship while material like this is greenlit is sickening. Go into any office drawer in the country and you'd find a piece with more dramatic integrity.\n\nAlthough the script is maddeningly unoriginal, the film as a whole is not irredeemable. Jessica M. Thompson's direction is patient and uncanny at times. The film's opening sequence is wild and unhinged, a decent preamble to the more stately and mannered events to come. The overt horror is not scary, but it is built up with attention to detail and potent tension. The soundtrack is grand if a bit grating. Aside from the last act, which is downright horrendous in every imaginable way, The Invitation is mostly just vaguely average. It's a time-killer that floats by at a reasonable pace.\n\nThe only elements which truly stand out in the film are its cinematography and set design. Cinematographer Autumn Eakin bathes the old manor in a diffused, cool blue light which emphasizes its gothic roots and creates some much-needed atmosphere. The grounds feel cold and alien, but there's also a warm comfort to the luxury of the manor, doused with warm, orange hues. There are also many costumes and sets which exude an old English charm; the prestige of the characters' history is obvious and enticing. Huge props to the location scout and wardrobe department for rising above the material.\n\nOverall, The Invitation is uninspired, predictable, and without thrill. Its characters are caricatures, its politics are hollow, and its themes of identity and class are leaden, dragging down any fun or spooks generated by the competent craft. By far the most interesting thing about the film is just how much is revealed in the trailer, which gives away the central twist and is made mostly of scenes from the third act. If you feel compelled to watch the film, just pop the trailer on and save yourself the drive to the theater and the price of a ticket - it's all there."

Emmanuel, Doherty, Corneliussen and Boden all put it Great Performances. They really got into each of their Roles.\n\n3.

It's that Ending, that Part After the Wedding where Evie makes a Completely Abrupt Decision after the Ritual. Why didn't they build off of the Dilemma Evie was in?\n\n2. Again, Abrupt fight scenes at the end that are over way to quickly.\n\nOverall, That Botched Ending Pretty Much Ruined the Rest of the Movie. From the Start of the Movie to the Wedding Itself is a Fantastic Movie. Just don't watch Anything AFTER the Wedding Ceremony."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE INVITATION is beautifully filmed, and that's about the best recommendation I can give it. The overarching problem here is a script that's so poor and uninspired, it underscores every other flaw.\n\nThis film is supposed to be scary. Instead it's just boring. I love a good slow burn, but THE INVITATION fails to generate any excitement, and the script is the culprit. At the 45-minute mark, I first checked to see how much time was left on the counter. That's never a good sign.\n\nEven the best efforts of Thomas Doherty dutifully showing off his sculpted physique weren't enough to spark interest, but his earnest dedication to the task is greatly appreciated. Had every actor been as adept and charismatic as he -- even with this strained, substandard screenplay -- it might have helped the movie.\n\nThe first hour of THE INVITATION seems interminable, and by the time it attempts to turn itself into an action horror movie, it's too late to recover any momentum. Worse, nothing here makes any sense, and an excess of clumsy exposition midway through isn't the solution, especially when the dialog is nothing special. From the overlong set up to the denoument, the pieces of this puzzle never fit together in a satisfying way. Without spoiling, if one is going to turn convention on its head and break long-established rules, give the audience a fair rationale.\n\nIn one of THE INVITATION's more ridiculous moments, the filmmakers \"hearken\" back to characters from classic literature in a way that totally misapprehends their import and purpose. If one can't hearken better than this, perhaps it's better not to try.\n\nFinally, the filmmakers awkwardly inject a race and class social justice message that's forced and out of place. Unlike other films in which these topics are central and therefore meaningful, here they seem thrown-in, calling attention to themselves in a way that signals desperation to prop up a story that otherwise isn't working. That they include a character who exploits every stereotype of an urban black female played for laughs heightens the impression that the theme is merely an afterthought conceived as a quick fix to an ailing script.\n\nOverall, pretty scenery makes this movie marginally watchable, but you'll need to check your intellect and critical impulses at the door."

        "review_detailed_main": "During these last, lazy days of summer, there isn't a whole lot to do. Still, you're probably going to want to RSVP \"no\" to \"The Invitation.\" It had such potential, too. Director and co-writer Jessica M. Thompson establishes an unsettling mood that suggests we're about to enter a dark and twisted world. But then eventually, her film is just dark-as in, it's hard to see what's happening, with herky-jerky visual effects that are especially off-putting. And when the twist comes as to what's actually going on. Nathalie Emmanuel has an appealing presence, though, as Evelyn-or Evie, as she prefers to be called. The \"Game of Thrones\" actress is a stunner, of course, but there's also a no-nonsense naturalism to her delivery that makes her feel accessible. So when things go sideways on her too-good-to-be-true getaway to the English countryside, we remain on her side throughout. A spa day for Evie and the imposingly glamorous maids of honor (Stephanie Corneliussen and Alana Boden) is staged and paced particularly well. And she could have taken more time in building suspense to the big reveal, which occurs at an ominous, masked dinner party that's like something out of \"Eyes Wide Shut.\" But then everything changes really suddenly, really quickly, and \"The Invitation\" becomes a different movie-a sillier one. The shift into campier territory is jarring and even a little disappointing. It felt like Thompson was onto something here. Instead, she revisits some extremely familiar material in uninspired fashion. The costume design is fabulous, though-the work of Danielle Knox. So even when Emmanuel is forced to do a tough juggling act between horror and comedy, at least she looks great in the process. Now playing in theaters."

In short, it is a waste of time.\n\nAlthough the actors' performances are satisfactory, it seems that they are limited by a poorly constructed script and are finding it challenging to break free from the constraints of an inadequately written and unintelligent plot. In addition, I suspect that the movie's entire team had a particular agenda, which gives the impression that the film is a blend of previously successful scripts produced by genuinely skilled producers. The reality, however, is that they failed miserably."

For movies like this, the casting can make or break it and I thought they did really well.\n\nI actually didn't expect what was coming in the final act but it delivered, for me anyways, as I didn't have high expectations coming into it.

Thompson was given something to work with.\n\nBut wait, then sudden, as the movie is up and at it, running on all cylinders, then writer Blair Butler throws a curveball and the storyline just takes a very unforeseen turn of events. And at start it was definitely not predictable and also a very welcomed change to the storyline. But then the movie snapped and it took a turn for the ludicrous. And it was when you come to find out who the leader of the family really is. That is where the movie just shattered for me, and it went from being an okay enough movie to being a laughably bad one.\n\nThey had put together an interesting cast, and I will say that actress Nathalie Emmanuel carried the movie quite nicely. It was also nice to see Sean Petwee in the movie.\n\nThere was potential here, for sure, but ultimately it fell through as the writing just became poor and ridiculous. If you are a horror fan, then you might want to skip on \"The Invitation\", because this wasn't a gem in the horror cinema.\n\nMy rating of \"The Invitation\" lands on a four out of ten stars."

So, I agree with other reviews that it had an identity problem. The pacing had some problems as well but think it was some writing/editing issues that left it feeing disjointed. The 2 main characters, the chick from GOT/Fast & Furious along with the hot guy, with the pretty eyes and a jaw that can cut glass? Their chemistry was perfect, saved the film imo. And not for nothing, they didn't stay true to some pretty well known vampire lore regarding sires, but that's all I'll say about that without spoilers lol."

Maybe with characters in my generation, (older) like, the movie, 'Bloom. Maybe a movie that had a little of all 3 movies would be awesome. The movie, The Host is another ingenious movie (of that genre) with the same age range level of learning, and fighting the order of things. There should be more movies like these."

Now I can say the low ratings are true. Great cast. Honestly only even considered it BECAUSE of Nathalie. Loved her on GOT. Turns out the movie moved extremely slow, very predictable, especially if you know anything of Bram Stokers Dracula stories. Very cliche. Super dark scenes for 90% of the movie. Had to quint through majority of it because it was so dark. Even the limited action scenes were bleh. Trust the low ratings, this time is true...."

Its well made. Plenty of humour. Doesn't take itself too seriously or shy away from some of the more corny aspects of the story.\n\nSome is predictable. There are twists.\n\nIts really enjoyable."

Just go see the movie and you'll see what I'm talking about. Anyways, is this movie gonna win any Oscars anytime soon? Of course not! But in my opinion, it's passable fare. It's definitely what you'd call a \"Popcorn movie\". If you got some time to kill, go check it out. It's just entertaining and suspenseful enough to keep you interested, and to warrant the matinee price, but I wouldn't say that it's worthy of paying the evening price to see it."

Though a LOT of that is due to Hugh Skinner and Sean Pertwee - even though their roles are so small, they absolutely own their respective characters, and of course Nathalie Emmanuel. That being said, though, Thomas Doherty is decent enough despite his character being rather one-dimensional, and Stephanie Corneliussen & Anna Boden are similarly fun to watch despite their characters also being rather shallow...but the filmmakers really did dodge a bullet by casting Doherty instead of going with Garret Hedlund. Not that Hedlund isn't a worthy actor, I just can't see him playing DeVille quite the way Doherty did, and that would have been a big loss.\n\nThe story, too, is kinda shallow and weak but still manages to do something interesting rather than just being another Gothic Horror clone, making this at LEAST worth a watch for that alone."

The other women of the manor obviously don't like the new girl and express their opinions and blatantly foreshadow that he is not what he seems. Cut to the end where the new girl tries to run away after finding out the ugly truth of her origins but gets dragged back into hell. Then precedes to pretend to go along with everything only to kill everyone in the end. Idk I just feel like this story has been told so many times.

The film initially captivated me with its stunning manor, exquisite gardens, and surroundings, with its alluring grand production scale.\n\nUnfortunately, like so many films in the modern era, The Invitation quickly becomes tiresome and starts to drill into your head with the feminist movement that completely takes away all the films integrity to make it feel like nothing more that nonsense dribble, as it continues to use politics and the director's personal agenda by ramming it hard down your throat while you gag and struggle to breathe.\n\nI'm quite frankly sick and tired of films the seem to instead of embracing a female view turn it into a weird power dominance or 'patriarchy'. It is not only unpleasant to sit through, but it is also worse than listening to a political babble on for hours on a topic he knows nothing about.\n\nThe Banquet scene was one of the highlights of the film, truly gorgeous chandelier of immersive food, masks worn like an 1800's fairytale while the fine gowns and attractive dresses puncture the screen with identity, and this is the true embracement of femininity and beauty.\n\nDracula's brides and the families performing rituals and deftly touched on, but I would have loved greater depth and pivotal storytelling, the two ladies' origins and upbringing to how many generations have these rituals taken place, and in what places?\n\nIn the last twenty minutes of the film however, the momentum changes direction quickly and instead goes for the blatantly obvious all female power plot with buffy the vampire slayer, rainbows, unicorns, and whatever other crap they decided appeals to the imbecilic and halfwits of our current generation.\n\nThe Invitation should have been noteworthy, and while it fell down in some areas, it embraced others and had depth, scope, and diversity. Then it come crumbling down and yet another female director cast her eye on identify preference and completely destroyed the foundations of the film leaving it in a tattered mess unable to be salvaged into even a semblance of a positively memorable story.\n\nI don't have a problem with the female perspective but I weary and become sick and tired of nonsense filmmaking where agenda destroys good storytelling, either trying not of offend the majority and trying to appease the minority, The Invitation will be lost as something that probably should have captured the aura of the feminine spirit and propelled it into a memorable story that defines the horror landscape for women to inspire to.\n\n4/10."

The cinematography, sets design (love the dragon statue), and sound keep you interested and engaged, and the editing doesn't leave any holes. The pacing is quite excellent and you can feel like you're following along the emotional roller coaster and self doubt that Nathalie Emmanuel telegraphs so well in the lead role of Evie.\n\nBut there's nothing major to set it apart in a world with quite a few vampire movies. It does give the leading lady a modern flair typical of modern cinema but perhaps missing from older vampire tropes, touching lightly on issues of race and gender delicately and delightfully.\n\nPerfectly worth your time."

Yeah, they're about as terrifying as a Chihuahua in a Halloween costume. Save yourself the agony and watch paint dry instead.\n\nHonestly, the movie has potential, but it was spoiled - what a waste.

I was actually impressed with some of the direction, some of the scenes are downright creepy and scary which for me is lacking in a lot of supposedly \"scary\" movies these days. That being said the movie does feel a bit rushed, and the horror aspect is gone in the second half. When things are revealed its like the script is put on hyperdrive and the conclusion while entertaining is very rushed. That being said I liked all the actors, the set the scenes, etc. It was a good Friday night movie to watch."

It never picks up any rush or steam it is definitely a failure in the thriller department. You never get your heart racing sense of fear you feel with a good thriller. The love story is the best part of the movie and the gothic set also the actors except for Nathalie Emmanuel and her side kick girlfriend they actually ruined the movie for me they were that awful they just did not fit in with the movie.

This modern (s)take on the classic creature feature started out creepily well but its conclusion lacked a convincing bite.\n\nI quite enjoyed the first two-thirds of the film but was disappointed with its ending considering the great build-up. Honestly, it was underwhelming because I was expecting a more terrifying reveal of Walter (Thomas Doherty) in his full form as our main antagonist. It all just felt rushed and half-baked as they fumbled what I thought could have been a great update to the genre. Nathalie Emmanuel was steadfast and relatable as our protagonist although, at times, her delivery felt a bit flat. I appreciated the cinematography as it really did enhance the scares and had me feeling quite uneasy (in the best way possible). I also thought they under utilized the supporting cast in Viktoria (Stephanie Corneliussen) and Lucy (Alana Boden) - they were interesting characters that received an unjust ending to their arcs. Lastly, I liked the direction they took toward ending the film, except I would have actually shown what they intended instead of just implying - it would have been much more satisfying.\n\nUltimately, a moderately interesting and entertaining movie that didn't make a lasting impression."

Why they even bothered setting it in the present day I don't know. Anyone who's seen GAME OF THRONES will know Natalie Emmanuel is no actress and so it proves with her insipid central performance here, although the rest of the cast are no better.

The score is brilliant and many moments harken back to the vampire movies of the 60s/70s. The scenery and atmosphere is also remarkable. Great production values. Right mix of over the top and grounding that should exist in a modern Vampire tale. The costumes and set designs were perfect.\n\nThe bad: Ok, here's the thing... good writing generally relies on subtlety. When you've got to overtly push your point, no matter how good the story is, it's going to lose people. The audience is not stupid and condescension only adds to disappointment.\n\nOf course we get the theme of women falling prey to the patriarchy, in this case using the most legendary Vampire of them all and his effect on and control over women as the analogy. There was no need for spoon feeding. The movie fell apart quite quickly at the wedding scene, and it's really a shame because it had potential to be a cult Vampire movie.\n\nWith bits reminiscent of Anne Rice's Vampire chronicles, Underworld, and even some of the campiness of Van Helsing, I expected a much more satisfactory ending. Instead, it barely slumped over the finish line. Shame...\n\n5.5/10\n\n#31DaysOfHalloween2022."

The beautiful production design is similar to a Guilermo Del Toro film, but paired with janky editing and dumb PG-13 jump scares. They substituted tension with an abundance of darkness, probably to avoid an R rating. The incompetent fight choreography didn't add any excitement either. I am at least a little happy this contributed to the horny horror movie renaissance we're in.\n\nLike most of these handsome rich guy sweeps up swooning maiden flicks, it romanticizes a creepy relationship. However, they succeeded where 50 Shades and Twilight failed by eventually subverting the trope with a pretty stellar ending (minus the horrid CGI flames).\n\nDon't let the spoiler-filled trailer deter you from watching this mess.

I appreciated how parts of the story were connected and things seemed to happen for a reason rather than random events just occurring for the sake of the movie. The main \"twist\" is sure to catch absolutely nobody by surprise, but it is still executed very well, and it is easy to enjoy the moment for what it is. This movie had just about the right amount of everything for me to enjoy and I really don't have any major complaints. The main character did seem to be a little overpowered at times, but not so much that the movie stopped making sense or being somewhat believable which is big for me in films.

And then it feels like it's rushed to an end, missing quite some sense.\n\nIt feels like the movie could be potential so much better if they shortened the intro, went more into depth and detail (also regarding the nearby town). And the verry end is actually dissapointing. It feels like the movie takes 2 hours, but finishes quite shallow in only 10 minutes.\n\nSome things also don't makes much sense. They mention that they could only kill it by putting a stake to it's hearth or beheading it. But eventually it dies in a complete different, and not verry spectacular way.\n\nThe open end also feels like missing some parts and feels unfinished, like actually the entire movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I have to say that the whole 'woke' labelling of movies is getting pretty tiresome. It's just lazy, boring, repetitive and means absolutely nothing. If by labelling this movie 'woke' you're just offended by a coloured female lead then I'd rather you were honest and just admitted that you're a racist, or a sexist, or a racist and a sexist, instead of chickening out behind a 'woke' shield.\n\nWokeness, whatever that is, has nothing to do with the fact that this is a truly awful movie. I didn't see the trailer so went in with a completely open mind but after showing abit of promise it quickly descended into a total laughable farce. It's just a series of typcasted clich\u00e9s. The English are shown as either a bunch of snooty posh snobs or domestic servants. The Americans on the other hand are plucky and streetwise with a no nonsense in your face attitude. It's a cliche ridden car crash.\n\nThe writing is disjointed, the acting is wooden and amateurish. Apart from the actress playing the Scottish servant the acting from nearly all the other cast members was appalling. The jump scares are predictable and yawn inducing. The movie tries to shock but comes across as campy and almost comical. When the first shocking scene at the feast was shown, I just burst out laughing at the total silliness of it.\n\nI've seen kids trick or treating who were scarier than this highly polished amateur effort to make a horror movie.\n\nAs a huge fan of bad movies, The Invitation doesn't even work as a 'so bad it's good' movie.\n\nIts just awful. Simple as that."

Do not bother with this film especially if like me you can't concentrate if the material is not engaging. I was very bored.\n\nWhat could be a twist is given away in trailers and in the movie very early on.

        "review_title": "It Wants to Be Many Things",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Invitation, a new horror film from director Jessica M. Thompson, wants to be many things. At times, the film feels like a wonderful tribute to gothic horror romance novels of the past (there's even a Jane Austen reference in the movie for Northanger Abbey fans) and other times it feels like a solid entry in the cinematic canon of great vampire flicks. While watching the film, I caught intentional echoes of Dracula, True Blood, Interview with a Vampire, Midnight Madness, and even Downton Abbey. These influences and tributes are apparent, but there's so many of them they inadvertently create a strange hodgepodge of a film. It's as if the film is suffering from an identity crisis and isn't quite clear what it wants to be. Is it a ghost story? A movie about a haunted house? A supernatural horror film? A film about how far best friends will go to help each other? Instead, you're left unsure and confused. The film is enjoyable and fun, but it could've been groundbreaking on a higher level. I had a tough time buying into the way the main character Evie ends up making her way from a somewhat hand-to-mouth existence in New York City to a posh new life in London in a matter of days. Using the results of a DNA test to move the story forward felt forced and implausible. In an era of cinematic greats like Get Out and Tigers Are Not Afraid, I wanted something more clever. The two leads, Nathalie Emmanuel and Thomas Doherty, bring much depth and likeability to their roles. Both are impressive in their performances. The supporting cast is also solid, especially Alana Bolden as Lucy. Yet, I found myself wanting to spend more time with the supporting characters than I was allowed to. Often, interesting characters are killed off just when we're starting to know who they are. Also worth noting is the exquisite work of cinematographer Autumn Eakin. The film is shot beautifully. While The Invitation is rich with creepy ambiance and the performances are top-notch, the movie feels uneven. There are some terrific, terrifying moments in the film, but they're often undermined by weaker moments that don't feel as realized."

        "review_detailed_main": "A largely effective femme-driven spookfest set at a mansion in the English countryside with more secrets than a bad marriage. Nathalie Emmanuel stars as Evie, a waitress for a catering company serving hors d'oeuvres to snooty guests at high-end New York parties; when Evie learns through a DNA test that she's got a cousin in England, her best bud talks her into meeting the chap, and--after some initial reservations--Evie is flying off to join the rest of the clan at a family friend's estate. And when she meets with the friend--the suave and seductive lord of the manor, Walter De Ville--sparks fly, lips lock, and poor Evie finds herself trapped in a terrifying relationship that is more, much more, than she bargained for... Despite a few early jump scares, it takes a while for things to get going, but once they do--and \"The Invitation\" sheds its gothic romance vibe and shows its true colors--it turns into a reliably exciting (if somewhat silly) supernatural thriller. The tacked-on ending nearly undercuts everything that preceded it, but no matter; if you're a fan of classic horror, this is one RSVP you should probably accept."

Some of the characters didn't even have a final outcome. Who knows where they went. And the end.... Well.... that made me have even more questions about what was cut from the movie.

With Thomas Doherty he was amazing. You felt his whole aura change. Nathalie Emmanuel she was great she was strong and felt very personable.\n\nBut all in all I loved it and can't wait to see it again. It's gonna be one of my go to movies forever. So in all, if you are a fan of men written by women and pretty much fan fictions of vampires this is for you. To me it's a chick flick horror and I found it just what I wanted to be. I'm thankful that I saw it with my best friend because we would hit each other anytime something romantic happened."

She doesn't really have any redeeming qualities: she's stuck in a job she doesn't like, she makes pottery without really seeming to have any talent in it, she seems to be constantly late, she jumps on the first attractive rich man that she sees and agrees to marry him in less than 48 hours... We're supposed to like her, but I just couldn't. She's the type of heroine who \"simply knows better\", drenched in self-righteousness. And of course, she can triumph over 4 vampires and a bunch of other antagonists thanks to her gumption. -_-\n\nI appreciate what they tried to do with the whole Bram Stocker's Dracula thing, but it was a miss for me. The lore is flimsy and unstable at best, the characters don't act like actual human beings, the story is uninteresting... Frankly, I regret watching this movie."

The storyline, was kinda well-written, but there were some unexplained questions. The location was very creepy, but a really nice choice. The characters were very interesting and well-developed, but, they were too many.. In my opinion, that movie should be rated \"R\", instead of \"PG-13\". The opening scene was very promising and so intense. The kills were just nice, even though most kills were off-screen. The casting was really good, acting too. The ending scene was very intense and kinda unexpected. Also, I have to admit that it was kinda scary and there were some jumpscares. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie, unexpectedly good, but the plot twist wasn't really shocking. Last but not least, I think that movie deserves a prequel or a sequel (they should continue the franchise)."

Give him a Walter PPK and who to cast as James Bond is covered. The rest of the story is appropriately sinister. The \"brides maids\" were both great and the heroine's solution is a nice surprise.

If you've never seen a vampire film before then it might be entertaining, but it steals so much that anyone who is already a fan of the genre will see everything coming a mile off.

Someone wrote in a review earlier that Dracula would be rolling in his coffin with the way this movie went down in the end, and that is exactly right. I wish they would have taken the time to put in the same time as they did to build up the beginning instead of just rushing through the end.

They're both captivating and they have chemistry. But that's pretty much it, to be honest. The story from A to Z is just plain awful and predictable. During the climax I almost fell asleep.

Thompson continues to improve, giving us a more tense and spooky experience than The Light of the Moon. I wish it had a similar tonal shift like that film had though. I didn't like the splashes of the supernatural we got throughout the film, and I would have much rather preferred it he ambiguous whether or not they're vampires (or even just really eccentric) sort of like George A. Romero's Martin.\n\nThe first thirty minutes or so have a lot of Get Out parallels, just in the way the story is set up. At one point, she goes for a run at night for no reason, just like in Get Out, but then the movie veers into a totally different direction and doesn't feel like such a blatant copy. I'm glad her best friend wasn't in it too much because I think it would have distracted me from the drama/mystery of the story.\n\nThe scene from the trailer where they're like having dinner really got me hooked, and it really helped get me invested for the last thirty minutes of the film, but it felt too little too late after already teasing us so much. I think this film should have saved its supernatural aspects for those final minutes rather than sprinkling them throughout, it would have made the reveal so much more impactful. I basically wish the film tricked you into thinking it's a drama/thriller, but I am not at all discrediting the movie for what I wanted it to be.\n\nI really don't think this was a great movie, but it was decently-shot. I liked a lot of the performances and I felt like I could always tell what was happening (like in the dark) which is important to me in a horror movie. Not that everything needs to be shown, I just don't think dark = scary. I also really liked the long black nails the vampires had and I thought their teeth didn't look too fake or cheesy.\n\nNathalie Emmanuel did a great job as the lead in this film, but Thomas Doherty really stole the show for me here. He was so hot in this movie (I would let him bite me lol).\n\nIt's worth a watch if you really like vampires or are bored. I did have some fun though, but I don't think you need to rush out to theatres for this one. It would be just as good at home on your television."

The moment required to relay a sense of panic and helplessness but was a let down due to the unconvincing performance. It didn't help that the story was agonizingly predictable. The second half also seemed rushed with the narrative (the unveiling of a vampire coven and futile attempts on the part of Evelyn to escape from the it) expeditated all within a few minutes.

The design of set, dialogue, and general appearance of the film is well done.\n\nIf you want an interesting film that will keep you engaged until the end (skip the last 2 minutes or so of social engineering) then I recommend this film."

Its a pretty basic ride from beginning to end. But considering the people involved I am kinda surprised how basic it really was.... Felt like one of those movies with too many producers involved, You know the ones.\n\nNo spoilers there.\n\nThe movie is ok for people who maybe have never seen a movie before. As others have stated, its an obvious copy of many other movies which isnt necessarily a bad thing. No idea is original. But at least make an effort to put some original content in there.\n\nRemember all those old black and white British Dracula, Vampire and Mummy movies? I really loved the camp almost childlike scaryness of them, I still do. Well this movie really reminded me of them...except those movies were made about 60yrs ago, so thats not really a good thing.\n\nBut of my pet hates in modern movie making, the ones used in this movie are surely the worst.....Like the idea of taking a very basic premise for a story and needlessly socialising it just to please the execs. I mean--- racist Vampires???? Who would have thought it? Do vampires have any dog in that race?, excuse the pun. If its to do with pure bloodlines then why invite her at all??? Adds less than nothing to the story.\n\nMore pet hates??? How about a snivelling weak baby suddenly becoming a supreme badass out of no where..No training, No previous skills..just boom, badass!! YAWN!!.\n\nHow about making set pieces so ridiculous that even a drunk child would question the writing.... I mean the ending made my nose bleed.lol.\n\nBut genuinely it wouldn't have taken much to actually make a decent little B movie. And I honestly mean that.\n\nLeave the social commentary to movies where it may make sense or Give her some help along the way, I know why they didnt but it would make more sense. Maybe get her to ask the obvious questions. Remember the fantastic 5 or whatever they were called? How they tried to solve stuff they had questions to? They were kids for kids..she is a full grown adult lady who has no questions at all????\n\nWell you get the point . A movie made because they got money from a studio. That is really all i can believe.\n\nWatch it, dont watch it....your life wont change either way."

Is it the film schools that are failing, or is Hollywood just out of new ideas for horror films? Watching these films is like watching paint dry.

It certainly has no guilt over the actions of a group of religious fanatics who decided to steal someone else's country.\n\nSleeping with a black man was in no way scandalous in the 20's, unlike America, England disnt feel the need to keep the races pure. (Seriously, England's black queen is a main character in a popular series, that started 2 years before this rubbish was made.)\n\nVans full of virtual slaves and catering supplies aren't brought in for parties. The staff (maids, butlers etc) who don't live on the grounds are just like everyone else, they drive to work, do their jobs and go home.\n\nAnd if a white person described a black family as \"extremely black\" they'd be lynched. It isn't any less repulsively racist for a black woman to say it.\n\nApart from all that, the film was just a crap amalgamation of a handful of gothic horrors and Ready or Not, with little attempt to hide the lack of a single original thought, or a total lack of understanding of the films. Even if the trailer hadn't made it obvious what the family's dark secret was, it was pretty clear long before the big reveal; by which point I was already bored, and kinda hoping someone would throw Evie into a deep hole somewhere. I only finished watching this dreck out of fairness, if I'm going to trash it in the reviews, I should watch the whole thing. And I massively regret watching till the end! I'm not sure if it was the utter laziness or the pathetic cliches that I found more insulting, but I'm actually angry that someone paid for this and inflicted it on others."

I am hoping the release a R rated for a bit more scary and a bit more steam if you know what I mean. After all of this if your big into perfect plots and need to be upset at every detail that isn't right than yeah dont see it but if your a normal person like me just give it a shot.

There's little consistency with how the characters speak and it takes away from the immersion.\n\nThe characters themselves are underwhelming and forgettable. They have 1-2 traits, leaving them flat. Awkward side characters don't help with the story at all.\n\nVisuals are fine, but don't even live up to modern TV shows. The inconsistency here is disappointing. The set looks good, but VFX were really bad, even for a lower budget film.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Its not so bad you can laugh at it, and its not a good movie.

I imagine this will be considered a \"sequel\" if the series really ends up taking off. I mean, The \"incredible Hulk\" film was the first of the marvel universe, but it wasn't exactly \"great\". Everyone loves the idea of Dracula, and the idea of an entire universe about him is perfect, even if your not a fan of the book (it really is a dreadful literary masterpiece). But realistically, Renfield will be on the same level as this is on, only in the comedy category. Which will be fine. Last Voyage of the Demeter should be the one to blow the doors off. They've pushed back the date and kept every piece of it under wraps. I guarantee it will be huge."

Instead, we got no gore due to its PG-13 rating. Worth watching if you have to catch a flight in a few hours and need to kill time.

Now that she's in the databases she can look up her distant relatives. One of them contacts her. It's some Brit. He invites her to the wedding of some relatives there.\n\nShe reluctantly (TM) goes then to this all expenses-paid trip to a British castle. She right away has a run in with the arrogant chief butler as the abused catering girls arrive, with whom she connects immediately. Then she meets the owner of the castle who \"saves her\" from the butler. They are attracted to each other. Tuns out the entry hall of the mansion is the place where the woman in the intro hanged herself. There are some huge monster statues all over the place. She is told she can't go into the library. At night she discovers the location of the hidden library key. Later we see how the butler sends one of the catering girls in there. Let's just say she doesn't fare well. Our girl is introduced to the whole family, which is almost entirely made up of guys.\n\nNext day she meets 2 bridesmaids. A sweet and friendly one, and a creepy arrogant one who keeps pushing our girl's buttons, which is easy to do since she has a huge chip on her shoulder. Our girl gets closer and closer to the mansion owner who suggests they should marry and she sort of agrees. Later that day there's a family dinner where guy announces, much to girl's shock, the wedding of the two. So this meeting is of three families that have been connected for centuries. The fourth missing family member is finally present--the girl. And in marriage then all of them will prosper. Then butler brings in a catering girl, slashes her throat and passes on glasses of blood for folks to drink.\n\nTurns out mansion owner is a big time vampire who needs the girl to keep the line going. During the wedding they will exchange blood which will turn her into a vampire and give him strength. Of course she's not interested in massive wealth and eternal life, what American would be... So she has other plans for the wedding.\n\nThe Invitation then comes across as a vampire-themed version of Get Out with an unappealing cinematography reminiscent of Euphoria. I'm glad someone finally made a vampire movie with a budget. Unfortunately the politics, casting, and poor cinematography don't help the story much. Missing is also more violence, gore, sensuality--in other words everything a vampire horror flick should have."

Apart from a few jump-scares with according crashing sound-blows, there wasn't so much scary stuff going on, while the gore-rate was equally moderate. Nathalie Emmanuel is lovely to look at (although I kept being annoyed by her unbecoming nose-piercing), and Thomas Doherty is as handsome as a walking Leyendecker advertisement (which of course suited his true nature fine), but these two couldn't save this project on their own. Sean Pertwee making a silly caricature of his Alfred-character in Gotham didn't help either. Maybe a touch of humor would have, but alas, no laughs here. Just a deep sigh."

        "review_detailed_main": "5.7/10\n\nThis film definitely had me going in the first half, as it's been awhile since I've seen a horror, so I was genuinely spooked for the first bit. However, once I settled into the movie and got a grasp on who and what I was watching, boredom kind of settled in.\n\nThe story feels very similar to \"Ready or Not\" (2019) with one glaring difference being vampires are in one and not the other. The story here had me intrigued me throughout, but it didn't sit right with its execution, and the finale feels rushed with no care for the build-up of characters and story.\n\nThe acting won't be receiving any awards, but it wasn't terrible. Each actor was suited for the role they were cast for, and because there seemed to be commitment, it made the story more enjoyable and worth giving the chance.\n\nShadows were essential to building the tension, and worked very well with the cinematography, as nothing was revealed sooner than it should've been. However, action sequences lacked. To give the look of something crazy and exciting happening, a lot of unnecessary cuts were used, and therefore made the visuals seem a bit much near the end.\n\nOverall, for the style of movie that was presented. I personally would A) recommend waiting to see this movie on a streaming service; and B) recommend watching \"Ready or Not\" (2019) (6/10), as it's pretty well the same movie, but without vampires."

I found myself waiting for the action to kick off, even after an hour in to it. When it finally does, there's less than half an hour left, and the final scene is extremely cringeworthy.\n\nI was hoping this film would be similar to Ready or Not (2019) and while it has glimpses of it, it fails to give the lead the same badass heroine character as Samara Weaving's in Ready or Not.\n\nNathalie Emmanuel (most known for Game of Thrones) is a good actress, just waiting for her Hollywood breakthrough role. This film sadly isn't that.\n\nOn a positive note, The Invitation has a great set design, and for a mostly dark lit film, it has great cinematography."

Well firstly the story, it started off good and then about fifteen minutes into the film we are led to believe the main actress is simple and hasn't a clue about strangers on the internet, then there are the effects, these went from okay to dreadful with the fire scene near the end of the film. Then there is the ending story, it almost became a female Blade style film, this totally ruined the film for me, it went beyond stupid.\n\nA ruined chance of a film being good but again this shows the script writer didn't know how to carry on with this movie, give it a miss, I wish I did."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a real slowburner with a relatively unsatisfying ending. It's just... meh. Not great, but not terrible. A lot of horror movies are that way; writing horror is HARD. Imo, it's one of the hardest movie genres to do right, which leads us to a movie like this.\n\nIt had a really great buildup if you're willing to be patient. I definitely recommend doing something else (have dinner, do some crafts, doodle, etc) while watching it, since it's not the most stimulating buildup on account of how slow it was. I think the actors did a fantastic job, which is something I don't feel we see enough of in horror! The cast was gorgeous, the sets were impeccable, and the cinematography was very pleasing on the eye.\n\nI didn't see any trailers for it, but I've heard that they spoil everything for the movie, so heads up that you may not enjoy it as much if you've seen trailers. Some of the dialogue was a crime against writing, and, as always with horror, the actions of the main character didn't really make sense. Then again, the genre wouldn't exist if it didn't revolve around idiots, would it? From my perspective, a lot of the plot twists seemed completely obvious, and the suspense was kept in just not revealing it yet. Making you doubt yourself.\n\nIf it were me, I think I would have gone for a funny ending. I really believe the place where this film failed is in its ending. The biggest letdown for me was that the movie seemed to take itself too seriously, but didn't pack the same punch that an excellently done horror ending would have provided. I know many people would have been let down by a serious buildup and a funny ending, but I think it would have been easier for the writers and director to pull off than what actually happened. In the sense of the ending, it was too predictable, and I think that's what made it unpalatable."

In addition, it is the height of the casting that they put a British actress as the main character, so that she passes as an American citizen disguising her accent of origin.

There's the typical casual racism tropes thrown in as there is in more recent movies, because it simply can't be a movie with deeper meaning than having some sort of racist tone, that seemed entirely misplaced the entire movie. I initially made a joke about a comment at the beginning of the movie, where one of the characters stated that British people apologise a lot because of \"their colonial guilt\", joking that it gets a 1/10 just for that cringe comment. But I just shrugged it off as a maybe-one-time-thing. It isn't. It persists throughout the whole movie.\n\nBasically, it seems like they had SOMETHING good here that they were close to getting it right..

Unfortunately, the movie itself fails in the horror elements by doing mostly cheap jump scares and lack of tension to it. Even when after the reveal, the movie itself can be easily guessed what happened next and the events that play out. Also, the movie tries to build up the relationship between Evie Walter, but it's pretty predictable where this goes.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Invitation is a horror thriller film directed by Jessica M. Thompson. It stars Nathalie Emmanuel and Thomas Doherty.\n\nAfter the death of her mother, Evie takes a DNA test and discovers a long-lost cousin she never knew she had. Invited by her newfound family to a lavish wedding in the English countryside, Evie's at first seduced by the sexy aristocratic host. However, she's soon thrust into a nightmare of survival as she uncovers twisted secrets about her family history and the unsettling intentions behind their sinful generosity.\n\nThe film starts very positively and has some great scary scenes in the start but as the film progresses the film starts to derails from it's path. The film has unnecessary love scenes and the long delay in uncovering the big twist disturbs the momentum of the viewers and the film. However after the big secret is revealed instead the viewers might be looking for some gothic scenes but the film ends very quickly and abruptly leaving the viewers disappointed. The film is indeed not a mystery film but the makers had a great opportunity to convert the film into a horror mystery film but sadly opportunity is lost.\n\nThe acting in the film is average to good. The screenplay of the film could've been more crisp and fast. The climax of the film could've been written more better. Overall the film certainly raises high expectations in the film fails to deliver. A wasted effort."

Beyond that, the build up is ultimately flattened by poor CGI, and even worse writing. Our ending is plagued by a supremely rushed ending that leaves the audience feeling disappointed by anticlimax. It also doesn't help that casual racism is sprinkled throughout and dressed up as comedic relief. In the end, this movie will go down as a mediocre venture."

The scares are great with great visuals and audio and actually refreshing the now abandoned subgenre of horror. Characters are perfectly placed and well designed.

        "review_title": "As Soulless As A Vampire",
        "review_detailed_main": "Vampires in movies date way back to the early days of cinema; we hate them, we love them, but there is one thing for sure they are not going anyway anytime soon and will continue to prey upon us on the big screen for years to come. Now once again, we end the summer sinking our teeth into another vampire flick. Unfortunately, this one is pretty soulless (literally.)\n\nThe film opens up with Evie (Nathalie Emmanuel), a city girl living in New York City trying to make it big in the big apple, working as a caterer and trying to make ends meet, and being a struggling artist, still grieving the death of her parents she incredibly lonely and desperate for a family. However, through a series of dumb events, not always entirely dumb, sometimes we want to know the background of our family, but she uses one of those DNA tests, and she learns that she has a second cousin, Oliver (Hugh Skinner). Even while her best friend Grace (Courtney Taylor) tells her, it's not a good idea to go meet a said cousin. He convinces her to travel to London, where she finds out she is a part of this royal family that she had no idea about, and oh, by the way, yes, Olivia is indeed a vampire. Now in London, what we essentially have come to is a sexier, hornier, vampirism-infused Downtown Abby.\n\nWalt DeVille (Thomas Doherty), a close friend of the Alexanders, sweeps Evie off her feet in a manner consistent with the form and tone of any gothic romance story. Despite all of the warning signs, Evie is obviously star-struck by Walt, starting with their awkward first encounter when she confronts the irate and unpleasant valet, Mr. Fields (Sean Pertwee). Still, Walt comes in and, as one might anticipate, immerses Evie in her fairy tale, sending butterflies fluttering through your stomach. The romance and chemistry between Evie and Walt are dashing as one would imagine them to be. The actors put on a great performance; doing so, however, does feel like a bit of twilight chemistry, but these kinds of films are our guilty pleasure, so I roll with it here. I should also mention the set design from Felicity Abbott totally gets it right with dressing the manor, and its grounds, from the fabrics to the statues, are exquisite and absolutely stunning,\n\nThough, there aren't any real scares. For all you horror aficionados, if you're expecting scares from this, you might think differently about what you're getting into. This film is more about the vibes and not the gory and chilling horror. I think the movie is very misleading in terms of being an outright horror film; if we just stuck with the premise of being a Gothic, sexy, romantic vampire flick, it probably would have done some good for it. However, The movie has issues about race and social class that is dangled in front of an audience but its never fully developed. Though it is nice to see another film touching these subjects other than Jordan Peele, it doesn't need to be a Get Out rip-off, but it could have been developed a little more.\n\nAll this said, The Invitation takes so long to get anywhere. By the time you reach the end, the climax is about to happen; it ends before you even realize it. The script spends so much time building up to this moment, just to have it all come to an end as fast as lightning; the credits are rolling. The Invitation is not the worst horror film (if you can call it a horror film), but it's not the greatest either. It's as soulless as a vampire.\n\nReelistflicks.com."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Invitation Is a new horror film directed by Jessica M. Thompson, this is only the second film she has directed after The Light of the Moon.\n\nThe film is about Evie (Nathalie Emmanuel), who discovers after the death of her mother that she has more family than she knew. She is invited by her new family to a wedding. During this wedding, she gets to know her new family, but also learns about the dark family history and discovers more than she wanted to know before.\n\nThe trailers made this film quickly reminiscent of the horror comedy Ready or Not from 2019. Unfortunately, after the first hour, where Evie gets to know her new mysterious family, it doesn't look much like Ready or Not. Compared to that movie, this movie also takes itself too seriously.\n\nFor writer Blair Butler, this is his first story written alone, which can be seen in the film itself. He fills the first hour of the film more with Evie's mysterious introduction to her unknown relatives, but doesn't really elaborate on most of the different family members. Thanks to the trailers, it is also possible to guess what the plot twist of the film and thus the family secret is of Evie's unknown relatives. The film itself also does little to hide this or to make you doubt this as a viewer. This way you as a viewer can keep ahead of the story, which can make the film predictable and so long-winded.\n\nThe visual effects are also not always credible, with a lot of blood and fire it can be seen that this is fake and simply placed in the film with CGI or a green screen. In the film, they also play with shadows to create a creepy atmosphere. Unfortunately, they use these shadows at too dark moments, so that the shadows hardly stand out if you as a viewer don't pay attention to them.\n\nThe acting is also not that special in the film. For Nathalie Emmanuel, this is only one of her first leading roles in a film. She is also more known for supporting roles in other films and TV series. She doesn't really know how to carry this film as a lead. Many others of the film cast are also more actors from TV series or smaller film roles and also know how to make their roles in this film little special. It's nice to see Sean Pertwee as a butler again after his role on the TV series Gotham as Alfred Pennyworth, the butler of young Bruce Wayne."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Invitation\" is a horror thriller film directed by Jessica M. Thompson (\"The Light of the Moon\"). Starring Nathalie Emmanuel in the lead role, it relies so heavily on horror clich\u00e9s that even genre novices would struggle to find anything remotely scary about it.\n\nIn New York City, Evelyn \"Evie\" Jackson (Nathalie Emmanuel) works as a waitress for a catering company to help make a living. At the urging of a friend, Evie takes a DNA test and discovers that she has relatives in England, with a cousin named Oliver (Hugh Skinner) currently located within the City. After meeting up, Oliver invites Evie to accompany him back to England for a family wedding set to take place shortly, which she accepts after some initial hesitation. Upon arriving at the lavish estate, Evie is courted by the lord of the manor Walter De Ville (Thomas Doherty), whom she is charmed by his sophistication and wealth at his disposal. As the wedding date draws closer, Evie starts to notice strange occurrences at night, learning that her newfound family is hiding a dark, sinister secret from the world.\n\nIt seems a natural curiosity for us to want to trace our family roots, as it could help discover important things about who we are and why we're at this particular point in history. Thanks to websites like \"Ancestry.com\" and \"23andMe\", modern technology has allowed for easier, more streamlined tracking of our genealogy that can produce results in as early as a matter of days. But the reality is that in life, sometimes it's best to live in blissful ignorance since the deeper we keep digging, the more likely we'll find something that we might not like. The film \"The Invitation\" tries to use a concept like this to elicit fear in the viewer, but it fails in just about every way imaginable.\n\nTo the film's credit, I think the idea of somebody learning that their family history hides a monstrous secret is actually a pretty decent plotline for a horror movie. The problem here is that everything is so poorly executed that I can't imagine too many people who would find anything to be afraid of while sitting through the whole thing. For a start, the film just isn't scary at all. And since this is supposed to be a horror film, that's a huge problem. The first scene that should be considered scary, which takes place in a dark room where the candles keep blowing out, leaves so little to be desired that by the time it's over you can't even comprehend what just happened. There's no attempt to build any suspense or tension during this scene nor is there any frightening payoff once we figure out what was supposed to have made us fearful in the first place. I'm not sure whether this should be blamed on bad writing, bad direction, or both, but it certainly set the stage for everything else to come.\n\nIn addition to the lack of scares, the film is also so reliant on the overused tropes of other better horror pictures that it almost borders on comical. Everything from the large mysterious mansion with conveniently out-of-bounds rooms to the obligatory jump scares that are revealed to only be a dream are played up to ridiculous levels. I actually lost count of how many times I rolled my eyes at these moments, in hindsight I probably should have written each of them down instead. Because of this, the film is a predictable bore the entire way through. Even if you aren't a fan of horror movies, you can't help but notice how desperate this film is to entertain us with what it perceives to be clever writing, but all it does is come across as cookie-cutter modern horror flick that makes you wish you were watching something else instead.\n\nConsidering the bland material she had to work with, I suppose Nathalie Emmanuel tried her best to give as convincing a performance as possible in such an awful film like this. At the same time though, I am reluctant to call Evie the best thing about the film when her character is nothing more than a typical Mary Sue. Practically everything about Evie's character is perfect; she's beautiful, she's confident, she's a talented artist, she has no notable flaws (unless you count low finances as a flaw), and every problem she encounters she manages to overcome all by herself nearly right away. As a result of this, I didn't have any attachment to her or felt any sympathy for what she goes through because I know what's going to happen to her regardless. The only redeeming thing is that at least Emmanuel knows how to cry on cue when necessary, though even something like that is hardly worth defending.\n\nThere is little else to say about the rest of the cast, except perhaps Thomas Doherty as Walter De Ville. If there's such thing as a Mary Sue equivalent for objects of affection, then Walter fits that bill perfectly. Every one of his character traits is taken right out of the stereotype catalogue of male love interests who are irresistible to women; he has a foreign accent (a British accent would sound exotic to an American), he's sophisticated, he's well-dressed, he's handsome, he has a chiselled body, and he lives in a big mansion because he's incredibly rich for reasons unknown. Though all of this would seem too good to be true for an intelligent female protagonist, not once does Evie ever question this, even after she deduces that things seem amiss. This character is nothing more than a shameless self-inserted fantasy by the writer for lonely female viewers to ogle over. When both the film's main characters are Mary Sues, you know there's a major problem.\n\nWhether you like horror films, thriller films, or even romance films, I can tell you now that \"The Invitation\" fails to appeal to fans of all of these genres. The whole thing comes across as a dull hodgepodge of horror clich\u00e9s, poorly written characters, an uninteresting story, and a general lack of reason to exist. There are so many better horror films out there that I would rather have spent my time watching than something like this. My only hope is that my warning is heeded to stay away lest you desire a bad product.\n\nI rate it 2.5/10."

Why bother even giving a rating with your review? My idea is to watch it yourself and see for yourself.\n\nI did find one scene laughable towards the end. Something to do with height differences and objects that would probably not be the best to have in a house like that. You will see. Or not if you choose not to watch."

It sets a creepy stage and, most importantly for me in these times, the vampires are bad...really bad. The film makes you think it will be another sexy, misunderstood vampire hack job, but nope. Do I have quibbles? Think of them more as suggestions for Jessica and company's next outing. 1. I do agree with others that it lacked \"edge of your seat\" suspense. This is in part because they telegraphed all the best stuff in the promotional material. Still good and creepy though. 2. For me (and only me) they spent a little too much energy on checking social issue boxes. The very best films I have seen with strong female/minority leads make them unapologetically strong with no or little need to express social injustices which, while very real, distract from a horror film. 3. The cast were all very able and pulled it off, but sometimes it seemed like some of the leads were uninterested. For good horror, they have to be dialed in all the time, not just dialed in sometimes, but other times looking like they are waiting for their latte at the coffee shop. I accept this May be unfair as they are in a major film and I am just a person on the net, but I hope they take this as constructive criticism because I want to see them all, especially the director, take another run at the genre. Great job all!"

The cast was great we loved their look as vampires, the tension between the characters and the storyline was mostly there. But our favorite part was the castle setting, decor and slight horror aspect. It wasn't very scary and at times felt like they were trying to avoid a more mature rating, but other than that I really enjoying it even the final action scene that came along didnt feel unnatural or drawn out.

The story was usual, but the way they crafted it was unpredictable. Unlike other movies, here you genuinely want to trust the characters even though your heart knows there's something wrong. They make them extremely likeable in the first half and you are caught up in the warm, cozy, cindrella story that it offers. I quite related to the lonely Evylyn who lost her mother and was in dire need of a family. And these are the vulnerabilities that can be easily taken advantage of. You really ignore the red flags when everyone is this welcoming.\n\nBut even though the twist was shown in the trailer and you know whats about to happen, you still want to see how the protagonist rescues herself from the mayhem. The actors were good, the plot was engaging, the set design was magnificient. Everything was top-notch. Its been so long since I have seen so many vivid colors on screen because almost all horror movies in recent time have been dull, colorless and predictable. And kudos for making vampires scary again. The stories of Dracula and his brides now seem mythical and folklorish, thanks to the various new interpretations of vampires that have almost killed the horror in it. Today vampires are seen as pretty much superheroes. Seeing vampires as a menace was a fresh feeling altogether.\n\nNo idea why it got so low ratings. People have lost taste. If you pull down content like this, you get served content like Marvel's She Hulk and you are forced to be happy with it. Promote good films people. Rate them well. Otherwise be prepared to be served hot steaming pile of .. well you know what I mean."

I've seen some people talk about plot holes regarding certain events, they weren't paying attention.

I think the pace is just alright. If your are fond of story-telling type of movies then this is your cup of tea. Yes, tea. Not coffee. It's Brit.\n\nIf I m a real picky guy then I would say the ending is a bit disappointing to me. I do expect a more dramatic and adrenaline-pumping ending. And I would be impressed if Dracula can show me more of his evilness. Audiences like us should have known a lot of facts and misunderstanding about that Son of Dragon and I did expect more of him. Think out of the box, as I always expect from the modern classics.\n\nI would recommend it to all vampire lovers.
