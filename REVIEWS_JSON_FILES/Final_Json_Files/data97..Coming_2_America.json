        "review_detailed_main": "It's a 5.7... and it's trying to be a tribute to the first film-which was epic-but not a good tribute. Some jokes are good, some characters are ok (e.g Wesley Snipes) but the story and the writing are so lazy and uninteresting that instead of a comedy, it's a sleep-athon. I give it above 5 because I liked the music, the performances, the costumes and the fact that the original cast got together for this. And for some nice jokes here and there. But...why didn't they try a bit more? With the likes of Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall you can get a great comedy. However, these guys didn't seem to enjoy much being there. The pace is slow and the energy is low in about 80% of the film. Tracy Morgan is not adding anything new and Leslie Jones... was more annoying than funny. The plus points here are that it's indeed a feel good movie if you don't fall asleep... 5.7/10 They could have tried a bit more."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a longtime fan of Eddie Murphy, he belongs to that breed of likable comedians who can make a film that fails without failing by himself. \"Coming 2 America\" succeeds at least in one department: it makes you realize how good he used to be and how good he can be like in his recent (and better) \"Dolemite\". Now, to describe my feeling about \"Coming 2 America\" I will paraphrase Dewey from \"Malcolm in the Middle\": \"I expect nothing but I'm still let down\". In fact, that quote should be the stock answer to all these tiresome trends of rebooting, remaking and sequels or prequels that sprayed all over Hollywood creation like a certain virus in our everyday lives.\n\nIt's not that the film is bad but it's just a benign nostalgia-driven project that keeps basking in the shadow of the original whose references are expectedly countless. Some are cute like the three old guys' cameos and some downright funny like the promised bride who was still barking and jumping on one foot after thirty years; but unfortunately, the film can't live up to the same levels of fun and the material isn't original enough to be referenced to in ten years. The costumes and set-designs were visually creative but same can be said about \"Cats\".\n\nWhat's the story about? Prince Akeem, now King of Zamunda, has three daughters, he's pressured by General Izzi, the tyrannic ruler of the neighboring country Nexdoria (got the joke?) into marrying his daughter Princess Meeka (KiKi Layne) with his son and thus guaranteeing an access to the throne because Zamunda can't be ruled by queens. At that precise moment, anyone can guess the obvious trajectory the plot will take. The problem isn't that the film takes a long detour through Queens to get to the obvious solution: change the law, but that the solution all depends on Akeem's good will. Indeed, the prince who challenged his own father, who rejected the tradition, wouldn't change the rule. Of course, if he did, there would be no story and maybe the first film didn't need a sequel to begin with.\n\nTo his defense, Murphy throws in the script a few lamentations about Princes generally changing once they become kings but that aspect left me with an uncomfortable thought: in the end of the first \"Coming to America\", Akeem resigned himself and if it wasn't for Lisa having an afterthought or his father Jaffe Joffer changing the rule, he wouldn't have married the girl of his dreams. Now, why wouldn't he make the same move to let his rather competent daughter fulfill her dream? I started looking Akeem as a hypocrite and I blame the sequel for that. And when he is put in his place by Lisa (Shari Headley) and everybody's supposed to be \"about time!\", I was like \"couldn't that conversation happen before and spare all the trouble?\".\n\nBut I'm reading too much. You can tell there's a reason why this problem exists: the same than the 'forced marriage' thing, it's the unfair law that must be canceled. That's the point. And so it's a foregone conclusion that Meeka will become the queen. If you don't get that instantly, you've missed many movies of the 2010s (not that you missed much). My suspicions raised with the martial arts fighting sequence with Akeem practicing with his daughters, it was as if Eddie Murphy just discovered the \"girl power\" thing almost one decade too late, making the film dated in its attempt to be in touch with today's trendy streams of inspiration. The problem is that his daughters aren't given much screen-time anyway so the script begs us to root for them while dedicating the whole storyline to the illegitimate son: Lavelle played by Jermaine Fowler.\n\nLavelle is referred with the b-word (the film's most memorable running-gag), the unwanted result of an intoxicated night with one distinguished lady they met in the nightclub. That's the best they could come up in a flashback sequence that provides a few clips reminding us how awesome the original was. Akeem has no trouble finding Lavelle, he's a likable loser who welcomes with enthusiasm the prospect of being a prince, and so does his mother played by Leslie Jones. And so what we got is a reverse formula of the original where you never exactly know whether Africa is honored or mocked, Zamunda was supposed to be an expositional joke to highlight the contrast with America but Murphy handles the matters of succession with utter seriousness while providing the worst caricatures about the continent.\n\nThat African fantasy is a source of one-note jokes awkwardly contrasting with the whole theme of inequality. Even the romance between Lavelle and a groomer named Mirembe (Nonzamo Mbatha) has to get in that territory. Had the film delivered its share of laughs, that would have made for a more enjoyable experience. It started well but went downhill after the death of Jaffe (James Earl Jones). Arsenio Hall is underused as Semi, Tony Amos add some gravitas to Akeem's position recalling his more progressive mother, and well we have the \"references\" to ornate the rather half-baked comedy and so many musical cameos I felt like watching MTV. The film put me in such a sorry state of mind that when I saw the three guys in the barbershop, I thought they should be logically dead. My spirit was.\n\nThis is not a bad film because it is predictable, the original wasn't a masterpiece of originality either, but it just didn't have that energy, that gentle silliness the original had (Craig Brewer is no John Landis), it was like Akeem: too pompous and civilized for his own good and so obsessed with rules and the etiquettes he wasn't aware of his own contradictions. I said about the original that it was pure 80s fun, in a way the sequel also exemplifies the 2020s: a lackluster era where remaking what's old stands for newness. Like I said, I expected nothing but..."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I rewatched the original Coming To America this week, I was struck by its timelessness - every scene still worked, every laugh line still felt quotable/funny. In 1988, it somehow managed to be both a classic fairytale and something that felt remarkably fresh (All Black cast?! Actors playing multiple characters?!). This movie meanwhile is...fine? I could not help but enjoy seeing the actors and their characters again, but that's not a movie. That's a reunion special. So we wound up with 2 different things happening: an updated version of the first film starring Jermaine Fowler and a bunch of cameos from the original. It is entertaining in fits and starts. But it is not timeless. It is not even cohesive. I have probably watched Coming To America 20 times, but I'm not sure I'll watch this one more than twice."

        "review_title": "One of the Worst Movies I've Seen",
        "review_detailed_main": "40% or more of this movie is choreographed group movement (I won't say dancing because sometimes it doesn't have music) or terrible musical numbers that spoof popular songs but change the lyrics in an amateurish way to pertain to the characters in the movie. The main character even gets a freestyle rap in... Ohh, did I accidentally change the channel? Is this a live-action 2021 movie or a bad 90s cartoon?\n\nIt's pathetic that while this musical mess is going on the characters watching it are snapping or swaying along like it's so good. You're trying too hard. Just stop.\n\n30% of the movie is woke virtue signalling. They repeatedly, crassly, and directly continuously state how it's messed up women don't have as many opportunites as men, how sexism is bad, how there's systematic racism, how it's wrong to grope women... Was the script written by a ultra-liberal children or an out-of-touch high school teacher or what?\n\nThen they imply that society has changed and now people consider all that stuff bad. Is it implying that the first movie was miogynistic and culturally backwards? Uhh... I didn't see Eddie Murphy groping women or denying women their rights in the first movie. How is this relevant or necessary? It's not on both counts.\n\nNow we can talk about the shrimp larva of a plot. Basically Eddy Murphy's character has a son and we meet the son.\n\nThat's the whole plot. It's not about anything in particular because there are many storylines, none developed beyond the outlines, none of them logical, and all regressing at some point:\n\n1. Fish out of water trope? The son and his family are from the hood and they go live in this African king's palace. Except the son's not really very hood, knows how to behave himself appropriately when going into an interview, and quickly settles into the princely life. He doesn't play the role like a poor boy but like a middle class person.\n\nThe mom is a little bit more exaggerated and urban but she disappears for most of the movie. He also has an uncle of the same persuasion but he only comes out near the end. All of these characters drive the royals up the wall but are reconciled with them at the end and become close friends with no explanation.\n\n2. Poor guy suddenly becomes rich trope? He's (supposedly) poor, but not really. He wants to get a job for the sake of his dignity. His king father comes to get him. At first he doesn't want to go. Then he sees money and gold and wants to go. Once he's there he decides he doesn't care about money or luxury and wants to go back. Once he goes back he cares about money again and wants to return... Ad nausem.\n\n3. Love story: Rehashes the same plot from the first movie. Except at first he wants to marry the shallow girl because she's hot. Then he talks to some other girl for a week and wants to marry her... If he could fall in love with a girl he barely knows in a week and he's 30 wouldn't he have done it by then?\n\n4. Son is needed to ascend to the throne: They say a son is needed to ascend to the throne and never explain why. Kind of because some other guy wants to attack Wakanda or whatever their country is called if there's no male heir - for no reason. It's forgotten at the end.\n\nIf you're a huge, huge fan of the original, the only redeeming quality is the cameos. All of the main characters and even some minor characters who appeared in the first movie show up again.\n\nI've seen a lot of movies, but this is truly shameful and pathetic and I don't hesitate to say it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's barely a movie. More like a series of tik tok shorts badly sewn together.\n\nOhh, and no, it's not funny.\n\nHonourable Mentions: Yes, I hate Chariots of Fire (1981) with a passion, but I much prefer it to this movie. At least it had ONE good scene."

The premise is great in that, Akeem, left a little secret behind in America and it's time to answer that call. So much time passing works well for that premise also. I don't want to give anything away as it's not exactly a thick plot. I will say some of it, plot and jokes, was predictable. Sequels always have that uphill battle.

It looks like they tried to get as much as possible famous music artists to collaborate in this sequel. Now, not all the music scenes were bad, there was clearly some good choreographer appointed for those scenes, but at one point it looked more like a try-out for America Got Talent than a movie. The story is a bit similar to the first one, just the basics and then they added some new scenes. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall both still play four different characters and they did a decent job with that. I watched Coming 2 America, had some mild fun, but I can't help to have that feeling afterwards that this movie wasn't really necessary to make. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall did age well though, with 33 years between the two movies they didn't change that much."

If you keep realistic expectations and just want a nostalgic, slightly modern spin on the original silly story, you'll be entertained. Eddie is still funny, but he's playing a different role now that he's getting old. The idea is simple, but effective enough for an escapist comedy sequel. Don't take personal offense by the artists continuing an old story. Just have fun. Enjoy seeing so many cast members and silly characters return - they all do great. Lots of laughs all around. Awesome soundtrack. The CGI is fine, especially for a comedy. Some touching moments - yes, there is still some heart in this one, and just enough modern sensibilities to avoid getting too serious. But of course it's clearly not as good as the original - the original is one of the best comedies of all time."

Whereas the original movie was a smartly crafted comedy with a tight script and real characters, the sequel is nothing but a loud, obnoxious mess with a ridiculous story and cardboard cutout characters. The original was rated R, and the sequel is PG-13. The sequel has more to do with The Nutty Professor or any of the other lame family comedies Murphy started churning out in the late 1990's than the original Coming to America. It's a defanged Eddie Murphy with his hands tied behind his back. It doesn't help that loudmouth Leslie Jones is in this movie, playing the exact same character she did in Ghostbusters, shouting every single line.\n\nAnd then we get the musical numbers. This movie is more interested in shoehorning in washed up celebrities than telling a coherent story or crafting believable and relatable characters.\n\nAnd of course, since it's 2020 it must have lame girl power subplot, pandering to the Twitter patrol and making this movie essentially critic proof."

Sure the plot is wafer-thin but that's not the point. It's good to see people fall in love and talk about their feelings again. Extremely refreshing. And after Murphy's fantastic \"Dolomite Is My Name,\" his triumphant showing on SNL, and this - hopefully one of Hollywood's funniest is staging a comeback from quite a few dry years in which nothing he did was funny. Here he does what he does best - entertain.\n\nSo, rather than listen to all the nay-sayers out there, give this a go. And laugh, it's funny!"

Then again, their Bad Sit-Com style fits this contrived sequel more than the once-great Murphy, again alongside sidekick Arsenio Hall, who, like all the other familiar faces, seems to be going through the motions. The only new characters that kind of work, allowing Fowler's \"young Prince\" to stretch beyond the intentionally recycled plot, is KiKi Layne as his half-sister, reluctantly aiding in a dangerous task...\n\nAnd Nomzamo Mbatha as his royal hair-cutter and basically the new version of Sheri Headly: a free-thinking bride to change the age-old rules. Unfortunately, this love story is far too rushed to matter, inserted into the 11th hour what took the entire original movie to pan-out more naturally, and humorously."

I guess there are a lot of terrible C movies like this, but it's notable seeing it come as a sequel to a pretty good movie, and to come from a well-respected actor. Otherwise I wouldn't be bothering to write this.\n\nAlso, the movie felt the need to jump on the social justice bandwagon, which I would have no problem with if it didn't seem so forced, or if the arguments they used actually made any sense. Apparently it's a travesty that the royal lineage only passes to males, and it should clearly pass to females instead. Yet no character in any part of the movie ever questions the existence of a ROYAL LINEAGE in the first place. Like hmmm, maybe we shouldn't have a throne at all? But no, the same way liberals talk about having more female CEOs or whatever, they're fine with these oppressive systems as long as the rulers are more equally distributed across identity groups."

The new characters added a lot of new laughs and the original cast members/characters were just as funny as they were all those years ago. I did miss Eriq, tho. The throw back clips to the the first film were awesome, timely, and a smart move. They even threw my very favorite line (is that velvet?) from the first film back in. Looooved the nod to the Dukes, too! I loved the costumes and the dancers made me feel like I was right there in Zamunda. This film is a class act and it's so much fun. It doesn't try to be anything but that. Don't listen to a thing the haters say, Eddie. You did the first film justice by making the sequel a blast to watch. It was a great time, often laugh out loud funny. I liked it so much, I'm watching it again. Queen Aoleon would be proud. Well done!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm seeing a lot of low ratings for this movie ranging from 4's & 5's to even some 1's and I think I know why that is it seems many people are going into this movie expecting it to be a pure outlandish with memorable character/personalities an a story like the last one and that's just the problem, if your judging this one by the first one then don't even bother watching it.\n\nThat was 1988, Eddie Murphy is at a different point in his life no longer that brazen, raw, NC-17 comedian that he was at the time so therefore it's only logical that this film would be different. DON'T go into this movie expecting that type of comedic film because your just gonna be disappointed and a movie like that like the previous in an of itself would be a tough act to follow. We're we all wanting that? Yes. Myself included.\n\nHaving said all of that judging it at face value; it's not a bad movie IMO sure it's more family oriented and tamed overall but I honestly wasn't offended by that since I found there to be a nice rounded mix of old and new characters with much care & personality fleshed into them as well as the story I thought the actors did a believable job playing it I even was surprised that there was actually some tears being shed in the dramatic scenes abd the comedy like I said it serves second to the story and while yes it tamed PG-13ish I laugh maybe not out loud hardcore rolling on the floor but certainly audible, an still found myself smiling and chuckling much\n\nFlaws? I wish the backstory of main villain and the girlfriend were a bit more fleshed out the main villain's character, and his evil agenda as well as the girlfriend of our leading actor. I was hoping her backstory was a bit more detailed since a good chunk of the plot revolves around her. Also I wish her & the rest of Akim's kids had more involvement in dialogue and attention. Lastly from the time the first one ended to now I wish I would've know about what happens during the 33 year span from the first one nothing too much but a little history and details here and there between the main characters and zemunda.\n\nOverall this movie felt like more of a stand alone than a sequel and I actually thoroughly enjoyed it. Not as memorable but a good film to watch with the family if you just wanna have some laughs and a lighthearted story. (:"

Fortunately, because there are so many favorite parts in the original, the result is a good amount of enjoyable content here.\n\nIt's a shame that I've seen ratings in the mid 5 range for this.

This is done by new scenes with the actors deaged.\n\nAkeem becomes king of Zamunda. As he only has three daughters, he needs to groom his new found son Lavelle Junson from Queens to be the new crown prince. This understandably upsets Akeem's eldest daughter as well as his wife Lisa.\n\nAkeem also wants Lavelle to marry the daughter of the bellicose General Izzi (Wesley Snipes) from a neighbouring kingdom. This way he will unite the families of both kingdoms.\n\nComing 2 America recognises that the world has changed since 1988 and has a more inclusive outlook.\n\nThe subtext being that it is Akeem's daughters who take on General Izzi. It still explores the themes of marrying the person that you connect with.\n\nIt is a fun filled sequel with plenty of nods to the original Coming to America and other Eddie Murphy films. There is a quick shot of a painting of the Duke brothers from Trading Places (as well as Coming to America.)\n\nJohn Amos and James Earl Jones are just few of the actors who reprise the roles from the original. New veterans include Tracy Morgan and Wesley Snipes who almost steals the movie in what is now for him a rare non action role.\n\nThis is still Murphy's and Hall's movie. They also reprise many of the other characters they played in the original such as the Barbershop characters who must be over a 100.\n\nIt is not as good as the original when Murphy was in his pomp but it has some heart and soul. It also has a fair few cameos including Morgan Freeman, En Vogue, Salt n Pepa and Gladys Knight."

It felt like the film was specifically designed around including as many nostalgic moments as possible, down to some of the same costumes but cheaply made this time. Just like the whole film. Total bomb. You've been warned."

        "review_detailed_main": "Coming to America is one of Eddie Murphy's most charming and funny films. The idea if going back to his character of Akeem and bring back most of the cast for a sequel sounds good right? But when I saw the trailer for this sequel I was not expecting much. Trailers, especially for sequels should make you excited to see them. This one didn't. And after enduring the hour and 45 minutes of this film I can see why the trailer was so bad. There was no good laughs to put in it!!!\n\nThis is one of the worst sequels ever made. I know that it was released straight to streaming but I feel that Paramount must have had no confidence to release this in theaters. Yes I know that theaters are virtually empty because of COVID but if this were released under normal circumstances I think it would have failed at the box office. I get that sequels are mostly cash grabs these days and are almost always inferior to their originals but the dip in quality of this film compared to the first one is gigantic!!! It is not only unfunny, it is aggressively unfunny!!! I might have chuckled once or twice, but it was seriously unfunny. It obviously banks on yhe nostalgia that people have for the original and tries to hit the same beats but fails miserably. They bring back just about every actor from the first film here, but it feels like it's just they were brought back so people could acknowledge that they came back, nothing more!!! But worse is Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall. All of the chemistry they had in the first film isn't here!!! They are just not funny. What they do is supposed to be funny, but it just isn't. They both play multiple characters again, many of the same ones they did in the first one liked the old guys in the barber shop but the scenes just didn't work for me!!! I wanted to laugh but just didn't. Eddie Murphy's performance seems phoned in. He doesn't seem to even want to be there. He can be so funny and in the case of the first film charming. There is none of that here. The supposed story here is that Akeem, now King, finds out he has a son in America. Akeem goes back to Queens to meet and bring his son back to Zamunda so he could become heir to his thrown. Also there is a plot point about a militaristic dictator of a neighbor nation played by Wesley Snipes demanding one of Akeem's daughters marry his son. All of this is more or less done like the first film but without any laughs or charm. I just don't get why so many funny and talented people could be so unfunny. It doesn't help that this sequel comes 33 years after the original film. Nostalgia could only take you so far. Last year Bad Boys For Life did what this film couldn't recreate the feeling and chemistry between its leads and deliver alot of good laughs. Unfortunately, Coming 2 America failed miserably in doing that. The first film is a very funny and charming fantasy. This has none of what made the Coming To America enjoyable.\n\nThe fact that almost everybody that was in the original is back and that didn't help says alot. Also, I think that the prior film being directed by John Landis helped. He was a very reliable director of comedies. The new director Craig Brewer doesn't seem to have the chops for this material. Bad script, lazy performances from your star equals disaster.\n\nI don't know why but Eddie Murphy sequels seem to just be bad!!! I think the only sequel to an Eddie Murphy hit that I've liked is Beverly Hills Cop 2!!!\n\nVery Bad sequel here, maybe the worst in his career!!!\n\nGrafe: F."

It would have been better to do a sequel two or three years after and have that fail, but 33 years, now that Coming to America is officially a classic!? People would never let that go.\n\nSo let's get this out of the way, Coming to America is a classic. You can't touch Coming to America. What you can do is make a really funny movie. I would expect this is what it would be like if Eddie Murphy actually started doing stand up again. We all worry if he could possibly top what he did 30 years ago and forget what we were talking about cause we are laughing too hard.\n\nFor someone like Eddie who was joined with a big ensemble cast of who's funny, I knew making us laugh could not be a problem. What did take me off-guard was how heart warming the film was. It's just like the first cause while the main story, or the one they advertised, was about Prince Akeem discovering he has a son back in Queens that is heir to his thrown (Despite fathering three more than capable daughters with Lisa McDowel), Coming 2 America has a similar love story to it's original. It also has a huge theme about the love of family which I dug.\n\nLike most sequels that come out decades after it's original, the movie is littered with references to the original, which did not wear me out as I thought it would as I was really happy to see so many faces from the first film. I will say all the jokes from the first film are in this film and are updated for 2021 (all except one bit that I guess makes sense cause it's just too 80s (you'll understand when you see the film).\n\nThey added all the old characters they could (Rest In Peace Marge St. Claire). I mean they even called back Garcelle Beauvais who was barely an actress when she had a small part as a flower girl in the original, just to be a full fledge actress now doing a cameo still tossing those flowers. All that and they had a big stable of new ones they had to put in the mix, but it works cause everyone was funny and charismatic.\n\nThe great modern day fairy tale did not even need and update but it got it and it was great!"

        "review_detailed_main": "* SIGH * And here it is, the second \"blast from the past\" disappointment in a row... First, we've got Tom & Jerry with Spike crapping all over the place and now? Now we've got this. Like everybody else, I loved the original movie. Together with Trading Places, it was, like, one of the best comedies from eighties. So, even though I tried to keep my expectations here as low as possible to avoid being disappointed much, I still hoped for good. Like Agent Mulder? I wanted to believe. Unfortunately... yeah. You know how it is. Didn't happen. Like... at all.\n\nFirst of all, it's exactly as forced as you may expect. Every single scene and every single line here screams \"forced\". The original Coming to America was daring, it was fresh and, well, it was... you know... FUN. This? It's just a forced mess. One of those movies that you forget right after you're done watching. Heck, it was actually hard not to fall asleep here. The main idea wasn't really that bad (long story short, the new movie tried to focus on Zamunda instead of Queens), but writing is so terrible that... seriously, how many people worked on the story and screenplay here?\n\nComing 2 America (the one who came up with the title alone should be punished) is one of those movies where some random people talk about some random stuff and you just sit there, wondering why in the freakin' world should you care and when this torture will finally end. Watching this movie? It's like visiting your distant relatives. It's kinda boring, it's kinda awkward and you can't stop thinking about just how much you want to go home. And guess what? The movie is almost two hours long, so I'm really glad that I watched it at home where it was easy to take a break and do some more exciting stuff. Like watching the paint dry, for example. Watching this movie in one sit? It's plain boring. Sure, humor is a subjective thing, but while I laughed all the time while watching the original (still do), this time? I didn't even smile once. It's THAT uninspired. Every time there was an attempt for a joke, I was like \"good grief, seriously?\". The original impact so-o-o ins't here...\n\nAlso, it's a bit too woke. In a bad way. I mean, don't get me wrong. I like woke stuff. Adds quite a lot to the impact, as long as the writing is right. Then again, you know how it is. There are times when such stuff feels natural. When it does make you care. And there are times when it feels painfully forced, out of the place and actually plays against the writing. You can't just make things interesting and exciting just by saying the right things, you know? You need a good writing to make people feel involved. Here? It feels like nobody even cared. They took one of the most popular comedy movies from eighties, they've tried to re-create some of the most famous parts (like those scenes in the barber shop), they've tried to copy / past some of the old jokes (without much success since, like I said, the original impact is long gone), they've added some woke stuff just because it's a right thing to do and BOOM! Your new Amazon Prime movie is ready. Seriously, guys, those female Ghostbusters were more funny and exciting than this. And I never thought I'll say that. Like... ever!\n\nThe only thing I actually liked was Akeem's daughters (one of which is played by Eddie Murphy's real daughter, Bella), but guess what? They've barely used the characters. Seriously, even though there was, like, a ton of potential, the girls barely appeared at the beginning and near the end of the movie. While the rest of the thing was just our painfully generic stuff from all those Eddie Murphy movies nobody really cared about. You know, Dr. Dolittle, Nutty Professor... I really wonder if the man is cursed, or something. After the initial success in movies like 48 Hrs., Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, the movies with him started to feel EXTREMELY forced in uninspired. And this one? Heck, even Meet Dave was more funny than this.\n\nNot only Coming 2 America was unable to repeat the original success, it's also one of those sequels that actually ruin the original quite a lot. Not only it's forced and isn't funny at all, it ended up ruining good old characters. Lisa McDowell, for example, feels absolutely terrible now, while Cleo barely have a reason to appear. Not only this movie won't make you laugh, there's a big chance it'll actually make you feel sad. Just because seeing a great movie from your childhood being ruined in such a poor way? It's... you know... SAD. Dixi."

The plot is perfect for a sequel. The film has great nods to the original, and I think it says a lot of the film production and the reception of the original, that every single (alive) cast member makes a return (and the ones who sadly couldn't are spoke of with fondness). The film has so much energy it's almost like a celebration. The music is sublime, I was dancing along. And it was remarkable to see Murphy and Hall jump back into those character perfectly after 30 years! And the new addition of Wesley Snipes returning to a major picture was great too!\n\nIf you go in with the right attitude this film is the much needed celebration and light hearted entertainment that I certainly needed. Sure. If you compare it to the original you may be a little disappointed, but I'd suggest if you compare the original to the Ghostbusters or The Godfather you will also be disappointed.\n\nIt was great to see Prince Akeem bringing Zamunda to the 21st century, as it was great seeing this classic comedy being brought into the 21st century too. Also, I want to say this film was essentially free to anyone with Amazon Prime! If you're compare it to anything, compare it to the endless garbage titles on rental that you pay \u00a39.99 for!"

The closest it comes is in casting Leslie Jones, as if to say, \"hey, she's a funny lady so her mere presence makes this a comedy, right?\" Wrong. The movie instead spends all of it's time on an inane princess and pauper plot line that strings together the worst Disney cliches. It did have a bunch of money put into it, which it wasted on grand opulent parties and dance sequences. Must have been a blast to shoot, but it's an absolute chore to watch."

The story is so forced and disjointed and doesn't know what it wants to be that it's uncomfortably frustrating trying to figure out just what the point in this movie is, because it certainly isn't to make you laugh. Eddie Murphy is simply an empty shell of the comedy actor he was in the 80's, in fact, the whole cast are empty shells here; there's nothing behind their eyes except dollar signs... it's actually quite sickening to see them take advantage of their audience like that. I do get it, of course, it's easy money, and they'd be stupid not to take the gig, but at least put in some effort, ugh, why do I do this to myself?... Anyway...there's zero spark in any of the characters, and nothing is really driving them. There's no chemistry between anybody in any scene (that we saw), it actually felt awkward to watch the whole time. The actors are simply saying their lines like it's painful for them to speak, not one of them looks like they want to be there. Which brings me to the dialogue..... I'm not even sure I even want to go there because it's so cringe inducing. Nobody talks like that in real life. Well, they've already made their money, and it's pretty clear that's the only thing anybody cared about while making this embarrassment to cinema. It truly saddens me that this is the best they could come up with at this moment in time. I'll leave it there before I have a breakdown. PLEASE DO NOT TORTURE YOURSELF."

        "review_title": "Another Late Comedy Sequel that's too Much of the Same",
        "review_detailed_main": "Coming to America was never a movie that I grew up watching, nor ever seen until fairly recently. Something about it just never appealed to me, and that's coming from someone who will watch anything. With that said, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the original film when I finally sat down to watch it. The goofiness along with a great comedic performance by Eddie Murphy is what held the movie together and made it so likeable. Well, 33 years after the first film, a sequel was just released on Prime Video, and while I have to admit that I laughed a few times, it's a very poor film overall.\n\nComing 2 America picks up in real-time with these characters, decades later. Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) is unimpressed that he has no son to be his heir once his newfound reign as King ends. Learning that he accidentally made a son of his very own while on his first trip to America, he ventures back to meet him and bring him home. This is also where today's lingo and humour are brought into the film tenfold, making for a very jarring experience in comparison with the first. I get it, the humour of the first film was very much of the time, as is this one, but it didn't click all that often for me. It felt more like pop culture references rather than legitimate jokes.\n\nEddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall are both once again very enjoyable here, trying to keep up with the times, and I even enjoyed Lavelle Junson as Akeem's son Jermaine. The biggest problem this film faces, however, is the fact that it feels like a copy and paste of the original film. Aside from a few side characters/plots that kept it from feeling identical, I honestly felt like I was watching the first film again, through the lens of 2021. It was like a blend of old and new, which has worked for some late sequels, but it didn't click here for me. That's a shame because this film has some very relevant underlying messages that are very well-done. I just wish they were in a better film.\n\nI truly believe the reason that so many people seemed to be looking forward to this sequel was the fact that Eddie Murphy has recently been appearing in more projects again. He definitely hasn't lost his charm, but just like the cast of movies like Anchorman or Dumb and Dumber, sometimes it feels like these actors are just trying to replicate the past. As I said, it has worked before, but it seems pretty rare at this point. I laughed multiple times, but only because of a few unexpected line deliveries from certain performers. There were a few scenes where it felt a little improved, and those were easily the best moments.\n\nOverall, the story plays out exactly how you think it will after watching the first 10-20 minutes. If for nothing else, it's good for a few laughs that are spread throughout the movie, but I just didn't connect with the story this time. I'm not saying late sequels to popular movies need to stop, but I believe they deserve more. This movie felt lazy to me, which was a huge disappointment. Coming 2 America is now streaming on Prime Video. Certain viewers will probably have a blast, but I personally can't recommend it."

Coming 2 America is a cheap, painful money grab. Just horrible. The barbershop scenes are still the best part and if you enjoyed the those characters you will still enjoy this part of the show. The fun play on McDonalds and McDowells was still pretty cute, but those scenes are only small snippets. Everything else is so disappointingly bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen a lot of negative reviews on here for this film and to be honest, It's getting to the point I can't take any reviews seriously on here.\n\nHere's my completely unbiased take not expecting for one minute to live up to the original.\n\nIs the film funny? - Yes in places it is. I wasn't laughing the whole way through but, there was more than enough laughs through out this film to keep me entertained. I have no idea what viewers that have allegedly seen the film were expecting? On top of that It's Rated 12 in the UK so, It was never going to have the language or some of the jokes that were present in the original film.\n\nFor me, It was a nice little trip down memory lane. It was lovely to see how Akeem and Lisa were as King And Queen with Three kids in tow. In parts, Lisa handles being Queen a Lot better than Akeem does as King. Akeem is now a King, A Father, A Husband and Ruler of Zamunda and has a lot to juggle so for Akeem, a lot of the story has to do with rediscovering who he is.\n\nShari Headley As Lisa looks even better with age and the chemistry she had with Murphy in the first film is still there.\n\nWhilst we end up in familiar territory with Coming2America (No Spoilers) If you take this as a continuation of the story of Akeem then you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for this film to surpass the original then I would advise not to bother watching.\n\nI just like to add the supporting cast of characters especially Wesley Snipes as General Izzi were more than fine and competent in their roles and the return of some old favourites and a few surprises add a little bit more to the happy factor when watching.\n\nDon't get me wrong, In the middle of the film, I didn't find myself laughing as much but, The last 20 minutes, redeemed the film for me.\n\nIn closing, I don't think they ever set out to win any awards but the 1-3 star reviews it's been getting are rubbish. I've rated it a 6 because as I said, the middle of the film is a bit flat but, the beginning and end make that up for me.\n\nJust don't view it as a sequel, view it as a continuation to the original and you may be pleasantly surprised and, ignore any 1-3 stars reviews because they are fake."

I think James Earl Jones was held at gunpoint to do this. The storyline was lackluster at best. Bringing back the barbershop quartet (who must be 120 years old by now) was laughable in the worst way. I'm honestly surprised they didn't CGI Don Ameche & Ralph Bellamy to round out the idiocy... Or did they? I honestly made it 40 minutes in before I felt my IQ drop significantly.\n\nYou just can't make a PG-13 sequel to an R rated classic."

King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones) is dying. General Izzi (Wesley Snipes) is demanding a marriage to tie together the rival neighboring countries. Akeem needs a son to take over the country. Semmi (Arsenio Hall) reveals that he coerced Akeem into a forgotten sexual encounter with Mary Junson (Leslie Jones). Akeem and Semmi go back to America to find Akeem's son Lavelle Junson (Jermaine Fowler).\n\nThe premise with Leslie Jones is uncomfortable and very awkward. The movie tries its best to play it off as something funny. It's not funny. It's really not funny for Lisa and the rest of the family. As for the male ascension to the throne, the solution is obvious and the audience is forced to wait for Akeem to come up with the only right answer. I would suggest a different route for the initial premise. In between the two movies, King Jaffe could become a widower and he had a fling with a Queens woman. By this movie, his young son from that union would be the next heir but he's estranged and don't want anything to do with Zamunda. That's the cleaner and less yucky way to get to the same general location.\n\nAs for the rest of it, it's fun. One needs to ignore the uncomfortable premise. Just enjoy this for what it is. It's a bunch good people reuniting and having a good time. There is no meanness to anything. We're revisiting beloved old characters and everything works out in the end. It's fine."

Impressive how James Earl Jones was 88 during filming of this yet still reasonable health. Morgan Freeman's voice for announcements will remain legendary that's for sure! Also one of Louie Anderson's last roles rip. A lot of great cast carries on from a 37 year old classic and this one is pretty fun for what it is! The dialogue is mixed it has its moments, the acting is good enough, makeup is great even though it didn't win the Oscar, and I love soundtrack quite a bit. So good that barber folks are they were among the best in the original."

The comedy is lightweight. Fans of the original won't be happy whilst some newcomers will probably like it. What a great opportunity wasted."

It is not, she is irritating.\n\nThe premise of the movie is Leslie Jones character was supposed to have drugged and had sex with Akeem the first time around in the 80s and they had a baby he was totally unaware of. So in this me2 climate this is deemed a laughing matter to base an entire movie upon when its a women doing it to a man I guess.\n\nOverall this was an awful movie. It was unfunny and tiresome. I will say however I loved Nomzamo Mbatha as the royal Barber. She stole the film and made it a 4 as opposed to a 1. And John Amos is brilliant as Cleo McDowall as is Shari Headley's Lisa McDowell. They were the only sparks in a tired by the numbers movie. Everyone else, especially Arsenio Hall, looked tired and lacking any energy."

Extremely weird pacing with awful editing.\n\nDidn't anyone on the set yell out \"cut cut .. one more take\" ? Because the whole movie needs another take.\n\nHuge admirer of Eddie Murphy, loved his performance in \"Dolemite is my name\" and was hoping he would continue in fine form (also Craig Brewer the director). Sadly Eddie's performance is the weakest one in the movie. Can it be his worst performance yet?\n\nIn the lead up to the movie I watched Eddie's interviews where he claimed \"we have gone above and beyond with the sequel\". The end result couldn't be further from the truth. Awful direction, filled with lame and cheesy \"Kardashian\" type jokes just to keep up with the times. It just seem so forced.\n\nI wished they kept the R rating and the grimy, grainy dirty New York look of the original. This movie looks so crisp, almost like a HD soap opera tv show.\n\nThe original was such a classic because of the \"raw\" feeling that the supporting cast like Frankie Faison (it's a damn shame what the did to that dog) contributed with. Nothing like this in the new one.\n\nFeels like a bad SNL sketch. Clean, lame, weird and without charm. I felt robbed."

Loud and obnoxious lol.\n\nOther than that I thought this was decent, not better than the original or even equal to the original, but this was still entertaining. Most sequels (with the exception of the Lethal Weapon franchise and the Back to the Future franchise IMO) don't do well to impress the original audience.\n\nIt's great to see these characters back on the screen, but this sequel probably would have been better if it came out 10-20 years ago."

I found it to be a solid enough sequel story with some funny callbacks and enough enjoyable moments of its own. It's worth seeing just to revisit the old cast and characters. Eddie and Arsenio have still got it, and it's supported by some great performances from the original and new cast, especially Wesley Snipes, who clearly loved flexing his comedy chops here, with that despotic charisma he gave us back in Demolition Man.\n\nI was wondering how woke they'd take this sequel, understandably some people could find the first movie to be problematic 33yrs later, (mostly the gender inequality and outdated African stereotypes) but the sequel does a good job of keeping enough of the same humour for modern audiences. The CGI animals were not good, at all, and tbh it probably could be 10-15 minutes shorter, but I enjoyed it, and you might too. 7/10"

Then there was the multi-punch cameos of En Vogue, Salt 'n' Pepa, Lil Kim, and Gladys Knight. I think John Legend whined a song during the credits. The jokes fall flat. As one reviewer wrote, the film gives viewers the impression that black culture is about weird phrases and hip-hop music. Frustrating and vastly self-depreciating. Every major black actor had a role, and yes, even Morgan Freeman. I was half expecting to see Denzel Washington or Jamie Foxx pop up. The only two white characters in a speaking role were a dithering tit for the 'McDonalds\" corporation and an accused business owner who was being accused of being handed everything. Very cringe-worthy. And by far the worst part, is that this is almost a carbon-copy of 2003's \"What A Girl Wants\". Not seen it? Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth. Much better story line, warm-hearted, far funnier and charming all the way. Eddie, I am stunned by this movie. You were epic in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" trilogy and many other after... but this is a super-low point. I wish I could unsee this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Coming 2 America did a few things correctly, being a sequel to a very funny and very successful movie a generation ago, in 1988. The nods to the previous movie with flashbacks, music, and the secondary characters created by Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall were all very entertaining. And the brightest spot was Wesley Snipes as General Izzi, trying to marry off his daughter to Murphy's son as a way to prevent war between neighboring nations. Snipes' comedic timing and talents were unbridled and on full display, in contrast to the many serious dramatic and action roles he has played for decades.\n\nIn the sequel, Eddie Murphy rises from prince to king of Zamunda, and comes back to Queens to seek out a son he didn't know he had, as the laws of Zamunda only allow a male heir to eventually take the throne. After finding his son, he brings him and his family from Queens to Zamunda to prepare for an arranged marriage. The clash of cultures has some funny moments, and Murphy as king must now decide whether to allow his son to marry the woman he chooses, or the woman arranged for him. The makers of this movie should have stopped there.\n\nInstead we got a steady stream of lecturing on how men are sexist and misogynistic, weaved into each of the plot turns. Every few minutes. Nonstop. OK, we get it. It completely sucked the fun out of the movie. But this is 2021, and if you are going to release a movie in 2021, you WILL bow down to the woke gods of political correctness. And you will do it early, and often."

        "review_detailed_main": "Celebrating his 30th anniversary with Lisa, Prince Akeem is visited by the military dictator, General Izzi, of neighbouring Nextdooria, who, due to the fact Akeem does not have a male heir, threatens to invade Zamunda after the passing of King Jaffe Joffer. When Akeem conveniently learns of a son back in Queen's, he travels back to America to find him with the intention of bringing him home and teaching him what he needs to know to one day rule Zamunda.\n\nThe main function of a comedy is to be funny, right? To be honest this film didn't make me laugh as much as I'd hoped. There were a few giggles, but compared to the original this film does struggle to deliver the humour. One of the reasons for this is that they try too hard to reuse gags from the first film. I guess the thought process being if people found it funny the first time, they'll find it funny again. Doesn't work that way. And any of the riskier jokes in this either had a quick retort or were fully explained to make sure we as an audience were in no doubt that it was only a joke.\n\nAnd narratively this film is also way too similar to the original. Everything there is in the original is also in this sequel, which made me cringed at the lot of the scenes. It's like the whole thing or movie became self-aware/too conscious of itself, \"hey we are making a sequel to a classic comedy movie after 30 something years why don't we just put everything in the original in this and also get every black actor/celebrity there is on the planet to also act in the movie\"\n\nHowever, while the similarities are apparent, that actually wasn't that much of a problem. I quite enjoyed the story. The beats may have been predictable, but the way it was filmed and performed was sufficient to exceed my low expectations. Performance-wise, I thought Murphy and the returning Arsenio Hall still had good chemistry. They brought back many of the original characters which was nice. The new characters are also a bit likable. Jermaine Flowler, who plays Akeen's son Lavelle Junson, was good but I'm not a fan of his character, the character totally lacks any kind of personality, he way too 'comedic' to be taken seriously. He pales in comparison with Murphy's Akeem in every way. His mum and uncle played by Leslie Jones and Tracy Morgan respectively were funny but only for a short amount of time. Akeem has three kick-ass daughters, the eldest, Meeka, was played brilliantly by KiKi Layne. Wesley Snipes, who clearly had the best time making this. Every time he enters a room and the way he walks was funny. Then when he spoke he was pretty funny too.\n\nSomething else I didn't expect from this film was the amount of singing and dancing there was, not a fan of that, as I found most of them to be cringey but there were a few sequences; a couple of bigger ones at the beginning and end that were quite fun. We got a few decent musical cameos. There was also a well choreographed fight scene in here too.\n\nAside from a slightly unconvincing CGI lion, visually, this film was nice to look at. The costume design I think was award-worthy. Same could be said for the hair & makeup. Even the production design was fantastic. The use of colours in this film was also good.\n\nOverall, Nowhere as good as the original, and like they said if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but nevertheless 'Coming 2 America' is a slightly enjoyable film if taken for what it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "IN BRIEF: An unfunny comedy that wastes the talents of Eddie Murphy and company.\n\nJIM'S REVIEW (NOT RECOMMENDED) It saddens me to say that Eddie Murphy is a tired retread of his former comic self in this tired retread of his former hit comedy from the late 80's, Coming to America. The title upgrade is more clever than this sequel. Yes, it took over 30 years for this second coming. One can only hope that another installment of the Coming to America franchise remains on the drawing boards permanently and the third coming is past gone.\n\nThis labored sequel has an intriguing premise that never comes to fulfillment. Prince Akeem of Zamunda has no male heir to the throne and his kingdom is being threatened by a military dictator, General Izzi (Weslie Snipe). So he goes off to America with his trusty aide Semmi (Arsenio Hall) to locate his recently discovered male successor Lavelle Johnson (Jermaine Fowler), a product of Akeem's drug-induced one night stand, Mary (Leslie Jones) from his previous coming in America.\n\nThe screenplay-by-committee is evident from the start with only fitfully funny moments on display. Blame can be aimed squarely at the movie's writer team of Kenya Barris, Barry W. Blaustein and David Sheffield. They abandon the stranger-in-a-strange-land formula that made the original so delightful and instead focus on the story of the newly found prince and his formulaic romantic coming-of-age journey back in Africa. It's all smutty innuendoes and well-worn gags despite some engaging performances.\n\nMr. Murphy can also take some of the blame as the film's main producer. This movie need a lot more than major rewrites; it needed major re-thinking. This is the type of movie where the crew must have had more fun making than moviegoers will have more fun enjoying. Director Craig Brewer assembles his large cast, many whom reprise their roles, and puts them through the paces once again, but his own pacing is off this time around.\n\nMost of the cast is waylaid by the material it was given. Some actors were unharmed in the making of this movie: Mr. Fowler has a nice screen presence as the Lion King, Nomzamo Mbatha is a fine love interest, and the aforementioned Ms. Jones and Mr. Snipe try to breathe some life in their one-dimensional characters. As Akeem's wife, Shari Headley has her moments and John Amos is solid as Akeem's father-in-law. The esteemed James Earl Jones has a short but sweet role reprising Akeem's father. As Princess Meeka, the eldest daughter and real heir to the throne, the talented Kiki Layne is wasted in her underdeveloped role. However, there is some truly cringe-worthy acting from Tracey Morgan as Lavelle's uncle and tons of cameos by many Black entertainers that pad the story with lavish musical interludes and no real humor.\n\nGranted, a few scenes which do provide some entertainment value and hint back to the earlier more successful predecessor that involve Mr. Murphy and Mr. Hall's multiple supporting performances, under heavy layers of prosthetics. Their comic talents shine in these sequences. (The make-up department does wonders too.) But they and the majority of the ensemble are adrift in this alleged comedy that settles for the predictable and unfunny.\n\nWhen the costumes upstage the actors and the story, one knows something is terribly amiss in the disappointing comedy, Coming 2 America. The sumptuous costume design by Ruth E. Carter deserves a better film. So do we. (GRADE: C-)"

        "review_detailed_main": "To prepare for the highly anticipated sequel release I spent my Friday evening watching Coming to America, the original. A friend of mine cooked some amazing Fu Yung Hai which we enjoyed eating while watching the absolute 80s Eddie Murphy experience. He forgot part of the recipe and made a plate that could have easily fed 6 people instead of the four it was meant for, but it was delicious nonetheless.\n\nOwing to the COVID-19 lockdown we couldn't really finish the movie before our 9 P.M. curfew kicked in. But as we've all seen the original countless times before we knew how it ended and so we felt reasonably refreshed and confident going into the sequel.\n\nFlash forward to Saturday evening. The beginning of the film was quite promising. It was good to see most of the original cast reprise their roles over 30 years later. Quickly Eddie finds himself having to journey once again to Queens, NY. However, to much dismay, barely 10 minutes of runtime later he takes the plane home. This is when the movie falls apart.\n\nSlowly the viewer realizes that the rest of the movie is going to play out not just -not- in America, but also not with Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall as the lead players. Instead this movie turns into a vehicle for Jermaine Fowler and Leslie Jones, and it does not work.\n\nIt is very much a shame, having to give this film a 4 out of 10. They had only one requirement that this movie should have covered: Eddie as an African King in the US.\n\nHow in the lord did they fail to do that?"

Most of its humour misses the mark, its plot is all over the place and it generally just feels a bit subpar. It's almost like two or three movies shoved together, with its attention torn between Murphy's newly crowned King Akeem and Fowler's newly discovered Prince Lavelle. Yet, it still manages to remain relatively engaging and, once it's properly underway, even quite enjoyable. This is mainly because it brings back the original's likeable cast while also successfully implementing some new players. When it comes down to it, it only works as well as it does because of its well-performed characters. Its call-backs are frequent but not bothersome; it doesn't feel like a quick nostalgia-based cash-grab or anything like that. There's the sense that everyone involved had a great time on set and this actually makes it easier to forgive the thing's shortcomings. Don't get me wrong, it isn't great. I mean, it's not even as good as it should have (and could have) been. It's decent enough, though. It's also never even close to boring. 5/10."

What is amazing, you get everybody back from the original movie - everyone that was available and had a role in the script. And then you get some more people! Like Tracy Morgan and Wesley Snipes to name but two.\n\nReally well cast all around, with Eddie and Arsenio playing multiple roles all around. And they don't seem to have aged that much to be honest. New York doesn't seem to have changed much either - except from the hairstyle thing. And while you may be asking yourself \"how are those people from the Barbershop still alive, 30 years later?\" ... the obvious answer is, because they are played by Arsenio and Eddie ... but if that is not enough ... remember: this is just a movie - and a comedy at that.\n\nIt has its own sets of rules sort of. There are things here that do not work as fine as they were in the original. There is also the being aware element that plays more into the cards of those who don't like the movie: talking about sequels and how they mostly don't work. But for every such moment, you have another great moment or dance from Wesley Snipes ... or any scene with Tracy, if you are a fan of course.\n\nThe flashbacs work at first and I even thought they included some deleted scenes. But it becomes evident quickly that they just use a deaging software, similar to the one I reckon that they used at the Irishman. Unfortunately it becomes especially evident with Eddies face, where it looks weird to say the least, when he has to do expressions.\n\nIt may be flawed and predictable, but it also is quite fun, if you let it. You can either roll with it then or just hang onto the original. The choice is yours. The callbacks make it a fun ride though"

Kudos to Paramount for completing it and selling it to Amazon.\n\nI'm 30 minutes into this film as it has just been released and I've been happy all day knowing it was to be released. However, not only is this a nostalgia fest from the off (which has both good and bad emotional effects on the viewer), but it also heavily relies on a lot of CGI and you can tell that a lot of the scenes were filmed very, very, very socially distanced and simply cut into the edit. This zaps all of the enjoyment out of the room as what comedy relies on is people in the room.\n\nI get the whole Covid socially distancing thing, and agree - but this was filmed before Covid and whilst you can forgive James Early Jones for doing his parts remotely (as most of the cast too to a degree), there are some scenes where the comic timing is off and you can see it is down to differential directing.\n\nUnfortunately, this film adds to a long succession of films which prey upon your nostalgia without really whetting its appetite. From a personal perspective, it's good to see Eddie Murphy and the cast again - but Paramount were right to flog this to Amazon; I'd probably have never paid my hard earned cash to see this and wait for it to hit TV (which is has - it Amazon Prime the 'New' Direct-to-Video?).\n\nOkay, so after the full viewing I'm quite happy with my original rating. It is nowhere near as bad as some of these reviewers are making out. Not by a country mile. But what it is is a pastiche of everything that made the original what it was. Everyone is in there and everyone plays their part - it's deftly cringe at times, and quite amusing in others. It isn't as funny as the original, but what are you gonna do?\n\nHowever - In Retcon City, the walls are wide and diverse and a lot of this feels like rewriting ones memoirs.\n\n5/10 - Eddie and co all look good for their respective ages - with respect.\n\n-1 - Whoever told Paramount that 'Arnieing' Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall was a good idea?"

The principal cast members return with some new characters played by Jermaine Fowler, Tracy Morgan, Nomzamo Mbatha and KiKi Layne.\n\n\"Coming 2 America\" (2021) is nowhere near as good as the first movie (which is probably my all-time favorite comedy), but it is fun to see where the characters are at after over thirty years, not to mention what they look like.\n\nThere are four things that hold the flick back: It seems like it's in a hurry, peppered with music videos, not to mention it's noticeably goofier than the original. It's afraid to slow down for some compelling or heartwarming drama. When they do, like with Lavelle (Jermaine) and Mirembe (Nomzamo), it works and you start get drawn into the characters, but then it cuts to another crazed scene.\n\nSecondly, Akeem isn't as likable or funny here, whether that's because of Eddie's low-energy, mediocre writing or simply Akeem being stifled by tradition, I don't know; probably a combination. Thirdly, the trip to New York City comes and goes so this isn't really much of a Coming to America 2. The focus is on Zamunda, which is fine, but the story needed more interesting ideas and writing.\n\nLastly, I liked Jermaine Fowler as Lavelle Junson; he has charisma, but he pales in comparison to Murphy as Akeem in the first movie. The creators needed to spend more time fleshing out the potential of Jermaine and his character.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, \"Coming 2 America\" is still worth catching if you're a fan of the original flick. It's great to see all the old characters and there are some amusing and entertaining moments; for instance, the early bit with Bopoto (Teyana Taylor), which made me bust out laughing.\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in Atlanta, Georgia, and New York City.\n\nGRADE: B-/C+"

If you were expecting it to be as good as Coming to America that's on you. You should have known it wasn't going to be the same quality when you saw who some of the new cast members were. Plus it was free with my Prime membership and it discussed class discrimination among black people and the tension that often exists between black Americans and Africans.\n\nI came in with no expectations, had a few laughs, got a few warm fuzzies, and left feeling about the same as I felt after watching the Fresh Prince and Community reunions. Sure the plot was done do death and Semmi was underutilized but this is really less of a movie and more of a reunion show."

I don't know if it was amazon or Eddie himself who watered his comedy down, probably a mix of both, but he should have stayed out of making more movies after seeing the dissaster this one was.\n\nOn top of that the plot is a \"nothing\" sequel plot, it tries to justify itself by tieing itself to the previous movie but the tone is nothing like the previous one, it feels more \"comercial\", I know movies are made for profit not for the love of art, what i mean by comercial is that is devoided of any soul.\n\nIt is waste of your time."

Using some similar plot pieces and an ensemble that obviously was having a good time during filming they put together a movie that is both light-heartedly silly and just overall fun to watch. Sure, the plot is formulaic but: How good is it to see Wesley Snipes indulge in his role as General Izzi? The over the top spectacle with just the right amount of irony? I had a few good laughs and a smile on my face when the credits were done. And I think this is exactly what they set out to achieve: some easy, silly light-hearted fun. Nothing more - but nothing less either."

It was enjoyable to see these people doing these characters again, like trying on outfits you haven't worn in years. The new additions were just that, although I can't really say that they really did much for the story, which was basically a rehash of the original. But the film acknowledges this in a meta/postmodern way, so it's ok? Kind of? I will say that I laughed and had a decent time, but this will be a one-and-done. I wouldn't have bothered to see it had it not been part of my Amazon Prime subscription. Just add it to the growing list of self-referential pop culture ephemera that will not be remembered for half as long as the initial film that spawned it."

Hell no. Please do a remake.

Somehow the daughter of Izzi Bopoto really doesn't feel credible with this \"I like what my king likes\" lines, I would have rather expected a disconnect between them because of Bopoto giving an indication of being some predator herself rather the same as her father...\n\nAnyway, please take another shot at it.

Im sure it would have done well. This sequel definitely doesn't have any elements of the original. It lacked a certain elegance and I felt that there were scenes in there that didnt need to be there (mainly a lot of the music scenes). The character that played Meeka was very strong and if the movie centered around her more maybe it would have given it that original feel.\n\nAt certain times it felt like a mockery of African culture and some character's accents were on and off like they'd have the Zamunda accent and then it would be an American accent and then back to the Zamundan accent and so that took away from the authenticity. I cringed a bit at Leslie's character but then grew to love her in the end. I especially loved Wesley Snipes' character.\n\nLastly there seemed to be a fusion of Black American and African culture which was nice to see."

Akeem's bastard son is not likable in the slightest and overall for a comedy I laughed at like three jokes. But I dont think the script is awful it just is very singular minded no real twists or arches but just one big issue. I appreciate they used basically all the original cast but the movie didn't have the soul that made the first one good, but I guess you cant make a fish out of water story twice."

On top of this, some characters felt a little forced and just weren't needed which could have allowed more time for nostalgia trips. Having said that, I very much enjoyed the start and I feel the ending was a really great celebration of the film and cast and ultimately just felt like everyone was having a fun time which made me have fun too.

No laughs, maybe a few feel good smiles.\n\nI found the 1st half somewhat boring so I stopped watching midway. A few days later I finished it. The 2nd half went faster but is very predictable."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Coming 2 America\" is a Comedy movie and the sequel of \"Coming to America\", in which we watch Prince Akeem going to America again in order to find his long-lost son. He has to build his relationship with his son and control his kingdom.\n\nSince I had already watched the first movie I knew what I was about to watch and expect by the second. In comparison with the first movie, this one is less entertaining but still funny and watchable. The direction which was made by Craig Brewer was good and he followed the pattern of the first movie and he succeeded on connecting them very well. The interpretations of both Eddie Murphy who played as Prince Akeem / Clarence / Saul / Randy Watson and Arsenio Hall who played as Semmi / Morris / Reverend Brown / Baba were very good for one more time. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jermaine Fowler's who played as Lavelle Junson, Wesley Snipes' who played as General Izzi and Nomzamo Mbatha's who played as Mirembe. In conclusion, I have to say that \"Coming 2 America\" is a nice sequel and I recommend everyone to watch it but first I suggest you to lower your expectations otherwise you will be disappointed."

Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall are both reliably perfect in their multiple roles. Jermaine Fowler, KiKi Layne and Nomzamo Mbatha are all really good and Wesley Snipes is a scene stealer. It's reasonably funny with quite a few good jokes but nowhere near as funny as the original. Craig Brewer's direction is good, it's well filmed and well paced."

Of course, there is girl power, the overdone theme of so many movies today. The now standard CGI is plentiful. I'm not a Tracy Morgan fan, he strikes me as abrasive rather than funny, but to each his own.\n\nIf not compared to the first movie, this is very good. To get all the jokes, you really need to have seen the first movie before watching the sequel, although it can stand on it's own.\n\nThe movie has a good family message and is enjoyable. It's not as funny as the first movie, but not many movies are. It's nice to see the characters back again."
