This movie starts out a little slow but eventually builds up into a film that can hold it's own. This movie was fluid enough to keep me entertained and laughing here and there so it's not half bad. The fight scenes are good for the men. There is a romantic side of the movie too for the women,and a cultural touch as well. It is also very patriotic in the sense that it's a military movie and I'm sure many GI's will enjoy this movie too. Give it a chance if you have 90 minutes of free time, you may be surprised."

The first 35 minutes of the movie was just plain retarded and unfunny, then after that it gets a little better. However seeing that the 3 leading comedians were Larry The Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls, I still found the funniest guy in this movie to be Keith David. His role as Sgt. Kilgore made me laugh several times more than I laughed at the others, oh and Danny Trejo was pretty good as being the villain and being funny at the same time. But anyways I give this movie a 5 out of 10 because it starts off slow and unfunny, but then it kind of picks up and you might have a few laughs before the end credits start to roll."

I wish I had left sooner than what I did (I sat through nearly an hour and a half of this crap), I could have gotten a lot more done that day. Seriously, it was nothing but vague references to overdone jokes by both Larry the Cable Guy & Bill Engvall - two comedians who haven't changed their routines in nearly a decade, who by some fluke of nature, still have careers. At one point the movie actually paused to zoom in on Larry, covered with ammo, so he could say \"Git-r-done\" and rile up all the rednecks in the audience.\n\nEvery aspect of this movie was terrible. The acting, the fight scenes, the comedy, even the explosions were terribly boring and pathetic.\n\nWhat it boils down to is this: Bill Engval & Lary TCG are nothing without Jeff Foxworthy and Ron White. No, the movie wouldn't have been much better with those two on the bandwagon, but it might have at least had some laughable humor in it."

The jokes weren't funny AT ALL, the story was ridiculous and unconceivable beyond belief, and it looked like it was shot on home video. The fact that this movie got Greenlit is dumbfounding to me. If someone wants to see something funny in this genre then see Three Amigos (of which this movie is a blatant rip-off). I am not even that liberal of a person....but this movie would lead people to believe that American's believe that Mexicans are useless, uneducated, people who need rescuing by the amazing Super Power. Its appalling how it tries to represent what we Americans \"think\" - and if it is, we are doomed! This movie was Racist, full of Homophobia, and just plain stupid.

Anyone who has ever been in combat knows that humor is where you find it, and this movie has a lot of it, if you keep your mind open. This database is an amazing tool. If you look at other movies commented on by users who didn't like this movie, the majority haven't liked other inane titles with the same bent of humor. I don't pay theater prices to see a movie. They are a ripoff especially when most movie goers are rude, inconsiderate slobs. I guess my point is that if a person doesn't like this type of movie why pay the money to hate something you have predetermined to hate? The trailer was enough to know how the movie would be.\n\nIf you like to be entertained and don't want or have to think, this is an excellent movie"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the most horrendous movies I have ever seen. It's supposed to be a comedy but It wasn't very funny at any moment. And I don't know if it has a political message, is it pro Iraq war or anti, either way I couldn't tell. It's just a mess that should be avoided at all cost, it has no original joke and every joke has been told before. More than that, every joke and every situation that's supposed to be funny has been telegraphed and expected.\n\nThe movie is about a trio of redneck buddies who are in the Army reserves and are called up to duty to join the fight in Fallujah. Needless to say they did not make it there, but the redneck part is played to the hilt. From the first time they were introduced up to the time they landed at the wrong destination. Everything they do emphasize their ignorance and none of it is particularly funny. It's like the worst of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" it's not even ignorance in some cases just stupidity. And it makes the movie more painful to watch than already is.\n\nNone of the jokes and situations are original, and most of them are telegraphed and quite very early. The situation with Larry and his girlfriend (Christina Moore) was pretty much where it was going to go. You can't convince me that you didn't know what she was going to say. Even the sight gags were so obvious, sending us endless message that this trio are a bunch of rednecks and they're suppose to do the redneck clich\u00e9.\n\nOld jokes can sometimes still work if you have the right people to deliver it. Suffice to say this cast of goofballs just are not the right people. For the most part they know they're delivering a one liner or a punchline. It's been said that the best way to play comedy is to play it straight. These guys know they're in a comedy and what's worse is that they know it's bad comedy. None of the three leads are particularly good actors and what they do isn't create a character but rather create caricatures. Personally I find that that's common with comedians who try their hands at acting.\n\nThis movie is an unoriginal, unfunny, clich\u00e9d film. The jokes are clich\u00e9d and so are the situation. To make matters worse none of the lead are any good as actors."

        "review_detailed_main": "Originally, Jeff Foxworthy was scheduled to star in this film. Fortunately for him, his schedule wouldn't allow him to be in the movie and so his two friends, who were less lucky, starred in this mess. I thought Bill Engvall was too talented for this sort of terribleness. Larry the Cable Guy, however, is pretty much in his element. Don't believe me? Look up his filmography on IMDB! As for who took Foxworthy's part, I assume that was D.J. Qualls...a super-skinny guy who I cannot remember having seen in films before this one.\n\nIf you can believe it, 260 pound and 44 year-old Larry the Cable guy, 50 year-old Bill Engvall and D.J. Qualls (who appears less athletic and muscular than Wally Cox) are ALL supposed to be in the Army Reserves. We are not only supposed to believe these three are in the military (at least part-time) but that their Reservist unit consists of just these three men and no commanding officer!! Soon, however, a sergeant (David Keith) arrives and you'd think he'd whip them into shape. Instead, he announces they are going on active duty in Iraq!! So, in the next scene they are in a transport plane headed to Iraq...and an accident occurs and drops the four of them in Mexico*...and they three idiots believe it IS Iraq. As for the sergeant, he was left behind because they thought he was dead.\n\nAfter wandering about the countryside, they wander in to a town and they attack because they think they are in enemy teritory. Yes, despite everyone speaking Spanish, they still think they are in Iraq. However, they accidentally do something good...they drive off a group of nasty bandits who have been terrorizing the town. Now, the three morons are heroes.\n\nUnfortunately, their life as heroes is short-lived. The sergeant IS alive and is coming to get them AND the bandit leader (Danny Trejo) is planning on a rematch. What's next? Watch the film...or don't. I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.\n\nTo say that the story makes little sense is a big understatement...along with the fact that no country would ever allow these three misfits to serve. Much of it is totally stupid, some is offensive (IMDB won't allow me to post the offensive word they kept using) and, accidentally, some of it is actually funny. Now here's the interesting part--the professional comedians are NOT funny....but Danny Trejo is a hoot and makes the film at least watchable...the same is true of Qualls. More of them and less of the Larry/Bill would have made this a much better picture. In fact having NONE of Bill and Larry would have made the film much, much better. They suck...no two ways about it.\n\nSo is it worth seeing? Perhaps, if you have rather low standards. But I will say it's NOT as bad as many of the reviewers say...and I cannot imagine giving this one a 1 or 2 when there are thousands of worse films...not that this is a glowing endorsement to go see it! My attitude is that it's a brainless and occasionally funny time-passer....I just wish Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy had opted out of appearing in this one, as they were the worst thing about the film. Larry was, quite simply, Larry (I think that is pretty self-explanatory) and as for Engvall he generally acts like he's nearly comatose during most of the film.\n\n*Their reserve station was in Georgia...how they had to fly over Mexico to get to Iraq is beyond me!!"

The Mexican alpha-dog bandit is a hoot and is probably the best actor in this exercise in silliness. His gay nephew is a knee-slapper as well. Meanwhile, everything else is lightweight and not stressful. Think 'Gilligans Island' and you'll be right about where this will fall in the scheme of things. I did enjoy the flick and will probably watch it again because I was entertained which is all I wanted to begin with. If you don't get into rednack farce you probably won't have much use for this movie.

I ignored the warnings of IMDb and the bottom 100, and decided to actually give a \"Larry the Cable Guy\" movie a shot. Boy, was I sorry.\n\nThis film doesn't actually have a plot. It's just Larry the Cable Guy, Dj Quails, and 2 other actors doing a 4 man comedy show, who happen to be in the military and in Mexico. \"Delta Farce\" is overrun with jokes that are downright embarrassing. This is the kind of stuff where, a bush-league newbie comedian goes on stage for the first time and gets crickets. I felt genuinely embarrassed for whoever wrote this movie, and would advise them to take the \"sue for name removal\" route immediately.\n\nSecondly, \"Delta Farce\" was stupidly unbelievable and ridden with clich\u00e9s. For example, Keith David calls the men \"maggots\" in R. Lee Ermey fashion, and orders them to go to Iraq. Another dumb moment was the very fact that Marisol Nichols was in the movie, with makeup all done and perfect hair, with the rest of the village looking weathered and primitive. That wasn't the first, \"man, this is stupid\" moment, but it doesn't help you escape from the fact that you're watching a Larry The Cable Guy movie.\n\nSo, upon watching this garbage halfway through, I aborted my viewing mission, and left men behind; especially Larry the Cable Guy who should never star in a movie again. I'll probably work on humanitarian missions next, like advising other people to never watch this piece of crap again.\n\n2 / 10"

These three losers become members of the State Military Reserves and they are soon to go to Iraq to be deployed to the occupation of Fajullah. Hard-nosed Sergeant Kilgore (Keith David) has to prepare them and helping them keep a perfect shape. After this, they are all loaded on a C-130 transport plane bound to Iraq. However when the plane is over Mexico there is a thunderstorm and the pilots are forced to dump some cargo. The three misfits were sleeping in the Humvee that was dropped and Sergeant Kilgore happened to be there as he was looking where his men ended up. Since when they arrive they see only desert around them they assume they arrived in Iraq and even bury alive Kilgore! They soon end in a village and think that they are helping the villagers to fight against terrorists. In fact, the village is plagued by the attacks of a bandit gang led by Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) and the three ''heroes'' try to defeat them in various ways (and also save Sergeant Kilgore after he is kidnapped). And in the end they are seen as heroes and awarded with the Silver Star and the Purple Heart (and Kilgore will open a fitness centre) and Carlos becomes a comedian.\n\nSo it this movie any good? I thought ''so and so''. But you might assume it isn't as it has a score of 3,6 and for a period in 2019 it was in the Bottom 100 (the list of the 100 lowest rated major released movies) and when I read the reviews I even thought that I was watching a different movie! It has some very funny moments (such as when Kilgore is abducted and is forced to sing I'VE GOT YOU BABE by Sonny and Cher, or when Everett disguises himself as a lucha libre wrestler and he defeats all his opponents which might seem impossible as Everett is probably the skinniest guy I have ever seen on film!) and also kept me very entertained towards the end as I was curious to see how the bandits ended up. And the supportings performers (especially Keith David, Danny Trejo and Glenn Morshower) were a real hoot to watch.\n\nMy opinion is that this movie was just a decent and funny time-passer and I couldn't force myself to give it a 3 or a 4 as there are worst comedies out there (including most of the other Bottom 100 entries). If you don't have high expectations during the viewing just like I did, you might even like it."

That level of dumbness is simply not allowed. True, the Three Stooges could get very close to this, but their comedy was rapid fire and unsentimental. This film, on the other hand is pretty standard sympathy-for-the-dummy fair, meant to appeal to people who suspect their own inadequacies, so they want a comic hero dumber than they are but who validates their values. That in itself tells you that this is a bad movie.\n\nAnyway, on top of that general disorder, there is the unfunny humor about Iraq (Fallujah was a horrible blood bath); unfunny humor about gang murder; unfunny Mexican stereotypes; unfunny redneck stereotypes; unbelievable, and unfunny two day bootcamp scenes - well, what's the point of going on. The operative word is \"unfunny.\" Toilet humor, of course, and unfunny slapstick. What more could you ask from a film this childishly amateurish? Oh yeah, you can ask it to end - or just pull it out of the DVD player half-way through, which is what I did."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Delta Farce\" strains credibility even for a comedy whose sole purpose for existence is to strain credibility. Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall and DJ Qualls star as three imbecilic army reservists who are accidentally dropped off in Mexico on their way to Iraq. Unaware of the mix-up, the trio, believing at first that they are actually in Iraq, wind up fighting against some local gangsters who are terrorizing the inhabitants of a small rural village.\n\nAs written by Bear Aderhold and Tom Sullivan and directed by C. B. Harding, \"Delta Farce\" is riddled with wheezy plot mechanics, tired lowbrow humor, and insulting stereotypes of gays and Mexicans, the latter of whom are portrayed as either gold-toothed, moustache-twirling banditos or backward children who not only cannot defend themselves against the bad guys but must rely on good old American ingenuity and know-how to get even the simplest menial task accomplished. This is especially offensive given that these American heroes are not too many DNA strands away from being certifiable idiots themselves. None of this would really matter so much if the movie itself had managed to be funny. As it is, however, this is about as thoroughly witless and lame-brained a comedy as has come our way in a long long time.\n\nThe movie makers end on a sobering note, dedicating the film to the real military men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's a nice gesture, I suppose, but don't our brave soldiers already have enough troubles over there without having to contend with a cinematic \"tribute\" like \"Delta Farce\"?"

        "review_detailed_main": "With movies that have made mockery of such stories and movies involving disaster films (Airplane!) Police squads (Naked Gun) Horror movies (Scary Movie) and even Teen Sex Comedies (Not Another Teen Movie) a mockery of the men and women in arms seems like a very possible topic to exploit for humor, right? If it were a movie done by the Wayans Brothers or David Zucker and it didn't star Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall or D.J. Qualls, it might have had some kind of chance.\n\nDelta Farce is one of those kinds of films that tries to make fun of a lot of movies where the military branch of the world needs a little mockery, since it's such a serious profession to work in. This kind of recipe has been seen before: Take a couple of bumbling friends (Qualls, Engvall and Larry) give them some kind of crisis with their lives, and have them put into a situation where bumbling around actually means your doing a good job.\n\nThis has been seen before in much better movies, and trust me, those movies are a hell of a lot better than what you could see in this movie.\n\nWhat could have made this movie funny is that these three friends are stuck in Mexico, but they haven't got a clue, they just assume the people living in the village are Iraqis. Stuff like that could have been funny, but instead, it's never taken opportunity of. The characters act confused, and never make an understanding right away (Judging by the terrain, Iraq apparently has mountains and grass, but I digress.) This movie could have made jokes barraging the military, but instead, the three men in charge are much more bumbling and funnier to mock because of their stupidity and buffoonery, which is all well and good, but these kind of jokes rarely work unless the character(s) have a bit more intelligence than the ones in this movie.\n\nAlso, in poor taste, stereotypes are just strewn about throughout the film. The villains in this movie have some kind of intelligence when to inform others about their mistakes, but seem incompetent when faced with situations of their own. Danny Trejo is a poor villain known as Carlos Santana (Not the singer, Carlos repeats) whose annoyance is that he's given many opportunities to shoot people, and he talks about it.\n\nThere's also a very horrible slam to homosexuals that just disgusted me (He's gay, flamboyant and Hispanic, and no, I'm not against any of the three, it's just insulting to mock in distaste) and Keith David in this movie as the only real normal thinking man is rarely seen, probably to avoid being seen in this movie as much as possible.\n\nFor someone else, this might actually be funny to someone. My father, who was in the military for awhile, loved this film because he knew a lot of the stuff they were going through: yelling men, conflict in the field, etc. Perhaps this movie might be funny to someone who has went to basic training and gone to Iraq, or not.\n\nAll I know is that for me, this is definitely one movie I did not enjoy, it's very limited in laughs, in anything. My father loved it, but I did not. If you've seen \"City Slickers\" or \"Wild Hogs\" or \"In the Army Now\" with Pauly Shore (After seeing this movie, Pauly Shore actually seems like a welcome release.) Watch those movies again, because this movie is just not worth your time, your attention span, or for your country.\n\n3/10."

There is also their Sgt. Kilgore who fell out of the plane too. He is forced to sing karaoke by the bandits. The ring leader is named Carlos Santana so of course that brings more jokes. The towns people give them tacos to eat and they just can't believe they have tacos in Iraq. There were many other scenes that made me laugh, but you get the idea.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: A lot better than you would think. It's funnier than a lot of movies I've seen lately. Check it out."

Second off, there was like 1 or 2 small quick scenes i thought were funny.....that's IT.\n\nDJ qualls or whatever his retarded name is, is a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE actor. (i realize this guy is a survivor of some kind of illness, but this guy SHOULD NOT be acting....period.)\n\nbill engvall was an innocent victim in this movie....he's a very funny guy, it's a shame he agreed to sign onto this movie.....he probably did it purely because they couldn't find ANYONE dumb enough to sign on, so jeff did it just because he's a good friend.....whatever.\n\nKeith David is AWESOME, i love this guy, he was actually the only funny guy IN the movie.....too bad he got suckered into signing onto this movie too.\n\nThis is one of the few movies i've actually just STOPPED watching because it just sucked so bad, the plot was weaker than the rating I gave it. The movie goes nowhere, the comedy was SO DUMB, yet they try to pull the plot off as real for a comedy movie, yet bombs out miserably.\n\nTrust me, I WANTED to like this movie, I TRIED to find the humor in it, but it just wasn't there.\n\nI'm the type of guy that will give any movie a chance, I am not picky at all. I like over 90% of the movies I have seen in my lifetime.....I am not hard to entertain or please.\n\nThis movie was THAT BAD.....WOW words cannot describe it.\n\nI'm so glad I actually never bought it, otherwise I would have glued it to a piece of cardboard and literally used it at the local pistol range just to get out some aggression."

And I mean at the level that a mother would not defend their child or a stripper won't laugh at your joke level of rejection. Our \"film\" manages to pair two southern comedians/actors who would bring with them a more conservative viewership to the party and proceeds to shove anti-Bush era/anti-Middle East conflict propaganda down their throats for what seemed to be an eighteen hour movie. Liberals, especially those overeducated pansies I always hear about, are not spared. The Farce is packed anti-woke jokes thanks to their racist Mexican caricatures and tasteless homosexual representations. Moreover, it is actually a remake of The Three Amigos, proving that we have regressed in our art as much as our values. Delta Farce is an example of how we sound when our unfiltered/unchallenged minds have a sounding board. Now you might think I am bashing on this film, but I am actually its champion. It is brilliant in that regardless of what defines you as a human being we all have one undeniable commonality, we hate Delta Farce."

Larry the Cable Guy himself enjoys bashing his first film, \"Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector,\" but you know what? I enjoyed that a lot more. It was a much better comedy vehicle for the talented comedian. In \"Delta Farce\" he's not given nearly as many opportunities to showcase his brand of humor. If anything, I think this is a better vehicle for his Blue Collar buddy, Bill Engvall, who is quite good in the film. The movie is far from awful, but it never made me roar with laughter. Most of the jokes are predictable. How many times have we seen the gag where an out-of-shape man is doing chin-ups, and it's later revealed that someone is lifting him over the bar? There are also many gags where we're forced to believe the characters have no intelligence at all. I know they aren't the sharpest knives in the drawer, but how could anyone possibly confuse Iraq with Mexico? Speaking of no intelligence D.J. Qualls (who was good in \"Road Trip\" and \"The New Guy\") is wasted in a crappy role as the dumbest of the three guys. Danny Trejo, who's given a bigger part than he normal, is also wasted. This is another one of those comedies where all the good jokes were given away in the previews. Even if you're a fan of Larry, like me, you'll probably be disappointed by the film."

And never having heard about the movie, I opted to sit down and give it a chance.\n\nAnd while \"Delta Farce\" is watchable, this was hardly a grand cinematic moment in comedy history. The movie was just too generic, I suppose.\n\nThe storyline told in \"Delta Farce\", as written by Bear Aderhold and Tom Sullivan, was pretty straight forward, sure. But at the same time, the storyline was just not one that was overly crammed with comedy elements. So for a comedy then \"Delta Farce\" felt a little bit tame.\n\nPersonally I got no particular interest in Larry the Cable Guy, neither as an actor or a comedian, so I didn't sit down to watch \"Delta Farce\" because he starred in it. The movie does have some good enough names on the cast list, with the likes of Keith David, Emilio Rivera, Danny Trejo and DJ Qualls. The movie even had comedy Jeff Dunham in it, which was definitely a blast to watch. It was, in fact, Keith David and Danny Trejo that made the movie watchable, and they weren't even in the lead roles.\n\n\"Delta Farce\" has the occasional laugh here and there, but for a comedy it was a bit bland. I had hoped for a bit more contents that would make me laugh, truth be told.\n\nWhile \"Delta Farce\" is watchable, it is hardly a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time.\n\nMy rating of director C. B. Harding's 2007 comedy lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed Larry The Cable Guy's previous film, HEALTH INSPECTOR. It was a perfect example of lowbrow physical comedy that should have appealed to the Three Stooges and Bowery Boys fans out there. It used time-tested formulas dating back to silent comedy (check my reviews of obscure silent and early-sound comedy shorts and you'll see I love that tradition), and while they are simple-minded and obvious, they still work when in the hands of a comic master. For me, Larry the Cable Guy is in the Larry Fine/Leo Gorcey/Jerry Lewis vein, and also somewhat like the comedic sidekicks in old westerns. This new film is not as much of a gross-out vehicle as the Health Inspector. Bill Engvall is very much a straight man to Larry, while DJ Qualls is like a psycho version of Don Knotts/Barney Fife. These three are a great slapstick misfit trio, if crude obvious physical comedy is what you like. I presume anyone reading this already knows the plot--three loser guys are sent to Iraq to fight and mistakenly get dropped off in Mexico. Like any plot for a slapstick comedy, it's merely a device to hang routines on, and I found the routines to be quite funny. The writing is full of jokes and all three guys are great physical comedians. It's also nice to see screen heavies like Keith David and Danny Trejo in comic roles, David as the Sergeant who is leading the boys, Trejo as a weird bandit leader. Larry's stand-up routines are VERY different from this film. Don't see this film unless you liked Health Inspector. Or unless you want to see someone working the old Three Stooges/Bowery Boys type routines. My teenage daughter and I laughed quite often and found the film more than worth the money. By the way, the outtakes at the end of the film are interesting in that they show scenes that did not make the final cut. I hope those scenes will be included on the DVD. I anxiously await Larry's next vehicle, WITLESS PROTECTION."

You'll see what I mean in a minute.\n\nThe film stars two of the Blu Collar Comedy actors, Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Engvall playing Larry and Bill, and a non member of the group, DJ Qualls who plays Everett Shackleford. The three men take a trip to an army base because they are National Guard members. When a request for more soldiers comes in, the three men are deployed to Iraq unexpectedly.\n\nAfter sleeping in the truck in the airplane and being dropped into Mexico, the clueless duo believe they are in Iraq and basically act as if they know what they are doing, when really, they are just as clueless as you would think. Se\u00f1orita Maria Garcia (Marisol Nichols) falls for Larry after they protect their town from invaders or terrorists. Larry is determined to continue the job in Mexico until Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) the dictator is with thrown.\n\nThis movie is full of slapstick and fart jokes throughout. Some of witch can be mildly entertaining, others are just silly and over used portions. In the first twenty minutes of the film I thought I would like it, but it just lost my attention more and more. The only actress that entertained me was Marisol Nichols. With her being one of my favorite actresses, her performance wasn't really that bad, but sadly to say nothing great. \"Delta Farce\" is a Comedy hated by most, loved by few, and respected by no one with good taste. Though I have to say there were pretty many movies I couldn't stand that I have seen this year. So this one is passable.\n\nStarring: Bill Engvall, Larry the Cable Guy, DJ Qualls, Marisol Nichols, and Danny Trejo. Directed by: C. B. Harding."

I thought that this was a great movie. 10/10."

Putting three dumb people in the army and sending them to Iraq but ending up in Mexico, while the three dumb people think that they are in Iraq. One of the best films i have seen. I have watched it 1000000 times, and I'm going to watch it now that will make it 1000001.\n\nI love the humor the actors and everything about the movie. They couldn't of made it any better. I hope that they make another one like this.\n\nI cant see how other people could not of liked it, but i guess that people have their opinions."

They thought they were in Iraq when they were really in New Mexico. This movie was so funny with Larry The Cable Guy, and I think that the plot is great. I think if you are looking for a funny movie to watch with the family on a rainy night, than this movie is the right one! Anyone who loves Larry The Cable guy should watch this movie! If you thought Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector was funny, this movie is even funnier! This movie is a must see! If you want to really get a good laugh then you should watch this movie because it is full of laughs!"

His action sequences were simply breathtaking-a true man amongst men.\n\nTo list this movie as (only) action/comedy is a travesty as the romance and drama were so genuine that I was forced to reflect upon my life decisions once the final credits rolled.\n\nI highly recommend this movie to any and all who are sick of the trash Hollywood has been churning for the past few decades (Titanic, Lord Of The Rings trilogy etc..). Treat yourself today."

I seen this movie a few times and I still laugh-out-loud when I watch it. The cast is really good. They all get their time to shine and they all deliver big laughs. Larry the Cable Guy is funny but Bill Engvall and Keith David are even funnier. David is fearless in this movie. Nobody believes my when I say it but \"Delta Farce\" is a great movie. (Now I need to ramble on a little bit because of IMDB's 600 character minimum. So, how was your day?)"
