        "review_detailed_main": "The original \"The Witches\" is a Childhood Classic that we all grew up watching & the setting & the actual Witches themselves looked way better back then in 1990 than these CGI creations look today in 2021.\n\nRobert Zemeckis is an excellent director & he does good here but like every big film today it's overrealiant on CGI affects & even with it's mega budget it doesn't look as good or as richly beautiful as the darker original old Classic. Also the actors were alot better in the original as was the Hotel but as a new version as a fun fantasy adventure it's still a decent watch.\n\nAnne Hathaway is good as the main head witch but again got nothing on the scariness of Angelica Huston.\n\nThe characters have changed to the cast of a Black version which was ok because i liked Chris Rock telling the story & Octavia Spencer is really good as the grandma who takes the little boy to a big beautiful Hotel to escape a Witch encounter but end up right in the middle of a Witches meeting place. Stanley Tucci is fine but felt very subdued & not fun like Rowan Atkinson's Classic part. The kids are fine & the CGI mice are cartoony looking but there is some Magic here & the story is pretty much exactly the same as the original but just not done as great.\n\nStill this update is a fun film with decent performances & nice cinematography but it just ain't on the level of that Original Classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1968, a young Hero Boy is forced to go live with his grandma (Octavia Spencer) after losing his parents in a car accident. She tells him that witches are real and they hate children. As a child, she lost her friend when a witch turned her into a chicken. She gives him a white mouse. She takes him to a seaside hotel for an escape hoping that witches would not search there since black children are rarely at the luxury hotel. Unfortunately, the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) has gathered her followers to present a potion to turn all children into mice.\n\nThis is the second film adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book. The 1990 adaptation stars Anjelica Huston and is a fan favorite. It's probably a fool's errand to try to do another. The only reason is to upgrade the mice with CGI and that's often a bad idea. The charm of the old animatronics is actually more timeless than CGI which ages over time. It does inject some American racial divide into the story but the movie drops that interesting take rather quickly. The one awful thing it does is to replace the greatness of Huston with a terribly weird Joker-smiling Hathaway. It is bad. There is no good reason for this movie and watching it proves that."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Grand High Witch is killing it. but seriously, she's terrible. From the start on, with the weird Chris Rock voice-over, this remake goes wrong wherever it can wrong. The acting is stiff, the focus is hardly on all the other witches, the CGI is not good. Even the housekeeping cart seems to come from the CGI box. Positive thing: Octavia Spencer is doing her best to be a genuine grandmother, and she succeeds, but that's about it. OK, yes, I am a fan of the 1990 movie. Even though it wasn't as close to the original story, I really can't believe Roald Dahl would recognize his book in this mess. The first movie was gorgeous in it's authenticity. It has folklore, it has an edge, it has a heart. This is Hollywood factory work and seems to want to be much more than it can deliver. It made me miss much more than the purple glow in the witches eyes. It made me want to just throw up like a witch who smells children. I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it. I am sure that an entire generation who never grew up with the original will disagree, but to me, this is like cursing in a church. It's horrible."

The special effects look decent in parts, and woeful in others, Anne Hathaway displays personality it's fair to say, but her accent..... If anyone remembers Rentaghost, think Miss Popov, she spans countries from Ireland to Russia, it had me chuckling.\n\nOnce again, please, please try and give us something new and original, stop taking things that have already been made, and making them ten times worse. An extra point for casting the wonderful Josette Simon.\n\nIt made me want to watch Anjelica Huston.\n\nI paid to download it, that money could have gone on something less awful, like a Donny Osmond cd.\n\nNaff, 3/10."

Kids are most definitely going to enjoy it, it is for them after all, not the adults comparing it to the 1990 adaptation, so I'd say this film was a success in what if wanted to do."

You also have to remember these movies are kids movies based on a kids book so if your pissed that a movie from your childhood has been remade, that's sad. At least they waited 30 years to do it. The first one is a lot scarier but that's because of the awesome makeup and not cgi."

The story is similar enough to be considered a remake, but the minor differences keep it interesting!\n\nIt's been given the Hollywood treatment for sure, so it's far glossier/more polished than the original, but having just watched them back to back, unless it's just nostalgia you're after, then that's no bad thing I promise.\n\nOverall the quality of the story itself shines through, and if you just want to have some fun watching it then you will certainly do just that.\n\nIf you're looking to review it for Oscar-worthiness then maybe reassess your expectations, chill out and grab a drink. It's a fantasy film people. Let the fantasy breathe!"

The original hotel was so iconic to me, it just really stuck with me and when i watched it was like like i really want to go to this fabulous hotel on the cost in the UK. This hotel looked so bad, i honestly think it was CGI. It looked fake, like all the exterior shots looked like it was a CGI hotel.\n\nSpeaking of CGI, there is so much in this film and it just looks stupid. They lean so heavy on it. The original uses make up and animatronics so well and it just works to make the film seem more rooted in our word and just more pleasing to look at. I also think it is incredibly lazy to just CGI. That word pretty much sums up this movie.\n\nThe acting was fine apart from Anne who was chewing up the scenery like it was going out of fashion. She was the best part of the move i guess. Well her costumes were to be honest. But they even used CGI in her costumes!! It was infuriating. Her accent was absolutely horrible tho. She should have just used her normal accent.\n\nI would say you could defiantly skip this one. Just watch the original."

If you read all the negative reviews they are mostly from those who think one race or color can do abetter job and question the cast. Who cares!! Watch it, smile, enjoy and go on with your lives! Don't rate a movie lower because a character is not of the race in the original or what YOU wanted. The rest reviewers who are asking why the movie was even made? Here's the truth about those nonsense reviews, MOST of them did NOT watch the movie so their reviews are biased and inappropriate. Nothing wrong with remakes and this is a great story to remake. It's a kid's movie, but we see old angry folks sitting behind a keyboard and trashing a good story.\n\nIs the movie, the best ever 10/10 Well, not really... Is it good? Yes it is! Is the movie better than the original( I watched the original 3 times)? No it is not,but it has a great flare and spins. It a nice refresh and a story you want to experience again. Not to mention the fact, millenials often don't want to see 30-year old movies and they would connect better. So if you are 50, and angry, it is YOU who is a problem. Young teens really enjoyed this one and the actors they like. It's as simple as that so take it easy!! It's a great story and I was delighted to see another angle of it. That is all. It was cool to see how the creators of the 2020 changed it.\n\nPS. Anne did a great job in the movie. She is a shining star anything she does. Chris was ok in his narration, but I am not sure he was even needed."

I thought the relocation to Alabama was fine, and didn't detract from the plot - the lore of witches can exist everywhere. I *understand* the book takes place in England (and Norway), because that's where Roald Dahl is from. Have some tolerance for an artistic change here, people! Overall I found the witches to be WAY creepier, far more villainous. The changes didn't deter from the plot for me, the ending stayed far truer to the book than the 1990 version. Anne Hathaway did justice to the Grand High Witch. That doesn't mean that Anjelica Huston isn't still absolutely iconic in the role. Was it as good? No. Was it a good adaptation that had its merit? Yes. Worth a watch. Form your own opinions and don't let the aggressive reviews here deter you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike what a lot of people seems to think about this movie I though it was a fairly decent family movie. It's not great but decent enough. I quite enjoyed it at least.\n\nThe story is what it is. It is a Roald Dahl story so it is somewhat dark but funny and with some light at the same time. Of course there are a bunch of whiners complaining that it is too dark and not suited for children. Well, everyone knows (or should now) what to expect from a Roald Dahl story so just go and see another movie then. My kids, even when they where younger, would have no problem with this movie. But then I would spend the time to watch it with them. It is called parenting.\n\nThe beginning felt a wee bit slow perhaps but once the grand witch, and in particular the three mice, entered the scene it became rather funny.\n\nThe one thing I did not like that much was the over the top silly acting of the witches, especially the grand witch. They could really have toned down that it bit to make her a bit more scary. Now she just became silly and somewhat annoying.\n\nThe special effects were quite nice. The mice was a bit cartoonish but that was okay for this movie. I quite liked how the grand witch's mouth split open from time to time to reveal her \"witchiness\".\n\nApparently a bunch of disability advocates, including British Paralympic swimmer Amy Marren, got unhinged and claimed the movie was \"perpetuating bias against individuals with ectrodactyly and other limb differences.\"\n\nSeriously? Get a grip. It is fiction and a family movie about witches for Christ sake! Presenting witches or other supernatural creatures as having \"abnormalities\" like crows feet, fangs and God knows what is what makes witches. If these obsessive whiners and cancel culture freaks would have their way no movie worth watching and no book worth reading would ever be made.\n\nAnyway, I felt it was an hour and 45 minutes that I enjoyed."

There are plenty of kids movies out there that I can barely stand to have on because they're so obnoxious but this is not one of them; in fact, I find myself pausing what I'm doing to watch it when it's on. It's a bit cartoonish and over the top but it's based on a kids book and it's for kids, so that's kind of the point. Who cares.

I even thought that with actors like Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway that it might be saved, and they were great in their roles as far as remaking/re-imagining movies go. But even with that, the grandmother is sort of a rehash of Spencer's character Minnie from The Help, Stanley Tucci hardly gets ANY screen time or character development, and Hathaway, while nailing so many of Angelica Houston's mannerisms, is still a bit overdone on her character. But also the remake lacks the character/story development, decent plot, dialogue and even the action and tense scenes from the original. And the transformation scenes (minus the one in the beginning which I thought was a good add) were extremely short with bad CGI. Overall, this was no improvement over the 1990 version, and not different enough to be all that good."

I chose not to directly compare the two films while watching & that let me enjoy it on its own terms. There is a lot to enjoy here. The feeling of it is right where it needs to be, the cinematography is top notch, creepy and daunting, cartoonishly foreboding, but still a proper kids movie (for kids that are mature enough to take it). It was an interesting direction for the film to take setting it in Alabama, USA with a black cast. This ensured it wouldn't be trying to rehash the same film again (which you can't... the original is classic). They went their own way with it, included American topics of racism, classism, poverty... and it did it in a way that adults have something to work with and kids will get the gist about.

        "review_detailed_main": "This new 2020 adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic has its flaws, but it skyrockets above all the lukewarm live action Disney remakes that have been produced over the past 10 years. While critics might be quick to dismiss the film in comparison to the original 1990 adaptation, it has potential to be a sleeper hit and gain a cult following for future generations.\n\nAnne Hathaway gives a GRAND performance as the Grand High Witch, with classic campy terror and vaudevillian shtick humor (minus the dodgy German accent). Although Hathaway might not instill the same terror upon younger viewers as Anjelica Houston, she none the less delivers a balanced and entertaining performance that is all her own. Let's just say that if you are a fan of Miss Hathaway, you will be content with her performance, and may never be able to watch The Princess Diaries or The Dark Knight Rises like you once did. A true testament to the raw talent that Hathaway has.\n\nOctavia Spencer plays the role of the grandmother with all the tough love and southern spunk that you would expect to find in a grandmother. Spencer might have been too young to play a grandmother, but her mild mannered yet passionate performance, radiates the film against the madness in Hathaway's performance. Clear eyed, charming, witty, and devoid of irony, Spencer nearly outshines Hathaway when they are on screen together.\n\nThe highest praise of this film goes to Hollywood newcomer, Jahzir Bruno, playing the hero boy who triumphs against the forces of evil. Bruno was perfectly cast in this role, and despite his young age, is very believable and sincere in his delivery. His character is perfectly relatable, down to earth, humble, and never displays any obnoxious adolescent moments. While watching the movie, kids will identify with his fears, and adults will be moved by his bravery and loyalty to those he loves."

Obviously the old movie can't compare, but it was one of the best movies I had seen in 2020. I believe it will recieve the hate that the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory remake recieved to begin with, but then people will grow to love it and get past the fact that the previous movie existed.. watch it as if it was not based on an original movie and you will see it from a different perspective.

        "review_title": "Welcome to the era of lousy CGI, Mr. Dahl",
        "review_detailed_main": "Roald Dahl was my favorite author throughout my childhood and adolescence, and even now I still tremendously enjoy re-reading his novels, or - even better - reading them to my 8-year-old daughter. Of all the writers in the world and in history, Dahl created the most insanely imaginative fantasy worlds and the most colorfully eccentric characters. In every decade since the 1960s there has been at least one famous film adaptation of Dahl's work, and often they were helmed by some of the world's most acclaimed directors (like Nicholas Roeg, Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, and now Robert Zemeckis)\n\n\"The Witches\", Dahl's awesomely grim and eerie novel from 1983, already received a film version once in 1990, and - in my humble opinion - that version stood the test of time very well. Still, the skeptical author got to see it shortly before his death and didn't like it, so producer Guillermo Del Toro and director Robert Zemeckis considered it was time for a re-interpretation. The result is an overall enjoyable movie (or at least more enjoyable than what the harsh reviews around here claim), but nevertheless one with many shortcomings and tiny disappointments.\n\nThe narration of Chris Rock feels awkward and misfit from the very first minute. Although he never appears in the film, Rock's voice is supposedly the young and orphaned boy whom, together with his loving grandma, courageously confronts a whole coven of witches, and the diabolical Grand High Witch in particular, in a picturesque seaside hotel. While Octavia Spencer and the young Jahzir Bruno gave away likable performances, the frequent interruptions by Rock's irritating voice formed a nuisance to me. Furthermore, I read a lot of negative comments regarding Anna Hathaway's depiction of the Grand High Witch, but I honestly can say she's quite alright. Sure, she can't hold a candle to Anjelica Huston, who was born for the role, but I dug Hathaway's exaggeratedly nasty accent and her overacting.\n\nThe biggest default of the 2020 version, according to me, is how Dahl's vivid imaginary setting and lead characters were turned into uninspired and soulless CGI effects. Anjelica Huston's transformation into the Grand High Witch gave 9-year-old me nightmares for weeks, while there's nothing even remotely scary about her digital transformation here. Same goes for the kids turning into mice, and the legendary moment when all witches take their wigs off. These sequences are a lot less impactful and astonishing as in the 1990s version. I read somewhere that producer Guillermo Del Toro initially wanted the effects to be stop-motion. Why didn't he persist? He's the producer after all, and a classic Dahl story needs old-fashioned handicraft effects!"

It's also been very clear for a number of years now that Anne's forte are not accents. I mean she sounded comical and even Scottish in certain parts...like girl come on now. It goes without saying that Anjelica Huston's performance was much stronger and scarier in the 1990 version, but overall the cast, sets and writing were okay."

It actually shaped my tastes as an adult as I now an avid horror fan. The 90s Witches was actually a horror film and I love it. But uh... It also came out like 31 years ago? Have you watched it recently? I love the film still from the FX to the performances... However, it looks OLD AF. Thus a remake becomes necessary.\n\nI'm not one to usually support the concept of a remake especially in the instance of something like Total Recall. But come on guys... The Witches is a KIDS film set a presumed present day. It had to be updated.\n\nMy assessment of the remake is its super duper fun! You will laugh and jump as long as you don't sit there arms folded and pouting like a 9 year old thats had their fave movie taken from them.\n\nThe performances kick ass, especially Anne Hathaway. The criticism of her accent is utterly moronic. She is intentionally over the top and \"cartoony\"\n\nThe film does suffer slightly from identity crisis swinging styles from kids drama to cartoon back and forth. But it really works. I think a lot of people simply don't understand what the film makers are trying to achieve here.\n\nI loved sitting down with my son and sharing this version of The Witches with him - followed up by the original. Yeah its not the 90s film -because its a remake that actually does things differently and it mostly does them well. So calm down haters.\n\nCons- Identity crisis Sometimes poor CGI (perhaps intentional?) Pacing (rarely)\n\nPros- Anne Hathaway Performances in general Soundtrack Production values Story."

Anne Hathaway was disastrous casting choice, she also had an unbearable multi 'European' accent (if you can call it that!). Chris Rock's narration is over the top and grating. Not everything needs to be Americanised to sell. I can't believe the line \"only rich white people can afford to come to this hotel\" was actually approved in a kids film - fuelling the fire for the next generation.

Based on the book by Roald Dahl.\n\nAside from fun performances from Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer, \"The Witches\" relies too much on CGI, which in my opinion is making movies worse with every use. What happened to getting a real cat in a movie? Is it really about animal rights or more because Hollywood doesn't want to train an animal to sit on Anne Hathaway's forearm? Chris Rock as the narrator was a nice touch and the highlight of the film.

The child actors were child actors so mileage always varies with them. Another thing to keep in mind is that this is a children's movie geared toward children so people old enough to have fond memories of the original when it came out are well outside the age range for this one. Again that being said I found it to be perfectly pleasant. I won't lie and say it was a perfect 10, but does every movie have to be a perfect 10.

In my opinion they over used CGI and the storyline was bland, what wrong with using Prosthetics like in the original. The story leaves you unfulfilled and not wanting more. Like many of the remake during the last few years it leaves a Sour taste in your mouth and you asking the question why?. Will these film producers instead of only think about making a quick buck, decide to make something new and with integrity, Their is plenty of source material, books, et. I think I speak for most people when I say if it not broke don't fix it"

Yes, the other performances are oddly lackadaisical, & Zemeckis desperately needs someone to stop him from his unending use of unconvincing CGI. Otherwise, this is a bold, old-fashioned, decidedly un-family-friendly family yarn."

The film starts out quite well, with some interesting camera work, great screen performance by Octavia Spencer, and Chris Rocks relatively well narration that not only sets the tone, but reminds the viewer that this is a Roald Dahl themed story. There clearly was a lot of attention to detail, which one can appreciate, but unfortunately these nice things don't make up for what the film lacked.\n\nOnce Octavia Spencer and Jahzir Bruno (the main child) reach the hotel where most of the film takes place, it all goes downhill. The film was quite slow and struggled to work with the genuinely interesting world that they created. Although Anne Hathaway's performance did invoke emotions of intimidation and even fear, but her confusing accent at many times took away from her performance.\n\nThe CGI and effects in some scenes felt dated and generally poor (mice transformation, mice movement), while other (particularly Anne Hathaway) scenes provided cool and even disturbing effects. While this film was most likely made for in-theatre 3D effects, too many scenes where sacrificed for cheap 3D effects that where directed towards children and took away from the experience.\n\nAlthough this film does stick closer to the original book and introduces a beautiful Alabama setting, strong Octavia Spencer and at times Anne Hathaway performances, the film struggles to stay consistent in its themes and pacing. The film generally feels sloppy and leaves many fans of the original film dissatisfied."

Led by Anne Hathaway. The boy and another gets captured and turned into a mouse. Which they try to stop the witches.\n\nCute and fun film for the family.

As I said even the high witch reveal was fast paced and not as grand, good try from Octavia Spencer and that kid, but it was flat.

I would've enjoyed the film to be a bit more dark and eerie, as the original was. This one adds more humor and the CGI can get a bit annoying. Can we get some make up artists back in the mix? CGI still makes everything look generic and less realistic. I enjoyed Anne Hathaway surprisingly. I'm sad that we didn't get the opening with the girl stuck in the painting as that always stuck with me as a child. And the ending was different which was partially upsetting to me as well, although it was a cute new ending. Watch it. It's fun and exciting.

        "review_detailed_main": "This has to be one of the most heinous remakes of a film that I have ever seen. Anne Hathaway's delivery with a hybrid of about five changeable accents throughout the film, makes her character incoherent and very difficult to understand. On some occasions, I believe most skilled MI5 interpreters and trained linguists would not actually assimilate what was actually coming out of her mouth at times. Her character is a shadow of Angelica Huston's prowess as \"The Grand High Witch\". An American disaster remake with over the top CGI in your face from start to finish. The continuous and monotonous narration throughout this film disrupted any realism throughout. Nicolas Roeg obviously tried to capture the mystical and magic mind of Roald Dahl's children's dark fantasy novel in his 1990 film, which still retains a cult following to this day. The makeup and potential was all laid out on the table for this to be a fantastic remake. Unfortunately, Hollywood grabbed it by the horns and stripped it of all its magic, comedy and dark fantasy themes. Robert Zemeckis's retelling of the wicked children's story feels more grumpy than scary, while its comedy veers between frantic and strained. The original 1990 film was more faithful to the book albeit the ending. As a British child who grew up in the 90's, engrossed in Dahl's novels, this has to be by far the most unendurable and vast substandard film I have endured in a long time. 1/10. That is being generous."

There was no connection to the characters, everything felt very sterile.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's pretty sad to see a bunch of adults getting so bent out of shape at a film aimed at children. I have seen so many comments on horror groups from outraged men and women who think 'true horror fans' will hate this movie. They need to grow up. We know that the original was great, get over it. Kids will love this, they'll also love the original. Shut up and let people enjoy things.\n\nOk so onto the movie. The story has moved to 1960s Alabama. Little Hero loses his parents in a car crash, and his Grandma comes to take him into her home. Not ashamed to say that the first 15 minutes really moved me, actually had a lump in my throat. Grandma singing \"Reach Out, I'll Be There\" to a clearly traumatised little boy is genuinely upsetting. The story hasn't changed much. The Witches are holding their annual meeting at a posh hotel (where Hero and Grandma are hiding after they encounter a witch near their home) under the guise of a conference for a child protection group. The action is very slapstick, the mice are very cute, the acting is great and the story is pretty heartwarming. I was slightly put off by the fact that Anne Hathaway was playing the Grand High Witch because I've never been a fan, but she was great - although her accent jumps around quite a bit. Octavia Spencer is one of my favourite actresses, so there was no question of me not watching this movie. She is excellent in it, just the right mixture of stern Grandma and loving Grandma. The children are excellent too.\n\nYour kids will love it, the whining adults who need to grow up and let people make up their own minds need to stop living in the past. This movie does not erase the original. If you don't like how it looks just don't watch it. Not rocket science is it?"

However, she soon learns that, coincidentally, the witches are staying at the same hotel and they have a ghastly plan of action to eradicate every child on the planet...\n\nI have seen the original Witches film and therefore drawing comparisons between the 2 films is somewhat inevitable; for me though the 2 films are worlds apart in terms of quality with the remake clearly being the much inferior offering...\n\nThe budget is clearly much bigger in this remake than the much lower budgeted original, but to me it felt as though too much effort was put in to trying to make the film look good rather than actually being good. I like CGI in films when I feel as though it is used to enhance the viewing experience, but in this film a lot of it came across as silly, pointless or show-offy (sometimes all 3 at once). Here the Grand High Witch can fly and has go-go gadget arms and all of the witches have Chelsea smiles; I thought the idea of witches in this story was for them to blend in with society yet a bunch of women all arriving together with scars on their faces is never noticed and/or arouses suspicion with the hotel manager or any of the staff or guests.\n\nI think the really big difference between the 2 films is how indifferently everything plays out in this remake; the original film built many elements of its story up with a bit of suspense and tension which made the original a far more involving experience. In the remake, it all feels rather rushed and there's no real depth to any of the characters (Bruno's parents were portrayed as being a lot more snobbish in the original which gave them a bit of character and likewise the hotel manager was developed far more in the original which meant that interactions between characters carried more weight and it meant that the original had a bit of dark humour which was severely lacking here).\n\nIf we look at the acting then perhaps the only person who stands out as being better here than in the original is Octavia Spencer as the grandmother; she's just got that little bit more pep and fire about her and she was good in every scene in the film. Anne Hathaway does a good job as the grand high witch, but she can't hold a candle to Anjelica Houston (even with all the makeup and CGI). Tucci is poor as the hotel manager coming nowhere near as close to the quality that Rowan Atkinson brought to the role in the original (although Tucci isn't entirely to blame -he wasn't used as well as Atkinson was in the original).\n\nThe Witches 2020 feels rather slap-dash, crass and underwritten leaving the CGI to be the star of the show (which I might have given more credit for had it not all came across as being so cartoonish). Aside from good performances from Hathaway and Spencer the film has little else going for it. In all honesty you'd be better off watching the original which while being far from perfect at least contained some tension, suspense and a far better developed narrative."

Sure, I don't recall that movie, but I am generally not one that is pro-remakes of movies.\n\nRegardless, I will say that the 2020 version of \"The Witches\" definitely was a movie that was enjoyable for the entire family. And there was enough varied contents to the movie to ensure that most people in the audience would be entertained. I know I was.\n\nVisually then \"The Witches\" was quite good, which was to be expected for such an endeavor. And the special effects and CGI team definitely helped carry the movie quite the distance. I liked what they did to present the witches as being non-human creatures.\n\nThe cast in the movie was good, and with the likes of Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway, to mention the most notably of performers, then you definitely were in good company throughout the course of this movie.\n\nHowever, to me at least, \"The Witches\" is hardly a movie that warrants more than a single viewing. While the movie was enjoyable and entertaining, the storyline just didn't have enough contents to be seen more than once, unlike many other movies.\n\nMy rating of \"The Witches\" settles on a six out of ten stars."

I do hope that Zemeckis's next movie is something more along the lines of his first movies, though."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Witches\" is a remake of the movie of the same name made in 1990, both of which are adaptations of the Roald Dahl book of the same title.\n\nI like the 2020 version of \"The Witches.\" It improved upon the visual effects used in the 1990 movie even though it didn't improve much upon the script.\n\nThis time around the movie takes place in 1968 Alabama. The little boy who lost his parents was played by Jahzir Bruno and his grandmother was played by Octavia Spencer. The Grand High Witch was played by Anne Hathaway. She did as well as Anjelica Huston did in 1990, though she was scarier and more sinister looking due to the CGI and her displays of brute strength.\n\nThe performances were all good, and the changes from the 1990 version to the 2020 version were slight with the exception of the ending. I think they made a good decision by releasing it on HBO. It's a decent movie, but nothing to rush out to theaters to see."

But this movie is not all bad as it may seem. The main, and most enjoyable part of this movie was Anne Hathaway. She played the head which perfectly. I have never seen her do a project that involved so much screaming and had that much visual effects for her. To me I think she deserves another ask her for her role. Same with Octavia Spencer. She was awesome too! This movie may not live up to its novelization in the 1990 version, but it's still an enjoyable film for the family to watch and has a somewhat awesome plot that tells the story of creepy ass witches!!"

        "review_title": "A mediocre update to a beloved children's story that only barely manages to engage its audience",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Witches\" is a dark fantasy film based on the novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future Trilogy, Forrest Gump) and starring Anne Hathaway, it is a mediocre update to a beloved children's story that only barely manages to engage its audience.\n\nIn 1968 in Alabama, the unnamed hero boy (Jahzir Kadeem Bruno) survives a car crash that kills both of his parents and is sent to live with his maternal grandmother (Octavia Spencer). One day when the two are out shopping together, the hero boy encounters a witch who entices him with a snake and some chocolate, but disappears when his grandmother calls out to him. Later on, the grandmother tells the hero boy about how witches are very real and that once they set their sights on a particular child, they will never give up pursuit until that child is dead. Desperate to avoid her grandson from being killed, the grandmother and the hero boy take refuge in a high class hotel, unaware that a large group of witches led by the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) are staying there as well.\n\nNearly everyone I have met has read at least one story written by Roald Dahl. His dark sense of humour and tongue-in-cheek wit still resonates strongly with many people today, and most of this ends up being translated successfully into cinematic form with films like 1990's \"The Witches\". That film remains one of the most popular adaptations of Dahl's work, so it comes as a surprise that this modern update with seemingly better technology thirty years later could be so inferior in comparison. What I believe made the 1990 film special was how lively and raw the special effects were thanks to the puppetry and animatronics provided by the The Jim Henson Company. Whenever you saw a character interact with a mouse or a freakishly ugly witch, you instantly got the feeling that there was something physically there in front of them. With this film, the CGI is so overabundant and unconvincing that it severed most connection with me as I watched actors talk to an obvious green screen under the pretense that something will be added later in post-production. This made the film feel soulless and sterile and it constantly made me wish I was watching the original film instead.\n\nQuite a few talented people worked on this film, like director Robert Zemeckis, who also co-wrote the script with Guillermo del Toro. This should have been a winning combination but instead it seems nothing good came from it. Not once did I ever have that sense of wonder and fascination I've come to expect from watching a movie made with the involvement of either of these two. Zemeckis, who directed the cult classic \"Death Becomes Her\", a film renowned for its impressive visual effects, instead takes the easy route of overloading each scene with CGI and badly rendered animals, including a very fake looking cat. Additionally, del Toro's signature style seems like a mixed bag here, keeping that dark fantasy tone while also including scenes that would be too frightening for most young children. That's not to say the 1990 film didn't have its fair share of scary moments, but most of them were brief, whereas this time the camera would often linger on the fearsome appearances of the witches enough to burn their images into one's mind. Something like this may be fine for del Toro's other films aimed at adults but seeing as this is supposed to be for kids it comes across as unnecessarily mean-spirited.\n\nThe film's one saving grace was Anne Hathaway's performance as the Grand High Witch. Almost equalling Anjelica Huston before her, Hathaway brings so much over-the-top madness and eccentricism to her role that one can't help but laugh at seeing her lose herself playing this cartoonishly evil character. She easily overshadows the rest of the cast, which isn't really a good thing the more I think about it. While all of the other actors aren't terrible by any means, they just didn't leave as much of an impression as their 1990 film counterparts. Rather strangely, the film is narrated by Chris Rock as the older hero boy, which made the film feel as though I was watching an episode of the sitcom \"Everybody Hates Chris\". Even though that did offer some mild amusement, it still seemed like a bizarre creative decision that made me forget I was supposed to be watching a Roald Dahl story in the first place.\n\nIn the end, I just don't see this film being anywhere near as fondly remembered as the 1990 one. The very fact that I am able to recall so much of the original off the top of my head despite having seen it so long ago whereas with this one I am struggling to think of even one memorable scene goes to show which of the two has the most staying power. Roald Dahl rather infamously hated nearly all film adaptations of his work so it's hard to say if he'd approve of this one, but considering that it does accurately follow certain parts of the book more closely than its previous incarnation makes me think he would probably enjoy this one more. Personally, I'm going to stick with the 1990 film and so should you.\n\nI rate it 5.5/10"

The film closely follows the Original with very minor tweaks to make it unique. The design of the Witches is Fantastic, maybe not as creepy as the original Grand High witch but definitely kept some creepiness to it. The unique change of a third mouse brings more uniqueness to the story if only slightly. And The Soundtrack is great! Picked some great 60s/70s songs and The Orchestrated Music Really adds to each scene! The few turnoffs (of which there were few) for me were :\n\nThe crassness of the Grandmother towards the beginning. I get it was to help the kid but she basically tells him to stop crying about something traumatic.\n\nThe use of CGI for every animal. It worked don't get me wrong but even the Grand High Witches cat was CGI. I feel it wasn't necessary even if it was to set up perch scenes a cat wouldn't normally do.\n\nBeyond that the film is great for all ages. Parents warned: Your little ones may be afraid of The Grand High Witch scenes after they take the disguises off. It's nothing major, a little CGI editing to the mouth and some practical/CGI claws on her hands but might be enough to scare. Overall a great remake and very enjoyable!"

It has majority of the same theme/plot/characters, but Anne Hathaway playing the Grand High Witch is very different than the original performance. I think she did a great job, but it was a lot of CGI (her mouth in particular), which at times felt a little distracting. The children \"mice\" were SO adorable, and Octavia was so delightful playing the grandma. Your kids might be a little afraid of some of the CGI, but it was not more scary than the first in my opinion. It was still so fun to watch, and people are tough critics these days, so I'd take the really harsh reviews with a grain of salt."

She laughed throughout and found the grand high witch very scary.\n\nI personally found the movie to be watchable and it wasn't bad at all, the effects were very good and I liked Anne Hathaway's performance. I did however feel the movie lacked the depth of the original. They changed a lot of the original storyline which made it hard to connect with the characters and not to mention they didn't include a certain character that I feel was central to the original in adding a nice twist to the story, mainly at the end (if you've seen it and then watch this you will know who I'm talking about). I didn't feel any macabre and eerie aspects to this film and missed the story about the girl in the picture from the original movie. I hated the ending.\n\nI found that there were too many comedic elements to the movie instead of good character development and I would have given it 5 stars for effort, however my daughter just loved it and at the end of the day these kind of movies are more tailored to children so, although far from perfect, it's certainly one that little ones will enjoy around Halloween. Angelica Houston will always be the grand high witch to me but maybe watch this with an open mind with the kiddies and try not to take it too seriously. It's not a bad movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have a special relationship with the book and the first movie.\n\nBut two decades later I am not as rattled as I was and I can now see the book as the half-thought through children's story it really was with a few cool ideas, though I still sort of like it.\n\nI am very cynical about remakes of good movies, including re-interpretations of a base source, but I wanted to give this every chance because it might be a chance to see a different take.\n\nAnd I was not disappointed in that respect. Not only was the ethnic character of the main characters changed (which really gave the film a whole new vibe) I can tell that they carefully omit some of the choice scenes that were done so well in the other movie and work on giving us some new concepts to work with all built around the familiar narrative so old fans and newcomers alike can enjoy this.\n\nThe grandmother is a very different character than to what we're used to and that helped a lot. The coincidence that she just happens to be a Witch expert is dealt with nicely.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the narrative at all I would not discourage you from making your first experience with it this picture. It's really a terrifying story and it lacks both the flaccid second act of the book and the campiness of the first movie.\n\nA strange fairly tale that is surreal and yet on some level feels almost too real. An ever-present but hidden danger gradually approaches and dares us to laugh at its silliness but I, personally, daren't.\n\nSure, there is a little awkward CGI but I admire the fresh design they gave (especially to the grand high witch). I wish they'd found an actual Norwegian to play her but she is still pretty scary (Norway is for me in generally pretty scary, with the interesting exception of its rather lacklustre heavy metal).\n\nThis is seriously a lot more effective than a lot of horror movies and though it does at times move into a cartoonish territory, it's a compelling tail from beginning to end.\n\nI'm tempted to say use this movie to ease a child into full horror but in practice you'd just spoil them for the horror we're getting. Yeah, I'm kind of a snob.\n\nOh, and the girl mouse adds nothing, there I said it."

It has lots of very evil witches who want to turn all of the children in the world into mice and then squish them... It has a bunch of stuffy grown-ups who can't do anything to help... It has three brave kids who even after they get turned into mice still battle against the evil witches to save all the children in the world... Oh... It also has the fantastic actress from The help (a movie you never saw) playing the brave grandma... Anne Hathaway from Les Mis\u00e9rables (another movie you never saw) playing a campier version than Anjelica Houston... and Stanley Tucci from Big Night (yet another movie you never saw) playing the stuffy hotel manager who doesn't like mice...

It's annoying. Would you be up for it if we took one of your classic books, took out everything that made it American and inserted a whole load of British history that nobody asked about?

We watched the old one and liked it, but the old robotic mice creeped me out and I can't see my kids loving it like the movies being made today. It's not a stab at the old one, just the truth. Times have evolved in movie making and the new one proves it. The story was not in depth like the first one, at least in the witch scenes. I can excuse it because it left room for the grandma and Luke to bond and some new scenes to add to the fun aspect of being mice. Their background was a retelling and you can't be mad at it because the setting is in Georgia, not Norway so the original story of the girl in the painting wouldn't work. The new story was meant to capture kids' imagination and I think it achieved it. Anne's accent was just as hard to understand as Angelica's so I wish they would've improved on that. These two ladies shouldn't be compared because I enjoyed what they both brought to the characters. It's a retelling, not an exact copy! Each movie has their own high's and lows, which should just be enjoyed, not picked apart because grown adults think it it should only be done ONE way. The retelling was fun and meant to capture the attention of kids, which I think it did. It brought a new audience to an old forgotten movie and it's new companion. I recommend it!"

        "review_title": "A return to a more kid friendly filmmaking form",
        "review_detailed_main": "This feels like a return to an older style of storytelling for Robert Zemeckis. This is more in line with the manic early films of his career rather than the more maturely told movies he'd been making since the 90s. In another way, this also feels like the safest move he could have made after the financial flop that was Allied and the incredibly ill-conceived mess (as well as financial flop) that was Welcome to Marwen. A retelling of a well-regarded children's book that had another adaptation from thirty years ago is the sort of safe movie an established director makes after having cost some studios a few bundles of money.\n\nSo, witches are real, and they're real ugly and they hate children. Our protagonist (I'm not calling him Hero Boy) is a young boy who lost his parents to a car crash in Chicago in the 60s and moved in with his grandmother in Alabama. She's a healer and tells him of witches and how they want to turn children into animals. When our protagonist meets a witch in the local grocery store, Grandma takes serious precautions and takes the boy to a swanky hotel on the Gulf Coast that her relation used to be the executive chef at. Coincidentally, a large coven of witches are using the hotel at the same time for a gathering in which the Grand High Witch details her master plan to put a potion in chocolate that will turn children into mice. The boy and another young English boy named Bruno get turned into mice, and the two, along with another child turned mouse that the boy had kept as a pet and the boy's grandmother, must find a way to fight the witches and turn their evil plot around.\n\nIt's the exact same story as the Nicholas Roeg version from 1990 with a different ending, but, oddly enough, Zemeckis' version, which runs about fifteen minutes longer, ends up moving far more quickly with a focus on visceral movement and action over brooding menace. I enjoy the Roeg version, but this one is definitely a different beast despite the same story, and I find Zemeckis' return to spectacle based storytelling to be a fun diversion.\n\nPerformed with a very odd Swedish/Norwegian accent by Anne Hathaway, the Grand High Witch is a scenery chewing monster without any subtlety, and as an antagonist in a children's fantasy adventure tale, I found her amusing. Octavia Spencer plays the Grandmother with tenderness and strictness in equal measure, providing a very nice human grounding for the second half of the film after the boy gets turned into a mouse.\n\nThe special effects use CGI rather extensively, even going so far as to animate a cat that's never more than a cat, and I get the feeling that the decision to move the release from theaters to HBO Max might have cut back on the budget to finalize the movie a bit. The computer generated animals never look bad, mind you, but they exist between cartoonish and real in an uncomfortable spot. They're just a bit too cartoonish to feel like they exist in the same space as the humans around them. Another few million and a couple more passes in post-production might have made that gel a bit better, but as it stands, in a children's fantasy adventure film, I found it largely serviceable. As an end note, I did find Alan Silvestri's score to be an odd companion to the action on screen as he pulled rather heavily from his work on The Avengers movies, delivering a bombastic and bass heavy score in place of something to probably should have been lighter and more whimsical like he did on Back to the Future.\n\nEnergetic, well-performed, and appealing, Robert Zemeckis' apology for losing so much money on his last two movies is a fun diversion of a family film with a menacing villain and a winning performance by Octavia Spencer."

Octavia Spencer is reliable as ever, i quite enjoyed Anne Hathaway's over the top performance but somehow the film feels a bit sparse (covid perhaps?). Almost zero focus is given to any other witch. It also looses momentum when it becomes focused on cgi mice for a good 25 minutes.\n\nSo, it very well may not be as good as the previous version but please people, get it right, its not.a.remake!"

CG is good but not great. The witch in this film is designed in a unique way, unlike the common witch in the other films. She is very scary, funny, ugly and weird. The story became excited since the witch appeared until the middle of the film, which the protagonist and her friends had to fight against the witch and her pensioners. The fight scene is so fun. I think the film is too short. There is a scene that the protagonist were cursed into rats. Whoever like Toy Story or Ratatouille may like this film too. The Witches is not the film for little kids because there are some violence and adult jokes."

While some of the effects are charmingly whimsical, the tone is often too silly to conjure up any legitimate threat.\n\nIn the 60's, a little boy is orphaned after a deadly car crash and is sent to live with his eccentric grandmother in Alabama. Almost immediately, he finds himself preyed upon by evil witches who look almost exactly like regular women except for their strange hands, feet, the scar across their mouth, and the fact that they're always wearing wigs or turbans to cover up their baldness.\n\nHe and his grandmother escape to a swanky coastal hotel only to discover it's crawling with witches who are in town for their annual meeting. When the little boy gets too close, they turn him into a mouse and he and his grandmother must find a way to stop the witches before all the children in the world suffer the same fate.\n\nThe Witches appears to be trying to give us some political message, but it's a little too muddy to be totally effective. Are the witches fantastical versions of racists, nazis, and all other sorts of bigots? Is it saying that it's our duty to rally the troops to fight again them? Maybe, but it's all too silly to take seriously. With every smart move like this, the filmmakers usually fudge something immediately after, canceling any goodwill out. Octavia Spencer anchors the film with her performance as the grandmother and Anne Hathway appears to be having the time of the life chewing the scenery as the evil Grand High Witch."

Octavia Spencer was incredibly loveable as the grandma character and I enjoyed that her character and her grandson were black - it gave a new perspective on the story. Anne Hathaway clearly relished her role and gave a campy, intense performance. Omg those toes! Haha! The set design and cinematography were also excellent. I'm also glad they had the balls to commit to the events that took place - don't want to spoil the movie, but you'll understand when you watch it. Please give this a chance and make up your own mind about this one. A new Halloween classic!"

Then again, this is make believe....does it really matter. Anyway, I felt like the whole movie was Anne Hathaway, Stanley Tucci, Octavia Spencer and the grandson. The others witches had no personality: they were just a flock of sheep following the grand high witch. In the old one, many witches and side characters had memorable expressions, moments, personalities. Even Bruno is dull. 3 excellent actors do not make a movie. When the grand high witch kills the \"insubordinate\" witch, it takes all but 3 seconds. In the old movie, she begged and pleaded. She had a pulse. All this money on great talent, set, costumes and CGI but if story isn't good, you ain't got much. It seems like the people who created this movie were thinking, well they watched the first one so they already know this scene, no need to breathe life into it."

The interpretation of Octavia Spencer who played as Grandma, it was very good and I believe that her character fitted very well to her. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Anne Hathaway's who played as Grand High Witch and Jahzir Bruno's who played as Hero Boy. The narration of Chris Rock was spectacular and gave a nice touch on the movie.

Anne Hathaway plays a fun vilain, and Jahzir Bruno is a very likeable main character.\n\nThere are a lot of changes to the original storyline but I was fine with that, if you want to see the exact same story from the original you can simply watch the original. I liked that they changed some things up, it made this more of a fresh experience rather than a generic Rehash.\n\nI've seen a lot of complaints about the CGI, which I understand since I will personally always prefer practical effects, however I was pretty impressed with the majority of the CGI in this film. A lot of the CGI heavy scenes are actually really creative and fun to watch.\n\nOverall I had a lot of fun watching this movie, I think instead of judging it for not being as good as the original you'd be better off just looking at it as it's own movie. On it's own its a fun, goofy, kid's movie that I am happy I watched,\n\n7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "How on earth does it make sense to, in the name of being inclusive to minorities, adapt a book written by a Norwegian-English author that revolves around the land of his heritage, and completely Americanize every aspect of it! To me this screams blind ethnocentrism. Now, I think it could be justified if there was a point, like in order to stick to the spirit of the original that may be lost otherwise. But this isn't the case.\n\nAs with so many of the introduced elements to this adaptation, there is no real point at all. I won't give spoilers, but time and again, a new character or ability is introduced. You start thinking to yourself, \"I wonder how this is going to be used in the story to create new conflict, build tension, add depth, or set up a more epic confrontation.\" Each time, you are let down. As soon as something new is introduced, it is promptly forgotten, and the result is that this wasted time and distraction waters down the original story. Tense, climactic moments are simplified and hurried through in the most pedestrian way possible. Both the book and the 1990 film were so much better in terms of storytelling.\n\nThey also introduced plot holes so big that they confused my children on more than one occasion. I am pretty forgiving when it comes to plot holes in children's stories, but it does get to a point where it's off-putting, like, \"They're just dumb kids, it doesn't matter.\"\n\nThe only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of one change I came to appreciate--the addition of the snake-like mouths for the witches. It does add to the feeling that the witches are inhuman creatures which is in line with the source material.\n\nThe last issue, the one that makes it really hard to give even 2 stars, is how mind-numbingly lame the dialogue is. I'm not sure this is a direct quote, \"Those mean, nasty witches, are really mean, nasty and evil!\" but it's hard to keep track because there are probably 50 or so analogues. That and characters awkwardly stating the obvious to the viewer: \"Oh no, the mean, nasty witches just ***** and now they are trying to *****!\", when we have just seen ***** and *****, and there is no reason for the character to communicate this to another character."

Good way to pass an evening with some kids in for some fun but spooky times.\n\nI would've liked it much scarier though. The mice kids really aren't in any danger much of the time. The chefs didn't even take any shots at them. The witches have genuinely scary powers and that just wasn't represented here. Without the danger element this is not really the kind of film adults also like, but just too safe and better for kids.\n\nThis version has a different ending too. I don't mind the differences this movie has but I'm not sure it's really thought through. Like I was saying about the lack of danger element, the ending kind of reverses that, so the movie is a strange mix of messages about risk and change and consequences.\n\nA fun film with some daring twists that don't quite pull off in my opinion. But it's rare enough for these kinds of remakes to take risks.\n\nI'm really giving it a 6/10 but will give a 7 just because I think it's very watchable and not every remake has to surpass a previous classic film."

And to think that such great actors and actresses like Anne Hathaway and Octivia Spencer were in such a train wreck of a movie. My first complaint is that this movie uses an overly amount of CGI where it's to the point where it makes the Green Lantern movie look like Avatar. My second complaint is that it they didn't have the setting anywhere near England, seriously the book and original movie take place in Norway and another place I can't remember, not in Chicago. My final complaint is the acting, even though Anne Hathaway wasn't terrible it was still a little over the top with the accent and all, and Octavia Spencer's character is basically a rip-off of her character in The Help. In conclusion, the people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves and apologize profusely for this movie. The only good thing I can say about this movie is Chris Rock's narration which gave me a chuckle and that they put that one scene where Luke puts the potion in the soup."

I absolutely loved how scary they made the witches look, but I wish they had more spooky screen time! However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed that they changed the ending so drastically. Aside from that, and Anne Hathaway's confusing accent, it was a good watch. Just don't expect to have all your questions answered.

        "review_detailed_main": "Roald Dahl's 1983 novel 'The Witches' was one of many hits from the highly-acclaimed author's prestigious bibliography and was brought to life on the big-screen in 1990 thanks in large part to producer Jim Henson. Dahl, however, was rather critical towards the film (as he was admittedly known to do when it came to adaptations of his work) for its radically different ending. Nevertheless, the film was a huge success with critics and while it may not have been much of a box-office hit, it has very much become a cult classic of its time. As such, it's not too surprising that the 1990 film's legacy has had a major impact on the reactions towards this year's new adaptation of the novel, directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Guillermo Del Toro and Alfonso Cuaron. But while most of the user reviews on this site are venomously decrying this as a complete and utter disaster, it's not 'that' bad.\n\nTo be fair, though, I'm not saying that it's perfect as it's arguably the most by-the-numbers film that Zemeckis has ever directed. Just like what happened when Tim Burton directed his remake of 'Planet of the Apes' in 2001, this is one of those films where, if you didn't know that it was directed by the same guy behind 'Back to the Future' and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', you probably wouldn't have guessed since it's one of those films that could've easily been done by anyone. Still, for what it's worth, the film does a nice job of maintaining the whimsical nature of Roald Dahl's writing where the kids are the heroes in a story that's full of the delightfully twisted dark sense of humor that Dahl was well-known for. And while it's completely understandable if some may find her performance to be a bit too over-the-top, Anne Hathaway is clearly having a lot of fun in the lead role of the story's main antagonist, the Grand High Witch.\n\nNow as a quick disclaimer, while I have read the book, I'll admit that I've never watched the 1990 film because, simply put, it never ended up on my radar when I was growing up. As such, I don't have the strong connection to it that other folks have, thus influencing their thoughts on this new film. And becuase of this, I found this new version of 'The Witches' to be generally solid overall. While it's far from being the best film that Robert Zemeckis has ever directed, it's ultimately a harmless family-friendly flick that helps bring one of Dahl's most famous stories to a new generation."

Well what's the point in remaking something for it to be identical - yes they also use a lot of CGI.. well again, what's the point in remaking something if you aren't going to utilise the technology of today. The movie seems a lot more to the tone of the original book simply because they could use special effects to really pantomime up the original story the way it was told. Is it the original?

Angelica Huston was so perfect in her portrayal that she didn't even need to speak and you'd get the chills from her stare. I think everything was just overly done but without any substance. Even the weaving choreography-like movements as the witches entered the grand room they were having their meeting was annoying! The other witches in this movie also seem like they were just there to fill the bodies of witches--even they didn't add any kind of color to the movie. Plus, let's not even talk about the ending...oi! I was so excited for this and even set a reminder, way ahead in advance. This is such a major disappointment."

It's a good fun story that I'm fairly sure kids will generally like.\n\nThat the nostalgia and memory of the 1990 version that seems to have anchored so many here to a polarised and negative opinion of this one is quite frankly ridiculous.\n\nA film has to be VERY bad before I would even consider giving it a 1/10 (which I have never done) and I was rather surprised to see so many handed out like sweets for this title. So much so, that I found and watched the original for comparison.\n\nTo be quite honest, I think this is a better version, if only because it is period pertinent, but they both stand as great productions.\n\nThe Jim Henson special effects of the first one are pretty good, and taking them out of context by comparing them with modern day capabilities isn't fair, and I only do so because it's something so many here have already done. Certainly for the time they were excellent, but there is no comparison with the new release where they are immeasurably more convincing.\n\nI don't necessarily want to do a side by side comparison between the two movies, I think they both stand by themselves for the era's in which they are released, but the notion that this film doesn't stand on its own is pure trash.\n\nThe story, direction and in particular the acting from most of the cast are all very good, and in fact rather than go on, I'll simply say its an all round good film. Well set and well produced. Most of the reviews here are lopsided and unfair accounts of a good production that has stepped on the toes of a childhood or overly fond memory of the 1990 version.\n\nYour Kids will love it, and so did I. Its a Solid 6/10 but in the interest of fairness, I'm giving it 7."

I LOVE Robert Zemeckis (we share a birthday and he's a great storyteller fun fact, also sharing a birthday with George Lucas). There was nothing wrong with the original, however technology gives you a little more room to play with the execution of the storytelling. None the less, a lot of the 1 star ratings were simply because the leads were black? Seriously, it was compared over 4 times to a 'what if' a historically black film was revised with an all white cast. Which is extremely demonstrative of their ignorance because that has already been done with a lot of literature and black characters. As well as people stating this is a \"political\" remake, when no one really thinks that until you factor in their own insecurities of having minorities in leading roles. Anyway, I don't love Anne Hathaway... her acting was a little much, but that may have been how the director wanted it played. No one can really recreate that Anjelica Houston portrayal but she does it in her own way which is what an actress is supposed to do. It's just a bit distracting from the story. Overall a great FAMILY film. One person did say \"it wasn't as scary as I remembered it as a kid\". Which I agree with, but you may not realize that fear as an adult. Seeing those feet, mouths and claws may be more of an impact for a child, or it may have purposefully been made kid friendlier. Because I was 4ish when the original came out and I couldn't sit through it I remember being terrified. that also may be the difference between CGI and practical effects. Still a great watch, people who rated it poorly where looking for an updated remake without it being \"updated\". It's not a transformer movie it's a Roald Dahl adaption. I and a lot of people can feel apart of the story now with a lead character portrayed by people of color."

It completely relied on the CGI and had nothing else to it. The storyline had an under current of racism, I don't know why they had to bring that into the film. Chris Rock's voice over was extremely annoying and the Grand witch was just terrible. You don't relate to the film like the original, in fact I don't think you really care for the characters at all with the way they have done the stupid voice over rather than let the young boy develop his own. The only person I did like in the film was octavia but even her character was cold compared to how you would have liked her to be. Just a terrible remake, even my kids said they prefer the original! The only thing I did like about it was the soundtrack and that was it. Seriously save your money - I wish I hadn't wasted mine!"

I couldn't agree more. And the Alien was much creepier to me (That awful creepy smile, those hands and extending arms...) The actors are great and the special effects are updated to today's tech. Didn't like the changes in the story. Okay, so in my personal experience: found it scarier and the ending with a sad note. Not joyful at all."

The movie is cute, but it falls a bit short compared to the first adaptation that Jim Henson produced because that version was darker and took itself more seriously. This other adaptation has a more childish tone, but at least the story was faithful to the original book. Anne Hathaway's Grand Witch is gloomy and her design is reminiscent of Mileena from Mortal Kombat, but it's not as unpleasant as Anjelica Huston's Grand Witch's makeup. The protagonist boy and his grandmother act well, the digital effects are soft and obvious, but the CGI mice are quite adorable. It's not a bad movie, it's just decent and nothing more than that can be said. My rating for this movie is a 7/10."

How wrong I was.\n\nAs I watched the first 10 minutes, I knew this would be bad. I'm not going to bore everyone with attempting to act like a professional movie critic and talk about a load of technical things.\n\nThe entire movie is made out of CGI. Poor character models, ridiculous looking animals, fake EVERYTHING. Literally, everything was fake. And it looked it too. I've seen better CGI in 80s and 90s movies and YouTube fan films. I mean, what's wrong with dressing people up and playing the part and actually looking real? Why computerise everything and make it look cartoony as hell.\n\nAnne Hathaway did a decent job, her accent was weird but her acting was pretty darn good and scared the hell out of my young siblings but her characters' design was ridiculously fake, silly and ultimately, flawed. Hathaway and the brilliant Octavia Spencer did a good job acting wise but it wasn't enough to save this film.\n\nThe original had heart, soul and genuine magic that drew people in. The remake has none of that. I'm surprised that Zemeckis, Del Toro and Cuar\u00f2n are even involved in this. Why make this film? Why spend money to butcher and destroy the name of a wonderful Film and book? Roald Dahl's name should be nowhere near this remake. It's an insult.\n\nPLEASE Hollywood, stop disrespecting and destroying classic movies."

He gets a pet mouse to cheer him up.\n\nOne day in a store he is lured by a witch who offers him a bar of chocolate. However his grandma calls out for him before any damage is done.\n\nHis grandmother tells him when she was a child her friend was turned into a chicken by a witch. The witches seem to target black kids as no one seems to notice when they go missing.\n\nThe boy is taken to a hotel to stay by the seaside by his grandmother. Unfortunately the witches are having a convention where the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) plans to turn all the children into mice.\n\nBlessed with a narration from Chris Rock, a camp performance from Anne Hathaway and expensive CGI special effects. This adaptation still struggles compared to Nicolas Roeg's version from 1990.\n\nThis can be shown by the waste of Stanley Tucci's hotel manager character. At times The Witches wants to be a dark Disneyfied kids movie with a nod and a wink to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This explains why a fat boy lured with bars of chocolate is transformed into a mouse because of his greed."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is OK. Don't listen to the whingers and whiners complaining about this movie not being like the book or Nicolas Roeg's 1990 film.\n\nA few pertinent points follow.\n\nRoald Dahl hated Roeg's (who I much admire as a director) version. So I don't quite understand all the keyboard warriors out there, calling the 1990 film a classic adaption of the book, because it simply wasn't.\n\nThe switching of locations from Europe to Alabama works really well imo. I actually found the first half of the movie, before the action moves to the hotel, particularly compelling. Let me just add on here that Octavia Spencer playing Agatha the grandmother is very good.\n\nI really don't quite comprehend the extent of the criticism of the special effects. They were more than adequate and perhaps I just need to remind critics that this is a Robert Zemeckis movie. Robert Zemickis simply doesn't do bad/cheap CGI. That's not an opinion, that's a recognised fact.\n\nSimilarly I don't subscribe to the criticism aimed at Anne Hathaway. She made an excellent Grand High Witch. What's with all this overacting babble emanating from the pointy heads? Let's not forget this is primarily a kids' movie and designed to be both funny and suspenseful. Anne Hathaway was expected to give an over the top performance and be always central to and dominating the scenes she is in. That's the nature of the beast. I don't think the vast majority of the viewing audience were expecting to see some sort of female rendition of Voldemort. She was meant to be a scene - chewing, scary, funny character and I think she succeeded.\n\nIgnore the naysayers. Apart from the switching of locales, this film adaption is closer to Dahl's book, than Roeg's, which is arguably the primary reason The Witches was remade in the first place. I think this is a decent attempt. I liked the atmosphere of the first half best. The second half set in the hotel, becomes more of your typical kids' thrills, spills, chase movie."

This has resulted in unfortunate contradictions such as a line in the movie which states \"witches prey on poor children\" which is soon followed by an attack on a \"wealthy white child\" by the witches. It has also been dumbed down with every plan being fully explained before it's executed - thus no surprises. The racial stereotypes we an unwelcome and unnecessary addition IMO. It's an OK movie if you haven't seen the original but I would recommend the 1990 version over this one."

People clearly have too much time in their hands these days and decide to start criticizing a children's movie just because it's different from the remake they watched when they were younger.\n\nI found the movie was cute and entertaining. Good acting, nice story-line, decent visual effects and great costumes. Not as scary as the 1990 movie, so more suitable for children. It stayed true to the book while still adding some new aspects, such as the witches only preying on underprivileged, poor children who would not be missed. I also liked how there was more diversity than the 1990 movie.\n\nSure, it has a few flaws. It was a risky move to Americanize the story, the accent of the Grand Witch is a odd and the witches don't have a lot of magic, but I wouldn't say any of these are a real deal-breaker. Just because this movie might not be as good as the 1990 remake, doesn't mean it's not worth watching.\n\nJust set aside your high expectations, keep in mind that it's a children's movie and you will enjoy this movie."

And it definitely didn't happen here!\n\nNow the location of the film has been moved from England to America, not the biggest issue in the world. The main characters are now black, again no issue at all... until the undertones of racism come into play. Jibes at \"rich white folk\" being the only people that normally stay at the hotel where the majority of the film takes places and the not-so-subtle racist comments by the white hotel manager. Was all that really necessary? I don't think so.\n\nThen we come to the Grand High Witch, Anne Hathaway have it a good go but was nowhere near as terrific or scary as Huston was. They were big boots to fill to be fair to her.\n\nThe film scores it's points from me for fantastic cinematography, costumes and set decoration. But that's about as good as it gets in my opinion.\n\nAlways watch a film, especially a remake, before having an opinion, I will just pre-warn you not to have high expectations with this one."

In the late 1960s, a young boy (Jahzir Bruno) goes to live with his grandma (Octavia Spencer) after the tragic death of his parents. Very quickly it appears he is the target of a group of evil sneaky witches led by the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) so Grandma takes him away to a seaside hotel where they shouldn't be found. Unfortunately, they happen to choose the hotel where the Witches are gathering for a meeting to discuss hunting every last child \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc80 the children's book by Dahl is notoriously dark and deliciously twisted, leading to an adaptation by director Nicholas Roeg (Don't Look Now) back in 1990, starring the brilliant Angelica Huston. I'm going to try my best not to compare it to the original as I have a nostalgic fondness there. This remake is a very fun kids movie that will satisfy any pint sized person seeking a good scare \ud83d\ude00 the visual effects are lovely which is to be expected from the visual mastery behind Zemeckis' vision and from co-writer Guillermo Del Toro (The witches facial and limbic contortions are beautifully Del Toro influenced!) Hathaway is having so much fun here and she's incredible to watch, especially when she snarls and hisses her way across the room, sure to scar a new generation of kids interested in Dahl's stories \ud83d\ude00"

The casting was really good and their acting was nice (especially, Anne's acting). It wasn't a very intense movie, because it was very family-friendly and there weren't any explicit scenes. However, there were some enjoyable scenes (especially, the witch's reveal and the witch's transformation). The opening scene was very interesting and really promising.

I'm glad the good author doesn't have to experience this 2020 film adaptation anymore.\n\nI have three major criticisms:\n\n1. Americanization. The story of an English orphan raised by his Norwegian grandmother has moved to Alabama. Even worse is that the film adaptation has become typically American 'exaggerated'. \"Witches don't kill children with knives or guns, they're far too smart for that.\" That's what Roald Dahl wrote. His witch was actually a child molester. A monster who dressed up as a neat lady. This American film adaptation has turned it into a Demon. It's exaggerated, it's not authentic. Children won't get the fear of being caught on the street by the gloves of lady.\n\n2. Anne Hathaway was miscasted. It is what ruins it even more. She doesn't fit her role as a grand high witch, her role is all heavy overacting, a lot of dramaqueen and she doesn't offer any depth. I had hoped that Eva Green would have been cast as the supreme witch instead, because she has already played very strong similar roles, such as in Dark Shadows. Unfortunately.\n\n3. Style and special effects. Ugly and not scary. That the supreme witch can fly is even laughable and did not appear in the book. Outfits of the witches are a bit wrong too. Why is the grand high witch wearing a bdsm corset underneath her dress, in a family movie?\n\nStill 5/10 for those who haven't read the book. They still have an okay family movie. Still, I recommend the 1990 film to them."

Then Anne Hathaway was casted as \"The Grand High Witch\", was a perfect match. Couple weeks later Octavia Spencer and Stanley Tucci were added as well and I was all on board! Since COVID19 cancelled theaters to release films regularly, Warner Bros and HBOMax worked together to release it streaming on only HBOMax this October.Now the original 1990 film is and always will be iconic for Angelica Hustons' performance as \"The Grand High Witch\" is unlike anything. Anne Hathaway sold that role in a different way and it worked! As well as everyone else in the cast are all really good. There are certain aspects closer to the book and some different. Book had claws for fingers and nostrils and toes and the grand high witch being pretty but has a mask to cover her face. This version had everything that the book had expect her scary face was an elongated mouth and only came out when she was furious. I loved this touch and some won't at all. I will always be a fan of the 1990 version being so advanced with prosthetic puppets and makeup can appreciate its originality! As a whole I loved this re-imagined version by the iconic Robert Zemeckis and produced by Guillermo del Toro they did a great job. Some aspects are closer to the novel and minor changes, don't go in expecting the original. Go with an open mind. Do not listen to the negative reviews I didn't understand. This was a great modern adaptation! Stop being negative because it's a remake. It's fun! But not recommended for young children under 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Witches\" (2020) starring Anne Hathaway is a darkly whimsical reimagining of Roald Dahl's classic novel, but it's not without its flaws.\n\nHathaway's portrayal of the Grand High Witch is absolutely mesmerizing - she delivers a performance that is both wildly eccentric and chilling, embodying the villainous character with a perfect balance of humor and menace. Her dramatic physical transformation, coupled with a voice that oozes malevolence, makes her an unforgettable figure, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.\n\nThe film's visual design is a standout, featuring imaginative CGI that brings the world of witches to life in striking, often unsettling ways. The settings are beautifully crafted, with vibrant, exaggerated colors and dark, eerie undertones that capture the essence of Dahl's original story. While the visual effects are bold and creative, at times they veer too far into the surreal, making the experience feel more cartoonish than necessary for the darker themes the film tries to explore.\n\nThe story, while faithful to its source material, at times feels rushed. The pacing in some areas falters, and the transition between key moments doesn't always flow smoothly. There's an emotional disconnect in places that makes it difficult to fully engage with the characters, despite the effort from the talented cast.\n\nHowever, there are moments of pure magic within the film. The transformation scenes, in particular, are expertly executed, creating a sense of awe and terror. The combination of dark humor and horror, mixed with a touch of heartwarming family sentiment, provides an enjoyable experience overall.\n\n\"The Witches\" is certainly a feast for the eyes and a joy for fans of the fantastical, but it's not quite as enchanting as it could have been. With a stronger emotional core and a more consistent pace, it could have been a true standout. Still, it's an entertaining ride, and Anne Hathaway's performance alone is worth the watch. It earns a solid 7 stars for its creativity, visual flair, and captivating villainy."

        "review_detailed_main": "The stage curtains open ...\n\nAnother movie version of Roald Dahl's, \"The Witches\", for a new generation. Having watched (and being a fan of) the 1990 film based on the same story, I admit I went into this one a bit more critical than most films. This 2020 version did deliver in certain areas, but failed in others.\n\nAfter our young hero boy's parents are killed in a car accident, he goes to live with his grandmother, who seems to know quite a bit about witches. To escape the gaze of a witch that approaches the boy in a hardware store, she takes him on a small vacation to a nearby hotel. However, unknown to them both, a convention of witches is being held in the hotel, headed by the Grand High Witch herself. When the boy is discovered and turned into a mouse, the race is on to find his grandmother, and stop the witches' dastardly plan to turn every child in the world into a mouse.\n\nAs I mentioned at the outset, I have seen and loved the Anjelica Huston 1990 version of this classic tale, so I did a little comparison. One of the things I did not like was the fact that our witches were dumbed down. There wasn't nearly as much engagement with the coven of witches, and Hathaway's version of the Grand High Witch pales in comparison to Huston's performance. However, I liked what Octavia Spencer brought to the role as the grandmother, and the special effects were very good.\n\nThis really wasn't a bad film, but I cannot recommend it. The magic just wasn't there in this re-make. It is fun, entertaining, and made me smile in places. But, for a better telling of this story, I personally would recommend you watch 1990's film instead. It has it all. This was \"just okay\" at 6 stars out of 10."

The unreal of CGI distracts you because it does not fit the image. After they turn into mice the film becomes boring and monotonous because everything else of the context is lost, even the hotel seemed dull. Without a doubt this movie has nothing redeemable, the casting promised to give us a good movie, however Anne Hathaway's performance seemed a bit fake, and the essence of the character was lost due to the terrible CGI , Octavia Spencer's performance was good but it could have developed the character more and Stanley Tucci barely appeared. With the exception of a couple of funny scenes, I did not enjoy the movie because it had no elements to catch the viewer. For kids it's probably fine."

Unlike some other comments I didn't mind the spin of swapping the main characters out for African Americans, I just don't think it added anything.\n\nIt's hard pinpointing exactly what went wrong here, but the whole film just felt off, you didn't feel like you were watching actual characters...but actors acting like characters, which makes a huge difference. Octavia Spenser has done some great roles throughout the years and she just didn't seem to put much effort into this. Anne Hathaway has also done some great roles...and it seems she put TOO much effort into it. It felt like she was trying too hard the whole time. And every other character is basically forgettable, including the lead child. Who was actually pretty good I think, just underutilized because the voice over by Chris Rock basically stole all the kids thunder by explaining everything he had already done, was doing, or going to do. Let the damn kid act.\n\nFinally there was something odd with the special effects, some scenes lead me to believe they might have originally intended for this to be in 3D for a theatrical release, so you have these weird CGI sequences where they're reaching or running right at the screen and it comes off looking out of place. Which was really the case for the whole movie, just nothing seemed to work together and it results in a movie that just feels completely unneeded.\n\nAs a complete side note on what could have actually worked...change up the story a little bit to have the black leads have an actual backstory as to why they're there. If they'd put a French spin on it then the African Americans could have been the descendants of Creole slaves or immigrants who'd had dealings with witches on the European continent. I think that would have been a fun twist instead of just essentially making them movie props for a diversity quota."

        "review_detailed_main": "This reboot of the 1990 classic leaves fans of the original feeling somewhat disappointed. Most of the good portions were borrowed from the first film, while the new interpretations fall flat. The first witch our protagonist encounters doesn't even attempt to lure or trick the boy. She is immediately creepy, and rather annoying in the way she speaks. Octavia Spencer is fantastic. Kristin Chenoweth comes out of nowhere with no back story. Anne Hathaway, while great on screen, her character's accent makes her nearly incomprehensible throughout the movie. The special effects were nice, but there is very little magic to behold in this version. Viewers of the original will especially feel this during the ending. While they may have set up for sequels that will hopefully redeem this story, on its own, this one fails to capture the fun that Nicolas Roeg did 30 years ago."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are so many 'not thought out' things in this movie; a lot is just amateurish. The script is good for, maybe, a developing mind around 6 or 7 years old. I didn't like the narration either, a proper speaking young boy and a narration 'as if it was him when older' changes from a well spoken child to this 'older him' voice completely different than how he sounds adding useless information you would already assume, know or find out or just completely without purpose. Poor poor plot. It is more like a Halloween semi-spooky child's book of about 20 pages or so. Was not made to entertain adults at all unless you have very low expectations and are just bored enough to watch anything. The boy had a bad script but still did well with what he had. The original blows this away and ruins this movie just in comparison. As Snoopy says, 'BLEH'. Also, with it being so child-like it was really inconsistent in that they emphasized Anne's breasts and made it pretty disgusting in the looks that were scary."

        "review_detailed_main": "Robert Zemeckis always teases us with something that could be family fun and charming enough for adults. He frequently doesn't deliver like he used to. Which is the case yet again with The Witches. A movie so adverse to the art of filmmaking it constantly gives up in the middle of scenes.\n\nRobert still shows signs of life with some nice looking shots and editing that has some inspiration behind it. However, more times then not he feels like he's sleep walking. He's never been a director to deliver tour de force pitcures but he usually finds a balance between fun and dramatic. The typical shmaltzy music he uses is over bearing in this and the constant visual effects do this little favors.\n\nIt's like Steven Spielbergs BFG but with less effort put in, which is saying something. Even basic scenes that start promising end with a CG extravaganza that made me want to hide away and forget I saw it. One scene in particular where the witches reveal their plan is one of the most embarrassing things this year. Robert can't help but flex his visual effects in this scene and it's a sight that made me want to stop and die.\n\nThe overbearing use of CG definitely doesn't help, but neither does Anne Hathaway. Who is overacting to such an extreme it's unbearable. She is the main protagonist and is so laughable you can't see her as a threat at any point. She is so so bad in this and looks even worse when she shares scenes with Octavia Spencer. Who plays the grandma to the main child and is lovely. She is typically charismatic even if she isn't trying that hard. She knows what this is.\n\nWhich is a family movie at the end of the day. It seems to want to drive in the Stuart Little lane of yesteryear. But I can't see any demographic of people enjoying this. It's a clunky disaster of bad acting, poor writting, and so much post work it feels plastic. There's no heart to this. There's no warmth in a movie that tries so hard to have some. Kids will be bored and adults will be horrified."

        "review_title": "A Pointless Copy and Paste (Zemeckis is Way Better than This)",
        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure where to begin on this one, so let's wind the clocks back to 1990 and talk about the original film based on the same book. While I haven't read the Roald Dahl classic book of the same name, I enjoyed the creativity throughout the first adaptation of his work. The Witches from 1990 had many issues and stretched out a very small story to fill the run time of a feature film, which was absolutely the most notable negative of that film for me, as it was for this 2020 version as well. At a mere 105 minutes, Robert Zemeckis' The Witches felt like an eternity to sit through and missed the mark almost entirely for me.\n\nThis film begins with a montage of images that showcase the fact that witches exist in this world. After the death of his parents, a young boy and his grandma flea to an expensive hotel, where they can get away from the witches, whom they believe are following them. Without knowing it, they end up going to this hotel during some form of witch conference. This in turn leads to this young boy being turned into a mouse by them, as well as another young boy at the hotel. The two of them, along with another mouse, venture around the hotel, trying to escape from these witches.\n\nThe premise itself is the most intriguing part, as it's equally strange and fun. With that said, the idea was created as a book, then as a mediocre film in 1990, and now remake nearly exactly the same in every way. Because it did nothing new with the material, I have nothing but criticism honestly, aside from one major thing that I really appreciated. Without ruining it, the original film ends in a way that left me disappointed, but this remake actually had the guts to do something that I wished the original had done. For that reason, I give this film a little praise, but that's just how the film ends because the rest is absolutely the same.\n\nI admit that I was enjoying the first act of this film because Octavia Spencer made for a very enjoyable grandmother to this young boy and I would've loved more of that. Sadly, once they get to the hotel, the movie takes no chances and the witches themselves chew up the scenery, and not in a good way. Anne Hathway plays the head witch and although she's absolutely committed to the role and having a blast, I just found her performance to be way too overdone. I commend her for going all out, but it didn't work for me. This was a major issue because she has more than half of the screentime of the duration of the movie.\n\nIn the end, Robert Zemeckis is a director that I love, but his latest efforts in Allied, Welcome to Marwen, and now The Witches have all been less than stellar to say the least. I thought The Walk and Flight were great films, but I haven't truly loved one of his films since Cast Away, which was 20 years ago. On top of that, Zemeckis also wrote the screenplay with both Kenya Barris and Guillermo del Toro, so I'm really not sure how all those creative brains just made a copy and paste of the original. There was so much talent behind the lens here and I'm still scratching my head as to how this was the final result. I don't believe this film is worth anyone's time, but it's now available through HBO if you wish."

It's 2020 so I should expect it wouldn't be like the original and made for the current generation. If kids could review on here they would praise it because in the theatre we watched it in there was laughter and cringing, ohhhs and arhhhs in all the right spots.

        "review_detailed_main": "IN BRIEF: All of the joy and wicked dark humor has been zapped from Roald Dahl's classic novel in this over-produced nightmare.\n\nJIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) This garish retelling of the Roald Dahl's charmingly macabre children's novel is a major disappointment, especially from the talented director Robert Zemeckis. Lately, he has been so enamored with CGI and its powerful effects that he sacrifices his actors and story to wow his audience. This moviegoer was not.\n\nAll of Mr. Dahl's dark humor and subtle wit has been expunged by the director and his writing crew (Kenya Barris, Guillermo del Toro and Mr. Zemeckis himself) as they readapt the hi-jinks to a Black family in Southern Alabama during the late sixties. The move does not go well.\n\nOctavia Spencer plays Grandma and she, at least, brings some sense of humor to her character. Jahzir Kadeem Bruno plays Hero Boy (?) and he is serviceable in his role as written. As they encounter a group of witches at a hotel convention, the stage is set for humor and conflict that rarely materializes.\n\nMost of the fault belongs with the director and script, but Anne Hathaway's bizarre interpretation of the Grand High Witch is all terror and none of the fun. Her thick German accent is sometimes unintelligible, and the CGI only distorts and makes the character more repellent and unpleasant than needed. Granted, she's a witch, but far from bewitching. The comedy is sorely missing in this performance. It's as if someone put a spell on this actress' skills as a comedian which she has shown to better effect in many other movies. Also wasted in his role as the harried hotel manager is the usually reliable Stanley Tucci.\n\nThere is no delight or whimsy in this off-kilter film adaptation for today's audience, only lots of desperation and some spiffy CGI, certainly too intense for younger audiences...and this reviewer.

It looks ridonkulous, the premise is even more absurd and it just... None of it makes any sense. Witches are lizard people and the only way to escape them is to better yourself by being a mouse? I'm just not having it and the whole time I was watching it I was constantly asking myself WTF?\n\nThis was an insane movie and honestly just not on my wavelength but I could see some people enjoying it. I really don't get how this is a kids movie but whatever. Don't watch this. There are so many, better movies for the whole family, such as the entire Pixar library. Just steer clear and save yourself."

Just everything about the 1990 version is wonderful, so all of the changes from small to big are just not needed. I don't object to the blackification, Grandma does a good job, but everything else is wrong, the timings are all off, watch the original, it's poetic & magical, this is messy & clumsey.\n\nMAKE NO MISTAKE - THIS IS BAD - THE END!\n\nExamples - The original death of the parents is momentary, moving & touching, the new version drags on & on & has no heart!\n\nThe witches meeting original is timed perfectly & everything makes sense, the new one is a CGI mess.\n\nThe original music is delightful & memorable, the new one, can't remember it!\n\nThe narration is AWFUL & I find Chris Rock's voice annoying.\n\nThe decision to make Grandma a 'good witch' is bad!\n\nBruno's Dad is almost entirely written out, no white guys I guess!\n\nNo assistant to the grand witch, leads to unnecessary changes & permeant mice!\n\nThe decision to shoe horn in racism is dreadful (however slight), I can't think Dahl would've been impressed.\n\nThey all dance to a song at the end that isn't written for 10 years yet.\n\nSo, memorable versus forgettable."

I like to write reviews taking two things into account: Target audience and Genre.\n\nGiving this a 1 just because its not as good as the original is really unfair, especially since most people who are rating are rating upon their own adult bias.\n\nThis film is a lot of fun, the plot wasn't clich\u00e9 and the acting was solid. Based loosely on Dahl's writing, it avoids a lot of the pre-generated story telling that makes the basis of most adventure films for a younger audience that Hollywood keeps squirting out in the past few decades.\n\nThe Witches is interesting and gives some good lessons to children about greed, teamwork, acceptance etc. The CGI isn't perfect, and its a little over done. But it is intentional. And whilst Dahl might be turning over in his grave, it doesn't detract away from the fact that for kids, this film is lighthearted, fun and enjoyable.\n\n9/10"

The effort here is lackluster, except for Hathaway, who you can tell is enjoying chewing the scenery. Zemeckis keeps doing these weird hybrid animation movies that just aren't good. A lot of the visuals are disturbing and the messages aren't well told. Also the Everybody Hates Chris narration is super weird. Not sure who asked for this movie, but it wasn't me."

It would be an understatement to say Anne Hathaway did a stellar job, she absolutely owned the role of The Grand High Witch and took the character to a whole new level. Her performance as The Grand High Witch is the main highlight of the film, although there are many highlights. The cast is brilliant, I was just as impressed with Octavia Spencer and of course Stanley Tucci was great, providing some laughs and reuniting with Anne Hathway. The kids were really good, the cast was really brilliant and I think there's not a single scene in this film which is not magical in some way. Really enjoyed it, I recommend a watch."

The charm of the original was the practical effects in the make up and puppets used - this just felt lacklustre and cheap. Any opportunity to gloss over what could have been done with practical effects was just instantly jumped to computer graphics for no good reason - and not even decent ones at that. The performances on the whole were quite good but I felt the script felt rather forced with try hard humour and gags where they didn't fit. Lastly - the setting of the USA just felt too ill fitted to the story. I think The Witches unlike Matilda and Charlie is a work by Dahl that only fits into a British setting. It is quintessentially British in it's narrative and characters & so setting the story in Louisiana was a bold choice that sadly - didn't pay off well. The whole film just felt very Hollywood factory farmed with little to no passion and thought gone into it. There was no quirks, no effort and even large parts of the sets were CG'd into the scenes. Overall a general Lazy vibe of a movie they knew people would come and see due to the popularity of the original and works of Dahl - they rested on that too hard and when that happens even Hathaway can't save it."

There's none of the eeriness of the original, none of the like-ability in the lead characters. The two stars are for the lead child and stanly tucci. No humour whatsoever so far but the easy 'fat kid' jibes to keep kids entertained. Anne Hathaways lead witch visually just reminded me of Mars attacks and the accent was and is too much even though it's meant to be. Just a lot of bland CGI none sense. Having said that I'm sure there are loads of 10 year olds that have enjoyed it. If you enjoyed the original, give this one a miss to avoid disappointment."

I've seen worse adaptations but this one is just a plain old run of the mill remake kids can get a kick out of it and even the parents might see it as a fun adventure but it's no classic"
