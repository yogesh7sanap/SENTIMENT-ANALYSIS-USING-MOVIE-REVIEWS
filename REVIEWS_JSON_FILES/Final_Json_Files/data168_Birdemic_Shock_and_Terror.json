        "review_detailed_main": "Don't be fooled by the rating. You have to watch \"Birdemic\" at some point.\n\nThis movies outshines \"Troll 2\" in every respect. It puts \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" and \"The Room\" to shame. Imagine a movie that would be created solely to give film students a paper topic on how NOT to make movies. Every conceivable error has been made in making \"Birdemic.\" At first, you simply won't be able to believe that the film is not a spoof. But if you read about the film and about Nguyen, and if you take a few moments to watch the additional material on the DVD, you will soon agree that this was just a misguided effort on the entire production team's part.\n\nThe sound is the most outstanding example of sheer incompetence. The director clearly understood what Foley is, since the gunshots have all been added post-production, but I guess they just didn't have the time or money to dub the vast majority of the film after shooting. And it needs it. Badly.\n\nThe acting is uniformly terrible. Not bad. Terrible. Alan Bragh doesn't even rise to the level of fourth grade pageants. Whitney Moore is cute as a button and is aided by a bit of camel-toe in at least one scene, but she's the best of a poor lot. All the supporting cast is \"give your financial backers a small part\" bad.\n\nIf you want to explain blocking, editing, framing, sound markers, continuity, reverse shots, and other film terms to your friends, this is the film to use. None of it is done correctly.\n\nWhile the CGI (and I use the term in only the broadest sense) birds are hilarious, my favorite scene is the \"retirement\" scene. I think that the word \"retirement\" is used six times in just three lines. Watch for it. It's hard to miss.\n\nBUT...it's strangely watchable. In contrast to many bad movies, it's not boring. Consider it a train wreck that you simply can't tear your eyes from. Even the boring scenes (and there really aren't that many) have some aspect (poor sound, hilariously unrealistic dialogue, odd things going on in the background) that fascinate. You'll be giggling and poking your elbow into the side of the person beside you.\n\nSo, go rent it. Really. You won't regret it."

By this time, the majority of viewers have fallen asleep or have taken their own lives.\n\n2. The actor who plays Rod, Alan Bagh. He makes me miss Nicholas Cage. NO NOT THE BEES!!! AHHHH!!!\n\n3. The birds. What do they do exactly? Nothing. The birds come down and fly directly in front of the victims face. Then they die for reasons only criminally insane director James Nguyen knows. God help us.\n\n4. Read my parental advisory\n\n5. \"Hey I thought I told you to stand back. These birds are contaminated\"\n\n6. What is wrong with Rod's friend?

It's like watching a poorly translated foreign film. \"I like you and because you are pretty to me\" \"I thank you this words they make me happy\" \"Yaaaaaayyy...\"\n\n8. This quote: \"Why would birds do something like that? Why would they just attack\" \"......I don't know\"\n\n-------The good?\n\n1. Thank god for Whitney Moore in lingerie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes there is a film that comes along that boggles the mind. You cannot believe the thing exists, but there it is, paddling its arms forward like a Special Olympics finalist (and no, this is not a joke on the Special Olympics - they're too good for Birdemic: Shock and Terror). The movie tricks a viewer like yours truly; at first, having not seen anything made by its director, the inimitable James Nguyen - he has two other films to his credit, Replica and Julie and Jack, neither seen by me (just as well, one of whom gives its highest praise as \"Ed Wood quality\" on IMDb) - I wasn't sure what I was really seeing, if it was either the highest or lowest of artistic expression.\n\nThe film takes place in some sunny seaside community on the California coast - as we're made PAINFULLY CLEAR in the opening from-the-car driving shots (immediately calling to mind the opening credits of Manos: The Hands of Fate) - and is about how Rod (Alan Bough) and Nathalie (Whitney Moore), who meet one day by chance, he a successful solar-panel salesman and she a Victoria's Secret model (she just made the cover!) Oh, and there's an almost inexplicable warning of a crazy-killer bird epidemic on the news, from, um, I guess it's global warming. And after about a half hour of almost *nothing* going on between these two pieces of cardboard-as-actors, the birds finally arrive.... oh yes, how they arrive.\n\nWhat I mean by my uncertainty of what I was seeing, it felt like a double-edged sword. I kept thinking during the film, 'either Nguyen is a total genius, crafting the most intentionally bad movie in recent memory, or he's quite possible the most sickening hack you've never wanted to meet.' It's one thing that the film was shot on a shitty camcorder. It's another that the actors appear to be non-professionals or at best from community theater (Alan Bagh is so stiff he just might make your eyes bleed; Moore is too hot to have that happen, though her talent is just as nill).\n\nBut it's something else how absolutely, and surprisingly consistently, awful the film-making is. Even if you've never taken a class in proper lighting or sound or stage direction or editing, Birdemic shines so mightily in its crap-ness. Scenes start and end without a proper marker, as if the editor didn't know how to flow from one scene- one SHOT- to the next. Sound is completely mis-matched from one shot to the next. The music is the kind of synthesizer work that cranked up loud enough could drive Bin-Laden out of his cave (they even go as far as to rip-off the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" for a girl character wearing a \"Imagine Peace\" shirt. And the birds... oh, boy, the birds (if you need further proof, watch the trailer, do yourself a favor and get it out of the way).\n\nNow, again, experiencing this film, especially in the case I had in a theater with people perhaps anticipating its awfulness based on the trailer or the website or the claim by Nguyen to be a \"Master of the Romantic Thriller\" (Trademarked. I'm not kidding), that this is perhaps just a brilliant prank, a satire of epic proportions. Certainly the \"message\" part of the movie- and it's wielded with such a sledgehammer it would make Stanley Kramer look like Jim Jarmusch - is done to such a ludicrous extent, with characters appearing for walk-on scenes like a Old-man Biologist who appears to explain that the birds were caused by man's harm to the planet, or the \"Tree-Man\" in the woods who has a tree-house home and finds the birds don't attack him because he's in the woods and not out on the road like the rest of stupid man-animal civilization. Not to mention the rather *listen to us now* attitude of the main characters driving their hybrid cars and seeing An Inconvenient Truth (I s**t you not, this is in the movie) and their silly solar panels. Who ever heard of that working really well?\n\nAll of this could, potentially, really be just a put-on of such a magnitude that I would want to shake Nguyen's hand for pulling off such a feat. But, no, Nguyen took himself very seriously during this production, only slightly changing his tune after the fact of people seeing the film like the audience in The Producers seeing \"Springtime for Hitler\" for the first time (if you need proof, look at this NY Times article quote: \"I never went to film school,\" Mr. Nguyen said. \"But I did go to what you'd call the film school of Hitchcock cinema.\"). I'll give him that he had persistence in getting the film out there, even showing it in bars around the Sundance film festival when he couldn't get in. The masses of sober people puking all around him should have given him a clearer idea of what he had though.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong, Birdemic is absolutely, hysterically, historically, gloriously funny. It's a magnificent fresco of horrible CGI (the birds just float, like a screensaver), and non-existent acting, and plot that... wait, what plot? And who needs an ending that makes sense either, or shots that match up? It's so funny that I ended up feeling just a wee-bit guilty by the end. It's easy to mock this movie, like a bully on the playground mocking the kid with Cerebal Palsy. If the film isn't an intentional anti-film, then it's just a really bad Manos/Ed-Wood level movie, and all of the hilarity that ensues from it is kind of expected. It's not even worthy of Asylum DVD status. Alongside The Room, After Last Season, and Severed Ways, it's one of the real no-budget bad-movie finds of the past ten years. A must-see, for every wrong reason imaginable."

When the actual film starts, the camera is so horrid I thought the cameraman was drunk, or if I was unwillingly intoxicated. Anyways, I had to check my earphones after a couple of minutes, because the sound suddenly stopped and popped up at random, looks like the sound-mixer of this movie probably is deaf or some sort of modern day Hellen Keller.\n\nLet's say something about the acting.. if there is any. I felt my heart wrenching when the protagonist started reading his lines, his act is already so wooden after two minutes of screen-time he'd fit right in the Ents from the \"Lord of the Rings\"-trilogy. When an actor can't even walk straight without showing signs of having something rectangular shoved up his rectum, there's something wrong.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes of clapping (yes, see it for yourself), a love story that makes the Twilight-saga seem like \"The Notebook\" and \"Titanic\" combined, dialouges that are from another planet and all-in- all all I'm thinking: Is this movie the \"Shock and Terror\" the sub-title proclamates? 'Cause I haven't seen a f*cking bird yet!!\n\nWhen the birds arrive.. No, I don't even care to write about it.. I feel ashamed of myself. I feel like laying down in the shower with my clothes on and cry while the cold water is running on full.\n\nThis movie basically makes Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\" seem like the new \"Schindler's List\".

        "review_detailed_main": "I just got done watching Birdemic for the first time, I knew it was made on 10,000 dollars and it is regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. This same day I also watched The Happening and The Crawling Eye (MST3K version) so maybe I was feeling masochistic. This movie was all around bad in every aspect. It looks like it was shot on a fairly cheap digital video camera and it's obvious that the sound was recorded from the microphone built into the camera instead of a boom mic. I know that because the sound is very awful, the actors have to be pretty close to the camera to be heard right, and there's way too much loud background noise which in post production they played a lot of public domain elevator music to drown out the background noise. The worst audio issue was when they film on the beach because the sounds of the beach are 5 times louder than the actors voices.\n\nThe movie itself is very slow paced, the first half of the movie is just the main guy meeting his dream girl and building their relationship. The problem is that nobody in this movie can act and the writing was pitiful so what we get are very bland characters, not even vanilla more like tofu bland. We get no reason to care about these people in any way and to make them less likable the main guy has to talk about solar panels, hybrid cars, global warming, and even the war in Iraq as much as he can. The script is almost a love letter to Al Gore. This feels like an eternity where it goes from his boring job that he is way too enthusiastic about, his obsession with a greener world, and his dates.\n\nThe second half of the movie is when the birds finally go on a rampage. Lots of 2D computer generated birds that fly around in circles and attack their prey by hovering in place while moving their wings up and down and making the same noise looped over and over the whole movie. Somehow these berserk eagles can set house on fire as well as kill people in one swoop. The couple ends up meeting another couple who lets them ride in their van, this van has everything from handguns and two AK-47 assault riffles with unlimited ammo (I'm guessing the van has Game Genie,) as well as medical supplies, and anything the plot requires. Most of the movie has these people gunning down birds and searching for survivors. The survivors they meet all have long boring monologues about how it isn't the eagles we should be afraid of, it's global warming and mankind's use of fossil fuels that is responsible for this disaster.\n\nAs far as the action goes, it's about as lame as the trailer makes it look. When someone dies it's just a bird hovering in front of the person and they fall down with blood make up on them. There's also some really pointless scenes there just to raise the body count like a man who pulls a gun on them (even though they still have an assault riffle that they seem to forget about for the rest of the movie)who wants their gas, which they say cost them 100 dollars a gallon. There's a whole lot of nothing interesting going on. At least companies like Troma can take a 10 cent movie and throw in lots of nudity, over the top gore, and comedy. The people behind Birdemic have the worst CGI effects since the old Star Trek movies and long speeches about the environment. If you watch it, bring some friends and laugh at it because it works in that regard. Other than that it's Duck Hunt: The Movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Given that \"Birdemic\" has been blasted by many critics, I think I should say something positive about it to start off with. The scenery of Half Moon Bay is agreeable, for one thing, and Ms. Moore has at least a modicum of charisma; also, anyone who appreciates a stylish blue hybrid Mustang rolling along in a stately manner gets to savor that very sight in many lingering shots. All positive aspects of this film.\n\nLess positive aspects of this film are legion, so much so that I'm reminded of my wish that IMDb.com would allow a vote on a scale from 1 to 100 rather than 1 to 10 (in which case \"Birdemic\" would rate at least a 3 out of 100 for the reasons mentioned, and perhaps a 4 for meaning well (though the message about global warming comes across in a preachy and ham-handed manner)). Still, something about the profoundly amateurish quality of this film makes it feel a little unfair to rate it at all ~ in much the same way that it would feel wrong to grade a term paper on the basis of some rough notes jotted down before writing the paper rather than the paper itself. This film very much reminds me of a rough draft ~ a sort of rough visualization of what the film would have been if the producer had more resources at his disposal (thus making the upcoming larger-budget sequel all the more intriguing).\n\nYet, I wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made. If it featured better sound, editing, writing, acting, direction and special effects, it might just be a forgettable homage to \"The Birds\"; its very flaws elevate (or should I say depress?) it to a special level otherwise occupied by a few special films like \"The Room\" and \"Manos: the Hands of Fate\" ~ the legendary realm of films that are so bad they're good. So, giving it the benefit of the doubt as a real film and not just a rough draft, I tender my vote of 1 out of 10 and hope that other fans of this film will also give it an appropriately low vote and insure its rightful place on the Bottom 100 (once it gathers the requisite number of votes)."

Yes, this movie has gifted me the ability to see sound.\n\nContinuing, every word that was spoken inspired me as a person. I also learned, in detail, how to use a gun, which, I now find very helpful.\n\nImmediately after the movie ended, I heard a knock at my door. My legs had returned to me, kicking the door down and attaching themselves to my waist. With this first amazing thing happening to me, I had the motivation to fix everything.\n\nI flew to the White House, killing the president immediately with my bird-like stare. I grabbed my wife from the clutches of his arms and lifted her into the air with my newly grown wings, holding her with my feet. The children were next.\n\nWe soon arrived in Ukraine, my children screaming when they saw me. There were tears in their eyes and they were backing away from shock. They missed me so dearly. I grabbed both and put them in my pelican-like beak, and began flying home.\n\nBirdemic: Shock and Terror is the reason I am still alive."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, to approach \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" with any kind of hope of witnessing a good feature film is utter lunacy. \"Amateur\" is a word a thousand times too generous for this film's description. Even given its low budget of $10,000, the majority of which seems to have gone on car fuel, the film is a joke. The acting is unspeakably bad, the \"special\" effects aren't worth mentioning, the music is corny and inappropriate, and the film's editing techniques have all the marvel of a flip-book.\n\nThe only way to enjoy this film is to treat it as exactly that, a joke. The above faults of the film are so glaring that the film becomes one huge joke that you can laugh along to. However, even this joke wears thin pretty quickly, and you're left feeling quite empty, as if you've been cheated out of 95 minutes of your life.\n\nNonetheless, I am firmly convinced that it is the director James Nguyen who is having the last laugh, as he has created a film so notoriously bad that everyone wants to see it. Perhaps the joke is on us, and the director's intention was to see just how popular this film could be through its infamy. Even so, absolutely nothing can forgive how bad this film really is. It makes Battlefield Earth feel like Star Wars, and makes the special effects of 1933's King Kong look like those of Avatar. It is, quite simply, the worst film ever committed to celluloid.\n\nWatching the trailer, I actually had a decent laugh, and thought it might be worth it. But having watched the finished product, the knowledge that somebody spent $10,000 making this ugly piece of garbage and then having the audacity to call it a film is infuriating, and actually quite offensive. People were PAID to produce this. With MONEY. I still don't believe it."

I spent the majority of the hour and thirty minute run time laughing in disbelief that this movie exists. It is a film you have to watch, if only to know how to gauge a bad movie in the future. I was just wondering what fundamental error they were going to make next. Overall birdemic is a fascinating piece of work simply because it is truly awful cinema. So terrible that it's unintentionally hilarious. I would absolutely classify it as a must watch."

All I can say is it has the worst editing, worst sound, worst acting, worst directing, worst special effects, worst story, and worst ending ever told. However it is by far the most breathtaking failure I've ever seen. It's like watching a work of art by Picasso created with dog poop and vomit under sewage water. Maybe that's what makes it fun to watch because of its honesty in trying to make a horror film with very limited resources. The pacing is atrocious though in that you will finally see the birds attack about 45 minutes through the movie and the birds look like Windows 95 screen savers. The sound editing...it's like every shot you will hear the difference in the background noise and by the time you see them \"firing\" guns your ears will explode due to the intensity of the sound. Forget about the plot because it doesn't even need one. All in all I can say it's a great movie to laugh at even when you are not drunk."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard to imagine that \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" isn't at the top of IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 List. After all, it's about the most amateurish and stupid film I've ever seen. Most kids posting homemade videos on YouTube make more professional looking stuff than this terrible mess. Imagine the joy in watching \"Birdemic\" as you see folks act who have LESS talent than middle school students in a school play! Imagine the use of a home movie camera whose sound is only activated when the 'actors' talk--and cuts on and off loudly and abruptly as they talk! Much of it is like a silent movie!! Imagine weirdly askew camera angles, scenes where lines are flubbed and a glacial pace. Yup, all that awaits you if you bother to watch this film! Oh, and lest I forget...there really is NO PLOT through much of the movie!! Yes, despite supposedly being about killer birds, nothing really happens during almost all the film! It's more like they turned on the camera and simply put EVERYTHING in the movie--even when it was completely irrelevant and you could care less about the characters!! So eventually it's saved when the birds FINALLY attack, right?! WRONG!!! The 'birds' are even more lame than stuffed birds on sticks or guys making shadow puppets of birds! You really have to see and hear them to believe 'em! When I say this is a horrible film, I mean that it is monumentally horrible. I am talking WORSE than \"Plan 9\", \"Rat Fink a Boo Boo\" and, believe it or not, worse than \"The Room\"!! Now that's bad!! Now considering that I am a fan of bad films and have reviewed well over 12,000 movies, when I say that this is the WORST film I have ever seen (yes, even worse than \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\") it means something!! Abysmal in every way...so bad you wonder if it was all some joke and never was intended as anything more! To quote Colonel Kurtz, \"The horror....\"!"

Finally I got a copy and sat down ready to laugh my ass off, instead I got bored, horribly horribly bored. Don't believe the hype people, this movie IS NOT so bad its good, its utter f*****g rubbish. For over half an hour of tedium I sat there as talentless actor gets in car, talentless actor gets out of car, talentless actor described his successful career in sales, talentless actor preaches enivronmentalism.... then i switched it off. No killer birds, no laughs and i was not at any point entertained this movie was just a complete waste of time and the money used to make this garbage could have been used to feed starving children. If you want a cheesy killer bird movie, watch Rene cardone Jr's Beaks (aka birds of prey) or if you want a great killer bird movie watch Hitchcock's classic the birds, just avoid this like the plague, watching it makes you stupid and the director makes uwe boll look talented."

With that said, I really hope they stick with the same formula for Birdemic 2 but improving upon it all, instead of trying to be like Piranha 3DD, where it's trying to be so deliberately bad that it just ends up terrible film that isn't funny. It's worth a watch to see it since it's so cute trying to be like a fully feature film, it's trying to do what it's trying to. You can find it on YouTube, full film and all, no joke."

        "review_detailed_main": "Waw, just wow. U know that feeling when you're having a conversation and then the conversation stops because you don't know anything more to talk about? That is pretty much the dialog for this movie. U can't call it dialog either, it's like 45 minutes of dead silence. This movie is so uncomfortable, it's more comfortable to watch your grandmother making out with a giant pink furry unicorn with a Justin Bieber face then watching this movie.\n\nThe problem with the acting is that it feels so unnatural. It's like you're watching a bunch of robots who are programmed to walk to this place, then do that. They don't give any motivations for their actions. If u would replace the main actor with a tree, i wouldn't notice it. My guess that they are taken from the p-business ( IMDb is forcing me to censor this word) .That would explain why the bed scene is the best scene in the entire movie.\n\nLet's talk about the plot: there is a guy and he earns a million dollars or something. He meets a random blond girl in a caf\u00e9 and he seduces-es her with a creepy smile. So they drive around and they visit her mother, they go to work and visit an Irish pub! Then suddenly........ a random singer sings for them. The bland guy dances the same for 5 minutes. Oh yeah there is something with birds too in the last part. And speeches about global warming , long LONG speeches from the most random people ( a tree-hugger?)\n\nThe plot and the characters are so stupid. Everybody who worked at this movie should be ashamed. The plot makes no sense and the writers , sorry the writer, who is also the director, probably also the editor, producer, sound editor and donut boy, was permanently high. The most random thing about the movie is that when the birds start attacking the main characters, they just go in a random house to see other random people. Then they start riding with their magic car. A car that randomly spawns stuff that they need. \"Oh look, it's a machine gun!\" \" It's a fishing rod!\" \" And there, a AK47\" \" Oh hey, Godzilla eggs here!\" \" OMG , a nuke\" OK maybe those last ones weren't true but if they indeed would happen i wouldn't be surprised.\n\nLet's talk about the biggest problem of the movie. U don't care about the story and neither do the characters and the writer. For example: children just had their parents killed, they don't care, they just want a happy meal? Somebody just died, OK they are sad for like three seconds and then it's OK again. They don't even censor the other cars. It's not an apocalypse when you see everybody driving around. ( maybe the birds learned to drive?) The filmmaker obviously didn't care to make a good movie so why should we care ?\n\nThis is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Everything about it is bad. The ending is terrible; it is all so bad. If i ever watch this movie again i will puke out birds everywhere. The movie's biggest enemy is not the birds but the director itself ( and the hungry kids).\n\n( Btw : in case u don't know, the special effects are really bad)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Almost impossible review as a commercial movies, \"Birdemic\" looks like a home-made project that somehow got a release. Everything about it screams UNPROFESSIONAL!!! From the very basic opening credits, which are in a hideous PC-average font, to the very long and static shots that start too early (before the actors are ready) and go on too long (after the action or conversations have ended), which show no understanding of cutting or editing. From the terrible muffled sound which varies with every camera angle, revealing that there microphone was on the camera and sometimes the background noise drowns out the dialogue, to the script and acting which makes you want to throw things (the lead guy walks like a drugged 5 year old, which is a shame as there are many long minutes of footage devoted to showing him just walking).\n\nAnd then we have to bird effects which look like a screen saver or a phone app. Stuck just on top of the filmed action we see looped animations of birds which can seemingly hover in one place flapping in slow motion.\n\nThe appalling plot sees our heroes spend 45 minutes doing normal everyday things like dating, meeting the parents, visiting restaurants and driving cars before anything happens. Once the bird attacks start, our gang of 4-6 \"survivors\" (apart from all the people strolling about that are not part of the film, and the endless traffic of other cars and trucks that are also not part of the film) seem to make a mad dash from the city (why is not explained) into the countryside (why that's safer is not explained), stopping regularly to buy gigantic bottles of water, armfuls of food and tanks full of petrol, only to somehow have to drink from streams and eat seaweed and a fish caught from the ocean only minutes later, when they can't be more than a few minutes stroll from another convenience store.\n\nYou need nerves of steel to be able to sit through this and call it entertainment. I can only assume this is a home movie. If it is, it must have been fun for the actors and their friends to watch once it was finished, but how actually got to be distributed and sold commercially is a total mystery."

There is the odd moment that is unintentionally funny about Birdemic: Shock and Terror, but much of it insults you in how incompetently done it all is. The worst movie ever? Might need to think on that one, but if not the worst ever it is easily down there as one of them. Whitney Moore is beautiful and cute, however that's all that halfway decent about Birdemic. It is a very cheaply made film, the constantly choppy editing and cheap shots make it very difficult to like or appreciate the scenery, and the special effects are some of the absolute worst of any movie of recent years. The dialogue is not just awkward sounding but also rambling and heavy-handed, while the story is let down by a very thin structure and interminably dull pacing(in particular the first half-hour is enough to bore the socks off of anybody). The birds feature later on, but they are lacking completely in presence or personality and their attacks are predictable, suspense-less and somewhat too silly also. The characters are completely unengaging, at no point is any effort made to make the audience care for any of them. And the acting is just terrible, Alan Bragh has no charisma whatsoever and looks very ill at ease, while Whitney Moore's beauty isn't enough to make up for her complete lack of acting talent. All in all, may have the so bad it's good factor for some, others will find it too shockingly terrible to enjoy it and the latter camp is where I fall in. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

The \"eagles\" and \"hawks\", and I use those terms loosely, look like they were stolen out of some 80's arcade video game. Their movement is one dimensional and have no other motion than to exist in the air with wings moving up and down. I have never known the eagles where I live to be able to hover in mid-air facing upward as if on a flag...very curious. --- Maybe I missed the part where someone was identified as an arms dealer, but suddenly the freaky eagles appear around the people and there are screams, \"ooooh,\" \"eeeewwww,\" \"ahhhh...,\" then someone has an idea. I swear I expected a light bulb to appear. The idea goes from thought to action...\"hey, we are under attack by killer one dimensional birds. Here, take this automatic weapon I just happen to have in the back seat and open fire.\" \"Oh yeah and use the thousand round magazine I have in the gun too!\" That is all I can stand to say about it. Oh wait, I just have to tell you to keep your eye out for those attack clothes hangers too. --- This is the first movie that I actually demanded a refund from Family Video over.

Birdemic is not so much a film, but more of a religious experience. Praise Jesus."

        "review_detailed_main": "Birdemic: Shock and Terror was released in 2010. I cannot believe it's taken seven years for this film to finally pop-up on my movie radar. If you've never seen Birdemic: Shock and Terror, do yourself a favor - don't wait as long as I did to catch it. It's a movie that has be seen to be believed. Words cannot do it justice. All at once, it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but one of the most fun. Film classes should use Birdemic: Shock and Terror to demonstrate how not to make a movie. Everything you think you've seen done poorly in a movie is most likely done worse here. It's a nightmare. Sound, lighting, cinematography, continuity, acting, and on and on are epically abysmal. It's like watching a slow-motion train-wreck. The two best (or worst, depending on how you look at it) examples of what I'm talking about are the dialogue and special effects. The dialogue sounds so completely unnatural. No one talks like this. It sounds like someone took a foreign language script and ran it through an online translator. And the way the actors deliver these ridiculous lines with a straight face is truly priceless. As for the special effects . . . well, there's really no way to describe them. My vocabulary doesn't include adjectives that can possibly paint a mental picture to adequately describe what's on-screen. You'll just have to watch it to see what I mean. Racking my brain, the only positive I can come up with is Whitney Moore as the female lead, Nathalie. She has more screen presence than the rest of the cast combined.\n\nAs bad as Birdemic: Shock and Terror is, it's still an absolute blast to watch. I can't remember ever having this much fun with a movie that is otherwise so Gawd awful. I laughed so hard at the birds exploding on impact that I had to stop the movie more than once. As I've said ad nauseam, I watch movies for entertainment. And boy was I ever entertained. The first half is a bit slow or I would have rated Birdemic: Shock and Terror even higher. I feel \"good\" about my 7/10 rating."

What about you? San Jose. I remember you now. You were in my English class. - I was? - Yeah, I sat two seats behind you. - You remember that far? - Yeah. So what do you do? I'm a fashion model. And a beautiful one too. Thanks. Well, it was nice talking to you. But I should really get going. I've got an audition for a modeling job. So it was good talking to you. Same here. Nathalie. Oh, hi again. I was wondering if we can keep in contact. Sure. Here's my card. - Here's mine. - Thanks. Again, it was nice talking to you. - I'll see you later. - Bye. This morning flocks of seagulls and crows were found dead in downtown San Jose and along highway 101. The crows and seagulls also caused an accident on highway 101 near the 1st street exit. Authorities are investigating the cause of their death. In other news today, the population of polar bears is declining rapidly due to the melting of sea ice in the arctic. As the sea ice melts, the polar bears are forced to move farther north. Although some have survived, many have died from starvation due to the difficulty of finding enough food such as seals. What does it take to win your business today? Okay, I'll give you that and a 50% discount. Can we close the deal today? Can I place your order today? Great, thanks. We appreciate your business. Hey, what's with all the noise? Caught the big fish. Yeah? How big was the sale? $1 million. - Awesome, man. - Biggest sale of my career. I'm proud of you. Nathalie? Hey, Christine. What's up? I have great news for you. Victoria's Secret wants you to become their cover girl model. You're kidding. No no, it's the real deal. That's great. Yeah, of course I'll do it. Thanks for getting me the gig. You are welcome. You worked very hard. So here's your chance to impress them. Congratulations again. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Thank you again. All right. Okay, bye, Christine. Thanks. Okay. - Hello? - Nathalie? Who is this? It's Rod."

The first word that was said in this movie pretty much told me what i was in for. At the beginning of this movie I was excited to see a really crappy movie and make me laugh hard. I was terribly wrong. By the first hour I just wanted the movie to end.\n\nNot only the audio was the worst I have ever heard, the editing was a joke, the lighting was awful but besides all that it was terribly boring the first about 30-40 minutes. What i was hoping to see was birds attacking people for the whole movie in really ridiculous ways but in the first 30-40 minutes the movie was just a day and the life of a really average and boring guy. The character's acting didn't help at all either.\n\nNot only was the character boring but I feel like the film could have been only 30 minutes long if there weren't so many shots of useless and pointless shots, mainly of them main character driving! It was just shot after shot of a car entering and leaving a shot.\n\nThe worst part of this movie is the audio. The audio was is the most noticeable part of the movie. There are times when the person isn't talking but they are still talking, ambient sound volume was being changed every other second. It was as if sound mixer brought up audio only when a character was talking then brought the sound back down when they finished.\n\nThe final verdict is that if you are someone that love to laugh at bad movies this might not be for you because its just way to bad, but if you have to watch it then watch it with a ton of people and make jokes during the movie. You will not believe how bad this movie is. Oh and one more thing, prepare for some really lame social commentary over global warming."

I goggled \"imdb bottom rated movies\" and rest will be forever remembered as the day that a 1.8/10 IMDb movie made us soil our pants laughing.\n\nWe literally laughed the entire movie. Every thing in this movie is of kindergarten quality, CGI reminds me of Microsoft Powerpoint presentations i use to make in my grade school days. The audio is sickening and half of the movie you cant hear jack squat because a boom Mic was out of the budget apparently. Everything was just eye-gouging, suicide inducing awful.\n\nWE LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT, in fact we watched the second movie immediately after the first one, and it was just as hilarious.\n\nPlease watch this movie. get as high as possible if you can...thank me later."

        "review_detailed_main": "This seeming tribute to Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" is a classic example of what happens when someone with a lot of enthusiasm, but absolutely no talent or film craft (or money) tries to make a movie. It's bad in a way even Ed Wood or Jerry Warren are not; Wood because his love of his dreck somehow shines through in every frame he shoots; and Warren because Warren at least includes lots of stock footage from other, competent films in his concoctions. \"Birdemic\" evinces neither passion or competence - it just borks along long like a piece of outsider art made by someone who saw a movie once and took notes, but then lost the notes and just winged it. (Hah! See what I did there?That lame pun is STILL better than any of the writing or dialog you'll find in \"Birdemic\".)\n\nIt's worth watching once just to laugh at the ludicrous special effects and the amateur hour acting. I have seen dozens of low budget science fiction and horror films in the last 40 years, and I have never seen worse examples of either. Seriously, the bird effects look like the product of a talented seventh grader, and I can't believe anyone over the age of six could convince themselves that what appeared on the screen was acceptable. The director would have been better off grabbing stock footage of bird attacks from nature documentaries and alternating them with footage of the actors (and I use the term advisedly) reacting to them, like the old Tarzan and Jungle Jim movies. And he would have been better off raiding the local high school and community college drama departments for his cast. Nothing against the actual cast members, who were probably just regular folks trying something different, but Lord, they're awful. Reasonably photogenic, (especially the heroine),but awful.\n\nThe one good thing about Birdemic is that it tries to be about something, and it means well. It's dumb and clueless, but it isn't sleazy or creepy, and it doesn't seem to have been made in the spirit of an exploitation movie.\n\nTwo stars, because I'm feeling generous today."

The acting is almost as bad as the animation, we won't even talk about it. And the first 50 min. of the film has absolutely no point and doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the film. I've made better films with 3 kid actors, Nerf guns, and a $30 video camera in my back yard... and I have proof.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen some really bad movies during my time, but I have to say this one most certainly has some of the worst acting and line reading of any of them. Manos: Hands of Fate actually has way better acting than this thing did. Forget the effects, bad effects can be forgiven; however, when your lead guy sounds like he's autistic and walks in a manner no human being does, that cannot be forgiven. Seriously, how hard is it to walk like a human being?!? You should be doing it all the time! The film also features more parking and pulling out than a whole driving classes video collection!\n\nThe story, well, lets just say it starts out slowly. Super slowly, I mean, the first half of this movie is just watching the lead guy courting the lead girl and going on dates and such. I am being totally serious...you watch them go on dates with the only things hinting at the Birdemic are a couple of newscasts about global warming and a dead bird at a beach. Then after the couple have sex, which we do get to see the lead girl who is cute in her bra and panties, wham, we have birds attacking. No gradual buildup or anything, no the birds are on the attack and hovering at windows screeching. The rest of the film is the hero and his girlfriend stopping every so often to give the birds a chance to attack them again.\n\nI am not sure if this movie was made in all seriousness, I almost think it has to have been made as a joke. Once again, the acting is atrocious, the only actor in the film that seems like a fourth rate actor is the main girl. She could be in a horror movie of higher quality, but that isn't too much of a compliment because there is only up to go from this atrocity! The film also keeps getting heavy handed with environmental messages, but coming from this film makes me want to go out and buy the largest gas guzzling machine possible to drive!\n\nSo, this film is bad, if it was made as some sort of joke I do not know, but I hope so because I can most certainly make a better film even for the paltry 10,000 this film apparently cost. The film starts out as a bad romance and turns into bad nature attack flick about halfway through, but the parking and driving are all throughout the film! It is sad that the only thing good in this film was the lead girl's camel toe!"

The sound comes and goes from time to time, the picture quality is good, not much for horror scenes, and the birds when they attack looks so fake; like a video game.\n\nWe have seen our share of bad movies but, this one takes the cake; I would not recommend this movie at all unless the person is that bored and willing to watch this kind of cheesy class b movie.\n\nI have noticed that there is supposed to be a part 2 to this movie; I don't think I will be renting it, it's supposed to be in 3D too but, if it's as bad as this one; forget it, I won't waste my money or time.\n\nThis is more of a made for TV movie, but I wouldn't recommend this for TV either; I don't know what they were thinking when they did this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Birdemic has all the requisite components that make up a delightfully bad movie: bad acting, bad dialog, plot holes, bizarre directorial and script decisions, and extreme awkwardness. For an outbreak of killer birds, everybody seems so resolutely casual about this aviary apocalypse. There is no sense of urgency or danger; characters will stroll in their walks and frequently make outdoor pit stops. One female character is killed after she wanders needlessly far from the safety of the van to pee. They didn't decide that an indoor bathroom would be safer? The gang also decides to wander through a crowded forest, a habitat that might, you know, attract birds. Then there's the careless frolic on the beach, again needlessly far from the refuge of the van. Rod is held up by one motorist for gas (yes, society has broken down that far in hours, and yet you can watch hundreds of cars pass along the other half of the road, foolishly driving toward the birdemic and their doom). But then Rod leaves behind the full gas container and hops back into the van, escaping a not so imminent bird attack. They keep venturing to outdoor areas to escape an enemy that utilizes the sky. They even have a picnic! In short, these people are dumb.\n\nNow comes the inevitable, and somewhat subjective part, where the critic must place Birdemic upon the scale of Absolute Awful ranging worst of the worst (Manos: The Hands of Fate) to the best of the worst (The Room). The people behind Birdemic are trying to streamline the cult phenom process. It premiered in New York City in early 2010 and is already being funneled to many markets. It all feels a little too manufactured for my tastes, like the media is so eager to be ahead of the hipster curve. Birdemic is a perfectly enjoyable, laugh-out-loud experience best had with a bunch of your friends and perhaps some adult beverages. It's a fine piece of derisive entertainment thanks to the sincerity of Nguyen. But in the world of bad, The Room still reigns supreme. Whereas Birdemic has plenty of bad housed in 90 minutes, it's pretty much the same bad decisions and limitations. I look forward to Nguyen's next film, Peephole: The Perverted. You just can't go wrong when a movie has a subtitle, \"The Perverted.\" He may not be Tommy Wiseau, but this man knows how to make some tasty trash."

It's littered with painful dialogue such as \"I'm getting a hybrid car\", and a whole scene of the protagonist purchasing some solar panels. It's also painfully annoying, with the same 20 seconds of music played on a loop and just 2 sound effects for the birds. No editing where sound is concerned makes for a film that's hard to understand at times, as dialogue is swamped by background noise. Not funny, not exciting, not creative, just terrible. Pure shite!"

Two people manage to fight back, but will they survive Birdemic?\n\nWhere to begin on this one? The acting (and I use the word \"acting\" loosely) is among the worst I have ever seen, the computer-generated birds are not even plausibly real, and why is there a \"minivan militia\" that drives around with assault rifles for just such an emergency?\n\nThis film makes \"The Room\" look like \"Shawshank Redemption\", but it is really hard to rate. On its merits, it clearly deserves the lowest possible rating (and it is no surprise this has achieved the honor of being on the IMDb Bottom 100). However, much like \"The Room\", it is thoroughly entertaining in its badness. Watching this in a theater full of hecklers and you could have the time of your life. Yet, it even stops being funny in the third act.\n\nThe film has been described as \"Birds\" meets \"An Inconvenient Truth\" (both for very obvious reasons). I am confused by the environmental message... they go beyond the \"pounding it into our heads\" stage -- polar bears, tree-huggers, John Lennon references, solar panels... it is more annoying than anything else."

        "review_detailed_main": "I couldn't stop talking about this movie for at least an hour after seeing it with 6 of my friends. There's a quality that the movie has that made me laugh uproariously at how awkward the entire movie was. My friend and I were in tears, and we kept cheering for the actors throughout the movie.\n\nThat being said, the movie is notoriously bad. The special FX birds and gore were an afterthought, the sound was either muddled or rerecorded ADR in a studio with different actors, some of the shots went on for way too long, the direction of the actors was jarring and made the characters feel creepy towards each other, the plot is an abomination, and every step these characters take, you're screaming at them as the audience, \"what are you doing?!\" The main blonde actress has been interviewed about the film where she explained that the director would often run out of money and call them back to shoot scenes randomly.\n\nI had a great time watching it, though. My 5-stars I'm giving this goes towards the quality of the experience watching the movie. It's not a good movie, but it's a great cult movie with a misguided, heartfelt message that only the director can understand. And that's fine. Lost Highway and El Topo were confusing to me, yet those movies remain cult classics. Maybe it's the fact we were watching a couple older John Waters films beforehand, but EVERYONE who has streaming video and is on the internet today in 2012 has had to have at least heard the legend this movie has behind it. I think it's worth upgrading the stars on the film to get more of a reputation for how insane this movie is instead of focussing on the lowered quality of the production."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1963 Alfred Hitchcock made his cult movie 'The Birds'; in 2010 James Nguyen took the concept to a whole new level. Birdemic is currently the sixth worst movie on the IMDb \"Bottom 100 movies\" list, which is still pretty low. It might just be the worst, most boring movie about killer birds and ecology ever made.\n\nRod (Alan Bagh) is a successful software salesman who has just started dating Nathalie (Whitney Moore), a Victoria's Secret model. As it usually happens in movies, their perfect lives are suddenly threatened by, in this case, killer birds that, interestingly, start attacking them after they've spent their first night together.\n\nThis movie is so bad it isn't even funny. It begins with endless scenes of Rod driving around town and moves onto horribly edited phone call scenes. If you skip the first hour, you're guaranteed not to miss anything except a really bad and boring introduction to the story. I can't understand why was Alan Bagh chosen to play the lead since he is clearly the worst actor of all and even a tree could have done a better job than he did. Whitney Moore, on the other hand, seems to be constantly embarrassed and therefore can't stop smiling.\n\nThe occasionally awkward dialogue is also worth mentioning: the scene in which Rod says that Becky \"is taking a s**t. Nathalie is watching her back.\" is certainly going to be remembered as a screen writing masterpiece. But the Oscar goes to Yeung Chang's visual effects, if you dare call them that. He would have done a better job using Microsoft Paint.\n\nThe music is awful, too. But it's not as relevant as the message of this movie: Nguyen saw 'An inconvenient truth' and thought it would be a good idea to make global warming the cause of the birds' madness, turning this movie into a bad horror with elements of ecological propaganda that nobody cares about. It actually makes you want to go and burn down a forest, just to make Nguyen sad. Which leads us to the obvious conclusion that everything in this movie is awful.\n\nRating: 1/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"

After seeing a number of flicks making fun of this film I decided to see the whole thing & I truly regret it.\n\nThe Acting was awful, the lead character's only attribute seems to be the ability to stare at his crush and exclaim stupid lines with a bored face.\n\nThe directing was just as bad, pretty much nothing in Birdemic makes any sense what-so-ever and even saying that is a complement.\n\nThe special affects were truly abysmal. In fact the original classic the birds despite being mad many, many years before still has birds that are a trillion times more realistic that the trash in this film (and no that wasn't an exaggeration) They probably would have been better off using kindergarten drawings of chickens than what they used in the film.\n\nNo matter how unbelievably bad that was, the editing was the worst part of all. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't have an editor at all and just used every second of footage they shot. Endless boring scene takes place after endless boring scene, half this movie is the main character driving around in his car! The sound is just as bad, I've seen and heard better from 0$ budget High School films than this.\n\nThis movie is unbearably awful and boring, it's not like the room for example which is so bad it entertaining, this is just plain stupid. The Director Nguyen should never be allowed to make another movie, and although the film tries to use the noble themes of humanities dependence on fossil fuel and the need to save nature, nothing can save this. This movie is rightly considered one of the worst of all time, and my advise is to avoid it."

(They couldn't afford, or didn't have any friends that could make for an appealing, watchable gig on screen. Not even some local guy from an amateur play or standup show that turned out pretty good. No one.).\n\nOK wait: to be honest, Whitney Moore (the pretty girl that appears in the film) does have a natural on screen presence, and given some worthwhile dialog, could be described as \"an actress\". No-one else in this film earns such a description.\n\nBUT WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?? I hear you ask. UM, a guy that's come into some money via a stock option following his tech companies upscale takes a pretty girl he used to know in high school on a date. Not long after, giant deadly \"birds\" attack from above, murdering random people, making \"Birdemic\" something of an entry in the \"zombie apocalypse/dystopia\" genre.\n\nExcept not really, because there's only about 22 birds in the air in the entire film. It's initially hilarious because the visual effects appear to have been done by a fourteen year old with an intellectual disability on some very outmoded Adobe software. The ineptness of director Nguyen's ability to get depth in a shot, continuity or an error-free soundtrack is overwhelmingly apparent throughout.\n\nIn hindsight, some of the absurdity of the film might strike viewers as funny, but wading through ninety minutes to appraise how bad it was isn't really cooking my boat. Seriously, this is the 2010's and people make 1.40 YouTube clips with more hilarity than this entire production.\n\nI have one caveat for this film: in two places, random characters that don't fit into the story appear to deliver bulky, unwieldy bits of dialogue concerning sustainability, ecosystems and the threat of global warming. This alone doesn't really save the picture from being 90% terrible filler and generally an embarrassment.\n\nSome people think failure is inherently hilarious. Such people are referred to as \"dorks\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a pretty big fan of bad movies and consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur. While this has the hallmark of a lot of bad movies, it's not really that great of a bad movie. When it comes to cinematography, the movie is terrible. The movie is also awful when it comes to pacing. This sometimes leads to amazing scenes, but in this movie, the slow pacing is actually quite boring. Combined with boring dialog this movie misses some of the things that make other bad movies great. Compared to Samurai Cop, for example, there are no crazy lines or monologues like the \"I'm telling these son-of-a-bitches...\". There are some great scenes in Birdemic, like the choppy applause scene, but I got more bored while watching this movie than many other bad movies. It can be fun to watch, but its glaring errors aren't as funny as comparable movies."

The lines are delivered flat and lifeless that a text to speech program from the '70s would have improved things. They've been pieced together that its painful to listen to every conversation. All the special effects compositions are so very wrong and sound effects too they draw attention to how they dont fit at all in any respect.\n\nIts clear not even students were involved as zero skills have been used anywhere in the making of this movie, even if it had been made fifty years earlier its just garbage garbage garbage. I'd guess someone pirated a lot of software and decided to call themselves a movie director much like facebook idiots call themselves photographers because they bought a cheap DSLR or paid $2 for a photo filter app in their phone.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well I just watched the RiffTrax version of the movie and still wanted to bash my brains out with a 2x4 full of rusty nails. Mostly due to the fact that this movie could be used as a torture device for any human being that is a fan of the cinematic art form known as moving pictures. Their are some movies so god awful that they are fun to watch I.E. Sharknado and The Happening. The main difference between those pieces of dog sh*t and this piece of dog sh*t is that this movie thinks its being artsy and delivering a brilliant subtle world altering message while assuming that the audience has the intelligence level of the week old splooge inside the jeans of a ten year old boy tragically born with fetal alcohol syndrome. The movie proves how dumb it believes its audience to be by making all of Rod's business deals with NTC software end in nice even round numbers like 1 million dollars and 1 billion dollars. Then he creates a company in a week and its immediately financed by the dumbest and or laziest venture capitalist group in the world for a nice even 10 million dollars. Then when literally out of nowhere the Birdemic hits for no plausible reason whatsoever the movie starts bashing us over the head with global warming propaganda that was written by that same ten year old with fetal alcohol syndrome I mentioned earlier. This movie was made slightly bearable by the guys at RiffTrax because at least they made me laugh but this movie has made me hate people named Rod and if ever a Victoria Secret cover model walks up to me I'm running away in fear and immediately relapsing on a lethal dose of Heroin you know just in case she even slightly reminds me of this waste of 1.3 GB that the servers of the world will never get back! Oh and yeah forgot to mention that Rod's girlfriend for the movie is a Victoria Secret cover model because we wouldn't know she was a hot soulless mouth breathing waste of oxygen unless the movie told us she was a model! P.S. I'm also an Afghanistan veteran and they manage to throw a why can't we all just get along line from an marine and Iraqi war veteran which is the only realistic part of the movie Army rules Marine Corp. drools na ni na ni boo boo!

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm convinced the people who say this movie is \"The best worst movie ever!\" haven't actually SEEN the whole thing, and are only commenting on abridged versions from YouTube clips. This things kinda a bore.\n\nDon't get me wrong. There ARE some (unintentionally) hilarious parts (mostly when our \"heroes\" get attacked by a particularly vengeful Playstation game...er I mean \"birds\") However the GCI atrocities don't even show up until the movies halfway point and only pop up occasionally afterwords. Like many other bad movies, this has massive pacing problems making the film a very dull slog.\n\nSo what do we get while we're waiting for the Winged Clip-Art of Doom to strike? We get an ENDLESS supply of driving and parking scenes that, if cut, would render the remaining footage about 15 minutes long. (And bad driving scenes to boot. These have all the thrill of Driving Miss Daisy, even AFTER the squawking GIFs start attacking.) And then about 13 of THOSE minutes is filled with pointless character after pointless character filibustering about global warming or some environmentalist issue told in that oh-so exciting \"Guess-what-I-copied-directly-from- Wikipedia-without-actually-reading?\" tone of voice. I kept waiting for Captain Planet and the Ferngully fairy to show up and rant about how unsubtle it all is. For the lover in you we even get a turgid \"romance\" between two pieces of plywood...er our heroes (You'll never look at a pumpkin festive the same again.)\n\nBut like I said there are SOME amusing moments to dull the pain, if you like seeing marble-mouthed dull-witted leading man who walk with the limber gait of the Frankenstein monster, plenty of flubbed lines that show that the word \"retake\" is not in directors vocabulary, the most jaded assemble of extras ever (a Birdemic is no reasons traffic in the background can't proceed as normal, right?), inept salesmen who CHEER when they lose one million dollars on a sale, and of course site of our no-talent cast pretending to interact with special (ed?) effects eagles that would look poorly rendered on a circa-1997 Geocities website. But those are just an oasis of hilarious ineptitude in a painfully dull sea of padding. Maybe it's easier to deal with as a group or \"audience\" to share the misery, but otherwise this is slow, plodding mess."

I'm not joking. 2. The sound. The beginning of the movie sums it all up for you. 3. The introduction. It's longer than the amount of rope you need to fill up an entire planet. And it's boring, too. 4. This cost MONEY. Even if it did cost money, it wouldn't cost 20K. It would at least cost about 3 dollars and a couple Chuck-E-Cheese tokens. 5. The movie constantly tries to tell you about global warming. We wanted to see birds (wait, after we saw those birds, no we don't), can we get birds for god's sake? 6. This costs money to buy. This should just be one of those things you find on a video website after searching deep enough. To say the least, a GoAnimate project is better than this movie."

Whilst I don't want to seem to be mocking Birdemic, poor eggsecution makes this aviary hard film to swallow.\n\nThe dialogue throughout is hawkward, and at times it feels like they are winging it. The cheep special effects are reminiscent of NES classic Duck Hunt, and although they quacked me up they are far from pheasant. The soundtrack is peckuliar at best, and largely consists of long stretches of silence - a cardinal sin sure to ruffle some feathers. Heron there you see glimmers of talont from the young starlings but certainly nothing worth tweeting about.\n\nMigratest suggestion is to sparrow few hours to experience Birdemic with friends, beakause you're sure to have a hoot. At times watching feels like a birden, but endure and you won't egret it. Owl call it one of the greatest trash films I've feather seen."

After the final cut was complete and James Nguyen had finished watching it, he had to say: \"This is great, we nailed it!\"\n\nAs a film fan, I have seen a lot of bad movies, now I can say, I have seen the worst movie ever made. This is a movie all true movie fans should watch and then hand the DVD to a friend and say \"I dare you.\"\n\nA brief rundown as to why it is so bad; The acting, I am fairly certain that Alan Bagh got the part because he actually owned the Mustang and they needed a nice car. I definitely was not because of his acting chops. The editing, a high schooler with iMovie could do a better job, even in 2010. The timing, mom's thumbs up that lasts just two beats too long, making it awkward, was painful. The heavy handed message delivery, why not make everyone just carry signs, \"Global Warming is bad!\" Finally, the birds. It starts with the parrots, in San Francisco, and it just goes down hill from there.\n\nIf you have time to kill, and like bad movies, this one does not disappoint, except on every level.

Birdemic has redefined human accomplishment; redefined it so thoroughly that I feel a slight sense of disappointment whenever I'm watching something that is not Birdemic. I would pay anything to recapture the feeling I had when I watched this movie for the first time. It's indescribable.\n\nThe main character, Rod (Alan Bagh), is a computer guy who falls in love while saving the world. The viewer gets a sense of every part of Rod's life, from the nuances and specifics of his computer job to the wild, romantic passions coursing through his veins, to the desperate urgency that only comes when the fate of humanity rests on your shoulders. Every syllable of Rod's dialogue is another perfect note in the melody of this national treasure, written crisp and sharp, delivered with gravitas and precise comedic timing. The fact that Bagh has not received some kind of recognition for his performance speaks volumes about the snobbery and despicable self-congratulatory nature of the various modern film academies.\n\nThe plot is beautifully conceived and executed. Exploding acid birds are attacking humanity because they don't like cars, and Rod happens to be in the position to stop the madness because he meets a wise scientist who understands what's going on. Look, the specifics aren't that important. What's important is that the plot makes a lot more sense -- more sense, in fact, than any movie I've ever seen. There is not a single plot hole or inconsistency to be found.\n\nThe cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and the animation puts Hollywood blockbusters to shame. The movie conveys its thoughts on such topics as environmentalism, corporatism, relationships, human connection, and knowledge with a poignant elegance that is almost shocking. The film made me laugh, it made me cry, it made my skin crawl, it made me feel emotions I've never felt before, emotions I never knew I even had.\n\nEvery human being, regardless of circumstance, needs to watch this movie."

The only good things about this \"film\" were seeing locations that I recognized, and seeing a few attractive actresses in bikinis. Thank God they didn't do any nude scenes. These poor young ladies would have lost chunks of their souls had they exposed themselves for the sake of absolutely the worst cinematic creation possible. Watching it made me ashamed to be human. I knew Birdemic would be bad, but I thought it might be fun to watch a cheesy horror film. It wasn't. And I know you will think that what I'm about to write next is an exaggeration, but I swear to you it is not: I recently got a molar pulled in the dentist's office, and this experience was far more enjoyable and far less painful than watching Birdemic.

        "review_detailed_main": "Anyone who watches Birdemic will most likely feel completely baffled by its existence. They will wonder who made this and why? Most importantly they will wonder if anyone working on this movie even tried. Birdemic has so many problems it makes the audience wonder if it is a joke. The laughably unrealistic special effects piled upon the underdeveloped plot and stiff acting makes the movie hilariously unrealistic and seems more like a comedy than the horror movie the director, James Nguyan, intended. The plot is basically that of The Birds. Birds go crazy and attack people for no apparent reason, except they are mad at people for not being environmental and something with bird flu. When they attack people they do so by shrieking while making a plane sound, and suicidally crashing into things, such as houses and gas stations, and exploding. The birds do not actually show up until about half way though the movie, and so many things never get explained. Birdemic starts with the main character Rod (Alan Bagh) driving. It shows him driving for almost 5 minutes, and every other little boring detail from his life, like filling his car with gas. He eventually meets up with an old classmate from high school, Nathalie (Whitney Moore), who turns out to now be a model. He then creepy follows her as she leaves the restraint but she agrees to go out with him any ways. Alan Bagh acts as stiff as a sim, like from The Sims 2, as he reacts very robotically to everything, like the way he walks and the way his face appears so stiff and blank all the time. Whitney Moore's acting is average but there is a point where she must have realized how ridiculous the whole movie seemed because at one point when everyone is trying to fend off the birds you can see how hard she is trying to not smile or laugh. The special effects might be the worst part in the movie. The birds do not even appear a little realistic. When on screen they stay in the same spot, squawking and occasionally flapping their wings, and then when the camera moves the birds move as though they are stickers stuck to the same spot on the lens. When the movie shows fire it looks like a fire started on the film instead of the intended target burning. The camera work is poorly done. In the beginning while Rod drives the camera records at a sideways angle. The film and sound editing in the movie is terrible too. The first line spoken in the movie is where the first problem appears. It is a simply a waitress saying \"hi\" but it does not meet up with her talking and there is static audible in the background. With the film editing, multiple times the film will randomly jump skipping a few lines of dialogue. Overall this movie does not have many, if anything, good in it. I do not know they made it. Honestly I wonder if they realized how bad the movie was when they were making it. The only reason I think anyone should, could, or would watch this movie is to enjoy how delightedly terrible bad this movie is in every aspect."

So here are the steps: 1st: get some friends, they're essential to the understanding of this monumental work of a mind so advanced we can't understand it yet. 2nd: Get as drunk as you possibly can, this way you will be able to get passed the first 2 seconds 3rd: watch your friends slowly starting to hate you as the movie goes on. and that's about it."

They seem to be afraid of something, something deeply inside them, so they need to control their emotions. 3. Distribution of the lengths of the scenes. I did believe that most of the scenes in a movie are somehow important, at least they give the viewer some sort of information. But in this movie, my knowledge did not apply and I tried my best to figure out what is the information behind the scenes. However, I totally failed. Well I must not think further.

Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.\n\nI didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like Bird-attack movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking Birdemic out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.\n\nThe allusions to real-life are both subtle and prophetic. Non-stop action combines with stunning special effects to portray the inherent struggle that humans face against killer eagles and vultures around the world on a daily basis; this film might just be the inspiration needed for governments to tackle this global problem.\n\nBirdemic and Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that the Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Birdemic to touch the soul."

I did, which is why I'm giving it three stars instead of one. I don't regret watching the movie, but I don't see myself wanting to watch it again.\n\nThe birds are the same two poorly animated models (an eagle and a sea gull), they flap around making the same annoying sound, the guns are obviously air soft guns, the birds only have about 2-3 dying animations. The dialogue is painfully bad. I question whether it was done and shot purposely like that in an attempt to be humorous.\n\nThere also may be an underlining message that global warming may be a serious concern to our planet, but the movie was too stupid for me to actually care."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I went into this expecting some all-out \"so bad it's good\" charm, but holy crap! Children can make better films than this! The story is abysmal. It spends nearly forty minutes on the lamest and most un-dynamic love story ever filmed. When the \"birdemic\" finally hits, there's no good reasoning or explanation for anything (and certainly no explanation for why all the birds leave at the end). It's all blamed on global warming. Yep, then the film goes on to shove global warming into the audience's faces at every turn. Because, apparently, it will cause birds to freak out and turn into GIF files that zoom along with airplane sound effects and can spontaneously combust.\n\nThe actual bird attack is the lamest thing ever committed to film. The birds are so cheap, and they tend to hover in place and incessantly repeat the same stock sound effects over and over again. They go on to dive-bomb everything and explode in cheap-looking explosions.\n\nActing? Terrible across the board. Writing? Just as terrible. Production? This film was probably made with pocket change. Filming? So very pedestrian. Sound quality? My God, the sound was the worst. It kept cutting in and out, with dialogue and sound getting cut off randomly. At first, I thought the disc was screwed up.\n\nThere are some scenes that go on for far too long. The beginning credits are a hoot; it's like five minutes of nonstop driving and driving and driving, with the same music looping two or three times. Same goes for the film's final shots.\n\nThere's easily a thousand other things wrong with this picture. You can laugh at it. You can pick it apart and pour all your hatred into it. You can get bored and walk away. For the most part, the former applies the best, so long as you are open to such bad cinema and can find enough good humor to take this film as it is. It's certainly up there on the \"so bad it's good\" meter, and would likely supersede most of the films shown on the SyFy channel (take that, Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus!).\n\n1.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Awful | Film: Awful)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The director starts with a long travelling shot, and we automatically add Kubrick to Hitchcock as directors the person behind this obviously aspires to.\n\nThe first scene shows exactly how far from that he is as he fails to a) get his actor walking like a believable human being, or b) manage 2 seconds of a tracking shot on him without the camera clunkily jumping along.\n\nThat said, visually the film isn't too bad, we get some very artistic and picturesque shots, let down a bit by lingering shots on cars, women, sandwiches and whatever else the director likes.\n\nThe sound and editing is awful, cutting between shots with completely different levels of volume and ambience. I thought it was bad during the early conversations, but the boardroom and then on the beach it got progressively worse, and at times the dialogue is even drowned out.\n\nEverything is super heavy handed, ranging from the constant environmental/anti-war messages to via news reports and dropped into conversations, as well as frequent comments about of money - A hundred dollar fuel, a twenty thousand dollar solar panel, a million dollar contract, a 10 million dollar investment, a billion dollar takeover! I have to say though these both got funnier throughout.\n\nI takes over 45 minutes to get to the actual birdemic, and the CGI is the next level bad you're expecting (maybe hoping for) by that stage of the film. The scene where they fight them off with coat hangers is one of my personal highlights of the film, along with pretty much every death scene.\n\nI will give credit to the female lead, she has a bit of charm, and I find her daily activities of walking, cutting food etc. as believable as her being a model. Beyond that the extras are largely better than the main cast. The young girl in particular has clearly never acted before.\n\nI won't go into more specifics or spoilers as you really need to watch it and be as shocked and entertained as I was. Right, I'm off to watch the sequel!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I first heard about this movie from my nephew, who told me it was so terrible that I just had to see it. As a fan of bad movies, all I can say is that I wish MST3K were still around so they could lampoon it. Yes, this one is one of the best of the worst movies ever, and should rank right up there with Plan 9 or Manos: Hands of Fate. If you like to watch bad movies, you've got to see Birdemic. It's so horribly bad it's actually got to be seen to be believed. I know that a lot of people call this or that movie \"the worst movie ever made,\" but in this case I have to say that this is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen.\n\nFirst I'll discuss the \"plot.\" Apparently global warming is so bad it makes birds in southern California attack people, even conducting kamikaze attacks against buildings and gas pumps (complete with aircraft sound effects!). Global warming must be really bad when dive-bombing birds explode into flame. Just how hot is it, anyway? And the plot holes are so huge it's a wonder all the actors don't just fall into them. For example, one moment the group in the van is running away and shooting at killer birds, the next minute they're out having a picnic at a state park. The heroine smiling at different points in the movie after the bird attacks. Kids playing with a ball and having a good time while they're on the run from killer birds (and after their parents were killed by same).\n\nThe first 45 minutes or so of this \"movie\" center around the hero, Rod, who finds the woman of his dreams, Nathalie, and starts to develop a relationship with her. For some unknown reason, she is totally attracted to his lack of personality, and they begin a no-conflict relationship. In fact, even Nathalie's mother is totally supportive of her modeling career, even happy that she's going to appear on the cover of a Victoria's Secret catalog. Everything's going great. Rod and Nathalie have an intimate moment in a hotel, and wake up the next morning when the birds start attacking. They find another couple in the hotel who just happen to have a van full of automatic weapons (which is never explained except later that the guy was an ex-Marine), so they go around shooting the birds and trying to help people. The ending is just as confusing as the premise of the movie, with Rod's girlfriend asking a question that starts with \"Why?\" which I half expected her to finish \"did I take this role in this cheesy movie?\" Or perhaps, \"Why was this movie even made?\"\n\nOK, let's talk about why the movie is so incredibly bad. The plot, for one. Secondly, the editing is incredibly amateurish. You could drive a Mack truck through some of the cues. The opening camera shots from the front seat of a car were all tilted so that it looked like they were driving on the side of a mountain. In fact, most internal car shots were slanted like this for some reason. Couldn't they find a cameraman who could hold a camera upright? When characters are talking to each other on the phone, the scene constantly switches back & forth between each character as they give their one or two word replies, which became annoying.\n\nThe quality of the filming is extremely poor. Poor lighting left some actors entirely in the dark on a few occasions. The sound quality was horrendous, dropping out completely at times, and you couldn't hear the actors speaking while on the beach because of the loud ocean sounds. The background music was terrible, and in some spots where there should have been music there was none.\n\nThen, you have to take into account the incredibly horrendous acting from just about everyone in the movie. The lead character walks like he's got a stick up his butt. Which isn't surprising, because all the acting is so stiff and wooden they couldn't have done worse than replacing the actors with department store mannequins. In fact, the extras seem to be the best actors in the entire movie, whether just walking into a building or laying around dead. Watch the scene early in the movie where Mr. Stick-butt is walking into the building, and then contrast that with how naturally the extras are walking.\n\nAnd the piece de resistance is the incredibly cheesy special effects birds in the form of what appears to be animated GIFs added to the video post filming. It reminded me of viewing a Geocities website back in 1999. In fact the cheesy CGI was probably the funniest thing in the whole movie, especially when some of the birds dive-bombed and then fell over dead. When the actors were shooting the birds down, it took me back to playing Duck Hunt on the Nintendo back in 1990, though the birds in Duck Hunt at least flew around instead of hovering in one spot while flapping their wings. They couldn't even put together fake bird props for the dead birds, but had still .gif images of birds laying on the ground.\n\nI was tempted to give this movie 2 stars instead of just one because this movie was so incredibly bad it made me laugh. But I rate movies on their own merits here, so it has to be only 1 star. But I do recommend it for the hilarity factor. At the time of this writing, the entire full length movie is available on Youtube, so I recommend seeing it there instead of renting or buying it. If you don't want to sit through the whole thing, watch the trailer or see the video showing the \"best\" action scenes from the movie.\n\nI understand they've made a Birdemic 2. I can't imagine why."

Not until half way through the movie does any action start. And when it does, you'll wish it hadn't. It's horrible and indescribable. Before you decide to watch this movie try to watch a clip on youtube or something just so you know what you're getting into. One last thing; the propaganda. This whole movie is some stupid preachy attempt to make people go green. A noble cause. But the stupidity of this movie made me resent the idea just because of how awfully it is portrayed. Long story short; DO NOT WATCH. Huge waste of time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am simply amazed at how horrendous this movie is. It has hands down, the worst CGI I have ever seen in my entire life. It might have been tolerable if the actual birds featured in the title appeared before halfway through the entire film. The first half is just this guy talking about his job and him meeting this girl. That is literally all that happens. To compare it to a home movie is an insult to well, home movies and everyone who makes them. There were parts of this movie where there was just no audio at all and it synched up terribly. It's one of the worst shot films ever made.\n\nThe birds stay in the exact same awful CGI shot for the whole film. At the end, most of them are just placed on the air doing absolutely nothing. They don't fly anywhere. They just hover. They use the exact same footage and effects in every single shot. When we first see the birds make their big appearance, they somehow make stuff explode. Yeah, they just randomly fly about and explosions occur. It is beyond awful Photoshop.\n\nThe film itself is beyond boring. We get shot after shot of just cars driving around or even them staying in the same place over and over. When the birds are shot, we see more terrible CGI with just red stuff floating around. None of the endless talking in the first half amounts to anything at all. It's completely pointless and while not quite as bad as \"Santa And The Ice Cream Bunny\" it's still terrible. It's just people walking and talking for no reason. If I hadn't downloaded the Rifftrax with this, my brain would've turned into spaghetti and I don't if it didn't just by watching it at all.\n\nOne of the best lines from the Rifftrax version was, \"We popped big zits at the same time\". Another great bit was, \"So you like standing out by this fence?\" with \"Do I!\". I also loved, \"Somebody said hello? This party is out of control!\". There was also, \"Sign your date is going badly when you have to warn your date not to touch a rotting carcass\". When the characters are talking about global warming, I love the line, \"It also makes morons say, 'So much for global warming' when it's slightly cold outside\". Every penny is well worth it to buy the Rifftrax if you have to watch this for any reason. Zero stars"

        "review_detailed_main": "Most people usually say that if you put time and effort into something, the result will always be good. James Nguyen spent a total of four years making Birdemic, and he proved the opposite. This movie, is one of the worst movies ever made, if not the worst. But I think people should watch this. I especially think that this is something that should be shown at different film schools, instead of movies like Citizen Kane. You learn by your mistakes right? Well, then you learn by watching a bad movie and not masterpieces.\n\nBirdemic is about a small Californian town which gets attacked by deadly birds one day. These birds don't appear until 45 minutes into the film, so there's also a lot more to this film. The most notable thing is that the movie follows the main character's full day, and I'm not kidding. You get to see him driving, working and eating. And these sequences are long, and also pointless.\n\nAlready after the introduction, you start noticing how poorly made this film is. The sound quality is very bad, and the track often goes to very quiet to very loud. The video quality isn't very good either, but since I'm a indie movie maker myself I don't have any problems with that. But the script, directing and most of all acting is so poor.\n\nAlan Bagh who plays the main character in Birdemic, is the worst actor I've ever seen in a movie. He just looks so bored and uninspired in all of his scenes. The supporting actors are still a bit better, but that doesn't save the movie. It is when the birds arrives that you really start noticing how poorly made this film is.\n\nThe birds looks awful. They look so fake and they're all the same. The birds literally just attack the humans by basically flying in front of them. These special effects are also what makes the movie so funny and bad. The scenes are so far away from horror as possible. And the birds make a sound that gives you an headache within a second.\n\nThe movie continues to be a bad film throughout. Everything about this movie is so bad. But as I said, I think everyone should still watch this. It is the best worst movie ever, but someone actually spent time doing this. And I appreciate it more than modern art."

You know when you see the behind the scenes of a film where the actors are waiting for the director to say action? the editor/director then edits that pause before the dialogue out, but not here, they leave it in, before most cuts there's a second pause with the actor waiting to say his/her lines. Even Al Pacino would look awful if that was done to him. Not that the lead actor is any good (Obviously the director owed him a big favour & whats with his stiff as a board walk? I bet he has great posture). We first see him creepily ogling the female lead in a coffee shop. then chases her down the street to make some very awkward conversation while she seems very happy to see him. then when she continues down the street, he chases her down again! gives his number which strangely she seems very keen on getting. After a lot or random product placement for a website (written on peoples T shirts & walls) & preaching that we should be better to the environment birds start dive bombing the city like its Dunkirk (with the same sound effects & exploding, taking down buildings!) but don't worry, they only do this once for a min, the rest of the time, they are just badly super imposed on the screen & seemingly do nothing (when the camera moves they stay in the same position) while the actors wave coat hangers at the non existent birds. The Director & editor (who might be the same person) don't have a clue & this is genuinely a case of I could make the film better just with a little editing (the CGI birds are just truly woeful). Still My Mate & I both had a laugh watching it on our bad movie night with beer & crisps & if you think it'll entertain from that description it probably will."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's unbelievable that APPARENTLY 'Birdemic' is unintentionally so inept. After seeing the movie I was borderline convinced that it's a product of ingenious comedy filmmakers but the DVD special features taught me better. One way or the other auteur Nguyen must be consumed with Hollywood movies or rather with all of their clich\u00e9s. Basically what the film does brilliantly throughout is to use movie clich\u00e9s so obviously and so poorly that it exposes those clich\u00e9s. You inevitably realize how the filmmakers are trying to manipulate the viewer rendering its manipulatory attempts ineffective but not without reminding you that it does nothing else than what most action-y big budget movies do and you think to yourself: \"Even if done well, how could I ever fall for such stupidity in other movies?\" It exposes the fabric of movie-making itself and therefore if you watch 'Birdemic' attentively you will never see an overly manipulative or clich\u00e9-ridden movie the same way again.\n\nThere's the story arc of establishing the hero with a romance before it turns into the movie we actually want to see. This one does it as jarringly as possible, the first 50 minutes are literally a romance almost without any forbidding of impending doom. OK, there's the title sequence music that blobs about repetitively like Torgo's theme in ''Manos' The Hands of Fate' wishing it was Bernard Hermann's 'Psycho' theme that was used so effectively 50 years ago with Janet Leigh behind the wheel. And there's the couple watching parrots fly about a tree and finding a dead eagle on the beach...unnecessarily all done in CGI, by the way, just as is common practice in modern cinema, practical effects just aren't accepted by modern movie going audiences anymore, it must be CGI no matter how bad it looks, it's called suspension of disbelief (while practical effects are just rubbish, period). So there you have it folks. Anyway, so at the 50-minute mark the movie suddenly shriekingly turns into a disaster movie from one second to the next (not counting the one minute \"establishing shot montage\" preceding it).\n\nWant more stereotype and clich\u00e9 debunking? Don't worry, 'Birdemic' delivers them relentlessly. The heroic protagonist who gets the bombshell and has not only one big career success in the movie but about three - in, like, two days - is a stoic, stupid black hole of charisma, the stereotypical \"a guy like you and me\" who succeeds anyway. The female lead likes everything he does and she's won over by the guy despite his \u00fcber-dorkyness, personalitylessness and stalker-like behavior but not without lighting up the screen in every frame of the film with her amazing smile as if she was walking a red carpet, yeah, even during the bird attacks. Of course she also strikes a big career success when she gets a cover model for Victoria Secret gig, you know, \"just a regular fashion model like you and me\".\n\nCharacters who are unlikely to have ever used a gun in their lives (a software salesman and a fashion model?) pull guns out of their \"asses\" and shoot them like pros without fear or remorse. Characters that are only relevant for one scene (if even that) are literally out of the picture when they aren't needed (hey, they are just in the car's back seat and REALLY quiet, that's all) and are back once they have to be. Between bird attacks the characters are as careless as can be. So careless that they take a break from escaping the attacking birds by having a picnic outdoors with their kidnapped children who just lost their parents and whose only purpose in the film (apart from getting \"rescued\" by our the-second-coming-of-Siegfried protagonist) is to bitch that they are hungry and that instead of fresh fish they want a Happy Meal\u00ae.\n\nThere's a theme that runs through the whole film as is typical for even the most shallow disaster movie but this one really rubs it into the viewer's face. At times (well, for most of its running time, actually) it plays like an ad for solar power or a raising awareness ad for global warming. The main character is shown how he is \"going green\" during the course of the movie without bearing any relevance to the story, and not only figuratively but literally as well, the guy's and the girl's wardrobe gets increasingly greener starting subtly with a light green tie until by the end their clothes are all green. Clearly Nguyen learned about subtext from the greatest of filmmakers.\n\nBut seriously, 'Birdemic' had me from minute one with production logos and credits being displayed without any sense of rhythm. During the opening credits (which for example credit a \"Patsy vanEttinger\", yes, without a space between van and the last name) we watch a Mustang driving on a country road at a snail's pace. In one scene a small tow truck with a load is stuck behind the Mustang, that's how slow he goes. And he continues to drive this slow throughout the entire film. Did I mention that sometimes the camera operator still is unable to keep the Mustang inside the frame when panning? Now THAT is comedy. 30 minutes in the guy mentions that his Mustang is a hybrid car. Ha, that explains everything. Subtly making the thing that the movie is a commercial for look bad. Nice gag. One among thousands since every other edit in the film is a joke. If you can laugh about horribly poor editing this is the movie for you. Really, it's quite astonishing that a digitally shot movie could have a glaring error like cutting to characters who are supposed to be in the middle of an action but are actually seen at the beginning of the shot for the director to yell action so they can start running."

Movies like \"Batman and Robin\" and \"Troll 2\" at least have some essence of competent editing and directing to the point that, while they are bad movies, they are still a coherent experience. \"Birdemic\" displays some of the most abhorrent sound and video editing, special effects, acting, dialogue and pacing of any \"film\" ever released.

If you are looking for a \"so bad it's good\" movie, your time would be better spend on the aforementioned films, or even intentionally bad movies like \"Sharknado\" or \"The Velocipastor\"."

It hits all the right notes in all the right places. Please, please, watch this movie. You definitely won't regret it. It definitely signifies and shows how much the film industry has evolved. The CGI in this film can not be matched. My favourite scene hands down is when they fight the almost photo realistic birds with coat hangers, never in my life have i seen such a real and vivid display of true courage and bravery. I can not see how the actors and actresses in this film have not won any awards. Has the film critics become blind to absolute genius? This film for what it is worth should have been critically acclaimed but sadly no recognition has been given to this master-piece. Definitely the highlight of my life. Must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "I hate this film. I don't even want to give this film my attention by reviewing it but I feel like I have to in order to warn anyone thinking of watching it. I suppose I can try to enjoy this as much as possible by tearing this film apart.\n\nI'll start by saying that this is the worst film ever made. This film is impossibly bad. In fact whilst watching this I did consider how it's possible to make a film so terrible, unless you were doing it on purpose... But alas this wasn't intentional. I've seen interviews with the director of this film, James Nguyen, where he states that this film is a 'serious romantic thriller', and that it is 'shocking and terrifying' and looks like a 'one hundred million dollar picture'. Shut up James.\n\nI despise everything about this film. Firstly the acting is of course abysmal. Nguyen made this film with the less than $10000 dollars he had saved from his day job so obviously the actors are not exactly professional. Also to be fair at times (mostly during the 'bird' attacks) it is extremely obvious that the actors have absolutely no idea what they are meant to be doing because the directing is basically none existent in this film.\n\nBriefly I'll mention the camera work. It's bad. It's really, really bad. You know that you're about to witness an awful movie when the opening shot is of a car moving painfully slowly which the camera fails to catch in the tracking shot, despite the slow speed of the car. Seriously, how could you miss the car! Also there are time where the camera is held at a dutch angle, and I really don't believe that this was done on purpose, I simply think that Nguyen or whoever was holding the camera was just accidentally tilting the camera because they didn't know how to hold it. I might as well talk about the lighting quickly whilst I'm here. I'm not sure any kind of additional lighting was used so some scenes are dull and some are painfully bright. Brilliant, just brilliant.\n\nOh no, the editing. Well the cuts are timed poorly. Two characters may finish talking because they have ran out of script for that scene but instead of cutting out the strange silence that follows this like any sane person would do, this lull is just left in, and so the final product it filled with moments where the actors stand awkwardly waiting for the camera to be turned off. Also the sound drops out constantly. Two people are credited as being 'boom operators' in this film. What?! Were boom mics even used? If they were, how could the audio be so dreadful? You can't even hear the last line of this film because of the wind! Were the boom operators facing the wrong way? Were the mics turned off?\n\nFinally, I would like to address the special effects. It honestly looks like the actors are being attacked by JPEGs of birds. Nguyen couldn't get one real bird for any of the film, not one. However it's always good to see random real birds just flying around in the background which aren't dive bombing anyone because most of the film is shot outside, a very smart move on Nguyen part there. The slash wounds from the bird attacks are quite horrible as well as they are clearly done with Halloween makeup bought from a costume shop. All of the victims have exactly the same cuts on their cheeks and sometimes their necks, which is just so lazy! Come on could you seriously not be more creative than that?!\n\nOverall I struggle to fathom how this movie came into existence. Did no one involved with the making of this film think whilst it was being made that maybe it was simply a huge failure? Did none of the actors question the script? During the editing process was it not clear that there were audio and visual issues with almost every shot of the film? However despite it being an atrocity, like other bad films such as 'The Room' Birdemic has garnered a cult following because many people view it as being so bad that it's good. I've still not entirely decided if I believe that anything can be so bad that it's good, but I know that Birdemic could never be deemed as good, not in any sense of the word. It is disgraceful.\n\nP.S. The sound effect of the birds will make your ears bleed."

The low rating and the shoddy reviews should have raised my alarms. But still, I like to watch all kinds of movies and even give questionable movies a chance.\n\nBut \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" was just beyond bad. The storyline is slow, dumb and mindbogglingly unappealing. For starters you have to get very far into the movie before anything starts to happen, and even when it does start, it is just horrible to bear witness to.\n\nI have seen many a questionable movies in my time, but \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" definitely takes the lead in regards of lousy editing, both in sound and visual. The cutting was awful, and the sound was all over the place - sometimes proper sound, other times with a great deal of interfering static sound layer on it. It was as if the movie had been filmed with ordinary home video camera equipment.\n\nThe dialog in the movie was forced, wooden and staggering, delivered without any conviction by anyone in the movie. Which leads to the next aspect; the acting. Wow, this was low budget and B-movie to the extend where your eyes were on the brink of bleeding.\n\nThen lets stop for a while and take a look at the CGI effects. I am of course talking about the CGI animated birds. Wow! Are you kidding me? It was so awfully fake and horrible to look at that you just sit there dumbstruck and thinking 'oh no they didn't, I didn't just witness that...'\n\nSuper poorly animated birds that wouldn't even fool a blind man! Really? And just when you thought you had seen everything, this movie puts a new definition to the term 'bad'. Would it be considered poorly-animated-bird-cruelty when you see the same bird being killed four times within one minute? This was just bad, they used the same clip of questionably animated bird being shot four times within one minute, but it gets better; one scene they mirrored the image.\n\nThe scene where Rod, Nathalie and Ramsey were fighting off the birds with tools had me going back to see it twice. It was just that poor! It is unfathomable that something this bad could see the light of day in 2010. And for some reason people die in this movie when a bird flies in front of their face for a couple of seconds.\n\n\"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" makes Troma movies look grand and astonishing. And it is just an appalling thought to know that there is a part 2 to this disaster. \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" makes it to the top three of horrible movies that I have seen, without a doubt."

To begin, the first half of the movie is the most awkward, poorly written, terribly acted romance of all time. Half the scenes include characters driving, parking, getting in and out of the car. The audio is so bad that the quality changes in the middle of scenes; outdoor scenes at the beach are inaudible because there is absolutely no editing of the audio. The entire plot is pointless, with the first bird attack happening halfway through the movie.\n\nThe effects....wow. There is one terrible scene with birds attacking in the absolute worst imaginable animation of all time, clip art from Microsoft Office essentially. They couldn't even get a stuffed bird to serve as a dead bird, they use clipart instead. There are 3 animations for the birds throughout the entire film, the first 2 which are reused over 10 times. I can't actually....I can't finish the review. This movie is an abomination...it's an insult to everyone that watches it, it's so bad it's not even worth watching for the laughs.

However both of those films at least were somewhat competently produced and therefore can actually be enjoyed as the accidental comedies they are.\n\nBirdemic's issue is that it is neither well put together or fun. The first hour or so is unbelievably boring. Nothing happens!\n\nIn the second half when stuff actually starts happening and the suicidal bomber birds turn up out of nowhere (not kidding) the sound design is so bad that it actually damaged my ears. The issue being that they clearly used one camera to record the audio and video at all times, even for wide shots. So in long shots no matter how loud your volume is you simply cannot hear what the actors are saying. This is usually followed up immediately by an unbelievably loud sound effect like a gun firing or a bird call which is deafening.\n\nThe editing of this film is pretty bad as well, as at one point a group of people are clapping in a meeting and it dies down. Then the camera angle changes and suddenly everyone is clapping again. This happens about five times in a row... This is like film making 101 and not something that you would find in the high quality productions of Tommy Wiseau and Neil Breen!\n\nEverything else about this film like the plot and acting is also terrible, which is likely down to the fact that James Nguyen both wrote and directed this film.\n\nThere are some so bad they're good moments in the film, like the above mentioned suicide dive bombing birds, but none of it makes sitting through the rest of the film worthwhile. This is one of those films that is just worth skipping entirely. It's simply not worth your time when there's far better so bad they're good films like The Room and Fateful Findings. Highly recommend watching them or watching them again instead of this rubbish.\n\n0/10"

Nguyen is up there with Remy Belvaux as visionaries, whose influence will carry for generations to come. I will admit, it took a few viewings of this film to embrace it's subtle messages planted throughout the film, but once you put on your analytical goggles and strap yourself in for this ultimate thrill ride, you are sure to enjoy yourself. The visual effects are stunning and left me floored throughout the film. The introduction of the main conflict should be on the radar of many modern directors, as Nguyen's stylistic choices shine through the cinematography of the shots, letting the viewer truly get into his mind, and to truly see how he sees the world. A film which will live on in infamy, and has changed my life for the better. Birdemic: Shock and Terror should be on the watchlist of every moviegoer, regardless of race, gender, creed, or religion. This film is a timeless classic."

The acting was horrible, the \"special\" effects were...special.

This movie is entertaining at first, but when it becomes obvious that the makers of this movie purposely tried to make a bad movie and create a 'cult' following and have screenings the way The Room has, it loses all credibility. James Nguyen is a complete phony and its really easy to see through what he is trying to do here. I could get a camera and take it outside and try to make a movie and make it really bad, but that doesn't count. It only counts if there is some heart in the movie and the makers actually tried to make it a good movie. If you want to see a movie like that, watch The Room, Manos: The Hands of Fate, Troll 2, Garbage Pail Kids, or Glen or Glenda, not this rip-off."

As soon as the waitress came to take the \"leading man's\" breakfast order, I wanted to scratch my eyes out and pour acid in my ears. Most of the actors went on to have rewarding careers working at Walmart in San Bernadino. The saddest part of the film was how they raped Hitchcock's film without any coherency, imagination, or thought. You can save yourself both time and your sanity by avoiding this film and instead watching \"Animal Porn Live\" on the FOX network."

We get to see the credits for the actors at the begin of the movie as he drives. And it looks like he has given the camera to someone else to hold luckily but you do see that it is hold. Also obvious.. in the whole movie even during scenes where it should be quite and silent around... other cars drive around with people doing their normal daily things.\n\nSo during this big nasty even where supposedly people are being attacked by birds. Everybody still drives as normal as if nothing happened. If that was just the only problem...\n\nNo the worst is shared by three things, the special effects are truly horrible but I guess for the budget I shouldn't complain. No the pushing of Eco Terrorism, I call it that way at almost every point where it is possible. We get a small tirade that we should be better for the planet. And that we should work on better energy methods and we should we should we... kalimero anyone? I don't mind a good thing put into a movie but pushing it in our faces like this makes me want to buy a Hummer H2, And park it right before the house of the director!\n\nAlso the hero is not truly believable. I Guess he is a friend of the writer or director because lets just say that he can't act. No emotion! It is a walking Mannequin, the first scenes where he meets his love I left feeling as if I watched a Creep! Good done movie!\n\nLook I love bad movies, cheap effects sure, acting from Mars hey perfect. Stories that are so not working go ahead love it.\n\nThis movie is just is a preachy basket full of bovine excrements. All this ECO this ECO that just stalls the movie. And well I am severely unshaken by the Monster. Through I have to kinda like a few things about it..like birds that dive like stuka bombers crash into a fireball and leave a nice fire. Of course all CGI!\n\nNo yes this movie is bad, but you know the Girl can act! Give her something better then this! She even looks pretty I mean a girl a next door type of Pretty! I would like to see her in movies where she can play with other actors that actually can act.\n\nThis is not THE ROOM, this is not an enjoyable Monster Movie. In a decent Monster Movie at least the Monster has some screen time. Here the effects are so bad and limited that most of it must have been cut!\n\nI don't know if no! Give that girl a better movie that is all I ask. This is not equal to The Room, or even Manos the Hands of Fate. This is.. not even decently riffable!\n\nThis is a boring Eco Flick of the worst most forced kind. I mean really they did go out on a double to a movie. Guess what movie .. An Inconvient Truth! I rest my case, now I leave to warm up my T34 for my daily shopping trip. Mmm the scent of diesel in the morning!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Birdemic is an exceptionally bad movie that's become legendary in its awlfulness. From the non-existent acting to the infamous CGI-birds who have kamikaze plane-sound-effects when they dive onto 'terrified civilians', James Nguyen shows his artistically inept vision where he can show his 'expertise' in the field of cinema; he just shows how much he bites off WAY more than he could ever hope to chew, and he can't make movies to save his life. Sure he loves Alfred Hitchcock, but that CERTAINLY doesn't show in this movie whatsoever. It's gorgeously terrible movie-making it hurts.\n\nBirdemic is an exercise that f###ing ANYTHING is possible when it comes to movie-making: nothing's off limits in terms of ambition or quality regardless of the end product. Birdemic is the below rock-bottom result of that effort; it makes The Room look like Vertigo.\n\nSeriously: Birdemic is like that pretentious film student's pet-project where he homages his favourite movie directors only to squander the things that matter most like direction, story, competent editing and/or acting, and broken English that makes bootleg film subs from the Asian black market look like goddamn William Shakespeare. It's surreal that a movie this awful exists, but here you go. But my God is it funny laughing at the awfulness: even if it may take some people to have a few drinks to stomach the crappiness.\n\nJames Nguyen is an ass-teur, an asinine 'auteur' who relishes in making movies while having absolutely no idea what the f### he's doing at all. He makes Hollywood mainstays like Brett Ratner and Michael Bay look comparable to Stanley Kubrick or Christopher Nolan; or freaking David Lynch or David Lean.\n\nBirdemic is a 0/5-star magnum anus of a movie. And it's not to be missed as a learning tool for what NOT to do."

You know it's not going to get any better, but you keep watching out of morbid curiosity, intrigued by what travesty will occur next.\n\nThe environmental message adds a moral point, but is delivered in such a heavy, ham-fisted way it can't be taken seriously. The terrible audio issues such as background traffic being louder than the actors, the awful dialogue delivered in broken English, the choice in background music, no attempt at balancing lighting, editing, eliminating background noises, or audio levels shows incompetence in every respect. How this ever got released is beyond comprehension, and its quality defies description - it truly has to be seen to be believed."

Most of us would not have the persistence to follow through with all that is required to complete any kind of film project, let alone one with very little support beyond the individual resources of Mr. Nguyen.

There was a bit of humor. When they were stopped along the highway, investigating two stopped cars that had people dead from the bird attacks, they were firing away at the birds in the air, while the camera showed the traffic along the highway moving as normal.

The acting, editing, camerawork, writing, special effects, pacing, all come together to make a terrible movie that is, essentially, two different movies put together: The first half is a poorly written romance where nothing of meaning happens and the second half is a terrible \"horror\" movie with eagles and vultures that are portrayed using the worst CGI plastered haphazardly onto the worst green screen, both of which have a convoluted environmental message that is just thrown in.

I want a happy meal too. Those guns they had came out of nowhere with nearly unlimited ammunition. That's a nice thing. I have to give credit to the make up person.

This cringe fest makes Plan 9 From Outer Space (1957) look like a masterpiece. Like The Room (2003) it's a tragic portrait in self delusion and a train wreck from which you can't look away. Definitely in the 'so bad it's good' territory in every aspect of film making, but the sound design! That is just in a class of its own. The killer birds are basically clip art and the dialogue has to be heard to be believed ('Where's Becky?' 'She's taking a s**t.') The fact that writer and director James Nguyen has made two sequels suggests either that he's a good sport or that he decided since everyone thought it was so bad he'd just keep going in the same awful direction. Ballsy to say the least."

It is poorly written, the CGI is eye aching, the acting is brain melting, the script is skin crawling, and the quality... I'm speechless. I have no words. There are no words in the dictionary to explain how terrible this movie is.\n\nThey decided to make a sequel of the classic Alfred Hitchcock movie \"The Birds\" from 1963 and made the franchise look like a school project filmed with an iPhone 2. The camera quality makes me want to break my TV screen... I have nothing more to say about this thing."

I mean, who cares about driving? The camera-work is probably the poorest of any movie I've ever seen. The Mustang is driving painfully slow, yet the camera still can't focus on it. The editing and audio iss coming out of my high school projects. Actually, some of my high school projects had better audio than this. Alan Bagh is probably one of he worst actors I've seen yet. Cinemasins sums it up nicely, with his personality being described as \"blank and stalkery\". The girl is better but you can tell she's not taking any of it seriously. The dialogue is clich\u00e9d, boring, and just terrible overall. Although since English is probably Nguyen's second language, we can't blame him.\n\nHmmm....that seems to be about it. I feel like I'm missing something though.......Oh, God. The CGI. The CGI. It's Ratatoing level. For those of you fortunate enough to have not seen Ratatoing, that translates to hilariously, unbelievably, awful.\n\nVerdict: Buy this movie. Watch it. It's fantastic."

The incompetence can be charming, the bad effects comical, the bad acting inadvertently funny. But in 'Birdemic' there is no humour of any kind because there are no signs of humanity in it. It is as though a poorly designed synthetic person decided to make a film. The whole thing is like some sort of nightmare and it is impossible to relate to any situation developing on the screen. It is not that the film is just bad and incompetent, it is outright inhuman. Whatever logic there is behind these scenes is not the product of a human mind.\n\nSo who is this James Nguyen?

        "review_detailed_main": "Birdemic...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.\n\nBoy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).\n\nBut the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Alan Bagh's excellent portrayal of Rod, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Colton Osborne's mysterious Tony, and even the creepy eagles, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action \"hero that kicks butt\" and \"cannon fodder\" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the eagles with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.\n\nAll I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks."

        "review_detailed_main": "Birdemic: Shock and Terror is often hailed as one of the worst films of all time. Judging by the cover, the title, and any of the clips, viewers might not have to watch to figure that out. Inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, the filmmakers added various political agendas to turn their low-budget thriller into something long-lasting.\n\nWorking as a salesman, Rod (Alan Bagh) seems happy with his career but yearns for something more in his personal life. Stumbling upon Nathalie (Whitney Moore), the two quickly take a liking to each other and begin to form a relationship. While on a romantic escapade, disaster strikes when birds randomly begin attacking people. With no explanation for the phenomenon, the pair fight for their lives to survive the Birdemic.\n\nOh boy. Birdemic: Shock and Terror is an all-around disaster of a movie. Everything about this film sounds like the roughest first draft but unfortunately is the final product. While similarly bad films, like Foodfight, can blame theft, production issues, and mismanaged budget on their downfall, Birdemic seemingly has no such behind-the-scenes issues. Instead, Birdemic has nothing to blame except for the messy vision of its director, James Nguyen. Trying to shoehorn in as many political messages as possible, Nguyen wedges in references or metaphors as often as possible, distracting from any sense of plot.\n\nThough often unnoticed in films, the sound mixing is exceptionally horrid throughout. The sound ranges from sounding as if it were recorded on a tape recorder to complete and abrupt silence, forcing you to question if you accidentally hit mute. When it's understandable, the dialogue has you wishing you couldn't hear it, as its simplicity becomes difficult to endure. The actors add insult to injury as every performance feels akin to nails on a chalkboard. Every line is delivered as though the actors were lobotomized before filming. Working with little direction, the newbie actors are left flailing (literally & figuratively).\n\nWith an estimated $10,000 budget, it is not surprising that the special effects look laughable. Though it may seem like an unfair amount to criticize a film over, films like Paranormal Activity & Eraserhead had almost identical budgets and created much better experiences. From stock image birds to Getty Images watermarks not edited out of the shot, Birdemic achieves unimaginable feats of visual laziness.\n\nAs the title implies, there will be plenty of shock, but mostly due to the quality of the film. Not only do I know that no one involved in the production had any prior experience in filmmaking, but I am fully convinced none of them have ever had a normal human interaction. Though I know it cannot be, this feels like the first A. I.-produced film. Birdemic: Shock and Terror is easily one of the worst movies ever made and it is not up for debate. This truly belongs in the Sewers of Cinema."

She drives about an hour north of San Francisco to Bodega Bay, where Mitch spends the weekends with his mother Lydia and younger sister Cathy. Soon after her arrival, however, the birds in the area begin to act strangely. A seagull attacks Melanie as she is crossing the bay in a small boat, and then, Lydia finds her neighbor dead, obviously the victim of a bird attack. Soon, birds in the hundreds and thousands are attacking anyone they find out of doors. There is no explanation as to why this might be happening, and as the birds continue their vicious attacks, survival becomes the priority."

I am lighthearted, and like lots of movies people consider bad (Troll 2, Satan's little helper, The Room, etc.), I can usually laugh at films that I myself find bad.

In the end I only felt rage, scowl, and a MASSIVE headache.\n\nI felt robbed watching it and felt I could have done something more useful with my time like watch leaves fall, do jumping jacks, call my ex, go to church.

        "review_detailed_main": "I was recommended this film by a friend. This guy was absolutely raving about the film which was funny as I had not even heard about it - and I watch many movies. Anyway after 3 days of heckling I agreed to watch it although a quick internet review search led me to believe this could possibly be the worst film ever made - so I forced him to sit through (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbGkxcY7YFU) as pre-emptive revenge (after I had watched birdemic he said he would have endured watching it 10 times over get me to watch Birdemic even though he did feel sick after the first time).\n\nAnyway.. I kicked back one evening and sat through this movie. What emotions didn't hit me as I ploughed through. I felt motion sickness by the end of the opening sequence. Anxious for action to begin after just 5 mins however after 40 mins I wasn't even sure I was watching the right film as it still didn't seem to have started. There were too many scenes that made me feel embarrassed as it was soo bad. At one point I laughed soo hard at the ridiculousness of the plot and storyline that I woke up my wife and baby daughter(which didn't go down very well at all). Absolutely flabbergasted by the special effects, in fact I don't even know what kind of effects they were - revolutionary sprang to mind as I was trying to figure out if it was animation, 3D or .. what?. The coat hanger action sequence was unbelievable (as was most of the film). Confusion over why anyone would have a picnic given the situation. I almost cried with relief at the end.\n\nAltogether this film left me in a most peculiar state - Anger aimed at my friend was the initial response however this emotion slowly (Very Slowly buddy!) transcended into something else. Not empathy for the underlying plot - not empathy, something else. I realised what had happened - I was traumatised! I realised that sitting through this movie is an experience that you emerge from a better human being. I could mention Roller-coaster however that clich\u00e9 makes me feel sick nowadays so lets try and elaborate - its like you were given a magic pill before you were allowed to watch the movie. It causes you to shrink until you could fit in an empty Jam Jar and then sealed. Through the see-through glass you are handed to a happy 3 year old who believes your a rattle and violently shakes you until you pass out. When you come to, your back to normal and the end credits are rolling, however you know something just happened to you but you don't know what and you cant find any proof that you were just abused - maybe I should have stuck with Roller-coaster.\n\nI believe what happened to me was similar to what can happen in certain hostage situations. The Hostages over a period of time feel adulation and feel positive feelings towards their captors - the technical term for this is the 'Stockholm Syndrome' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome). The Stockholm Syndrome hit me hard and the next day I was ranting about what a master piece of modern film this was to anyone who would listen - in fact I have got 3 people to watch it since that weekend and they are now passing on the message to their friends. Why? The purpose is that you cant share your experience with someone who hasn't seen it, as they just don't understand, they may read a review and say - \"why would I want to watch that\".\n\nUntil you watch it you can never understand what the genius of this actually is. My view on this movie is that the director wanted you to feel his pain, wanted you to understand how difficult it was to make a movie on Tesco vouchers, wanted you to experience all the feelings of watching his masterpiece movie that he knew he could never make so he gave you all those feelings by reversing the 'good film, plot, special effect' guide developed by Hollywood and translated it into Birdemic. I think all the worst parts of this film was preconceived and deliberately made bad to prompt the reactions it does from the audience - that in itself is the genius! Anyone who has watched this film is in an elite club, they know and they cant wait to pass on the word.\n\nDespite what anyone else thinks my short summary is: I love many movies however I don't write a god damn review about them. Anyone who hasn't seen this ought to as you cant talk about it until then. Any movie that can make me take an hour out of my life to write about my experience from watching it cant be that bad."

She is the only actress there. She is acting. Baffling bad, but she's doing the job. The other people in this video shooting (I'm not calling a film) are just kind of saying words and doing stuff like walking and breathing. Alan Bagh seems like a robot learning how to human. The kids are just following what the adults told them to do.\n\nI firmly believe some of the scenes were there to justify hitting them 90 minute mark. Otherwise this could be a very strange Chevron commercial.\n\nThe worst part is, you can't even meme this. It has nothing to offer even to mock. It's just... sad.\n\nAnyway, if you find yourself with nothing to do, I suggest just staring at a blank wall for 90 minutes. I can assure you it's better."

        "review_title": "That was a hilarious movie, 'Birdemic: Shock and Terror.' ...well that's it! I'm writing a 'Birdemic' review that's environmentally friendly! At a 50 percent discount!",
        "review_detailed_main": "What do you get when you combine the poor writing of mad mastermind Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\", the production values of Nick Millard's completely mindless \"Crazy Fat Ethel 2\", the inept direction of a Coleman Francis piece, a dash of on-the-nose environmental preaching and a budget that wouldn't pay for a high-school lunch?\n\nYou get James Nguyen's magnificent and brutally arresting unintentional-comedy classic \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror.\" It's not only a prime example of that old stand-by descriptor \"so bad, it's good\"... it one of the best examples you could possibly imagine. Every single facet of the film is so horrifyingly \"incorrect\", that you can't help but howl from laughter from the first frame to the last. It's right up there with \"Troll 2\" and the aforementioned \"The Room\" as one of the finest \"best-worst\" movies ever made. Fans of trashy Z- grade movies, camp releases and bad flicks won't be able to help but completely and utterly adore \"Birdemic.\"\n\nWe follow two leads who are both on the brink of breakthroughs in their respective careers... software salesman Rod (Alan Bagh), and aspiring fashion model Nathalie. (Whitney Moore) As both find themselves finally living out their dreams and attaining wealth and recognition for their accomplishments, a romance grows after they meet one-another in a chance encounter. However, their newfound relationship will be put to the ultimate test when suddenly and out of nowhere... birds begin to attack the public as a result of global warming. They will be forced to band together with other survivors to try and stay alive during the \"Birdemic!\"\n\nThe film is almost indescribable in its awful-ness. Everything goes wrong at all times. Right off the bat, the audio and video quality is exceptionally poor (I shot high-school student-films on Digital-8 in 2002 that looked better!) and the editing is atrocious with glaring continuity gaffes and dialog that cuts in and out constantly. But it only gets better (well, worse... but in a good way) from there.\n\nFrom wooden acting to hilariously holier-than-thou dialog to \"special\" effects that look like they were ripped right out of Microsoft Paint... everything continues a downward spiral in a sort-of brilliant oblivion of insanity. The film is trying to push a noble enough message about living a greener lifestyle and diminishing one's carbon footprint... but it does this by beating us over the head with long-winded speeches about the dangers of Global Warming about once every-other scene in increasingly hilarious fashion. Most movies understand that you need to be subtle about such themes... but to Nguyen, the word \"subtlety\" means having ancillary characters show up for one scene, give five-minute-long musings about climate change that sound like they were ripped right out of the driest high-school science textbook, and then vanish. There's even one particularly hilarious scene where Rod and Nathalie go out for a double-date and chose to see \"An Inconvenient Truth\", just so Rod can spout the dialog \"That was a good movie, 'An Inconvenient Truth!'\" while his friend retorts with \"That is it, I am getting myself a car that's more environmentally friendly!\" The film is liberally peppered with awkward and out-of-place moments like that, and it's brilliant picking up on them with repeated viewings.\n\nOur entire cast seems completely clueless, save for a bizarrely honest and well-natured performance by Patsy van Ettinger in a supporting role as Nathalie's mom and Stephen Gustavson as a frankly kind of eerie \"tree-hugger\" (that's how he's credited) that the gang runs into. Everyone else, though? Flat as a pancake and stiff as a board. In the case of Alan Bagh, literally stiff as a board. I've never seen an actor who looks more uncomfortable and nervous and uptight in my life. Microsoft Sam has better range. Also of note is More, who is quite likable and is at least trying, but just seems kind of lost and confused. I'm sure she's probably a decent actress, but she's dragged down in the best of ways here by the outlandish writing.\n\nBut I know why you're all here... the birds. My god. The birds.\n\nAbout halfway through the film, there is a sudden attack as birds begin to descend on humanity in a murderous rage. And that's where the movie goes from merely being charmingly-bad to being a new cult- classic! And it's almost beyond words. You almost just have to see it to believe it. The birds (all digitally animated) look like free clipart you'd find online. Often with only a few frames of animation that loop infinitely. And never animated quite right. They'll just... hover in place on-screen or zoom by in the blink of an eye. And they honestly look like cartoons. There's no realism to the digital model, nor any attempt made to light-match them to the background. It's like Nguyen found some free GIF images of birds online and just dropped them over the top of the scene. Oh, and did I mention that randomly, sometimes the birds in the background will dive-bomb the ground with an airplane sound effect and then explode? Because that happens. And when you finally notice it, you will never stop laughing. Ever.\n\n\"Birdemic\" is a special kind of bad. It's a \"you gotta see it to believe it\" kind of bad. A \"you might just laugh yourself to death\" kind of bad. A \"this only comes once in a lifetime\" kind of bad. And I whole-heartedly recommend it.\n\nI'm giving it 10 stars at a 50% discount."

Birdemic has been noted for its poor quality, with reviewers calling out its wooden acting and dialogue, amateurish sound and editing, nonsensical plot and its special effects, consisting entirely of poorly rendered CGI eagles and vultures that, in addition to performing physically awkward aerial maneuvers (non-animated bird sprites in the background will simply rotate 360\u00b0 in mid-air), spit acid and explode with unrealistic smoke upon impact with the ground with a plane dive sound effect. It has also been noted that the birds do not appear until nearly halfway (47 minutes) into the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't even know what to say about Birdemic. It was a roller coaster of a movie seeming to change at every turn. There were many scenes that were just...uncomfortable to watch. Multiple times throughout this visual experience actors just disappear, and wackass narrative decisions are consistently made by the \"writer\" (if there even is one). I think an illiterate man could write a better script. The plot is a crime against film and it is proven when the first line of the movie is finally spoken after the 4 minute drive to nowhere: \"hi\". The acting in this film was so vulgar that I was gagging in the middle of this movie. Whoever played Rob has no talent. Nathaline is always smiling, even when she's in danger. No one holds their weapons right and Rod shows off his mustang so much that the mustang has more emotion than him. Nathaline is like a member of a cult who would kidnap children, which she does by the way. The lack of critical thinking of the actors within this movie is extremely concerning. The worst scene in this movie was when Rod and Natalie were at the beach with the two kids and Rod had to go fishing. This is the worst scene because Rod catches a fish about twenty seconds later, boils the entire, whole, raw fish, and Natalie then proceeded to pick seaweed and cook it in the pot with the fish. They would absolutely die in a real world crisis. Birdemic is a painful film to watch, mostly stemming from the actors' robotic voices and movement. It felt like English was not the actor's first language; however, that might not even be the worst part.\n\nWatching the film gives me second hand embarrassment, as well as a migraine due to the awful use of sound. The audio quality really made the cherry on top of this horrible movie. There were parts in the movie where the audio would cut in and out of just loud, white noise. Nobody would be talking and you would hear painfully loud radio sounds. Also, the edited gun and bird sounds were cattywampus. The lighting was always either glaring because it was too bright, or you were squinting to try to make out the actors through the shadows. The amount of time the camera spent following the car around was way overly excessive, and the oblique angles for no reason were making me nauseous. My main concern goes to the person responsible for the editing, I'm wondering \"Is he okay? Is he going through something?\" That's because the editing of Birdemic made me feel as if I was experiencing a fever dream. The camera and sound quality weren't even on the scale of being anywhere good and knowing that they are actually thought it was good makes it worse. It would be different if the director intended the film to be bad; but, I'm just scared for him.\n\nI had no intention in loving this film, but it prevailed. Birdemic is not competent in really any form, but there are a few bright spots. The makeup artist who worked on this film is easily the most talented of the whole crew, giving the only reasonable contribution in the entire movie. Nobody should've put time and effort into this film considering how bad the directing was, but everybody in it stuck around, and thanks to this, we all get a film to absolutely obliterate in the reviews. It is very obvious this film was bad. The movie was so bad it was comical. I do want to show other people this just because I watched it and other people also have to suffer."

For a Movie released in 2010, it looks less eye gauging than 1910s even for 21st Century Standards. The Sound is Terrible and you can barely hear anything.

A lot of the audio is staticky and muffled. Then there's the process of editing. A lot of the background noise can be heard through the microphone. This isn't helped by the horrible acting. Don't even get me started on the performances the actors give us. Birdemic is a boring, unenthralling, and painfully awkward movie completely devoid of logic or plot.

        "review_detailed_main": "In this movie you follow a heartless protagonist with unnecessary scenes. Half the movie is just bird sounds, and the opening is the same stock music for 5 minutes. I understand they had a low budget only being $10,000, but the video quality is the quality I would expect from a 2006 camcorder. The death scenes are not scary or sad at all, and the most emotion I got out of this movie was laughing when a bird just randomly falls on the protagonist's car. I'm not critic, but frankly this is a bad movie. In case you want to watch this for the bad bird CG-I, I wouldn't recommend that either. The first 30 minutes of this movie is an absolute slump to go through. No birds until about 45 minutes in, and you'll waste about 4% of your day watching this. Overall, 1/10. If you want to watch a bad movie and make fun of it, I would recommend this only if you are prepared to make fun of constant reuse of ArrowHead Water, and real companies being used and shown in this movie. For example, the girl wearing the website shirt, and the fairgrounds they go to a little less then halfway through. 1.2/10, I would recommend Russian Disney Pixar rip-offs more then this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Direct quotes from Birdemic: \"Where's Becky? She's takin' a sh--.\" \"Hey look, there's an old guy on the bridge.\"\n\nJames Nguyen you didn't!... Oh no... you did..... and it's with this film \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" that a stunning new level of cinematic ineptitude has truly been been achieved. Warning: Sitting through Birdemic is quite the chore, though Rifftrax commentary can make it somewhat more bearable. Lazily plotted, terribly acted and then throw in some of the worst special effects ever seen and there you have it. Birdemic is perhaps the best known example of why amateur film-makers (such as James Nguyen) should stop what their doing and try something else - something entirely different. Because more Birdemic's - The World Needs NOT!\n\nThis movie is hilariously terrible on all fronts and the awesome level of incompetence that's exhibited by it's writer/director James Nguyen and his cast and crew makes for a rare and uniquely terrible movie experience and like so many other movies I've reviewed Birdemic's only real entertainment value is derived from it's confounding levels of incompetence and ineptitude. The film starts out in the lamest possible way, s-l-o-w-l-y limping to life with the lamest opening credits sequence you will ever see, which is also accompanied by the lamest music you will ever hear. As it turns out it's our hero of the movie \"Rod\" sedately tooling down a winding road, how they thought including his boring daily commute to work would make for a scintillating start to the film is anyones guess, but that is how it is - so with that you're basically bored before it's even really begun. Good going! With as few as words as possible Birdemic is this: Rod, a software salesman, meets a fashion model named Natalie, a few lame dates follow (the type that are loaded with lots of stupid facial expressions, forced smiles, much lame and awkwardly delivered \"getting-to-know-you\" dialog and capped-off with some bad \"white-person dancing\") then a motel room enters the picture where Rod scores (!), the next morning Rod and Natalie awaken to see the worst special effects ever, I mean....... birds, their under-siege by lot's and lot's of birds and as they fumble n' bumble along the way, their epic saga of avoiding this sudden and explainable wrath of avian aggression begins. THE BIRDEMIC IS ON! FINALLY! Factually speaking, it takes over half of Birdemic, for THE Birdemic to actually begin. Yet another example of how terrible this movies sense of pace is, as we observe Rod and Natalie stumbling through time and space, it's pacing remains terrible throughout - and such is the case for every other aspect of this epically wretched movie.\n\nWhat's funny about the whole idea that the world is victim to wide-spread avian scourge, is the fact, that the rest of the people in the movies backgrounds, are just fine and clearly aren't being attacked by anything. This glaring inconsistency is revealed several times throughout the movie, often occurring along roadways in a series of mid and long shots. Nguyen did a terrible job in creating the illusion of mass panic and The Birdemic is strangely localized to Rod and his followers, as they putz along in their happenin' wheels - a dark green Ford Astro Van complete with peeling paint. Consistent with other movies of James Nguyen's, be prepared to see countless many mundane scenes of cars, slowly and tediously pulling off to the side and parking OR (AND FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS!) slowly (always very,very slowly) pulling back onto the road. It seems to be something of a directors trademark for Mr. Nguyen - then again many amateur film directors, have been padding the play lengths of their ineptly made films, with just this type of vehicular repetitiveness for decades - but yet somehow, Nguyen has managed some fresh new angles on how to film vehicular monotony. These tedious and frequently recurring scenes contribute greatly to how -insanely boring- Birdemic ultimately is. On the other side of the coin, in the hands of a talented director (someone who is not James Nguyen) Birdemic: Shock and Terror could have been an exciting and entertaining, suspense and action-filled horror film, but.......\n\nThe actors in this movie are plain terrible - especially the actor who plays Rod, he's particularly slow and awkward when in front of the camera. For instance he can't even walk in a natural looking way and throughout the entire movie his laughably terrible acting has a way of stirring up a lot of unintended humor, it's one of the very few charms of Birdemic - unintentional or not.\n\nSomething needs to said about the films problematic sound, Birdemic is plagued throughout by a couple of glaring sound issues. First off, on at least half a dozen occasions the sound of the movie COMPLETELY drops out for a few seconds every now and then. Less egregious is the differences in it's ambient sound, for instance, the movie has lots footage that is mired by high levels of background noise and in light of how the film was edited, the noisy footage jarringly cuts back and forth with footage that has a quiet background. These noise issues are very effective in creating a very choppy and uneven, amateurish sound quality - but what the hell else would you expect from the likes of James Nguyen.\n\nThen finally we have Birdemic's special effects..........these are easily some of the worst looking optical effects ever seen (save for one certain made-for-TV movie I saw years ago), be it CGI or some other older brand optical FX. I've heard the bird effects are, hilariously enough, nothing more than Gif. file's, that anyone with a PC can download off the internet. Whatever their origin maybe THEY ARE TERRIBLE and redefine what cheap/overtly-faking looking effects are all about. For me it's the effects department, where this film is at it's worst and that is really saying a lot. Conclusion: Birdemic, bad in every possible way."

I don't think there is any world where the film makers where making this and said to themselves, this is going to be the most realistic movie out there with some of the best performances anyone has ever seen. No, that just didn't happen. It has to be this bad on purpose.\n\nThe movie is bad, in fact its so bad that in some aspects it's funny. You will be laughing throughout the whole movie i mean the logic is bewilderin bad and the birds... omg the birds have to be the best part of this movie. Every time you see them you can't help but laugh. It's so mind numbingly bad that it's genuinely funny.\n\nThe more i think about it, the more it hits me that i can not remember a scene that is genuinely boring. It manages to keep you entertained throughout all of its goofiness and flaws. Even though you are laughing at it because of how bad it is.\n\nIn another aspect i genuinely feel that you have to watch this movie. Mostly because it shows you how to not make a film. I feel obligated to give this film a 1, so i'm going to, but this is not a \"here is a 1 star review because i hate this movie\". I don't hate this movie at all.

        "review_detailed_main": "I knew it wasn't a smart decision, but sometimes reading about cinematic infamy isn't enough. 'Ishtar,' 'North,' Cats' - sometimes you just have to see it for yourself. And what better time than when one is already feeling down to experiment with 'Birdemic?' Even in the words of Alan Bagh, Whitney Moore, and others involved, the fundamental production was a fly-by-night mess; the visual effects boast a level of notoriety that's otherwise practically unheard of in the medium; the budget all but redefines \"bottom-dollar.\" If absolutely nothing else is true of this picture, I have seen Moore elsewhere, and I know that she is a capable actress, and I'm subsequently led to infer that to the incalculable extent that other cast members come off just as if not more poorly than she does, the deficiencies can surely (or at least probably) be chalked up to the exceedingly poor work of filmmaker James Nguyen as writer, director, and producer. All this patter still leads to the same unavoidable truth, however: 'Shock and terror' is an astonishingly bad movie.\n\nFrom the moment one presses \"play\" one can't help but be aghast at how wildly incompetent the whole effort was. Maybe I'm being overly generous, but I'm not inclined to doubt the sincerity of Nguyen in this instance, let alone the sincerity of anyone else involved. Perhaps I should - perhaps every single person who participated is equally to blame - but with the man wearing multiple hats and assuming creative control over the project, we in turn can only make educated guesses of where the responsibility lies. One way or another, there is nothing here that comes off well. Audiences are accustomed to casting aspersions on actors first and foremost, and make no mistake, the acting and delivery here is atrocious: blunt, direct, tactless, unsubtle, and completely amateurish. It often comes across in my opinion that Moore, Bagh, and the supporting cast were truly trying to act through the myriad other problems on hand, but they just couldn't manage to do so. Those myriad other problems include, and are not limited to, direction that flounders in every capacity, and egregiously sloppy editing of both sound and image; non-existent production values, perplexing and imbalanced \"sound design,\" and undetectable basic quality control for audio (headphone users, beware the wind and gunfire); artless cinematography; quizzical scene writing, terrible dialogue, shallow characters, slothful pacing, meager plot development, a weak narrative, and admirable themes and ideas that are nevertheless direly forced and unnaturally shoehorned in; the aforementioned baldfaced and transparently false \"visual effects,\" a laughable attempt at \"set decoration,\" painfully limp music, and among still more, scenes that either shouldn't have been filmed in the first place, or which are allowed to linger far, far too long.\n\nIs there anything here that is done well? I suppose the hair and makeup is nice, which I'm given to understand is ultimately also to the credit of Moore. The filming locations are nice. And once again - I do think the cast really tried; though I might be wrong, I think Nguyen was earnest in his efforts, and just 100% incapable. The only alternative explanation is that he wasn't trying in the slightest degree, and I'm not sure which possibility is worse to consider. Either way, the mind-blowing flaws are reflected on and in every other contribution. Either way, the viewing experience that is 'Birdemic' very immediately becomes laborious, especially as the birds don't meaningfully show up until almost exactly the second half. Either way, there is no doubt in my mind that this really is one of the worst features ever made; the only \"shock\" and \"terror\" to be had is in reaction to how appalling the finished product is. The only theoretical way to have fun here is by laughing at the sheer ineptitude, yet for as inescapably, unremittingly abhorrent as every element is, for the most part that flagrant horribleness even negates any chance at deriving entertainment from mockery. All told there is just no reason to watch. No matter how curious you are, no matter what impetus you think you might have to check it out, I must in good conscience vehemently recommend against 'Birdemic.' This is excruciating, and any web site that offers it to stream, rent, or buy is doing an incredible disservice to cinema and to all of mankind. Avoid."

First off, let me point out that there exist two kinds of cinematographic geniuses in the film industry; the best movie makers (ex: Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg etc) and the worst movie makers (ex: James Nguyen). James Nguyen is a genius because no living being in this world has or will ever be able to create a horrible movie nearly comparable to this 90 minute piece of crap.\n\nThis 'movie' contains every single error or mistake that can possibly be made in the process of making a film, every thing that should definitely never happen in a movie is found in this one, it's almost as though the production team had a checklist of all aspects of film they should disgrace for reasons unknown to me. I bet you if there was a \"make the worst movie\" competition none would come near the level of atrociousness Birdemic: Shock And Terror possesses.\n\nThe acting is disastrous; Alan Bagh (who plays Rod our hero in the movie) is easily the worst 'actor' in the history of mankind. Acting might be a bit challenging, i know, but you can't even simply walk in a convincing manner? My God, the way he walked towards that restaurant (very obviously prior to the director yelling action!) in the opening scene after the painful ten minutes of pointless and meaningless driving shots through California was just unacceptable. He should be sued for insulting us, nobody should be that bad it just simply does not happen. Then numerous other scenes were he awfully delivers his lines like a robot (His character's name says it all) and performs some the most terrible and absurd actions ever seen on screen. If i had to fully talk about Bagh's awkwardness in this joke of a movie you'd finish your days in front of the computer.\n\nAnother thing i found hard to believe is the scene where they're in a conference room and when the lecturer announces the good news they start clapping for nearly two minutes nonstop, fading a bit but then picking it up over and over again. Jesus Christ. I understand good CGI is expensive and all since Birdemic's budget was only $10,000 (obviously), but how in God's name can you not perform a minuscule task as simple as a handclap? Do you need ground breaking CGI software for that too? I will never comprehend the secret behind the badness of this film.\n\nBirdemic is full of completely pointless and useless plots, subplots and scenes that contribute absolutely nothing or add any knowledge to the life of the movie; it's aim doesn't begin until after 50 minutes of nonsense subplot when the bird attack actually takes place, and the way the latter is introduced is utter disaster. Scenes like when Rod goes to the gas station to get some gas and then continues his way afterwards without anything happening regardless of how greatly it was emphasized are a mystery.\n\nLet's see how many worst's Birdemic has: Worst acting, directing, editing, CGI, screenplay, plot, sound effects & mixing, special effects, script, camera operating...Jesus the list goes on and on. I told you they had a checklist...\n\nAnyway its directors like James Nguyen who make us realize the huge impact that better movie makers like Quentin Tarantino or Spike Lee have on the film industry. After all, they say you would never notice the beauty of light had you not seen obscurity right? Or something along the lines. Birdemic left me traumatized, seriously, and I by no means refer to its genre. It is an experience I shall probably never overcome and the wound it left me will never heal.\n\nSo there you have it, make your own judgement on this one."

The first part of Birdemic feels exactly like those videos, only stretched out over a tortuously long time and with actual dialogue instead of lyrics hopping around. The second part only differs through the addition of about four different animated GIFs of birds superimposed on the screen.\n\nAlthough I could not manage to watch the thing in its entirety for fear of getting an aneurysm, from what I have seen and read in other reviews it must either be intended as ecological propaganda, or it is made intentionally bad to ridicule ecologists. It works in neither way because it is simply too awful to watch. The only \"Shock\" is how this film managed to get as far as it did, and the only \"Terror\" is the sheer awfulness of its production."

From the world building to the setting, everyone in this movie has their own enjoyable qualities and characteristics. Starting off as an enjoyable romantic comedy then going straight into a horrifying masterpiece. James Nguyen is truly one of the most amazing directors in the world, featuring a truly uprising and spectacular soundtrack provided by the likes of Andrew Seger. These outrageous and biased critics giving this movie an 18% on metacritic who go against all of my opinions towards this beautiful beautiful movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Everything has already been said about Birdemic: Shock and Terror. Hearing about this film for years about how bad it is and seemingly avoiding and not taking notice. Now after watching it, can say it is truly as terrible as people claim.\n\nFirst the acting is awful. The lead character Rod's delivery and overall tone on which he says his lines are completely unconvincing where he is supposed to come off as across charming or cool yet comes across as idiotic and offbeat. Nathalie is easily the highlight of the film, although she doesn't have the best acting but clearly better than Rod and the other actors.\n\nThe birds don't actually come into place until 47 minutes. And when they do appear, it is random with no explanation and the cgi looks blatantly fake.\n\nA lot of pointless and foolish nonsensical scenes. Including one scene where Rod, and Nathalie stop to help a stranded man yet it turns out the man has a gun and tries to stick them up for gas. What was silly is, right after the man sticks up Rod and gets him to come out of the vehicle to give him the gas tank, a bird appears from nowhere and seemingly attacks the man killing him (we see that the bird was in no reach of the man). Then what makes less sense is Rod leaving the gas tank (and the gun) on the ground then driving away. This was completely irritating for no reason.\n\nPeople compare Birdemic to Tommy Wiseau's The Room, but in no way is Birdemic better, more entertaining, enjoyable or funny. This movie is just all around awful, irritating, forgettable characters, less funny dialogue (no memorable quotables) and the special effects and cgi look awful.\n\nEven with a relatively short runtime (less than one hour, thirty minutes), it really feels like it was nearly two hours or longer. It dragged on."

I'm typing this extremely, extremely slowly, just searching for a way to approach this. I guess I had better start with the most prominent feature of the film.\n\nAlan Bagh. I act as a hobby, and I've seen my fair share of terrible actors. But Alan Bagh is worse than the worst actor I've ever seen. Ever. Not just on screen - he's worse than the kid who played the innkeeper in my school Christmas play when I was 5 (his only line was 'No. Goodnight,' and he forgot it). He puts Tommy Wiseau to shame. Whitney Moore is slightly better, but not by much - the most realistic thing about her is that she plays a model for Victoria's secret.\n\nI don't even want to talk about James Nguyen, the 'director' and 'writer'. But James, if you're reading this, I want you to know: You're a sick, depraved man. This film has shattered my faith in the art of film-making. I wish I was exaggerating. I wish this was just some joke, but it's not. I think the scariest bit about the film is that... everyone was trying their best. This was the best James Nguyen could do. His best shot. Alan Bagh wasn't acting like that because he was joking. He was acting like that because that's what he thought acting was like. And at the end of the day, they all patted themselves on the back, and congratulated each other on a good day's work.\n\nJust let that sink in.\n\nSure, the first 30 minutes are funny. But it slowly turns sour, as you just watch your faith in humanity crumble before your eyes. It's like getting drunk with friends - at first, it's all laughs and in good spirit, but slowly over time it turns into something which threatens your entire wellbeing and the wellbeing of everyone you love. That's what it's like watching Birdemic. At the end of the day, it'll never reach the same cult status as The Room, because while The Room is some semi-playful BDSM, this is like someone holding a blowtorch to your balls. I'm giving this a 1/10 officially, but right after this, I'm going to email IMDb and ask them to put a 0/10 rating in place. Because what was the one point for? What in this film warranted the point? Where was the part of the film where I though 'yeah, this deserves a point'? I'm going to take a nice long shower and have a bit of a cry, now. I'm done.\n\n0/10"

Plus who ever made the T-shirt 'imagen peace.' Must have been an artist. When the birds were attacking the world I stopped the TV and looked out side. That's how realistic it was. The best couple I've seen in years. Then who thought of this idea which is when they attacked the birds with clothes hangers should win the Oscars. I mean look at the CGI effects better that marble and DC combined. The most emotional moment when they drove and saw their friend dead. It made me cry so much. The most dramatic moment was when a Texan pulled out a gun and took the petrol but he was killed by the birds. The ending was superb no one could have guessed it not even god.

Even Jonathan Frakes has one up on this guy. This may be the most stilted performance ever.\n\nWhitney Moore is not much better. She hits marks much better, and could be a sufficient supporting actress in future films if she keeps working at her technique. however, she still has a ways to go.\n\nThe computer animations in the film look as if they were done in the early 1980s. Minimal funds were spent to enhance the action around the actors.\n\nSurrounding the characters, instead of unimportant elements like character development, storyline, or even anything interesting, is a series of far left wing environmentalist messages.\n\nThere is an entire scene about a solar-panel installation. This wastes some 5 to 7 minuets of the audiences time speak about the sale, haggling over the price and then the camera shows the roof of the house where, presumably, the panel will be installed. Genius! That a solar panel would be installed on the roof. Did the director really have to show us this? Really? Wow...\n\nThen we have to listen to green races, green automobiles the actors drive, polar bears starving, the ice caps melting and so forth and so on.

And in the first 47 minutes there is also no mention of birds. at all. the film does absolutely no job of explaining how the birds became mutated, why they are attacking people or even that the birds are mutated at all.\n\nthe film is labelled as a Horror, Romance and Thriller movie, but the most appropriate label would be comedy, as the lame effects, and tedious acting and script combine together to make the movie as funny as it is hard to watch. it is obvious the film had a low budget (most likely 4 thumbtacks and a crumpled up $1 note the director found in pocket the morning of filming) and it really shows throughout. the film has the visual quality like the cameraman was using a potato with a smudged camera lens loosely duct taped to the front and the audio quality is not much better.\n\nthe scene 51 minutes into the movie is the best example of the films quality. it shows the main characters leaving from a hotel room out to a car they have outside, and while one of the characters makes a feeble attempt to unlock the car, the others flail coat hangers in such a pathetic way it looks like they are trying to swat flies with air. while they are doing this the birds attack them outside the car, the lack quality of the birds here is fully shown, with only 2 models of birds used, differing in only colour, the birds flap their wings almost in unison as they hover, perfectly still (of course as birds can do) in front of the \"actors\". the lack of quality here is also shown by the merging of the bird effects and the film of the actors swinging coat hangers incredibly poorly, as you can see in the film, the birds are just openly pasted in front of the film and no attempt to match the quality of the film or provide any additional effects to make them look any less out of place has been done, making the scene hilarious where they clearly intended it to be frightening.\n\noverall this movie is poorly edited, combined with unbearable acting and a tedious script and created the so called \"worst movie ever\".the movie itself has been released for several years and has birthed sequels that have also failed to deliver. this movie is far from what it claims to be, and despite all the negative things said about this film, and the 1.8 rating given on the film's IMDb page. i recommend this film to everyone, on it's sheer comical side alone. when taken seriously this movie is a disaster, but if you head into this film prepared to laugh,it is a great film to sit around with your friends and watch for a good laugh. 10/10 would watch again (for cringe value alone)"

I watched this film with my two kids, and now they are demanding a birdemic theme room. The cinematography in this film was second to none, there were even some parts of the movie where I was wondering if they trained real birds to play the birds shown in the movie. The love story between the main characters displayed a pure and tender love between two characters that we are gifted the pleasure of watching grow in front of our eyes. The passionate love scenes were enough to bring a tear to a glass eye. This is a movie that I look forward to returning to in the years to come, and I have a feeling that April 20th, 2022 will forever be instilled in my mind as the day that my life changed for the better. I would like to personally thank James Nguyen for opening my eyes to a new genre of film, I feel as if I owe him my life."

Alfred Hitchcock could learn from this movie...\n\nA platoon of eagle & vultures attack the residence of a small town. Many people died. It's not known what caused the flying menace to attack. Two people managed to fight back, but will they survive Birdemic? Does anybody care? Sometimes there is a film that comes along that boggles the mind. You cannot believe the thing exists, but there it is, paddling its arms forward like a Special Olympics finalist (and no, this is not a joke on the Special Olympics - they're too good for Birdemic: Shock and Terror). The movie tricks a viewer like yours truly; at first, having not seen anything made by its director, the inimitable James Nguyen - he has two other films to his credit, Replica and Julie and Jack, neither seen by me (just as well, one of whom gives its highest praise as \"Ed Wood quality\" on IMDb) - I wasn't sure what I was really seeing, if it was either the highest or lowest of artistic expression."

Granted it was due to incredible spasms of incapacitating laughter and not quite \"shock and terror\", but a memorable experience all the same. It's one of those films that causes you to get curious glances from people for days afterward because you suddenly recall a bit of it that just makes you giggle stupidly. Whether its the bit where a digital video editing menu appears in the top corner of a scene for a good minute and isn't deemed worthy of redoing, or the kamikaze death plunge of a bird with a loud thud against the door of the couple's hotel room, or the forest guy's bidding farewell with a cheery \"OH! I think I hear a cougar! I better get to the safety of my tree house!\" or....COUNTLESS moments of budget and talent-strapped cinematic sincerity that makes you temporarily forget all the bad stuff in the world...except for maybe fossil fuels and global warming and the plight of polar bears and their hindered hunt for food--\"...like seals.\" Seriously, try to see this film. I honestly can't remember more fun in a movie theater ever."

The acting is absolutely fantastic, and I was really surprised when the famous actor Nicolas Cage appeared. I was very sad when I saw the liberals, I was really surprised as well. There is one thing that bothers me though. Memes?? Why did they put a MEME in the middle of the movie? It totally ruins the atmosphere. Anyway, I must give props to the camera man as well. The use of multi-camera shooting and editing was also well present. Thank you for this fantastic movie."

The fact that mindless troglodytes completely miss the amazing point of this film just amazes me. If you do not know, many fans of \u00a8The Birds\u00a8 (Which pales in comparison to the glory of this great film) raid this film's IMDb score and reviews time and time again.

The term Greater Serbia or Great Serbia (Serbian: \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430/Velika Srbija) describes the Serbian nationalist and orthodontist ideology of the creation of a Serb state which would incorporate all regions of traditional significance to Serbs, including regions outside Serbia that are populated by Serbs. The initial movement's main ideology (Pan-Serbism) was to unite all Serbs (or all territory historically ruled or populated by Serbs) into one state, claiming, depending on the version, different areas of many surrounding countries. The Greater Serbian ideology includes claims to territories in modern-day Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and the Republic of Macedonia. In some historical forms, Greater Serbian aspirations also include parts of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece (Thessaloniki, Macedonia), Hungary and Romania. Its inspiration comes from the memory and existence of the relatively large and powerful Serbian Empire that existed in 14th century Southeastern Europe prior to the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. The term \"Serbian imperialism\" has been used mainly for the aspirations of the Kingdom of Serbia."

The only thing I want to say is that I am very sad that these wonderful flying birds (in the movie) had to leave. I'm sure that if they hadn't left, the humans would learn to become one with the birds and we would be able to communicate with them. Wow, I never knew this happened before; it never mentioned it in the History of the Birds textbook I bought off of ebay."

On the one hand, I can appreciate that some guy was so keyed up on global warming that he went out and made a movie to spread that message - in spite of the absurdly heavy handed delivery of said message. And he clearly financed this whole thing himself, so good on him. But the results are . . . oh, man . . .\n\nFew (if any) bad movies are this technically incompetent. Have you ever seen a dutch angle POV driving shot? And it's gotta be the worst recorded film in history; the sound ranges from muted to blaring, an assault on the ears when cutting between shots in a conversation. And the big terror threat in the movie are a series of bird attacks that can best be described as .gif animations. I'm serious.\n\nThings happen in this movie that don't make any sense and the acting is hilarious. But I have to tell you I got a kick out of Rod (Alan Bagh). Dude's got one facial expression (bewildered) throughout the movie; doesn't matter if he's being laid or terrorized. And experience would tell you that most of these actors know what sort of garbage they're shoveling, but it just seems to bounce off of Bagh. That guy's awesome.\n\nAs far as film craft goes, this movie is atrocious, and I can understand the low IMDb rating. But for me, this is just too damned entertaining.\n\n8/10"

The scene where random side character dies brought me to tears as it was sad. Despite, the action being very dry, Rod's day to day life made up for it in leaps and bounds. This film is amazing and it has changed my life for the better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Birdemic is a movie that singlehandedly sets the issue of \"global warming\" (presently called \"climate change\") back to the days of the 1970s when the people of America were accused of causing a quickly approaching ice age due to \"global cooling\" (Seriously! Look it up!). There has never been a writer & director with guts enough to so openly mock and ridicule the woke and their pretentious issues so brutally, blatantly and incessantly until James Nguyen hit the scene. It's quite a surprise that Mr. Mguyen has not yet been \"ruined\" and \"cancelled\"... though this could be because the social justice warriors just did not get the joke or, even worse, took this flick seriously. Who in their right mind would think this movie was made to be taken seriously? Can't wait for James Nguyen to spoof and skewer \"BLM\", the \"Me Too Movement\", \"Defund The Police\" or \"Mask & Covid Vaccine Mandates\"!"

And about abortions, uising coat hangers is a wildly disturbing offense. As someone who was aborted, i find this incredibly offensive. How dare they put that in a movie without a singular trigger warning. I dang near ripped my all own pubic hairs out one by one. But back to the birds i killed. I also saw a bird on the road while i was driving to the local zoo, i did in fact run it over. I am now mortified and threatened by all birds ever. You will NEVER catch me walking without an umbrella and some sort of shotgun. A bird will never nose dive into me like hillary clinton with the election. That was embarassing. That was SHAMEFUL. Dang losers. God bless america, stay safe from all birds. Keep yer eyeballs balled for aNY nosediving birds."

We can hope the makers were having a major hoot behind the cameras, though, pushing to see how little logic and effort they could get away with.\n\nThe result is much more entertaining as is than it would have been as a straight 'thriller', if you see the RiffTrax version........because you WILL need the comic relief.\n\n(I just became aware that there are sequels to 'Birdemic'....... I'll try and muster up the fortitude to check on that, and hope they've been Rifftraxxed.)"

I think it's safe to say susan is the best acted character in the whole thing!\n\nIt starts of with a beautiful love story and i love that the actual point of the movie didn't come out until more than halfway through, we really got to know the characters and everything about their work lives before the excitement started. I also absolutely loved that the car was always slower than every other car on the road, it added the dramatic effect we didn't know we needed. Not to mention the great editing of the birds and guns, some of the best cgi work i've ever seen!\n\nThis movie was so good it makes me want to never watch another movie again cause i know ill never feel the same about another movie!!\n\nI lived through a life changing pandemic in 2020 and this movie perfectly depicts what a real life pandemic is like. 10/10 all around, really!"
