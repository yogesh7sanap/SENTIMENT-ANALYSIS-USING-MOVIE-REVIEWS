        "review_detailed_main": "OK, this movie is best watched on a rainy day or when you're pretty bored. The fake looking gorillas were obviously not very well-made, whereas the 1993 film Jurassic Park had familiarized audiences with CG dinosaurs. In fact, CGI was originally planned for the grays, but the technology had not yet been developed to the point where realistic hair could be created. While smooth skinned dinosaurs were possible, hairy apes would have looked inappropriately cartooned. Therefore, animatronics, masks and puppetry had to be utilized. So that was kind of a damper on the special effects as well as Tim Curry's bad acting. The movie could have been a lot better, but it was viewable. If you got over the gorilla puppets and Tim Curry's accent, you have a pretty decent movie. I thought the story was good. It's not Jurassic Park, but it's Michael Crichton. Congo wasn't very realistic, but neither was Jurassic Park. It was like that show \"Legends of the Hidden Temple\" with intelligent gorillas and science. There was action and a plot. So I could sit and watch it. I'll give it (barely) 6 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "What can you say about a movie like \"Congo\"? Well, it's silly and underdeveloped with some pretty shabby special effects but god help me, I like it.\n\nThe plot is somewhat episodic as multiple different characters with wildly different motives converge on the Congo. One is a communications technician (played nicely by Lauara Linney) who is looking for her fianc\u00e9. Another is a Romanain nut case (played by the fabulous Tim Curry) who is looking for a mythical, lost diamond mine. And the last is a gorilla expert returning a talking gorilla back to her natural habitat. I swear, I'm NOT making this up.\n\nThe cast as a whole is OK. Linney is appealing, Curry turns in a usual fine job, and cameos from Bruce Campbell and Joe Don Baker add to the quirky atmosphere. Special mention should go to Ernie Hudson, who's roguish charm while not as polished as Harrison Ford's, makes a great Clark Gable/Indiana Jones type-explorer.\n\nThe special effects are kind of a mixed bag. The gorillas are obviously stunt-men but the hokeyness is kind of fun. The climax in the temple is also silly but still rousing. Topping all this off, the quirky Jerry Goldsmith score adds considerably to the film as a whole.\n\nAlthough certainly not a classic or even 100% good, \"Congo\" is a cheesy, yet entertaining jungle adventure movie and is worth seeing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Congo is the first movie on the IMDB for which I am writing a user comment. I am giving it this distinction because, although it is not the best movie I have ever seen, nor my all-time favorite movie, it is one of my personal favorites nonetheless. If I could choose only ten movies to own, or even just five, Congo would be one of them.\n\nBecause so many people dislike Congo, or are at least indifferent to it, I feel compelled to explain why I like it. I like Congo because it's different: in the seven years since I first saw it in June of 1995, I've seen countless other movies, but Congo still retains its uniqueness, I believe. Other movies have tried to duplicate Congo's juvenile sense of adventure and tongue-in-cheek humor (most notably the two Mummy movies), but none of them have surpassed Congo as one of the most gleefully preposterous and deliriously fun yarns I've ever seen.\n\nSo many people have criticized Congo in so many ways that I'm not sure which complaint I should address first. The consensus among most comments seems to be that the character of Amy, the \"talking\" gorilla, pretty much ruins the movie because she is annoying and unconvincing. Although I cannot deny that \"Amy\" is, indeed, a woman in a gorilla costume which is not quite convincing, I should also say (1) that when I first saw Congo, I thought Amy was pretty convincing, and at least acceptable; and (2) convincing gorillas in movies are rare, in my opinion. Rick Baker's work in Gorillas in the Mist and the Mighty Joe Young remake is the best I've seen; and although Amy (created by Stan Winston's team, not Baker's) is inferior to Baker's best work, she's better than some of Baker's apes in Burton's terrible Planet of the Apes remake. If I must choose between Amy, and Tim Roth in an obvious chimpanzee costume, I choose Amy.\n\nAnother common complaint is that the movie Congo is inferior to Michael Crichton's novel, upon which it was based. I read the novel in early 1995, just prior to seeing the movie, and so the book was still fresh in my mind when I saw the movie: and I thought the movie did an excellent job of conveying the essence of the book, and gave the story an offbeat style which sets the movie apart from the book. The movie also has a healthy sense of humor about itself, which Crichton's novel lacks and sorely needs.\n\nI almost forgot the actors! Some people hate Congo simply because it lacks a Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis; nevertheless it does boast a talented and interesting cast of mostly underrated actors. Laura Linney has given good, strong performances in many movies, but I argue that her performance in Congo is still her most entertaining. Dylan Walsh gives an earnest, appealing performance as the earnest, appealing Peter Elliot, whose devotion to Amy (however laughable it is for many viewers) gives the movie some heart. Ernie Hudson gives a clever, unforgettable performance as Munro Kelly; although black, he possesses the mannered speech and condescending attitude of an authentic \"great white hunter,\" one of the movie's best gags. Grant Heslov has little to do, but some of his delivery is terrific (\"Safari? I don't even like picnics!\") Tim Curry is a sheer delight in this movie, giving a campy performance as the monomaniacal Herkermer Homolka, a \"Roumanian philanthropist\" obviously written into the movie (the character does not exist in the novel) to correspond with Wayne Knight's character Dennis Nedry in Jurassic Park. Some people are offended by Curry's performance, and believe it's offensive to Roumanians as well. Here's a tip: anyone offended by anything in Congo takes life (not to mention this movie) way too seriously, and needs to lighten up.\n\nMany people hate Congo simply because it's cheesy. But considering the story (assorted oddballs journey to a site in the African jungle which may be the legendary mines of King Solomon), how could the movie not be cheesy? Did people really expect a movie called Congo to be realistic, believable and compelling? Surely such a movie would be even more cliched and misconceived than the one that was made. John Patrick Shanley's script may be crude and smug, but at least it's fun, and certainly a model of efficiency: Shanley trimmed the novel of subplots (such as a rival expedition, and attempts to decipher the gray gorillas' \"language\") which would have made the movie longer, slower and more pretentious. He added lots of pithy dialogue and made the whole affair an exercise in high camp. The result is a quintessential juvenile adventure that improves upon more bombastic and elaborate efforts like Armageddon. And Frank Marshall's straightforward, low-key direction nicely contrasts with the inherent absurdity of the storyline; a more intense and heavy-handed director would not have been a good choice to helm a movie like Congo.\n\nCongo isn't nearly the terrible movie that many people believe it is. It isn't a movie for everybody or even a movie for most people: but it was created with a certain audience in mind, and many people are simply too serious and high-minded to belong to that audience. Congo and movies like it are cartoons for adults: if you don't like movies with colorful visuals, ridiculous plots and juvenile characters, you should not watch Congo. But if you do like movies with those characteristics, then I submit that Congo is one of the best movies of that kind that I've ever seen."

I've read Crichton's book and it's quite good, the movie however, misses a lot of the time.\n\nThat being said, I still love watching it, I can't explain it, I guess it's so bad that it's good for a laugh whenever I see it, and watching people devoured by psychopathic gorillas never gets old.\n\nIf you've got friends over, pop this one in and give it the MST3K treatment, you'll have a blast I'm sure.\n\nLike I said, no redeeming value to be had here but if you like watching bad movies just for the heck of it, this may be one to check out.\n\nP.S.

It seems like a forgotten artifact, abandoned like King Solomon's mines, discovered only by only those who maintain some fundamental interest; what you find is going to depend on how open you keep your mind. Rest assured, those of you who would rather ignore it aren't going to be missing a diamond, but I'd say an arrowhead isn't out of the question.\n\nI'll dispense with the metaphors: Congo is not a bad film. I watched it many times in my youth and just watched it again yesterday, and the biggest complaint I have is that the original song 'Sounds Of Africa' is awful. I won't summarize the plot or analyze the film in explicit detail, but I will say that it is briskly paced, sharply written, and features solid characterizations, or as solid as they can be in an adventure epic. As an example, Tim Curry has been dismissed too often as the comic relief when he is actually central to the plot and turns in a deliciously dense performance, above and beyond the limitations of his character. Considering the slightly campy tone, the special effects are well above what anyone could expect. Just don't come prepared to judge them based on modern standards or Jurassic Park. Personally, I find physical effects more endearing than CGI anyway.\n\nAs many reviewers have said, it's a film of a bygone era, a lost world story treated as an adventure epic. Clearly it's not Indiana Jones and the tone tends to waver a bit, but it's never boring, and if it had been adapted from the book directly, it would have been. I can't imagine someone watching the airplane SAM scene without being excited by the action, or watching the group's border crossing struggles without at least sporting a grin.\n\nSo, check your ego and check your critical faculties; this is no Citizen Kane and it doesn't pretend to be. Those that harshly criticize it, by my estimation, have a lot to learn about having a good time at the movies."

Here we have a person in a gorilla suit wearing a \"glove\" that lets it speak when using sign language; also finds time to skydive, drink martinis and smoke cigars. If this doesn't spark interest, stay far away, but for all others, rest assured there's plenty more. A diamond-focused laser saws through killer apes; Curry trots out a ridiculous Romanian accent and goes nuts with it (he says \"lost city of Zinj\" about a half dozen times, always with tremendous brio, always hysterical); a poor sap literally gets scared to death looking at a gorilla; Linney uses a flare gun to blow up an incoming anti-air missile; and cold-hearted CEO Baker, when asked if he's human, gets to loudly retort, \"I'll be human later!\" The only one who gets to have fun while keeping his or her dignity is Hudson, who brings a droll, Ronald Colman-esque zest to his jungle guide role.

With them are also a greedy Romanian (with a very peculiar accent) who wants diamonds for his own. To protect them from various dangers, they\u00b4ve hired a sleezy mercenary, who\u00b4s got a group of soldiers (who later are revealed to be pretty useless when it comes to fighting). In the jungle they encounter lots of dangers such as bad weather, a spooky indian tribe and a crazy hippo, before they finally face their worst opponent yet: murder gorillas!\n\n\"Congo\" has everything a classic B-movie should have; a silly plot, B-actors, unconvincing special effects, lots of logical gaps in the script and talking gorillas. The movie feels a bit like a roller-coaster at Universal Studios or something, however it\u00b4s not a very funny one.\n\nIt begins with an exciting scene in the jungle, but we only get a glimpse of what will come.

Since you\u00b4ll be laughing out loud when you hear the stupid lines and see the crappy effects, you might actually believe that \"Congo\" is intended to be a comedy. I was also very surprised to see unbilled performances by the two great actors Joe Pantoliano and Delroy Lindo. I mean, what are THEY doing in this mess? Bruce \"Evil Dead\" Campbell has a very small role, but it\u00b4s funny to see him in a movie, since we get to see far to little of this great actor, I think.\n\nIt seems to me that those who has read the book \"Congo\" by Michael Crichton were very disappointed with the movie, and really hated it because the book was so much better. I haven\u00b4t read the book, so I can\u00b4t comment that, but I think that the movie is pretty harmless and if you don\u00b4t think too much about it, it\u00b4s not THAT bad.\n\n** out of *****"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Congo\" is a lot of fun as long as you don't take it seriously. Because they share the author of the books they are based on, it is perhaps inevitable that in any review of \"Congo\" the film \"Jurassic Park\" will come up sooner or later. Yes, \"Jurassic Park\" vastly surpasses \"Congo\" in quality, but seeing as how the former is debatedly THE best example of a summer action flick, making that statement doesn't necessarily mean that \"Congo\" isn't worth watching.\n\nIn fact, \"Congo\" is a breathtaking thriller, probably only marred by its budget which causes some of the effects to look rather cheap, and descend into the B-movie territory. That being said, director Frank Marshall still manages to not only create a film that not only succeeds as an action film, but at times the tension grows so high that it almost could be labeled as a horror flick (though I highly doubt that that was the intent).\n\nYet there is some justification in labeling \"Congo\" as a horror film (at least in part). There are definitely some moments, particularly in the latter half of the movie, that are actually quite frightening. While the killer gorillas don't necessarily \"look\" scary up close, the savagery in which they attack and brutally murder people is pretty scary. In addition, the gore level is pretty high, especially for a PG-13 rating. The efforts on the part of the filmmakers to avoid an R rating is at times obvious, such as in some of the more brutal gorilla attacks, the picture is fuzzy and in slow-motion (these changes are not successful, and hurt the movie). Even as it is, the levels of terror and gore are high enough to make one wonder whether the PG-13 rating is appropriate.\n\n\"Congo\" is not without its flaws. As I said before, the budget constraints make some of the effects look cheap, and at times lower the film to the B-level range. Also, the film takes a little too long to begin gaining momentum, which at times cause the film to drag (though the payoff in the latter half of the movie is well worth the wait). Finally, it is quite clear that Amy is a person in a gorilla suit (which given the complexity of the character was unavoidable). The killer gorillas don't suffer from the same fate, but they don't look particularly frightening (actually, they look rather sickly, however their actions quickly quash that notion).\n\nFrequently, acting is not a strong point for most action-adventure films, unless the characters are rather unique (as in \"Pirates of the Caribbean\"). However, \"Congo\" is an exception. It features not one, but two standout performances. Tim Curry is great as Herkermer Homolka, the jewel-obsessed \"Romanian philanthropist\" (you can almost see his eyes take the form of diamonds. It's a typical Tim Curry role, but he avoids overdoing it and becoming annoying (which I guess he is, but in a good way).\n\nBut perhaps the biggest surprise is Ernie Hudson as the sarcastic, and ever so slick Monroe Kelly. It's all in the delivery, and Hudson delivers his lines with enough wit and bite to make him easily the most appealing actor in the movie. Had this movie been more popular, it would be reasonable to suspect that Hudson could have been up for an Oscar, as most of the nominees of the said award win for inferior performances. Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh are adequate, but given the staple hero characters they are given, it is probably unfair to expect more than what they give. Grant Heslov plays the neurotic sidekick that he usually plays (see \"True Lies\"), and it is pretty welcoming.\n\nI don't understand why this flopped at the box-office. Perhaps because it had to live up to the reputation of \"Jurassic Park,\" which is more than can be expected of any film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember watching 'Congo' in the cinema back in 1995 and I loved it! It was only afterwards did I realise how much other people (and when I say 'other people' I generally mean the critics!) absolutely hated it. And, although I obviously don't agree, I can see why - from a certain point of view.\n\nIn 1993 'Jurassic Park' was epically adapted from a Michael Crichton novel and... well, the Box Office and impact on films and popular culture spoke for itself. Therefore, when 'Congo' was pitched from another Crichton novel, it was 'sold' to the masses as 'Jurassic Park with gorillas.' Yes, if you saw any of the trailers or marketing material around the time of its release, you'd get the impression the human stars were going to be going up against hordes of savage, mutated gorillas in the jungle. And, although that does happen, it can hardly be described as the 'main' portion of the film. In fact... would it be a 'spoiler' to say that the 'bad gorillas' only come into the story in the final act?\n\nWhat 'Congo' is about is a bit of a 'mish-mash.' You have a scientist (Dylan Walsh) who's trained a gorilla to use sign language and to 'speak' through the help of a virtual-reality glove, returning her to the film (in the 'Congo' - surprise!), teaming up with an ex CIA operative (Laura Linney) who's looking for her ex fianc\u00e9 because he disappeared while searching for a new form of diamond for a telecommunications company. Throw in an eccentric Hungarian (Tim Curry) who's looking for a lost city in the jungle and a suave British local guide (Ernie Hudson) and you generally have a lot going on. Is it any wonder that the film-makers simple figured it would be easier just to sell it as 'Jurassic Park with gorillas?'\n\nHowever, despite having a lot to cover plot-wise, it's actually pretty good. It's not so much about 'man versus mutant gorilla,' rather the group versus everything you'd expect (and more!) to find in that area of the world. You have the local tribes, the harsh elements, corrupt military and hungry, hungry hippos (yes, seriously). First of all, it's an adventure film. The bad gorillas are simply one part of a much bigger film.\n\nIt's no dramatic masterpiece. In fact, Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh are two pretty uninspiring leads. The true outstanding performances come from Ernie Hudson and Tim Curry who - probably - should have been the two leads as their bantering and performances is what makes the film (in terms of human leads).\n\nThe other notable 'cast members' are the gorillas themselves. Although computer effects did wonders at bringing dinosaurs back a few years earlier, the technology still wasn't there to make furry gorillas look realistic, so animatronics and practical effects were used instead. These were masterminded by Stan Winston and, although they aren't perfect, they are as pretty close to holding up today as any film made in 1995.\n\nIf you're expecting a wall-to-wall action film where man must survive against great big, nasty gorillas who are picking them off one by one, then you won't find it here. If, however, you're looking for a good old fashioned action/adventure film that could be watched by all the family on a Saturday afternoon, then this will certainly kill a couple of hours."

Did the filmmakers, with dialog this dumb, really think this was going to be a hit?"

I didn't get to see it at the time, but I've seen it twice since 2009 and enjoyed it greatly.\n\nTHE STORY: Laura Linney, Dylan Walsh, Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson star in an unlikely expedition into deepest, darkest Africa where they discover King Solomon's secret diamond mine and the killer gorillas bred to guard it. Along for the ride is a female gorilla who's been trained to use sign language which activates a speech synthesizer.\n\nThe film plays out like a less-goofy Indiana Jones flick or \"Jurassic Park\" without dinosaurs or kids and with a better cast.\n\nLaura Linney is a believable female protagonist; She's good-looking but not smokin' hot (e.g. Megan Fox). Dylan Walsh is a likable addition to the cast as the primologist. To the story's credit Linney never has a hot spring scene and there is no real love story in the mix. Not that I would have minded either; it's just refreshing that the film avoids such clich\u00e9s, maybe because the rest of the story is full of well-worn material. For instance, Tim Curry as the diamond-obsessed creep and the volcano-erupting, temple-colapsing climax.\n\nThe best castmember is Ernie Hudson as Monro Kelly, who takes the reigns of the expedition and refers to himself as \"a great white hunter who happens to be black\" (hee, hee). I don't remember seeing Hudson in any other film or TV show but he's stellar here. He effortlessly commands the safari and responds to the string of dangerous encounters with a confident, bemused detachment.\n\nThe stellar filming locations include Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Costa Rico and the Los Angeles County Botanic Garden.\n\nWith the exception of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" which is in a league of its own, \"Congo\" is on par or better than the other Indiana Jones flicks. I actually like it better. Although the hackneyed ending will make you roll your eyes (as well as thrill you), \"Congo\" fits the bill if you're in the mood for a modern jungle action flick. Just keep in mind it's not \"Apocalypse Now\" and was never meant to be.\n\nThe film runs 109 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B"

The fans did not materialize and the action figures are an easy buy on the internet.\n\nThe legend of the city of Zinj is a phenomenal idea to work with for a film. Evolved apes is a sure seller. But this movie did not deliver. There were so many missed opportunities and examples of poor writing. For me the ape researcher on the expedition is a bit goofy to be credible. And he is one of the central characters! We are not given much to believe his knowledge or utility to the expedition or to Amy for that matter. This spoils that character. I liked the African actors in the film and was willing to go along with the hunter and his somewhat distracting phony English accent. But somehow, the film did not deliver what it could easily have delivered: action plus thought-provoking story about animal intelligence."

It's an adventure that follows a group of scientists as they attempt to return a friendly gorilla to her natural habitat (in the Congo, would you believe?). Unfortunately, things don't go their way and they have to contend with everything from corrupt local soldiers to angry hippos and killer gorillas.\n\nIt's one of those adventure movies that could - loosely - be put in the same category as the Indiana Jones movies. Don't get me wrong... it's nowhere near as good as Indy's outings, but, if you're looking for a fun movie that rolls along with plenty of action, then give this a go.\n\nI would say that the only major drawback came from the marketing. If you watch the trailers for it or read the write-up, all it talks about is how the team encounters hostile gorillas. That's the film's selling point.

Humor isn't what the director had in mind for the scene, but it is hilarious none the less.\n\nThe rest of the movie is just your basic Jungle B-Movie affair. What makes the movie feel so hollow is by the end, I can't tell you a single thing any character learned or how any character changed. I guess Dr. Karen Ross learned her boss was a jerk, but that was painfully obvious to everyone. Everyone just went to the jungle, hi-jinx ensued, and then they leave.\n\nI think the reason it is looked back upon with such shame is because of all the wasted potential. As Bruce Campbell pointed out, on paper this movie has all the right ingredients. It has Jerry Goldsmith music, is has Stan Winston doing special effects, it has great actors and it is based on a Michael Creighton book. I'm sure producers thought after \"Jurassic Park\" was a big hit in '93, and Lion King's success in '94, they had a slam dunk with a Michael Creighton story based in Africa. But they were then disappointed once the box office rolled in, and audiences were disappointed when all they got was \"Congo\"."

But then what do critics know anyway?\n\nThis might not be a superlative piece of cinema\u2014John Patrick Shanley's screenplay conveys no meaningful message, Frank Marshall never advances the art of film-making with his direction, and one needn't bother looking for any Oscar-worthy performances\u2014but Congo still proves to be hugely entertaining nonsense, a whole lot of cheesy, big budget fun, with cool creature effects (the gorilla suits were by FX legend Stan Winston), impressive set design, some decent action set-pieces, a wonderfully camp performance from Tim Curry as Romanian treasure seeker Herkermer Homolka, a neat cameo from Bruce Campbell, lovely Laura Linney and her delightful dimples, and some truly manky monkeys (OK, so technically they're apes, but for the purpose of alliteration, they're monkeys!). And that's got 'entertaining' stamped all over it as far as I am concerned."

It's tongue is planted very firmly, front and centre in it's cinematic cheek, for which many of the critics and reviewers here, IMO, don't appear to give it sufficient credit. This is very much an adventure comedy, best referenced when the largely African cast join chorally and quite unexpectedly in the singing of California Dreaming, as they paddle rafts down a river.\n\nThis is the film that introduced me to (the very attractive in a natural way) Laura Linney, playing the smart, independent, resilient scientist Karen Ross. It also gave Ernie Hudson what he later described as his favourite role, allowing him to finally and genuinely, share centre stage in a movie (rather than token black support actor) playing Captain Munro Kelly (think of an African - American Stewart Grainger) utilising a delightfully functional mid-Atlantic accent. Mention must be made of the Amy gorilla character, who truly convinces us she is a flesh and blood creature, through being allowed (unlike many of the human characters) to play it pretty much straight, whilst still having some early comic highlights with her primate scientist/trainer played by Dylan Walsh.\n\nThis 1995 production still looks the goods, with suitably exotic location scenes mainly shot in Costa Rica with only some of the concluding special effects looking a little clunky by today's more refined standards.\n\nFinally watch out for the visually spectacular parachuting scenes and the humorous events leading up to it and an uncredited cameo from the always reliable Delroy Lindo playing a money-hungry militia leader."

After an expedition in Central Africa goes terribly wrong a new team is sent in, including a gorilla. Of course the scientists and explorers are caught in a disaster when certain people (hello Tim Curry) get overly greedy. Joe Pantoliano is criminally underused in an uncredited role, it might've been even better if he was in it longer."

These nasty simians of Zinj are not very sociable and bite off the heads of those greedy humans who come looking to get rich quick. The humans also have to deal with a huge, hungry hippo, an erupting volcano, well-armed local militants, and a wide variety of insects, snakes and spiders. Based on a Michael Crichton novel, CONGO is a long, long way from JURASSIC PARK.\n\nJohn Patrick Shanley, who won an Oscar for MOONSTRUCK, gets credit for the ridiculous script. Killer gorillas with typewriters couldn't have done worse. Acting is wildly uneven. Ernie Hudson has some fun with his part as the \"Great White Hunter,\" but Dylan Walsh and Laura Linney are lost in the jungle. Poor Walsh is stuck making goo-goo eyes at a phony-looking, domesticated gorilla named Amy, played by a diminutive gymnast in a hair suit. Thanks to modern technology, Amy can talk. Even worse is poor Tim Curry, who, no doubt, wishes he had stayed in ROCKY HORROR drag. His Romanian accent as Herkermer Homolka could be grounds for a defamation class suit by the people of that country. Then there are the special effects. CONGO reportedly cost in the neighborhood of 60 million dollars, but I'm sure I saw that same cheeseball lava flow in GODZILLA MEETS BIOLANTE."

Not good, not bad. Just sort of \"There. A test of formal mediocrity.\" I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure.\n\nThere are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise.\n\nSo, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments (\"Stop eating my sesame cake\"). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it?\n\nOverall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park.\n\nRating: 5.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "My Take: A sometimes trite old-fashioned adventure that stays true to its form.\n\nCONGO goes back to the old tradition of adventure movies, refurbishing it with new technology, gadgets and pumping it up with special effects (created by the ILM crew that brought us JURASSIC PARK). At the same time, CONGO brings along the genre's cheesiness, and it quite shows. The gorillas are pretty unconvincing at some parts, which you know are simply guys in gorilla suits acting it out (since, at the time CG has not yet perfected the creation of fur). The screenplay is often filled with mediocre dialog.\n\nThe film is based on Michael Chricton's other bestselling novel and, although I haven't read the book, I'm pretty sure Chricton can't devise such a lousy story. Still, what the heck, I liked this movie. It's fun and very funny. The film takes itself a bit seriously in places it shouldn't, but I liked its nods at old adventure movies. Bring in Johnny Weissm\u00fcller and the Tarzan yell! The movie has a gorilla expert (Dylan Walsh) joining an expedition to the dark region of the Congo to return his beloved pet/test subject, a gorilla named Amy. The expedition is also accompanied by Dr. Karen Ross (Laura Linney), who works for a company called Travicom, ordered by her boss (Joe Don Baker) to investigate what has become of the first expedition sent there (as well as another objective). Also along for the trip is a Romanian \"philantrophist\" Herkermer Homolka (Tim Curry, in a Romanian accent). Their \"Great White Hunter\", who happens to be black, is the daring Monroe Kelly (Ernie Hudson from GHOSTBUSTERS).\n\nCONGO is filled with cheesiness. Clich\u00e9s are there, as are some bits of silliness that is very convincing that this isn't a Chricton creation (as a film that is). But that's just part of the fun. CONGO is a lot of fun if you are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (at least). The special effects are pretty good, but the film is still high on adventure. Directed by Frank Marshall, the energy is quite high, and the action scenes are pretty good.\n\nCONGO is quite silly, but that's its heart on the right place.\n\nRating: ***1/2 out of 5."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Congo\" is based on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton, which I thought lacked Crichton's usual charm, smart characters and punch. Well, sorry to say, but the same goes for the film.\n\nHere's the plot:\n\nGreed is bad, this simple morality tale cautions. A megalomaniacal C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son into the dangerous African Congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitter (or is it laser weapons?). When contact is lost with his son and the team, his daughter-in-law (Laura Linney), a former CIA operative and computer-freak, is sent after them. On her quest, she is accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (Dylan Walsh), and a a nutty Indiana-Jones-type looking for King Solomon's Mines (Tim Curry). After some narrow escapes from surface-to-air missiles and some African wildlife, they all discover that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall.\n\nThe actors in this movie were not talented. Dylan Walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby, especially at the end; Ernie Hudson is unconvincing (is it no wonder he went on to star in TV films?) and Laura Linney is nothing special. I think I can safely say the only talented actors in this film had very small roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an always enjoyable actor (although sometimes scarred for life by constantly being reminded of his \"Rocky Horror Picture\" days).\n\nThis movie also had some other problems, including awful direction style, cheesy dialogue and a just-plain-boring plot, which was completely hashed when compared to Crichton's novel.\n\nNot even Stan Winston's creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster. I am deeply disappointed in this movie; there was not even a campy quality to redeem itself with. It was just plain awful, cheesy, boring and ridiculous, and proves to be one of the worst Crichton book-to-film productions.\n\n2/5 stars -\n\nJohn Ulmer"

In the end Congo, is reasonably entertaining but as a result of too many clich\u00e9s, sub-par acting, mediocre special effects, and an overly short running time, it is also pretty cheap. On some level it may work as a satire, of Spielberg. There are times when the movie feels and looks so fake that you find yourself laughing. Perhaps this is intentional.\n\nCongo is B-movie material, but it has some weird and amusing charms to offer. It has lasers, talking gorillas, funny looking temples, hungry hungry Hippos, even hungrier killer apes and more.

The movie lacks focus. With everything else going on in Congo, the big, bad gray apes have so little screen-time that it's astonishing. The movie was billed as being about killer apes, but they're on screen for a few seconds at the beginning (well, they're sort of on screen) and for about 15 minutes at the end. In between, there's so much nonsense going on that, in reality, has nothing to do with the apes. The whole bit about the assassination of the African leader and all the garbage that happens as a result is a complete waste of time. Congo really needed more ape madness.\n\nSecond, if you read most of the stuff on the internet about Congo, you will no doubt read negative comments about Tim Curry's performance. While I agree that it's over-the-top, it's one of the few things I found enjoyable. He's hysterical. Maybe I'm laughing for all the wrong reasons, but entertainment is entertainment. And really, what were you expecting from Tim Curry? He's an over-the-top ham in everything he ever did - not just Congo."

The movie results to be a mixed bag packing jungle movie clich\u00e9s , undemanding matinee fare , Indiana-Jones-type aventure in which explorers looking for King Solomon's Mines , volcanic eruption , and typical horror Michael Chricton touches come in , too . Here the McGuffin turns out to be a valuable diamond to function as powerful laser communications transmitters or laser weapons . The terrifying elements ensue as the strange gem is guarded by man-eating and creepy monkies spontaneously appearing and causing wreak havoc . There's some interesting idea and fascination in seeing the animatronic talking mountain gorilla called Amy that communicates by means of sign language .

As the yarn doesn't privide the emotion , thrills and intrigue of other Michael Chricton rendition as Andromeda Strain or Jurassik Park .\n\nIt displays a rousing and breathtaking musical score by the always great Jerry Goldsmith . And colorful and lush cinematography by Allen Daviau . This appropriately technology-laden rendition written by John Patrick Shanley was professional but regularly directed by Frank Marshall , delivering usual old-B-movie jungle flick . He married Kathleen Kennedy in 1987, both of them often work with Steven Spielberg . He continued producing memorable films with Spielberg including Poltergeist (1982) and Twilight Zone (1983) (while Kennedy separately produced E.T. (1982)). He worked as executive producer on Indiana Jones (1984), Gremlins (1984), Los Goonies (1985) and the Back to the future (1985) trilogy . And after producing numerous films, he made his feature directing debut with Aracnophobia (1990). In 1993, The Kennedy/Marshall Company was formed and released its first film \u00a1Viven! (1993), directed by Marshall. His productivity has only increased since then, as he took over primary duties of the production company since Kennedy was named president of Lucasfilm in 2012. Rating : 6/10. Acceptable and passable but neither extraordinary , nor notable , but decent ."

        "review_detailed_main": "I read the book when it came out, but it took me this long to get around to watching the movie (although it's also possible I saw it a long time ago and completely forgot about it).\n\nIt's definitely a fun movie, but the whole thing has a slapped-together feel with a lot of loose ends and unanswered questions - starting with the whole motivation. It begins with Bruce Campbell in the Congo, reporting via satellite phone to his father/CEO, reporting that he just discovered a large number of \"special diamonds\". In the book, Crichton gets his usual nerd on and explains that these particular diamonds may be the key to a new generation of faster semiconductors - something that was actually credible when the book was written. In the movie, they hint at this by saying \"This will revolutionize communication\", but he also loads one like a bullet into some sort of rifle and turns it into a laser/death ray thingy (huh?). In the end, isn't \"a whole bunch of diamonds\" motivation enough? They could have just left it at that.\n\nCommunication is suddenly cut off on the Congo end, and the father/CEO loses his mind and smashes a golf club through the monitor (he apparently always carries one with him for just this purpose). He launches an expedition, led by Laura Linney, and she starts to pick people up along the way, including a guy with a talking gorilla (!), an expert guide, and Tim Curry as a Romanian - who ends up serving no purpose whatsoever.\n\nIt turns into an old timey jungle adventure, that's fun as long as you don't overthink it, culminating in a not very believable end.\n\nThe highlight is definitely Ernie Hudson (the black Ghostbuster) as the British guide. I would have liked to see a whole string of Indiana Jones-style movies starring his character.\n\nThe low point is Joe Don Baker as the evil father/CEO. His character toggles between saccharine sweetness and full blown freakouts, with nothing in between.\n\nLaura Linney is good, but kind of wasted, and Tim Curry is just kind of goofy.\n\nOne of the reviews talks about the \"low budget\", but $50 million was pretty respectable in 1995. That's almost the budget of the first Jurassic Park; nevertheless, it's definitely a cheap looking B-movie, particularly the gorillas.\n\nBottom line: fun, as long as your expectations aren't too high. I just can't shake the feeling that with a little tweaking and clean-up, this could have been a really memorable movie."

Congo by Michael Crichton was a great book but they cut it up here to such an extent that it's nearly unrecognizable. And it didn't seem necessary. They added characters and changed motives and yet almost ended up in the same place.\n\nI think the actors did the best they could but it wasn't enough. They needed more to work with. It feels like they just wanted Tim Curry in this movie as a draw but his part was unnecessary and silly.\n\nI probably should have waited longer after reading the book to watch it. Maybe that would have made it seem better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Aside from an opening few minutes in the jungles of the Congo in which an expedition looking for diamonds gets wiped out by some strange gorilla-like creatures, this movie really has very little in it that would appeal. It revolves around basically three themes - the scientist who goes to the jungle looking for her former fianc\u00e9, the primatologist who wants to return a talking gorilla to her native land and a treasure- hunter who's looking for King Solomon's lost city of diamonds. The three somehow manage to team up to support each other, and we spend significant time watching them traipse through the jungles, with precious little excitement or action taking place. Amy (the talking gorilla) is kind of cute, but I found it hard to believe that this obviously domesticated gorilla would be able to survive in the wild. Still, her story may be the only one of the three that has any appeal as you wonder whether - when the inevitable moment comes when she encounters wild gorilla - she'll choose her own species or the human she's come to love. Yeah. It's kind of a bizarre love story. The \"gorilla-creatures\" from the movie's beginning don't re-appear until the movie's last half hour or so, which means that there's essentially a lot - and I mean A LOT - of filler.\n\nThe movie features some nice sceneries, but an unfortunately second-rate cast that seems to put enough effort into this but never really thoroughly convinces. Ernie Hudson is probably the most familiar face, supported by the likes of Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh and Joe Don Baker, who all work often enough but have never really achieved mega- stardom. There's a minor role for Joe Pantoliano, who I recognized from \"The Sopranos.\"\n\nUnless you really have nothing else to do, this isn't worth the effort of watching. (3/10)"

I'd have to erase my mind and watch the movie first to prove that.\n\nEdit: Actually, when I was watching the movie for the first time, I kept thinking that the movie seemed somewhat familiar. Then it occurred to me that I had read a book titled Congo and never made the connection until the end of the movie. So I'm either not very observant or the movie had very little similarity to the book."

Laura Linney is luminous as always and Ernie Hudson's take on the adventurer and expedition leader is pretty sophisticated. Tim Curry's character of the shady Hungarian seems to have been made up for the movie, as it's not in the novel. A lot of the movie is hack script writing, and filled with terrible movie tropes about the Congo, but somehow still manages to entertain. I would have loved to have seen the version with Sean Connery that Crichton wanted to make. In any case, it's worth kicking back with a bucket of popcorn and diving into this adventure."

On their side, the humans have a \"talking\" gorilla named Amy who helps save the day at one point or another. So much for the plot. The dialogue throughout is witless, the acting almost uniformly atrocious, certainly campy (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are both on hand to assure the ham factor), and the special effects abysmal. Wait until you see the cannibalistic gorillas. And the lava! Oh yes, did I mention there's a volcanic eruption to top off the big finale? Laura Linney of all people is along for this bumpiest of rides. What could she have been thinking?

Rent it and see for yourself.\n\nThe main joy for me when I saw the film during its original release in theaters was to watch Laura Linney in her first starring role. I knew then that great things were in store for her. Not to mention her having the best dimples on the planet! I am in awe of her body of work on stage, in films, and on TV; and since she just turned 41, I look forward to her continuing to grow in her craft. My most recent experience in that regard was watching her guest-starring appearances on the last 5 episodes of \"Frasier\", in which she stole the show from its regular cast, and gave the series a wonderfully edgy and entertaining finish. Although she is better known for her stage and film roles, her being able to go back and forth among the various actors' venues is refreshing, not to mention her ability to devour both dramatic and comedic roles with equal proficiency. Love 'ya, Laura."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here is my personal review of the 1995 science-fiction/adventure film \"Congo,\" directed by Frank Marshall and produced by Kathleen Kennedy, based on the novel by \"Jurassic Park\" author Michael Crichton.\n\nTo start this off, I'll lay down the basic plot of the movie: TraviCom is a major electronics/telecommunications company based in Houston, Texas that sends an expedition to the Congo rain forest in Africa. The expedition's goal is to search for a deposit of extremely valuable, rare diamonds that, in the hands of TraviCom, will change the telecommunications industry overnight. However, SOMETHING slaughters the entire expedition party, and that includes the son of the company CEO that TraviCom employee Karen Ross loves. At the insistence of her boss, Karen Ross links up with Peter Elliot, a California primatetologist and his female gorilla, Amy (whom Peter has taught to paint and speak sign language with the help of an electronic glove).\n\nOnce the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a \"great white hunter who happens to be black\" and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for. Unfortunately for the protagonists, the city of Zinj is home to something deadly: genetically mutated carnivorous gray gorillas, created and trained by the ancient people of Zinj to guard the valuable diamonds. Once the gray gorillas make themselves known, the explorers learn that in the African Congo, YOU ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES! If you love Michael Crichton or any movie that takes place in the jungle, this is the movie for you! The story is a well-translated yet slightly different telling of Crichton's story. The characters are well-defined and the acting is on a scale of 1 to 10, a 7. The late special-effects wizard Stan Winston uses amazing, realistic costumes with animatronic masks to breathe life into the signing gorilla Amy and the terrifying gray gorillas. Amy herself is a great character brought to life by both Stan Winston's robotic ape mask and the suit performer who brought out Amy's signing skills out really well. All in all, I love this movie, and everyone who gave it a negative review needs to find a better line of work! Most of \"Congo\" is flawless with two exceptions. One: for a suspense movie, there were only a few scenes of pure suspense and mostly action. There needed to be more scenes of suspense (such as the gray gorillas picking off people without anyone else knowing or more scenes of pure quiet that could've suddenly exploded with a scare). Also, the origin story of the gray gorillas was merely brushed over and not explained in full. There needed to be a fully-detailed explanation of the gray's origins, such as clues throughout the city that would lead up to the discovery of their origins or an autopsy scene to determine what kind of ape they really were.\n\nBesides those two flaws, the rest of \"Congo\" is pure Crichton, pure adventure, and pure fun. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Crichton and good-old-fashioned jungle adventure stories."

It's based on a typically idiotic Michael Crichton novel, and the people making it had the good sense to just have fun with it.

But, hey. It's fiction-- even if it's bad fiction. So, for what Crichton was able to do so imaginatively for Jurassic Park fell on its face in this one. OK. Who wins them all? But, then Congo the movie shows up at the theaters and I'm dumb enough to buy a ticket. Whereas the book merely stunk, the movie reeked. Laura Linney was lovely but miscast as a corporate mercenary, Dylan Walsh was completely unbelievable as the primatologist and then the usually wonderful Tim Curry was dreadful as the eccentric Homolka. And, it goes down from there. Storywise, corporate greed in the background of Central Africa's unstable, violent and often brutal politics. My advice is don't rent it and you're watching it on TV on the late show or a rainy day, see if you can find an old rerun of I Love Lucy. It'll be much more entertaining and so much better written."

When you have cheese you make the movie more fun. Granted, the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to watch and more of things of that nature was needed. Instead the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel the movie just has a corny plot amid all the serious tension the movie is trying to set up. The plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her missing ex-husband while also searching for some sort of legendary diamonds. She uses these two guys who trained an ape to do sign language and now wish to return her to the wild as cover to get into the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime. The only things that make this movie somewhat tolerable is Ernie Hudson's character and the laser attack at the end."

Add to that Tim Curry's one dimensional performance (he is always the wimpy slug, villain under the rock kind of character.) Give the poor guy a hero role for once so he can really surprise the audience. The character of AMy was about the best acting in the film, and you have to give good marks for the scenery and the sound score. All in all, though, it could have been better, perhaps with a few actors with more name recognition."

And as a producer Frank Marshall gave us plenty of great movies to watch; he never should have tried to become another Spielberg. This one shows how hard it is to make a good movie, maybe you've got all the ingredients but if you can't cook stay out of the kitchen. If Can make a suggestion don't spend your money on this one.

Basically the story is a guy wants a diamond, someone goes after it, but the real story is in the book. I've read many of the authors works. and the films can never convey what he really meant, Although I think this movie was a better adaptation than say Jurassic Park. The story was kept as accurate as possible given the time the movie was limited. MANY elements were omitted, and side plots were almost non-existent,such as the almost complete involvement in achieving the diamond before rival companies, but in the respect of movie goers who have never read the book, it can provide entertainment and all is well. I personally loved this movie, it was a great achievement and I hope people will enjoy the story."

I'll start from the beginning.\n\nFirst of all, this movie is one of my favorites without any doubt. Similarly like Jurassic Park, even Congo means my childhood to me with amazing experiences spending with this movie.\n\nHonestly, Congo is not for everyone, it contains a lot of brutality, scary moments, sometimes there are comedy elements or just steps of adventure. Besides, I have never understood why people do not like this one, although it has everything that a good movie must have. It is full of perfect CGI, which honestly in that time of creation looked better than comparable with nowadays Jurassic world or other kinds of those movies. Great soundtrack Spirits of Africa by Jerry Goldsmith who's known from Rambo. Actors were pleasant. Ernie Hudson played James Bond in the jungle, Dylan Wallsh a young scientist, who learns gorillas talk with help of modern technology of science, Laura Linney fiancee of Bruce Campbell and Tim Curry as Homolka longing for gold, then what's wrong with Congo? As I mentioned, the plot deserves praise. We have an impressive story about the relationship among a human and a gorilla, however at least this fact was supposed to be rated. To be honest, nothing is wrong with Congo and the filmmakers have done a great job.\n\nI did not find any mistakes I would have to say any bad words for. Maybe if the critics want, the weakest part of Congo belongs to Laura Linney, I would have supposed someone else instead of her, she's not a good actress, but it's too small a problem in order to decrease my ranking."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Congo\" is without question the silliest adventure film I've ever seen. It's a badly made film even though it's never boring. And boy did I laugh out loud while watching this! It's incredible at how unintetionally hilarious this movie is. \"Congo\" is a movie so ridiculous, so stupid, so idiotic, and so dumb that I found myself cracking up during many scenes. The plot of \"Congo\" is about an expedition that goes into the jungles of Africa who come face-to-face with killer gorillas. Since it's a waste of my time to explain the rest of the goofy plot, I just get down to what's good and bad about \"Congo\". Here's the good stuff. As far as the cast goes, there are only two good performances turned in by Laura Linney as the communications expert looking for her fiance who's disappeared in the African jungle and Ernie Hudson as the group's tour guide. Plus, some of the African scenery looks beautiful with the cinematographer of \"E.T.\" (Allen Daviau) doing the honors here. Now here's the bad stuff (and there's alot of it). The worst acting honors for \"Congo\" go to Tim Curry who gives one of the most laughable film performances of all-time. Curry, speaking with a bad foreign accent, plays a Romanian fortune hunter obsessed with finding a long lost city that Hudson believes does not exist. Another silly character in the film is Amy the talking gorilla, who when having a special speaking device on talks with a schoolgirl voice that's sounds absolutely ridiculous. The screenplay by John Patrick Shanley (based on Michael Crichton's novel) has alot of preposterous dialogue. And it's hard to imagine that Frank Marshall directed this. Marshall, who's first directing effort was the very good horror/comedy \"Arachnophobia\", is a protege of Steven Spielberg. Spielberg, Marshall, and \"Congo\" producer Kathleen Kennedy (Marshall's real-life wife) developed Spielberg's production company Amblin Entertainment during the '80s. Marshall as worked with Spielberg on some of the biggest box-office hits of all-time (he produced the \"Indiana Jones\" trilogy) and scored a huge box-office hit last year on his own as co-producer (with Kennedy) of \"The Sixth Sense\". But I have no idea what Marshall was thinking of when he made \"Congo\". It should have been a thrilling adventure tale but instead turns out to be a comedy of epic proportions. Marshall directed this as if it's a really serious movie. If it's supposed to be serious, why is it so funny? I was constantly laughing at the Tim Curry character because he's made out to be a nut; same goes for the talking gorilla. \"Congo\" has a couple of good things going for it, but it's just too ridiculous.\n\n*1/2 (out of four)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of my many guilty pleasures as far as action movies go, probably because I have a preference for jungle adventures in the vein of Tarzan; especially if there's a lost civilization involved.\n\nThe film is based on the 1980 novel by Michael Crichton, which I've read and consider superior to this. TraviCom scientist Dr. Karen Ross (Laura Linney) is sent deep into the Congo rainforest to locate her missing ex-fianc\u00e9, Charles Travis (Bruce Campbell) by his father RB Travis (Joe Don Baker), who is after a rare diamond that can revolutionize the communications business. Coincidentally, Dr. Peter Elliot (Dylan Walsh) seeks to bring his sign-language speaking mountain gorilla Amy (voice by Shayna Fox) back to Africa, joined by Romanian philanthropist, Herkermer Homolka (Tim Curry) who is after the lost city of Zinj where the diamonds are located. And so, the two parties meet up, and are led by Captain Monroe Kelly (Ernie Hudson) on a dangerous expedition to find the diamonds.\n\nThe acting ranges from stale to hilariously cheesy. Dylan Walsh was indifferent throughout the movie and has a blank expression on his face, even when he's shooting at the Zinj gorillas. It might have been better if Bruce Campbell played Dr. Elliot instead. Laura Linney is a decent action lady, but she looks puzzled at times and speaks her lines awkwardly. Amy is annoying and she soured the experience for me. It's Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson who carry the film. Curry is so over the top cheesy, you'll love every second he spends onscreen, and Hudson is great with his badass and wise-cracking Clark Gable impersonation. They're obviously fake Romanian (Curry) and British (Hudson) make them even more enjoyable. There are also a few notable cameos, like Delroy Lindo as Captain Wanta with his legendary meme \"Stop eating my sesame cake!\".\n\nThe filming locations ranged from California, Costa Rica, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. The scenery and set designs were impressive, with Matte paintings and miniatures used for the beautifully lush Congo jungle and the city of Zinj; the collapsing ruins and emerging lava pits during the climatic volcanic eruption were the best looking of all.\n\nThe creature effects and designs weren't perfect either, despite Stan Winston being in charge. While Amy and the wild, lowland gorillas and Hippo animatronics look good for 1995, the Zinj gorillas were obviously a mixture of puppets, suits, and animatronics. To be fair, though, CGI was not yet developed enough at the time to make realistic looking gorillas, so this is excusable.\n\nThe action scenes were quite enjoyable. From the frightening, night-time hippo attack to the final battle inside the mines against the Zinj gorillas, the movie doesn't disappoint in keeping the audience hooked. The sound effects were intense and cool sounding, like gunfire and intimidating animals' noises, such as Hippo bellows, birds cooing, and the Zinj gorilla snarls.\n\nStill, if the bad acting and dialogue is too much for you, you might want to try reading the novel instead."

I can't fault the actors because frankly, they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to Crichton's original work. I know good novels, especially those with a science fiction edge, are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original. But this may be the absolute worst disparity in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever. The book is really, really good. The movie is just dreadful."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review of Congo (1995)\n\n\"Congo\" isn't just bad-it's a catastrophic misfire that manages to insult its audience, squander its talented cast, and embarrass everyone involved. This movie is proof that even with a budget, source material by Michael Crichton, and a stellar team of actors, you can still create an irredeemable disaster.\n\nLet's start with the biggest tragedy: Tim Curry. A brilliant actor with an illustrious career, Curry is reduced to a cringe-worthy caricature as Herkermer Homolka, a role so cartoonishly absurd it feels like a practical joke. Watching him slum through this embarrassment with a bizarre, unplaceable accent is painful. Curry deserved better than to be forever associated with a film where a talking gorilla named Amy, equipped with a robotic voice glove, is one of the more grounded elements of the story.\n\nAnd then there's the plot-or rather, the lack of one. The film promises an adventure into the depths of the Congo, filled with danger, mystery, and lost cities, but instead, it delivers endless incoherence. The CGI gorillas are laughably bad, even by 1995 standards, and the climax involving \"killer gorillas\" is so anticlimactic it feels like a cruel joke. Let's not forget the laser-shooting diamonds-a plot device so ridiculous it belongs in a Sharknado movie, not a pseudo-scientific thriller.\n\nThe tone oscillates wildly between attempted seriousness and unintentional comedy. Laura Linney's character is a cold corporate archetype without depth, Ernie Hudson tries his best as a charismatic guide but is bogged down by a nonsensical script, and Dylan Walsh might as well have been replaced by a block of wood.\n\nAny critic who gave this movie a positive review needs to sit down, stare into the void, and reassess every life choice that brought them to that point. Did they see the same movie? Did they fall asleep and dream of a better one? Or were they simply paid off by the filmmakers?\n\n\"Congo\" is a failure of imagination, execution, and basic dignity. The only mercy is that it eventually ends, though not without taking two agonizing hours of your life you'll never get back. Tim Curry, if you're reading this: we're sorry this happened to you. We truly are."

It's all about the search for a lost expedition that was being led by the son of an American industrialist who was seeking diamonds large enough to power a laser (ostensibly for communications purposes, but who really knows?). Anyway, they disappear so it falls to Curry and Laura Linney's \"Dr. Rees\" to follow the sagely guidance of the Quatermain-esque \"Kelly\" (Ernie Hudson) deep into the hostile terrain of the jungle. It's got just about everything required to make it flop, this film. Terrible acting, even worse dialogue - and that's just from the chatty gorilla that all too often saves the day - and some very cheap and cheerful CGI that merely serves to showcase the poor nature of this derivative and rather unremarkable effort. Curry (\"Homolka\") is just not at the races here and Linney brings very little by way of gravitas to her over-scripted role either. It's rated 12 - but perhaps that's referring to the maximum IQ of anyone whom they are hoping will watch? I wouldn't bother if I were you."

And everyone acts like its a real Gorilla. Then there's the wristband that interprets its gestures into a Stephen Hawking voice and says things a baby would want. Then there's the irresponsible stuff: Gorilla is given a martini, his carer says \"she's allowed one.\" Gorilla is given a cigarette, against her carer's wishes, so he tells her \"Don't inhale!\" I hope nobody uses this movie as a guide to good Gorilla management because who-ee... Then there's the dialogue. Like, there's a sort of heavy type played by Ernie Hudson, who tells the heroes \"I'm your great white hope, I just happen to be black.\" Just non-stop relentlessly bad writing. Dylan Walsh is a complete absence. He is a massive black hole. He's like that character in The Mighty Boosh where people look at him and don't see a face. I'd say the movie suffers 50% total quality degradation because of this guy. Laura Linney is Laura Linney: you're either in camp Laura Linney or you're most moviegoers and would rather it wasn't Laura Linney. I personally would rather it had been Renee Zellweger or Adrienne Barbeau or some dude. Laura Linney is again more minus value. From my perspective, there's nobody in this who is worth watching.\n\nIf this were a movie by the Wayans brothers, I'd probably be giggling. Congo definitely falls into that \"so bad its good\" category, because its made with slick Hollywood filmmaking, and just happens to feature a string of situations and dialogue so ridiculous they provide a good laugh.\n\nWell, I think I've made my point. This is not good."

At times, there's just too much humor - so much so that nothing here can be taken seriously. I'm also not sure I like the idea of a talking gorilla. The visual effects were also mediocre, at best.\n\nDespite all the flaws, 'Congo' is still a rather exciting adventure movie, and I do love adventure movies.

Love Congo.\n\nThe Jungle Adventure movie had a bit of a revival during the 90's with Congo & Anaconda, both are Classic's from my era. I loved watching this big fun popcorn blockbuster at the Cinema. The 90's were amazing for movies, especially big budget B-movie type creature features & Congo is one of the best of that time in movie history.\n\nFirst off i loved the fact that the always underrated Ernie Hudson got a main role as Munroe Kelly & he was so cool as the Hunter/Guide, he made a great leading action hero.\n\nHe has a cool & calm charm & is the best character in the movie & that well spoken British accent was genius.\n\nErnie Hudson has said that this is his best role of his career & i totally agree, it's the best work he's done.\n\nI've liked Ernie Hudson since the Ghostbusters films but of course he was way underused in those but i love his Ghostbusters character Winston Zeddemore.\n\nI would actually go as far as to say that Ernie Hudson is one of the most underrated actors out there.\n\nHe's classed as a \"Character Actor\" meaning he is a bit-part small role acror, but he shouldn't be, given the right film & a chance, he can be great like he is here in \"Congo\" but he is also great in \"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle\" a 90s Thriller & the dark 90s vigilante film The Crow & the Classic Ghostbusters 1&2 & a lot of B-movies but He is always good, no matter how small his role my be. Ernie Hudson is also a very Humble guy that just never got the stardom he deserved, he's a million times better than big \"A-lister\" stars like the Awful \"Tom Cult Cruise\" but for some reason \"Ernie\" never got his true big break? But hey I'm a big fan of the man & enjoy checking out anything if i see his name in the cast, i grew up watching him as the cool, everyman Winston Zeddemore in both Ghostbusters films & from there i just like him & his personality on screen & of course Congo came out & showed me how cool he was as a main leading star!!! But of course it didn't last, i treasure his performances especially in as an average joe blue-collar Ghost buster & as a smooth talking African Jungle Guide taking a team deep into the dangerous Congo.\n\nThe rest of the cast is very good too especially \"Laura Linney\" & \"Tim Curry\" both great actors & give very good performances!!! In fact Congo has one of the best ensemble casts ever with: Bruce Campbell, Laura Linney, Joe Pontaliano, Joe Don Baker, Delroy Lindo, Ernie Hudson, Dylon Walsh, Mary Ellen Trainor, Tim Curry, Grant Heslov & Peter Jason, now that's a Classy Cast right there. Nice seeing all those faces throughout this adventure picture. Congo also has a beautifully touching score by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith. Also lovely scenery & again did i mention an excellent Ernie Hudson. At times Congo feels like very Speilberg & i liked that & it would've considering it's director Frank Marshall has always worked with Speilberg on movies, so some of that magic has rubbed off.\n\nThere also such a nice sense of Adventure in the films tone & atmosphere. Truly i think Congo is way underrated & i like it better than Jurassic Park. There's definitely a cosy & comforting feel to this movie now in 2022, probably the Nostalgia i feel for it & remembering watching it on video in the comfort of my living room.\n\nCongo was Directed by Frank Marshall who had Directed another one of my childhood faves, the 1990 Spider-Thriller-Comedy ARACHNOPHOBIA & I've always loved that film, here the Director uses that fun humour-out-of-fear & scary situations for his Congo film, both have that humour & sense of Adventure, Frank Marshall is a very good Director & has obviously learned alot from his friend Spielberg as he's been his producer on alot of his movies. I grew up on Arachnophobia on video from little & then Congo.\n\nYes the great \"Spielberg\" was producer this time to his friend \"Marshall\" on ARACHNOPHOBIA but didn't on Congo?\n\nThe mutant gorilla effects still look Amazing, animatronics & men in suits, today it would all be c.g.i so I'm very happy it came out in '95!!!\n\nCongo is a big budget B-movie at heart, it's a fun Jungle Adventure & a Creature Feature with a very good cast of unusual actors for a Jungle movie, but the best role & performance in the movie goes to Ernie Hudson.\n\nOne of my personal favourite movies.\n\nA great Jungle Adventure movie, there's heart & a sense of fun, it's pure 90s & should have a \"Cult Classic\" status!!! It's a childhood fave of mine.\n\nERNIE HUDSON is Excellent."

Ernie Hudson, Tim Curry And Joe Don Baker All made excellent performances. The music was great as was the scenery. The movie is entertaining and easy to watch. I think every dollar spent making it, showed up in the picture. Congrats to all, especially Marshall & Kennedy! It's east to pick apart a movie but often people don't realize all the work that goes into it. The scenery is especially nice and enjoyable. Ernie Hudson played Monroe Kelly well and believable. Joe Don Baker played a CEO real well too. The Traivs-com headquarters was cool too."

Now that i\u00b4m 18 I still like it, although i think that needs more action sequences.\n\nThe last scene is superb: boiling lava, killer apes, the destruction of the city of zinj, the way all the sets move around, all is very cool.\n\nThe bad thing is that the scene ends, and I'm like: \"What? that's all\" I'm sure that Frank Marshall could've shoot more action sequences. You are staring to get excited and the movie has already ended.\n\nHowever, I'll give it an 8, because it was cool the first time I saw it."

Along with Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters) donning a cool accent, Tim Curry (Rocky Horror Picture Show) also donning a cool accent, cutie Dylan Walsh (Nip/Tuck) and a friendly talking gorilla named Amy amongst others. The movie is goofy and fun and at times it feels like it's a stage production because of some questionable FX. That being said faults aside of which there are quite a bit from goofy performances to underdeveloped characters and goofy direction to name a few. The movie still works.

There are a few memorable moments of humor. Tim Curry is hilarious as Mr. Homolka, and the cake scene with Captain Wanta is one of the funniest scenes that has stuck with me all my life.\n\nThe gorilla is well acted, and is adorable.

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, so maybe this shouldn't have received a 10, it isn't Casablanca, or even an Indiana Jones caliber movie. But, I do like this movie quite a lot and feel more people should give it a chance.\n\nI think Congo failed because of marketing, first and foremost. This got the summer blockbuster treatment, and unfortunately, generated an audience that didn't suit the film.\n\nOn the one level this film completely works as a children's adventure movie, and on the other appeals to film-buff looking for some good fun.\n\nLet's get this out of the way. The acting is terrible. I mean really, really poor. There's a sign language-using monkey-suited midget with accompanying computerized voice synthesizer. And to top it all off there is Tim Curry.\n\nWhen I think of Congo I think of one character, Herkermer Homolka, played by Tim Curry. Even with thousands of movies under my belt, I still can't be sure if Curry turned-in one of the very worst performances of all-time, or whether he was just hamming it up. Regardless of why, Herkermer Homolka is one of the most enjoyable Hollywood characters ever created. Is it the terrible accent? Is it the ridiculously, one dimensional stereotype of the shyster? I can't say. But I can tell you that the character has left me in tears laughing on more than one occasion.\n\nI don't really remember a ton of the plot. They're trying to take the talking Gorilla back to Africa or something, and there's a diamond Volcano involved. You also have a ultra powerful mega-corporation paying for the adventure.\n\nI should also note that this movie has a very entertaining performance turned in by Ernie Hudson as the pragmatic liaison between the civilized west and savage Africans (passing bribes and such).\n\nFinally, one thing to watch out for, are the completely racist stereotypes of the Africans. They are portrayed as either corrupt, cowardly, superstitious, or all three. Watching this movie is much like watching an old Tarzan flick. If you, yourself, aren't racist I think you'll just sort of shake your head at the stupidity of it all and get a chuckle thinking about how angry the actors having to play the \"savages\" must have been.\n\nSo, this is a throw-back movie. It isn't good acting, the plot is contrived and silly, the entire narrative seems to use stereotyped caricatures, and there's a guy in a gorilla suit. You can see why some people hate this movie.\n\nOn the other hand, if you appreciate a good Hollywood safari-adventure flick, this one doesn't disappoint. In fact, it entertains."

This movie is a lot of fun, it is a decent and fun if nothing else adaptation of the book, and as far as movies go about the search for King Solomon's mines go, it's heads and shoulders above all the others. As one of my friends pointed out to me they didn't really take full advantage of Amy the gorrilla. If they gave her some one liners it would have been much better. IE:The scene where they finally discover the lost city, and first have a shot of the city then they camera zooms on Amy's face...this would be a perfect time to have her say and sign something like \"We meet again City of Zinj!\" or how about at the end when they are running away from the lava and Peter the scientist almost falls into the lava. When Amy turns around and sees it they should have her sign \"Peeeeeetttteeeeerrrrrrr!!!!\" and have her hold the sign for a moment or two. It would have been what is known back east as \"comedic gold\", or at least \"Comedic diamonds\" (pun intended). Anyway this movie is fun, I gave it an 8 to boost it's score but in reality it's probably around a 6-7, still way better then a 4 point something.\n\n\n\nZoopansick"

I was literally on my knees praying to God, for the safe return of the hero during the final act. Truly gripping!\n\nSeveral people have shared with me that they loved this film so much, they named their first child, \"cannibal\", after the evil gray gorillas who ate Charlie's face in act 1. To be honest, I'm an animal lover who does not wish to see harm come to our gorilla friends. Having said that, when the evil grey gorillas attempted to protect their blue diamonds from the evil Capitalists, I celebrated when the gorillas were caught in a hail of machine gun fire.\n\nThe Capitalists simply wanted access to the horde of blue diamonds and the evil grey gorillas did everything they could to stop them. In the end, the gorillas lost and greed won. The natural order of things was restored.\n\nHonestly, this is a wonderful movie that the whole family can learn to enjoy. In fact, I would encourage schools to show this film in Animal Studies 101. As the lessons learned in this film are timeless.\n\nThe main takeaway is..blue diamonds are a dead gorillas best friend."
