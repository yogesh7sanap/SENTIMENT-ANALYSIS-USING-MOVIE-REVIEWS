It moves along, something most movies don't. It's harmless and doesn't require any involvement on my part. The jokes are silly. I can miss some of it on a fridge run, come back to it, and still follow it. In fact, if I don't finish the movie, it doesn't seem to matter. However, it is charming, so I usually do.\n\nThe movie pokes fun at the super rich on a superficial level, but that's all right. I'll save the harshly critical movies for a different mood. There's some lovely views of the Biltmore estate. There's light ribbing of the corporate world. Oh dear, I'm falling asleep. I'll miss the end of the movie. Too many brewskies."

Other than that, compared with other mindless, shallow, hopelessly far-fetched pseudo-adventures designed for either very small or very uncritical children, it's really not worse than one would expect. Well, the comic book on which it's based is not exactly Stan Lee either\u0085 From a pedagogical point of view, one must say that Richie takes control of his situation in the absence of his parents, makes decisions that are largely sensible and practical, and carries them out mostly without adult help. He combines emotional and rational qualities without violating his basic identity as a kid. To me, that's all good, and redeems the entertainment value of this movie for a young audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't absolutely hate Richie Rich, but for me it wasn't that great either. As usual, there were some good things, but some not so good things as well.\n\nTHE GOOD THINGS:\n\n1) Macaulay Culkin, personally I think he is better an actor than people give him credit for. He is one of the main reasons why I love the first two Home Alone movies so much. Here, he gives a very spirited lead performance, admittedly not as cute as he was when he was starring in underrated gems like Uncle Buck, but he shows once again what a talented actor he was.\n\n2) Jonathan Hyde as the butler comes very close to stealing the show, a very funny and sly performance. Also Edward Hermann and Christine Ebersole give humorous performances, while John Larroquette plays the villain of the piece more than adequately.\n\n3) The scenery is quite impressive, captured well by the breezy cinematography. The Biltmore estate was gorgeous.\n\n4) The soundtrack was decent, nice background music especially.\n\n5) I liked the moral the film taught; All the money in the world can't make you happy, thinking about it that is true.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD THINGS:\n\n1) While I liked the moral of the film, the story itself is predictable and somewhat contrived. it probably doesn't help you have seen it all before.\n\n2) The script is quite weak in general. Don't get me wrong there were some good spots like \"Oh my god I look like Michael Jackson!\" but the jokes are admittedly very silly and juvenile, and the scripting does fall in the danger of becoming clich\u00e9d.\n\n3) The pacing. Now I don't mind films that move fast. I do have more of a problem if the pacing is TOO fast, despite the feel good nature of the film, and its valiant attempt to rise above superficial material, the film feels a little too rushed, the ending particularly felt skimmed over.\n\n4) The characters feel rather stereotypical. Maybe that is an unfair complaint as it probably couldn't be avoided, but I couldn't help thinking yeah I recognise that type of character.\n\nOverall, definitely not a bad film, worth watching at least once, but I personally didn't find it that great. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1994, Macaulay Culkin stared in 3 films: 'Richie Rich', 'The Pagemaster' and 'Getting even with dad', none of them particularly interesting. The movies themselves did poorly at cinemas and in critical terms.\n\nIn 1994, Macaulay Culkin was 13/14 years old. He was in his early adolescence, so he was growing. A difficult phase for him. Ridiculously, people began to ignore him because of that - either that or they simply thought his cuteness was disappearing and gave him little value for that. But he always proved to be a terrific actor. True, there were many, many great child actors but he was one of them for sure. Sure, his cuteness took him far, but it was his talent that made him a legend.\n\nAfter playing a completely different role in the 1993 film 'The Good Son' (where he played a psychopath that could very well disguise that nature thanks to his angelical looks, a wolf in sheep's clothe), he returned to the roles of 'good guys' in all of his 1994 films.\n\n'Richie Rich' is not much of a film, but perhaps it's a little more interesting than 'The Pagemaster'. It's not a bad movie, but it's a somewhat complex film for me to give a fair rating. It has good moments but also very stupid moments, particularly from the 2nd half on (in my opinion, where the movie is at its weakest).\n\nMacaulay Culkin plays the title character. Richie Rich is rich (like his name suggests), lives in a fancy mansion surrounded by comfort and luxury and can even count with a chauffeur that takes him in his majestic and elegant Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud whenever it's necessary. But Richie realizes that there is one thing that money can't buy: happiness. He feels the lack of friends and possibly bored with his tedious life. He just wants to be like the other kids.\n\nAbout the things I found funny in this film, a good example of that is the line \u00abOh my God, I look like Michael Jackson!\u00bb by Richie's mother. Come to think of it... that's not untrue - lol. I'm surprised they put this line in the film because Macaulay Culkin stars in it and considering the friendship he had with the eccentric singer... Other funny details are, for example, the cute dog that has dollar signs instead of spots and appropriately named Dollar, and the scene when Richie doesn't wanna wake up but stares at his personal trainer when he realizes what a beauty she is (she is portrayed by the supermodel Claudia Schiffer).\n\nMacaulay Culkin had everything to be a great name of the cinema. And he was, for a few years, mostly thanks to the success of the first two 'Home Alone' films. He was talented, charismatic and good-looking. Too bad he trashed his life later, but I believe he turned out to be like this because of his personal problems."

Richie makes friends with kids playing baseball at an industrial lot. Richie's parents are lost at sea when their plane is brought down by a bomb. Van Dough battles Richie who owns 51% share of the company.\n\nRichie Rich is a bad comic to make into a movie. I don't know what kind of problems Richie Rich has to overcome. It seems like a comic about a kid and his toys. The movie isn't cartoon fun. It does actually has some limited thrills. The characters are good for the most part. The mix of children's comic and real action don't always coexist easily. It's not that terrible but it doesn't really feel joyous."

        "review_detailed_main": "Richie Rich stars the charismatic, easily-lovable Macaulay Culkin in a role that basically begged for him from the first day of pre-production. Unfortunately, nothing else begged much attention in terms of how Richie Rich conducts itself as a piece of family entertainment. Is it serviceable? Absolutely. Just prepare for a rather long and tedious ninety-four minutes. Kids will appreciate it, seeing their favorite hero from Home Alone getting into more hairy little circumstances, but the true victims, the parents, will likely be contemplating better things they could be doing with their time.\n\nMake no mistake; I was enjoying Richie Rich for about forty-five minutes on a simply, passable level. Then at the hour mark, I grew restless, and by the finale, I was shaking my head at the missed opportunity the film could've capitalized on. I'll come back to this later. The story is inspired from the comic-book character who made quite the name for himself in books and strips that I never found myself reading. He is played by Macaulay Culkin, who was born to Richard and Regina Rich (Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole), a couple worth a dollar over $70 billion thanks to their immensely successful Rich Industries. The three live in a house that appears to be sitting two full-size golf courses, and embrace their wealthy status in the way of philanthropy, and not personal narcissism.\n\nWhile Richie enjoys living a lavish life, traveling in helicopters, playing basketball in doors, and carrying thousand-dollar bills in his wallet, he greatly envies the lives of regular, middle-class children, who have very little priorities and can spend their days playing baseball in an open sandlot.\n\nWith this kind of setup, you'd think the film would be on the track of setting up a \"lonely rich boy\" sort of moral, emphasizing that all the money in the world can't buy true, wholesome companionship, right? Well, just as we're about to further dive into that, a pesky plot point involving corruption, attempted-murder, and industry takeover begins to plague the Rich family, and with rumor that his parents are dead after a nice pack of TNT was on their private plane, Richie assumes the role as the CEO of the company. But just as we're about to go further into that detail, we focus on one of Richard Rich's employees, who tried to murder the couple and their kid to take over Rich Industries for himself. Not if Richie and his loyal butler Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) can help it, though.\n\nRight off the bat, we just passed up two solid directions this film could've taken instead of the contrived, foreseeable one it settled on. Yet if there's one thing that can't be overlooked about this film, it's the abundance of character-actors, who all do a capable job of doing what they can with what they have - especially Macaulay Culkin. Culkin's gifted, easy-going performance makes one sad that this was his last \"big\" film as a child actor, before landing roles in several under-performing independent films before fading into tabloid obscurity.\n\nCo-writer of Richie Rich Neil Tolkin worked on License to Drive, a potent, lively comedy about a teen and his two friends going out after hours in his grandfather's Cadillac even after failing his driver's test. After that, he settled for very little doing both Richie Rich and the atrocious Pauly Shore comedy Jury Duty a year later. When glancing through director Donald Petrie's filmography, it appears that he has made a career out of making spur-of-the-moment comedies that usually do fairly well at the box office before becoming safe-bets on cable. He has a formula and he should stick to it. It's just sort of upsetting that Richie Rich aspires to be functional, rather than successful.\n\nStarring: Macaulay Culkin, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole, Jonathan Hyde, and John Larroquette. Directed by: Donald Petrie."

My favorite scene with him is the one in \"The Good Son\" involving the cliff. I had a nice laugh with that one. Here there is no such scene and the film might as well be called \"Home Alone 3: this time the kids rich!\" as it has almost the same premise. Granted the parents did not really leave him, but rather got into an airplane crash, but it is essentially the same as that brat is in this one too. So the story is the kid is lonely and tries to make friends, parents disappear after a plane crash, some dude is trying to get all the money for himself and there is no robot like there was in the original cartoon still trying to debate if that is a bad or good thing. All I know is that the film for the most part is cringe worthy, but as I have said I can not stand Macualay at all so I am going to tend to be against anything he is in. I did not like \"Uncle Buck\", \"Home Alone\" or any of the movies he has been in. Except for said scene, ah yes plunge to your death you spoiled sack of...ahem, the only reason I give this movie a two is that there was a joke in it that actually got me to laughing involving this laser or something blowing a chunk out of a stone statue.

        "review_detailed_main": "While 1994 was a great year to be Green Day or The Offspring, this was not so for the young Macaulay Culkin and his fans. As a 14 year old playing the younger 12 year \"richest kid in the world\", Culkin and his management must have realized quickly that he could not stay a child actor forever. Richie Rich, therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23-year-old young adult in 2003's Party Monster.\n\nIn \"Rich\", no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between, especially for a family comedy. The post-Jurassic Park CGI \"robot bee\" may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault, anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside; that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep.\n\nHad the film starred another adolescent lead, we may have been forgiving, but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck, the Home Alone pictures, My Girl, and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute \"Black or White\" rampage. Being that it was filmed in and around the Chicagoland area, and that this reviewer is a sucker for anything local, this reviewer feels generous giving Richie Rich 4 out of 10 IMDb stars."

I assumed we would get an obnoxious rich kid, but the pressing matters lie elsewhere.\n\nSo he may be a bit (a lot?) spoiled, but he also knows right from wrong. Which I reckon has a lot to do with his personal servant. Political correctness aside, the movie can be fun. Just let its silliness run through you and all will be well.

        "review_detailed_main": "Richie Rich is a 1994 family comedy starring Macaulay Culkin and John Larroquette and is about a young rich kid who well, has a few problems. He's basically dirty rich and lives with his pretty nice parents who give him everything he wants, except he kind of wants to play with other kids from the street rather than the private school friends he has. The film is one of those one's you can imagine watching on a Sunday afternoon, and this can be enjoyed too but maybe it just isn't so clinical.\n\nThe comedy side of the movie is really kind of non existent, it tries it really does but by the end your kind of feeling disappointed. The story I'll give it is not boring, it has it's moments where you actually are maybe rooting for Richie and his fellow friends and butler(Jonathan Hyde), but in truth it's hard to like Culkin. Our main star in this is just too unbelievable and wastes any talent he has by being a dull main character, top that also with a poor script and you have Macaulay Culkin acting and sounding like some kind of badly built robot actor.\n\nDonald Petrie directs and he is pretty average really, doesn't do enough to make the story or actors better but also the general direction Is just well, not done well enough really. Now I'm not the biggest fan of these kind of comedies, in fact most I watch I don't expect much in terms of laughter, and here is another example. One thing I am trying to say though is that this didn't bore me strangely, I mean it is still a pretty bad movie but at times interesting.\n\nListen this is the kind of movie where at times it tries to flash it's crazy gadgets and cool rich persons items, but only really succeeds in making us the slightest bit interested in the ending. And on that point the end, actually not too bad but followed up just too poor a beginning and middle, Culkin also seems to get better but when he is sad, he just can't act at all!. Now don't watch this and expect to hate it, some could definitely enjoy it, some will hate, but always remember if this movie made you laugh because this movie labels itself as a comedy.\n\nAnd what about the other cast?, well not everyone is necessarily bad, Jonathan Hyde as the butler is pretty good and when he features the film can be a slight bit more interesting. John Larroquette as the scheming \"Van Dough\" is also not that bad, should have played into the jokes a bit more and maybe even have been a bit more in to what he is actually doing, kind of looks bored in this movie really.\n\nSo overall a movie I found to be well, just not good really, it isn't awful just not acceptable, the kind of movie only a few will like but at least there isn't only one person who likes it. If you like your family comedies you may enjoy it, Culkin has really grown up too much for Home Alone fans to come a knocking but still if your a big fan of his then sure, give this a go."

        "review_detailed_main": "Macaulay Culkin was one of the first major stars of my generation and I still remember that little lump in the throat when in 1995, I realized how much he changed since the \"Home Alone\" and \"My Girl\" days. Three years in kids' cuteness scale is quite an eternity. The heart wasn't in it and it showed... maybe Culkin was so blas\u00e9 about being wealthy it wasn't a role that required much composition but writers should also be responsible for their incapability to find a right dosage between warmth, fun and thrills.\n\nAnd a potential for warmth there was, Mr. And Mrs. Rich played by the late Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole are perfectly cast as the loving parents so blinded by their undivided love for their son that they fail to see what is truly missing. That the parents were depicted as nice people, philanthropists, was a nice departure from the usual \"rich equals snobbish\" trope and it actually enhances Richie's crisis, it's not that he lacks love, but one he'd have earned.\n\nBeyond the jovial and oblivious parental fa\u00e7ade, there's the obligatory butler: Cadbury played by Jonathan Hyde strangely resembling F. Murray Abraham. Cadbury is the hit-or-miss character, the adult and responsible figure that keep Richie's feet on the ground and has an awesome moment where he puts in his place a bodyguard (Chelsie Ross) after he grabbed Richie's arm 'for protection'. Ferguson would later team up with the Big Bad: Van Dough, the treacherous secretary played by John Larroquette. This is a man who's got all the money he'd need but no, he wants more because, you know, plot.\n\nAnyway, like a good villain borrowed from Scrooge McDuck adventures, Van Dough covets the family's secret vault that contains their most valuable treasure. Half the job is done with the villain and Larroquette is cunning enough, cruel enough, stupid enough to be a convincing Rated G Hans Gruber. Honorable mention to Michael McShane who plays a goofy mad scientist type and dishonorable mention to all the fat--eating jokes made at his expenses, and that goes for the fat kid, too.\n\nNow, while Donald Petrie (the director) clearly didn't exactly make a name, t's fair to say that as a comedy, \"Richie Rich\" isn't a total disaster and is occasionally capable to elicit a few sustained looks of amusement. Still, it's sadly ironic that a kid-oritened film isn't capable to understand children. I can say that because even in the mid-90s, some gags fell flat and the status of Rich's \"sandlot\" friend as your typical stock kid characters didn't fool us. In fact, the characterization of Richie's friends, or even Richie, is indicative of the film's main weakness: it was incapable to write kids.\n\nI don't know if the writers had children or were rich but their assumption of what rich and poorer kids be like is rather unflattering. According to the film, kids are superficial, intolerant or tribal and would hang out with the rich one just for the fun. Granted that one would be true but the instant rejection seems like one of these moments designed to make us feel sorry for Richie, but emotions aren't that easy to pull in an irrational context. That they haze him a little at first makes sense but refusing to see him again was too harsh to be believable. Nevertheless, within its clunky mechanisms, the plot goes toward the right direction. Kids ultimately come and have fun in his mansion, a rival for Michael jackson's \"Neverland\" and after that nice evening, Richie overhears that it was part of a 100-dollar deal.\n\nAnd this is where the film commits its worst mistake. Before that, Richie's wealth was treated like a gimmick with a few tired jokes about banal objects being made of gold, anyway nothing original when you saw a few John Landis flicks of the 80s, and many gags had good set-offs for weak pay-offs. Even Claudia Schiffer's cameo is embarrasingly dated now, not too mention a tad sexist. This humor didn't really allow Culkin to elevate his character and prevent the Razzie nomination he had coming. But the film was building something with the \"friends\" subplot, and when that afternoon ended on a sour note, it was the occasion to examine Richie's reaction. To whom would he direct his anger? Cadbury? The kids? His parents? Himself? We'd never know for this is immediately swept off by the news about the parent's crash accident and the incident is never mentioned again.\n\nThere are three writers in the credits (maybe more) and I suspect each one was in charge of one specific aspect: friends, action, wealth and only within a hackneyed formula could these tired tropes converge. Ultimately, the kids (except for the girl played by Stephi Lineburg) were only meant to form that Goonies-like team to fight the baddies, as if the delight of having friends could only be expressed in the context of an extravagant adventure. Sure Richie Rich is a comic-book character but if the point is to make him relatable, how about writing a credible adventure... can't money buy normality?\n\nSure the film is innocently silly and when you have bags of manure being catapulted or a weird romance between a butler and a mother (who doesn't care about endangering her own child) and a climactic nod to \"North by Northwest\", you might just enjoy the playful fun that at least takes your kids' away from smartphones and videogames. Sure, the computer effects are corny, and the CGI has aged worse than Culkin himself, but it's almost redeemed by one of the funniest exchanges ever, involving an answer to the question \"Where's the money?\".\n\nI guess that's what the producers kept asking in 1994 where audiences were busy watching \"The Lion King\", \"Forrest Gump\" or even \"The Flintstones\"... maybe Richie Rich was a poor subject to begin with, or maybe they overestimated the bankability of Culkin... quite an irony, isn't it?"

Starring Macaulay Culkin as the titular character, the film follows the world's richest kid as he navigates the ups and downs of his opulent life. While it's not the kind of movie you'd expect to sweep the awards circuit, \"Richie Rich\" excels in providing a charming and entertaining experience for its target audience. The film's whimsical gadgets and over-the-top scenarios are sure to captivate young viewers, while the clever nods to adult humor ensure that parents won't be left out of the fun. The performances, particularly by Culkin, are endearing and bring a sense of warmth to the otherwise extravagant setting. The supporting cast, including Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole as Richie's loving parents, add depth to the story, making it more than just a series of comedic set pieces. \"Richie Rich\" may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's a delightful family film that offers plenty of laughs and heartwarming moments. It's a perfect pick for a family movie night, where both kids and adults can find something to enjoy."

Not every movie needs to be in black and white, in French, nonsensical or boring to be great (sometimes that seems what critics want these days).

While watching it, I found it hard to believe as I'm sure most of you also find it hard to believe, that this movie is 20 years old. I have to say, it doesn't look that old even in today's perspective and has a good plot for kids about wanting friends. Whenever I watch this movie, it takes me back to when I watched this movie as a kid. I always find this movie, an entertaining movie to watch, if you're look for an entertaining appropriate kids movie. This one will keep you going as it's pretty fast paced. You'll be amazed at all Richie Rich has. One thing he has is from a memorable scene, the kid-a-pult. I wonder how they filmed that scene, and I wonder if such a thing exists, I mean what did they use in the movie? I can remember as a kid talking to my Dad about getting that thing. I guess I've written about everything I have to. I usually write longer reviews. Thanks for reading."

No, and I think that's what makes them more magical.\n\nI missed this kind of movies were they wanted to make something kids will enjoy, with nothing sinister or any deaths, they are teaching young people the true values and I think only that makes this one of my favorites.\n\nA perfect movie for children. It brings back so many good memories."

Well, fast forward to today and it's been over 20 years since I've seen it so I decided it was time to check it out again, unsure of what to expect and how I would feel (but I wanted to see it for old times sake). Man, I loved it just as much as all those years ago. It's such a fun movie. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely goofy at times and there's more than a few eyerolling moments, but overall, it was just such a joy to revisit. Even sitting here now, I feel like watching it again, and it's only been a few days since I last watched it. I found it to be that good. I highly recommend checking it out. If Shout Factory ever releases it on bluray I'll pick it up Day 1.\n\nThe score by Alan Silvestri is fantastic. It's so, so, so good.\n\nThe guy that plays the villain does such a good job.\n\nCadbury and Keenbean are great too.\n\n10/10!"
