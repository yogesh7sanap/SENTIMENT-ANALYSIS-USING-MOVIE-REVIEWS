The scene between Sheen and Lohan was perhaps the worst thing I have ever seen, it was appalling, almost like an attempt to replicate the Pamela Anderson scene, but it was just terrible. The Black Swan scenes were lots of fun, and nicely produced, they felt at odds with lots of the film.\n\nIs it the case that people's humour has changed since the early films, or were the jokes simply not funny? Personally I think it's the latter, in fairness though it isn't as if there were great horror movies to parody.\n\nIt's poor, but will still give the odd chuckle. 5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The era of spoof and parody is dead.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I knew this film was going to be horrible from the start. I had read reviews and knew it was bad, but being so infatuated with film and theater, I actually wanted to see the movie to diagnose exactly what made it so horrible. (Insult me if you must, but I have a lot of free time on my hands and I love all kinds of movies.)\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I went into the theater with the hope that on some slight chance, I would enjoy the film. Wrong. The movie was so boring and tasteless that I was actually distracted with my phone for some parts during the film, which is of the utmost rarity for me.\n\nThe horrible acting and line delivery dried this film out so much that I don't know where to begin. Ashley Tisdale was definitely not as good as Anna Faris was, and obviously, everyone will compare the two. I hate to admit it, but Mac Miller, Snoop Dogg, and Katt Williams all could have made audiences laugh with the material they were given, but were just too dry.\n\nAdmittedly, there were some very rare parts of the movie that had a somewhat witty humor to it, but it was only once or twice, and weak at that. The rest of the stupid slapstick humor was just so lame and dragging. Slapstick humor should stay within the PG level of humor for the kids.\n\nOn that note, the movie had overly crude, and just STUPID sexual humor that was just stupid and weak. Even hard R teenage sex comedies are more sophisticated than this. I laughed maybe one time, and it wasn't even a laugh. I kinda exhaled sharply while smiling.\n\nOverall, there was almost no sophisticated or witty humor, horrid acting, and it was all just plain bad. So yes, the reviews are correct, it was horrible. The only reason I give it a 3 instead of a 1 was because hundreds and hundreds of people put months and months of work into an 85 minute piece of what they thought was art, and giving a movie a 1 or maybe a 2 is too disrespectful to the art that is film. (But then again, this movie is pretty disrespectful to the art that is film as well.)"

I whispered over to her and told her this is really stupid, she agreed. None of other people that were sitting in the room laugh either. I can't believe we actually sat through the whole movie until the end, since we paid for it already. It had like 3 moments that made us chuckle a bit, but that was it. If I could demand my money back, I would. Little note for the producers- Instead of paying huge amounts of money to the celebrities, how about spend some in developing the story and jokes? I would say this movie *might* make little 10 years old children laugh, but that's about it.\n\nIt was so bad that I decided to make an IMDb account to criticize."

My 15 year old son said it was the worst movie he has ever seen. Disjointed. People were leaving the theater before the halfway point and it is only an hour and a half. There is really not much you can say about it except to wait until it comes out on Netflix and even then it will hard to watch. Honestly I can't believe that after the movie company watched this movie they had the nerve to release it. In my opinion this would hurt your reputation as a Film maker more than helping by a long shot. There is a considerable difference in the quality of this Scary movie and the others, none of the original cast appear in the movie and it seems to be based mostly on paranormal activity, the set becomes very stagnant. My son said that the actual paranormal activity was funnier. My son loves the Scary movie brand, he said this one would give the franchise a bad name and he would give it a -2 if he could.\n\nThis is a good reason to use Pirate Bay. The public is certainly being ripped off by paying for this kind of crap.\n\nAnyone who gives this movie a positive review should be suspect. They are either being paid or benefiting in some way.\n\nI like this type of movie - this one is just bad."

I'm not sure exactly what went wrong with this one, but I enjoyed the last 4 a lot more. Given that the 4th one was reaching a new level of stupidity, it was still 10x more funnier than the 5th. I regret paying $10 to watch this. This is the 2nd time in two weeks that I have made the mistake to pay money to see a stupid movie that ended up making me completely question why I go to the movies. Hollywood needs to wake up. Just because you can charge people money to see a movie, doesn't mean you should. Certain movies do not belong at the movie theater, and this one should have been on that list. The director should have never let this movie leave their studio, and for the sake of all of the actors, someone there should have stopped this movie from being produced. Again - I enjoyed the first 4, but I am now done with the Scary Movie saga. Enough is enough, this is just insulting. You can easily tell that even the highest paid actors like Charlie Sheen and that chick from Modern Family, put on a massive layer of suck in their roles. Are we all getting that lazy now days that we are going to record ourselves doing a horrible job, posting it to the world, and expecting money to come rolling in? I think the writers of Scary Movie should delete this one, and make a new Scary Movie 5. The next one that comes out will only be watched on DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is almost inconceivable to imagine how much effort a group of people would have to put into making a film as bad as Scary Movie 5. The latest instalment in the series of lazy spoofs, not including some unforgivable side projects including Date Movie and Epic Movie, this film offers virtually nothing to its audience, insulting their intelligence for an hour-and-a-half with perhaps the worst collection of blatantly uninspired and recycled gags ever put to celluloid.\n\nThe film's horrendous excuse for a plot centres on a suburban wife (Ashley Tisdale) and her dimwitted husband (Simon Rex) moving into a haunted house with their possessed adopted children. From there, the film brings its staple of parodying the biggest blockbusters of the last few years, but does so without a semblance of relevance, creativity or wit.\n\nIt says a lot about the film that the only half-laughs to be had come from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan sharing the opening scene- an incredibly stupid and borderline cringe-worthy, but inexplicably entertaining chuckle at their fall from grace.\n\nIt's all downhill from there, though, as the rest of the film plays out as a series of unconnected set pieces seen literally hundreds of times before. Often, such an unappealing movie is still able to salvage some hope by suiting itself for a target market, but it is hard to see any audience group, from 15 year-olds to stoners, defending this abomination.\n\nOne would have to drink Lindsay under the table, smoke copious amounts of bud with Snoop Dogg and/or Lion and snort pure tiger blood with Charlie to even come close to drawing any semblance of enjoyment from this disaster. An imminent sweep of this year's Razzies doesn't seem like ironic punishment enough for one of the worst films ever made.\n\n*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.

        "review_detailed_main": "I really don't know where to even start with this, so let's just get started. This movie is not funny. There you go - it fails as a comedy. In addition to that, it's dumb, mean-spirited, and in poor taste, and I think you're going to agree with me about that even if you like stuff that is in poor taste. I mean, this is basically an exploitation film for weed- and gangsta rap-obsessed 13-year-olds. It covers all the bases: sex scene involving clowns and ponies, sex scene involving pool cleaning machines, dildo collections being found by small children, things getting stuck up dogs' anuses, a scene featuring Snoop Dogg (or Snoop Lion or whatever he insists that people call him now) and a giant blunt, etc. Wow, this is multiplex entertainment in 2013?\n\nI saw the first Scary Movie and thought it was pretty amusing in places. I'm also a huge fan of totally absurd slapstick comedies like Airplane and the Naked Gun movies. What is it exactly that makes this film so awful where the others, at least on some level, succeeded? I can't think of any way to explain it except this: watching Scary MoVie is the film equivalent of eating White Castle sliders for an hour and a half, washing them down with a gallon of Mountain Dew, topping it all off with seven pounds of cheesecake and then doing the Mentos and Coke thing (featured in this film, incidentally) so you can projectile-puke the stuff you just ate all over your friends who were expecting it and think it's funny. Truly, honestly, that's the caliber of stuff you're going to subject yourself to for 90 minutes if you insist on watching this.\n\nThe movie tries to make fun of Inception, Black Sawn, Evil Dead, etc., but it seems to me that you have to actually be smarter than something if you want to effectively make fun of it. Instead, they should make a movie that makes fun of all the Scary Movie movies. Honestly, they should be pretty easy targets. This movie does not have the minimum level of intelligence required to comment about anything at all. The best it can do is make \"peehole\" jokes and try to get the audience to laugh at monkeys flinging poo at the wall. No, it's really not funny.\n\nI'm racking my brains trying to recall if there was anything at all good about this film. I do remember laughing at a couple of the gags. That sex scene with clowns and ponies was actually somewhat amusing - there, I said it. I'm afraid this review is going to come off the wrong way because it sounds like I refuse to watch stuff that pushes boundaries of good taste. Hardly, man. I even liked Videodrome, which Roger Ebert called \"nauseating.\" The real problem is that this film uses boundary-pushing as an excuse to be stupid. In reality, it's about as intelligent as a stoned middle school dropout, incidentally the only type of person I can imagine enjoying this.\n\nI was about to start getting depressed about the state of the world given that this kind of obvious dog dookie is considered entertainment, but it doesn't seem that other people found it all that entertaining either. I watched at least two couples walk out of the theater before the end of the film, so ultimately I'm concluding that there's probably some reason to have hope about the future of this planet. Thanks, Scary MoVie! Not that there's anything to be thankful for except that no one actually came up to me and hit me in the head with a shovel while the film was playing. They'll probably include that in part six."

I actually spent more time looking at my watch than I did the movie, because it was just that awful. Malcom Lee you must really needed the money, because this movie sucked!!! I am so used to seeing very funny skits with the previous scary movies. In my opinion this movie series has been going to the dogs ever since the Wayans Brothers stop contributing to the funny nature of this series. Also, the movie is more sexual in content than I would have liked and I really believe it should have been Rated R instead of PG-13. The acting is very poor in this movie and you would think with the actors that were involved you would have expected it to be very humorous.

Despite having David Zucker in a writing capacity, this installment seems finally to have run out of steam in its long-running franchise, one which took the horror films in between them and give them the spoof treatment. And the lack of material shows despite the seven year absence, having to touch non-horror films as well given the wafer thin content upon which to draw inspiration from and to make fun of.\n\nAnd you would think that their crowning glory, having the two Tinseltown folks who can't seem to get out of trouble and the wrong side of the limelight - Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan - would be a tad interesting, but it's not. Both look like they were in it for the paycheck, and couldn't care less to ham it up a little. The jokes they partook in were really bad, with absolutely nothing to laugh at or about, and if they were to think they have a second career as comedians, they just might want to think again, given their lack of comic timing.\n\nNo spoof of any horror film today would be without the Paranormal Activity style of video cameras being mounted almost everywhere, with the playback naturally being remotely hilarious, especially when people tend to miss the whole point of what they were hoping to see. Forming the basis for whatever semblance of a storyline is that of Mama, which involves Jody (Ashley Tisdale) and Dan (Simon Rex) picking up three spooky kids, thrown into a mix of Paranormal Activity, complete with a haunted house, Mama, and a housekeeper whose antics were probably the best bits in the film.\n\nThen came some other story development that linked up Black Swan, RIse of the Planet of the Apes and Evil Dead, for the most parts, and so you have one really amalgamated piece of narrative that had tried its best to blend these diverse stories together, but as it turned out, someone forgot to include genuine comedy in the film, short of tapping into the same old bags of toilet humour just for laughs. Some worked, and most didn't. Perhaps it is time to retire the franchise, for good. Even A Haunted House, was miles better than this, without having its jokes run stale, or feeling forced.\n\nThe many cameo appearances, do nothing to save the film from its depths of woeful scenes trying their hardest to pass off as comedy. And as if sitting through the film isn't torture enough, you can elect to stay until after the end credits to extend that dreaded feeling for a scene longer."

        "review_detailed_main": "Look, I'm not going to sit here and try to explain and justify my enjoyment of the first four entries in the long-running \"Scary Movie\" series. It's trash in every capacity, plain and simple. Cynical, trendy trash that only seeks to quickly capitalize on whatever is new or hip with filmgoing crowds through only the most base and lowest-common of denominators. Not a single film in the franchise could be called \"art.\" And yet... I get a kick out of them. Particularly the second and third films, which were actually very amusing. They may be trash, but they're fun trash. Enjoyable trash. Entertaining trash. Trash with a charming cast and just enough chuckles to make them worth a go on a slow, rainy day at home. Yeah, you'll feel your IQ dropping during some of the stupider moments of those previous films, but they were never so bad as to be offensive or outright dismissed.\n\nThen there's \"Scary Movie 5.\" ...whelp, this series was fun while it lasted, I guess.\n\nI'll level with you. This is one of those very rare occasions where even trying to force myself to watch a movie in order to be able to write a fair and balanced IMDb review, I just couldn't. I honestly was unable to. I had to start skimming through because the film was making me angry. Furious even. How could a series that was honestly never more than just silly, broad parody fall so hard, so quickly? It's shocking just how aggressively unfunny and tedious a film this is. Even by the midway point of the opening scene- a brutally prolonged \"Paranormal Activity\" parody involving Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to make a sex tape- the humor had been completely sapped and it was running on fumes.\n\nAnd this downward spiral only continued with each passing scene, every awkwardly contrived pop-culture reference and all the nonsensical attempts at lampooning then-recent releases. Essentially a melding of \"Mama\", \"Paranormal Activity\", the rebooted \"Planet of the Apes\" series and \"Black Swan\" with a smattering of plot elements from other major films, the storyline is a fundamental mess, with only the most tenuous of connections to string together the constant barrage of shockingly dead on arrival humor. Yes, you could argue that the fourth film's combination of \"Saw\", \"The Grudge\" and \"War of the Worlds\" was messy and contrived... but at least it tried. This one can't even muster up the energy to do that.\n\nStory goes that the production was a bit of a mess, with upwards of half the film being hastily re-written, re-shot and re-edited during last minute pick-ups barely two months before release without the participation of original (and solely credited) director Malcolm D. Lee. And it shows. Badly. Even giving it the biggest cut of slack I can, it feels like a mish-mash of several different visions and just stinks of a perplexing combination of apathy and desperation. I have a feeling you can tell which scenes were re-shot and which were in the original version as the tone and feeling will radically change from scene to scene. Some scenes feel like soulless attempts at patching together jokes whereas others feel like everyone was trying... way too hard. And as a result, it comes off disjointed and honestly just uncomfortable to watch.\n\nEven the return of Simon Rex in a starring role after his turn as a supporting character in the previous two films (albeit as a new character here) can't save this trainwreck... and I'm one of the people who actually really enjoyed his work in those films as the lovable goofball. Then again, he's the only returning co-star of any previous films, with series leads Anna Faris and Regina Hall- the two beating hearts of the entire series- having long since jumped ship. So I don't know what I expected. If the franchise film can't even attract the attention of its own lead cast members and instead has to upgrade a smaller supporting cast member to be the new star, it's usually not the best of signs.\n\nWhile it may not be quite as condescending and grating as, say... a \"Seltzerberg\"-level parody, there's just no salvaging any laughs here. It's a confused, contrived, unfunny and even uncomfortable experience trying to watch \"Scary Movie 5\", and try as I might... I couldn't do it. It's up there with \"Going Overboard\" and \"Fat Slags: The Movie\" as one of the most inherently unwatchable comedies I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.\n\nI really have no other choice but to give \"Scary Movie 5\" a tragic 1 out of 10. It's a shame."

This movie fails across the board. It fails in acting,directing, cinematography, jokes and any other conceivable cinematic component. Even the movie's behind the scenes sucks (Although much funnier than the movie itself). The only reason I didn't just throw my TV set out of the window and then shoot myself was that I didn't want even my tombstone to keep its record. Be safe and keep away!"

If you like this type of movies - even if not, sometimes -, you can laugh out loud and have a good time either alone either with party. I am not saying that those films are the best way to spend your time with friends, but it could be a good - just good - choice. Definitely better than watching a horror movie like Scream, Paranormal Activity etc, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, in the case of Scary Movie 5, things are, unfortunately, different. What I am trying to say, is that this movie is not even amusing. Scary Movie 5 is really boring. The first time I tried to see the movie, I stopped watching at 30 minutes. The second time I was determined and, honestly, I tried to see the whole movie from the beginning, but it was hard. I asked myself: \"Why are you doing this to yourself? What's the purpose?\", and I stopped watching again.\n\nIf you are in a good mood, and you want to see something that will help you, prefer Airplane, Naked Gun, Life of Brian or some other parodies. Maybe those movies not extremely funny, but I think they're better from the 5th Scary Movie. I don't recommend it, it's unworthy."

Whoever doesn't get that should never watch it, but don't trash talk a movie just because it does not appeal to your taste. It does feel choppy, but so did the other 4, which all have random scenes that don't have anything to do with the plot (such as the \"wazzup\" scene in the first or the basketball scene in the second). Overall, most of the spoofs were done well, even though the younger crowd won't get a lot of the ones from more \"grown up\" material such as 50 shades, Inception and Black Swan, which are dated and would have been funnier two years ago when those movies were still fresh. Despite what's wrong, I rated it a 10 because it did exactly what I wanted it to do, make me laugh. It is a great addition to the series, and the new cast does their best, although they are weak in comparison to the original stars of the series. The biggest mistake was having Simon Rex play a different character. He could have definitely been George again, because it's not like we aren't used to characters dying and coming back. The filmmakers probably watched A Haunted House and realized that they had to do re-shoots, which was a great decision. There are similar jokes, but they are definitely different in terms of humor and content. As usual, this film has had quite a large lack of promotion, just like Scream 4 and Spy Kids 4, which i'm sure has led to it's sad box office results. Movies like Date Movie, Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans were all huge hits and proved that the opinions of critics do not matter, and once people actually watch the movie instead of bad mouthing it, they'll realize that it is hilarious for what it is. I hope that there is an alternate cut on DVD. I would love to see how it was before the re-shoots, which were obviously done to make it stand out from a Haunted House, an under-rated spoof which in my eyes is the real Scary Movie 5. the actual SM5 is a good try and I would love to see another, even though this will probably be the last."

In this one, most of the cast from the previous movies are absent. That's not a good sign. In this one, we get parodies of more recent movies, like Paranormal Activity, Mama, Rise of the Planet of the Apes and ... The Shawshank Redemption? Oh well, only two of those are horror movies, but oh well...\n\nI'm gonna cut right to the chase. This movie is not horrible. If you thought the previous ones were funny, you're gonna think this one is funny. In fact, I find Scary Movie V to be one of the funnier movies in the series. That may be because I've seen most of the movies parodied in this one, as opposed to the other ones where there's only a couple parodies per movie I actually get.\n\nAnyways, back to the point: Everyone seems to hate this movie, and I say: What do you except? Do you really want a clever comedy with smart humor and jokes that you are gonna remember your whole life? No. The Scary Movies are stupid. Some of the stupidest movies ever, but that doesn't matter, because they know it. They don't try to make it good, they're just making another Scary Movie.\n\nI think a lot of people have forgotten to have mindless fun with comedies. Everyone expects a comedy to be memorable these days. Yes, this movie's not the most fun you'll have in the theater, but it is a fun movie to watch with friends none-the-less.\n\nAgain, if you like the other Scary Movies, there's no reason not to watch this one: It's pretty much a modern take on the same formula that's been going on for 13 years now. It's good for what it is."

The acting was awful and the effects (audio and visual) were laughable to say the least. I mean, this movie seemed like it was literally pulled from the trash and put in the theaters. The first Scary Movie wasn't half bad, but holy crap this series has gone done quicker than Lindsey Lohan's career. I just really don't know what else to say, the movie had absolutely no entertainment value of any kind, anywhere in the film.\n\nWhile I understand this movie is a parody and is supposed to be a \"so bad it's good\" movie, someone could make a parody of this movie it's so bad. Simply put, Scary Movie 5 is far and away the worst film of 2013, and possibly the worst film I've seen in my entire life.\n\n1/10"

But I can see the parts where they where not trying so hard, are probably the parts that i was laughing.\n\nAshley Tisdale who I don't doubt is a very talented actress, but is incredibly bland here, nothing she does just does not jump out at you. Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan are pretty good spoofing themselves, but lets face they are already become parodies of themselves at this point. Simon Rex is alright, but really he is just there also. Not as bad has Movie 43, but still not as funny has it tried to be, but still good for a few chuckles."

But know them or not, what can't be denied is what started out as an inspired, refreshing, if gross and thoroughly none PC idea got completely carried away with itself and just descended in to painfully unfunny dross. And so this fifth instalment, coming seven years after the last one, has an air of desperation about it, like some lazy studio executives thinking up something cheap and heartless for a quick buck. They've certainly failed to provide something even vaguely resembling a coherent plot, and so Scary Movie 5, lacking the Wayans Brothers touch that got it started, is left to just drag on in to the wilderness.\n\nBarely 70 minutes long, it's hard to think how something so short could be so torturous, but as it drags along without the merest hint of a laugh as it does, it becomes even more of a painful slog to the end. I'm just glad I didn't really pay to see it. NO STARS"

The movies Paranormal Activity and Inception are two of the main spoofs in the film and they are hilariously done, and the prologue with Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan was just good, funny starter to the film, especially when Lohan spoofs her own real-life legal woes.\n\nSeeing every actor's facial expressions, especially Simon Rex's when he experiences ghost stuff, are just fun to watch. The acting, I thought, was pretty good and the plot was well-paced. There are plenty of slapstick humor and so-stupid-it's-funny comedy, but I think the sexual innuendos are a little overboard - especially the spoof to The Black Swan.

And, in this case the book 50 Shades of Grey gets a look in with the unlikely pairing of Jerry O'Connell & Mike Tyson appearing opposite Ashley Tisdale in that sequence. My highlights were the Black Swan & ongoing Paranormal Activity rip offs, especially the pool cleaner party. Look at it this way, it's mindless fun, better with a beer in hand. It has it's moments and for those who care, stay on AFTER THE CREDITS for an extra scene. Ashley Tisdale is brilliant at the dead pan comedy required although I did miss Anna Faris a little."

I don't wanna see it, and i don't wanna talk bout it. And sometimes it's fun to talk bout a movie that's terrible. This movie's FREAKING TERRIBLE!!! Alright, so in \"Scary Movie 5\" they spoof Mama, Paranormal Activity 4, but they don't just spoof horror movies. They also spoof Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Inception, ya these kinda movies. At the start of this movie, we see Charlie Sheen banging Ashley Tisdale, and then they get killed in the beginning, then a text comes up and it's like \"Charlie Sheen's body was found in October 27. His body didn't stop partying\" or something. Ya, the only funny part in the movie is in text form! What the hell is that supposed to mean?! Like there's a segment where they spoof \"Mama\": the little kids like \"Don't look in the closet!\" Ashley goes at the closet, opens the door and we see the maid on the toilet. And she farts, flies of the toilet and hits Ashley Tisdale. Right there, i was like \"What was that?\" The thing i don't get is: Why's there a toilet in the closet in the kid's bedroom? They put the toilet there so then they can have that moment, that's not funny at all. And they also spoof the \"Evil Dead\" remake, that came out 1 week before this movie came out. Which is why i believe that the production of \"Scary Movie 5\" a week before it came out. The execution's sloppy, the script's terrible. It's just filled with stupid jokes that u just don't care about. It's not funny at all.

Some have said that this movie spoofs a lot of other scary movies. I wouldn't know, but if you have seen those movies, it will be up to you to decide what skits herein this movie spoofs. I could care less. But, I did learn that this was not a funny movie.\n\nIt's true that the promos led me to believe I might enjoy this one. Wrong again. And, I was sure that the Mandatory Hollywood Rule for Silly and Stupid things would play a large part. And, without fail, they did, big time throughout the entire movie.\n\nThis movie is all raunchy slap-stick and done badly by everyone. There was no one in charge of anything.\n\nThere are a lot of stars in here for cameo purposes. I found the Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan skit shown in the promo to be good. I laughed when Sheen was pulled out of bed by a demon and his jewels stopped his flight into the door. Ouch, ouch, ouch! Sorry, but that was funny. However, that scene WAS NOT in the movie. Fooled again. They used another unfunny skit to Benny Hill music.\n\nCelebs I recognized: Snoop Dog, Heather Locklear, Jerry O'Connell and Mike Tyson and there are others whom I have no knowledge of. Other actors were made up to look like the real stars for example: Leonardo DeCaprio and the movie character: Madea. .\n\nWhat you will see: adults hitting kids, fecal fights, child's hair on fire, things shoved up rectums, a lot of fighting some with fists and pots and pans, pies and fruit made with fecal matter, kids humping legs, a microwave being humped\u0085\u0085 I just cannot go on with this.\n\nThere are outtakes after the movie and none, again, are remotely funny. You will see some mouthing language that you didn't hear during the actual movie.\n\nThere is a Narrator throughout and he sounded very much like Morgan Freeman, but it was Josh Robert Thompson instead.\n\nTo give credit to this movie for spoofing other movies would be wrong because everything was done in ultra raunchy and disgusting ways. Basically, what we have is raunchy slap-stick throughout. (1/10)\n\nViolence: Yes. Sex: Simulated often. Nudity: No, but they came close. Lesbians: Soaping in the shower and later kissing. Language: Soft Stuff, but the outtakes had characters mouthing the other stuff."

It had it's moments, but other than that it was just a ho-hum type movie. Didn't have the engaging action and comedy that you're used to from the previous films, and just didn't really do anything for me. I like Charlie Sheen as an actor, and he's can play some funny parts, and this was no exception, but then it kind of dwindled after that. I think it's because the previous cast were not there. I think that if all the previous actors were included, it would have been a great movie."

Starring Ashley Tisdale and Charlie Sheen (who is only present within the first painful five minutes in a non funny sketch with Lindsay Lohan) the film spoofs big hitters such as Mama, Evil Dead and mostly Paranormal Activity, as well as non horror films Inception and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which believe you me, comes across as an even more boring watch than the actual horror spoofs. The film drags from one loose plot line to the next, and literally rams down unfunny toilet humor gags down our throats in the hope that we find them the least bit humorous or clever. Scary Movie 5 possess no humor whatsoever, and let's be honest, does it really come as a shock?\n\nThe not so painful truth is behind this movie is, every gag resolves into a heavy sigh and the rolling of eyes. The thing is with Scary Movie 5 is that it is rated as 15 like its predecessors, but the truth of it all is that the film really is aimed at anyone under the age of 5. The funniest part about Scary Movie 5 is that the target audience is not even old enough to watch it, and by the time they are, the film will be forgotten. I wouldn't even give it that long.\n\nMy Verdict: A mindless bore that really doesn't improve on any of its previous instalments, and makes you sincerely wish that the Scary Movie franchise will just go away forever."

Which FAILED in epic proportions, throughout the entire movie, i laughed a grand total of twice... and not the roll around belly ache laugh, just a minor chuckle... twice. In my opinion this film should be eradicated from history and be re-written ONLY if the Wayan Brothers are on board and ONLY if Anna Faris reprises her role as the hilarious Cindy Cambell."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scary Movie 5 is a parody movie comprised of slapstick humor, whimsical characters, and celebrity satire. The movie is done in the same vain as all the other Scary Movies. I think that Scary Movie 5 is one of the better movies in the series, Scary Movie 3 being my favorite one.\n\nThe movie is over-the-top and there is hardly anything witty about the humor or writing. Some of the scenes are ridiculous enough to come out of a child's imagination. Or maybe a child's imagination would have resulted in better quality humor than what was presented in this movie. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this movie, even though I know that the jokes are childish, over-the-top, and exaggerated. I have always enjoyed movies within this genre, movies such as the Scary Movies and The Comebacks. Meanwhile, I am not one to enjoy other exaggerated movies, like Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. I am not sure why such movies appeal to me more than others. If I had to come up with a reason why I liked the Scary Movies is parody: I like the satirical and ironic imitations that are intrinsic of parody.\n\nThe difference between this movie and the others is, for a lack of better word, subtlety. In previous movies, especially the first two movies, there are a lot of jokes related to disgusting events or disfigured and disturbing people. The first movie had an explicit over- the-top sex scene. The fifth installment's sex scene used more figurative imagery to represent what went on. A disfigured man in the second movie was the basis of a lot of jokes. Here, the only thing that comes close to that is a genetically-enhanced ape that is parodying The Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nI like Scary Movie 5 because of its parodies of movies, its slapstick humor, its whimsical characters, and celebrity satire. I am overlooking stupidity and the exaggeration because it does not bother me at all: I expect it as part of the movie."

Well, it wasn't and I did enjoy it. The main spoof was the movie Mama which I have seen so I was able to understand many of the references. Parodies are typically bad so this one was probably above average for a parody. It wasn't too vulgar, the slapstick and physical comedy wasn't too over the top, I got to see both Sheen and Lohan ridicule themselves. Not too bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's been 7 years since Scary Movie 4 hit theaters to a pretty impressive box office run, and Scary Movie 5 brings the series back in a big fun way. If you loved the other four films (especially part 3) you will definitely get a kick out of Scary Movie 5. This is a spoof done right, written by David Zucker, the master of slapstick humor. Sure, like any spoof movie there are tons and tons of jokes and some miss the mark. However, Scary Movie 5 succeeds by sticking to its roots and rebooting the entire series for new audiences and old fans alike.\n\nThe first thing you will probably notice is the rather unfortunate and upsetting lack of Anna Farris. Farris rose to stardom almost exclusively through the Scary Movie films at first, building her comedic repertoire along the way. At the time of filming, Farris was pregnant, so Ashley Tisdale fills Anna's shoes in a surprisingly fulfilling turn. Sure, she's no Cindy Campbell, but Jody is a character you can root for and Tisdale really does prove she has good comic timing. Unfortunately, there is also no Brenda (Regina Hall) or any of the other great characters to be found in the other sequels. For this film, it actually works this circumstance to its advantage, bringing back both Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex as relatives (again) but playing completely different character than their counterparts from the third and fourth installments. Some of the side characters bring the most laughs, from Molly Shannon as Heather to Tyler Posey as a hardcore Christian chilling at a cabin in the woods (long story.) The opening scene rivals the best ones in this series, and the scene fully concludes after the credits roll so stick around for a fun moment and obvious ode to the other four movies. Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen were absolutely perfect choices for the opening and I really missed them once they were gone. Also, I could watch Simon Rex do his awkward comedy schtick for hours and never get bored. Rock on, Dirt Nasty!\n\nThere are some really nitpicky issues to be found within this feature, but when you are watching a spoof film you really need to switch your brain off to have any fun. There are some odd dubbing issues as far as sound goes where it looks like the actor was saying something else, which most likely was a product of the numerous reshoots this movie underwent to remain more relevant. The Inception and 50 Shades of Grey spoofs kind of fall flat on their faces and bring the movie to a bit of a halt, but they are mere bumps in the road compared to the laughs to be found in the rest of the movie. I'm anxious to see an unrated version of this on DVD to see what was cut out or what footage/spoofs were excised completely from the final product.\n\nIf spoofs are your thing, there is plenty of hysterical moments to be found within Scary Movie 5, which actually takes chances and doesn't rehash the same material over and over again. This isn't your typical throwaway spoof. Though the ending could have used a bit of polishing (come to think of it, I've never been fully satisfied with an ending apart from the first), the final product is very watchable and has some decidedly off-the-wall moments. I can honestly say I loved Scary Movie 5, and if you're a fan of spoofs you will probably love it too."

Not something that is particular funny though.\n\nThe rest of the movie though: There are a few things, that were so silly that I had to laugh. Maybe it only makes sense or is kind of funny, if you have seen the other movies. Like \"Mama\" or \"Paranormal Activity\" which are the biggest influences here. If you have seen Haunted House (which I watched after Scary Movie 5) before you watch this, you might even like it more than I did. Regular Anna Faris is not back this time, but we get another actress who's doing a decent job of replacing. Though I guess if you were a fan of Farris, than you might be mad at her (not her fault though).\n\nBy far not the best spoof I've seen, but if you let yourself to it (and be silly) this actually has some funny moments (don't let that stupid beginning ruin the whole movie for you)."

For me, the worst film in the franchise was the second on the list. Anyway, this film is bad, and that is indisputable. With him, it seemed, definitely in a definitive way, a franchise that had an unusually long life, considering the kind of films presented.\n\nThe biggest problem with the film is not being funny. The jokes are within the standard of the franchise, but they are lukewarm, they bet a lot on eschatological humor (I don't know what's worse, that or the sexual obsession that abounds in teen comedies) and the fact that we easily predict them takes away from them grace. Some satires (like the one made for the films \"Mama\" and \"Cabin in the Woods\") did not work, although the script also seemed to me within the standard that the franchise has accustomed us to. There was a lack of a more competent and funny cast, in addition to the firm hand of a director capable of demanding more from everyone involved. Zucker, who signs the script, is good at making comedies when he can do anything he wants, and he has already demonstrated it, having been responsible for \"Scary Movie 4\", for me the best film in the franchise. But he is not alone here, neither in the direction nor in the script, and I do not know how well the joint work went.\n\nThe cast is amateur, to be nice. I don't know where they were recruited, but what gives the film some life is decent acting and Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash alongside some of the cameos: the opening scene, with Linsay Lohan making humor out of her own personal misfortune, it just doesn't become infamous because she's comfortable with it, and Snoop Dogg doesn't seem to know how it got there."

They all know that it's a silly movie and they seem to be having a good time. Ashley Tisdale is the biggest surprise for me. Not only is she very dreamy looking but she also gives a fearless and very funny performance. What she does in this movie is no easy task. She does a great job. The rest of the cast is also very good. Once I got into the groove, \"Scary Movie V\" ended up being worth the watch."

It was just horrible, I didn't laugh at all. It was worse than those cheap sex and drugs comedy movies that are a dime a dozen. I expected more from it. The mise en scene was completely different than the other Scary Movies. And it lacked the flow typically found in a Scary Movie, the flow was completely off. As a comedian, I was in physical pain while watching this movie. There were so many places during the movie that could have at least been marginally better had they done things slightly differently."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: This movie was completely ridiculous. It's totally not funny and the acting is really terrible. They based the movie around Mama with a touch of Evil Dead, Black Swan and the Cabin In The Woods, but they didn't do the movies any justice. The writers really didn't do a good job and most of the actors are either in debt or have suffered a slump in there careers. I'm not a big fan of the Scary Movie franchise, so I got what I expected from this film. Judging by the money that this movie has made, I sure that they will be releasing more movies in this franchise, but I personally think that they should look for some better writers or just leave the series alone. Terrible!\n\nRound-Up: The out takes at the end of the movie are much funnier than the actual film itself. There are loads of innuendo's which refer to other movies but they weren't that cleverly done. Tyson had sunk to a all time low by making an idiot of himself in this movie, as well as Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan who have gone through there own personal turmoils of late. If they were using this movie to boost there careers, they have definitely picked the wrong film.\n\nBudget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $64million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are fans of the Scary Movie franchise, but don't expect much. 1/10"

I can't believe I endured it. I've done it guys! I actually watched the whole thing in one sitting. I've evolved as a film critic, and I didn't press B to cancel. Throw anything at me, I'll watch it. Unstoppable. Uncontrollable. Un-flipping-believable. I am...that guy. A family adopt two feral girls and move into a house that is haunted by a mothering ghost. 'Mama' plus 'Paranormal Activity' divided by 'Cabin in the Woods' multiplied by 'Inception' and halved by 'Fifty Shades of Grey' equals one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's not even bad good...it's just plain bad. It started off well with a self-referential scene including Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, and then it declined to nothingness. I didn't laugh once, heck I didn't even smile. The jokes were horrendous and seemed like they could only appeal to a three year old. Honestly. There were more jokes orientated towards bums then actually anything witty...in fact, there was no wit. It was aimless. Dumb. When was sticking an object up your ass and smelling it funny? When was spontaneously combusting babies humorous? I just can't even comprehend the thought process of this! The lack Anna Faris and Regina Hall was noticeable and was a huge detriment to this fifth instalment. Ashley Tisdale? Really!? Shouldn't she be singing next to a swimming pool in 'High School Musical 2'? Heck, I don't want her on my screen! Snoop Dogg? Usher!? They really were clutching at straws here, sweet lord! I saw better acting in the porn video I watched this morning, and there was no talking in that! Christ! This genre is done. This film has resulted in the decimation of parodies. It's outdated. It's stupid. It's absurdly unfunny. It's just wrong. Scary Movie V is, without a doubt, atrocious. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to chill in the sun with a fresh cold cider and rethink my life..."

It's written terribly, it's acted terribly, it's jokes are terrible. The movie relies on poop and fart jokes; c'mon, that's too stupid. I only laughed for about 2 minutes, during the Inception part of the film. But even that was just a small smirk-type laugh. That's sad for a movie that's supposed to make people laugh out loud. All in all, I really don't want to talk about this movie anymore. It's stupid, unfunny, and unnecessary"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first Scary Movie was very entertaining if rather mindless, 2 is uneven though much better than what is often said about it, 3 was a mixed bag and 4 was poor and until now was the worst of the four. This fifth entry was just awful with no redeeming values, the only movie of the series to be on the same level as rubbish like Disaster Movie and Epic Movie and actually comes dangerously close to being even worse. Visually it's cheap, with the way it's shot and edited strongly reminiscent of a poorly done direct-to-video movie and that is the same with the sets. The soundtrack is generic and like a noisy music video with a lot thrown in for the sake of it and very little adds anything to what is going on. The dialogue toe-curlingly bad in how inane and excessively vulgar it is. Nothing about it is funny or witty, much of it is immature and insulting, if the writers were clueless as to what was funny that comes through loud and clear. The funniest it gets? \"Help, there's a mad demon in my house\", and if you're thinking that that is also stupid, you're right, it is. There is not much story here to speak of, it was just an excuse seemingly to cobble together genre send-ups and parodies and the sheer idiocy only increases. And none of these are funny, some of the gags are drawn out to an unbearable degree, the ones sending up horrors like Evil Dead have nothing atmospheric, scary or remotely creepy about them and the bulimia and pregnancy gags were tasteless(and not mildly, this is more above-borderline offensive, in quite some while no other movie has evoked a reaction as extreme as this). There's even a surreal spoof on Fifty Shades of Grey, which came across as out of place. The acting is awful, and even that is an insult to the word awful. It wasn't a problem that the original cast weren't there, what was was that none of the actors had any spirit and energy to their performances, the few actors who do have some talent are wasted and some overact, Ashley Tisdale being the worst offender. Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan send themselves and their tabloid reps embarrassingly, the Paranormal Activity spoof wasn't scary or halfway amusing in the slightest. In conclusion, a complete mess and by far the worst of an overall hit-and-miss movie series. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Fans liked 'Scary Movie and 'Scary Movie 2' when they came out in 2000 and 2001. After that the director was changed and in 2003 'Scary Movie 3' came out, which fans didn't like, even though it had a higher budget and bigger cast. The budget was even higher for 'Scary Movie 4', which came out 2006, which fans hated. 'Scary Movie 5' was meant to come out in October or 2008, but that never happened. Now, from the same writers of 'Scary Movie 3' and 'Scary Movie 4', comes 'Scary Movie 5', the real release date. It's not called 'Scary MoVie'. I don't know why it's called that on IMDb. Anyway, since it had a failed release date, didn't have a real one until five years after the failed one, and was from the same writers of two movies that did poorly with fans and critics, the expectations were very low for this movie... But it still had a negative 4% Rotten Tomatoes critic score, and a 57% user score, which was also negative, but almost positive. I really didn't think this movie that horrible.\n\nThis movie was stupid... It was very very stupid. There were many, many jokes in this movie, which was a bad thing. The jokes were almost all from the same humor. It was very strange humor. The humor was funny, but not hilarious. The humor also got old very quick. Since it went on so long, and didn't really change, it had a clear path to get old quickly, and it did. The jokes were also all over the place, and sometimes they would drag on too long and not be funny anymore. Sometimes there would be many things happen in a row that were too similar to be funny, even the second time. I don't dislike stupid humor, but there's a right way to do stupid humor, and they didn't pull it off very well.\n\nGetting past that the humor was stupid and the same and all of the other faults I found in it, 'Scary Movie 5' was a funny movie. At the beginning, when the humor wasn't old yet, and some other parts in the movie, I laughed most of the time. The jokes still lingered for a while in some of the funny parts, but the beginnings of the jokes would be enjoyable. Even though the humor stayed the same in the movie, They changed what they were making fun of several times. Some of the times it matched the movies they made fun of, and sometimes it didn't. When the humor and jokes hit the movie spoofs they matched, 'Scary Movie 5' would be funny and enjoyable then. They could never pull off a very long portion of the enjoyable parts, though. It would only pick up for a few scenes, then go back to the usually unfunny parts. It switched movies several times, though, so it would always come back around. This movie had many funny parts, like in one scene I laughed and laughed and laughed. They had pulled it off right. The writers set up the right things in the movie to poke fun at and make fun of with the right humor, almost perfectly. But the jokes stayed the same, so eventually it died down.\n\nThe verdict on this movie is that it was alright. I mean that as It was not bad, but I didn't necessarily like it. I was gonna rate this movie as a 5/10, but I walked out thinking positively of it. I understand why someone wouldn't like this movie, though."

Spoofing of the following: Any desolate cabin in the woods with hanging dead animals and mysterious object (book in this case). Flickering lights; moving household items although I don't recall the customary opening/closing doors. Floating/suspended people. Inanimate objects coming alive - pool vacuums (and their regular vac friends) in this case. Shadowy figures moving in the background. Shadowy figure tends to be female with long dark hair. Excessive number of cameras placed to see every corner of the house. Rec symbol in the corner. Loud, including the tiresome banging, noises. Possessed and/or wild animal like kids. Helicopter view of lone car moving along country road which the film substituted for by using a toy car performing the same hook. Loved it! My criticism, which mirrors some of the negative reviews, is that it seemed to get a little slow and redundant at times - could have used more hooks from other films."

Critics should know that. It's a 0.5/10 for a good movie but 9/10 for the funny parts. Don't listen to the critics they don't know what they're talking about .

Charlie Sheen is only in this movie at the very start not throughout the rest.

The humor was mind-glowingly dumb and made zero sense whatsoever. The entire plot made no sense, and all the jokes this movie spits out were so random. Is this movie even a comedy? I think I have seen suspense-thrillers with more humor than this. All this does is just spoof scenes from different movies, and I never laughed a single time.\n\nThis movie was bad on so many levels. Every time a character would crack a joke, I just rolled my eyes. The humor consisted of nothing but fart jokes, poop jokes, toilet jokes, slapstick jokes, and stupid sex jokes that are not even funny on paper. There are sex scenes that are not real sex scenes at all, there are a fight scene that looks like a dumb cardboard cartoon off of Youtube, a man who gets injured like every scene from dumb random activities. All in all, this is one of top ten worst movies I have ever seen. It is not so awful that it's good, it is not awful good, it's just AWFUL!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "SCARY MOVIE V\n\nBlimey\u0085 again we have a franchise that doesn't know when to end. This movie should have never been made.\n\nThis movie parodies other horror films that have recently come out. In this film we see spoofs of Evil Dead, Mama, Paranormal Activity, Cabin in the Woods, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Black Swan and Inception.\n\nI loved Scary Movie. I thought the original movie was brilliant. But after the second one they all mingle into one big mess for me. There are far too many parodies out there these days that they have stopped being funny. I guess it is one of those 'too much of a good thing' situations. I have always enjoyed stupid humour. It started when I was a kid and watched the Naked Gun. From then on I always looked out for them. But now it seems they are pushing it too far that it has lost its comedy value. I remember going to the cinema to watch Vampires Suck\u0085 the whole movie sucked!\n\nAnyway\u0085 back to Scary Movie 5.\n\nThe movie has a lot of famous faces in, but they are mostly just cameos. They even put the cameo stars on the front cover of the DVD\u0085 it's as if they knew that no-one would watch this unless it has some decent names attached to it. The main character is played by Ashley Tisdale. I was watching this movie looking at her thinking \"I know her from somewhere\" But I could not remember where I had seen her. Then the nightmare came back to me\u0085 \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u0085\". It is Sharpay from High School Musical. I tried my best to delete that film from my memory. But to be honest, she didn't do a bad job in this. She was funny in places and can imagine she could be a comedy actress if she had a decent film to be in. The cameo stars were Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, Snoop Dogg, Terry Crews, Bow Wow, Heather Locklear, Jerry O'Connell & Mike Tyson. That is one hell of a cast list\u0085 but they are not really on screen long enough for you to appreciate them. In some cases if you blink, you will miss them.\n\nThis film is not all bad. I was laughing out loud to a few scenes. There were some scenes that were very funny. Just not enough of them. I think the main reason I found them funny is because I have seen the movies they were mimicking.\n\nI was also very surprised to see the film was only on for 1 hour 8 minutes (not including the credits). That is very short for a movie\u0085 and even though it was not a great film I still would have wanted it to go on a bit longer. It felt like they had run out of things to parody so they ended the movie.\n\nOverall the film was amusing in places, but I did find myself watching it with a straight face through a lot of the gags. Mainly because they have been done a million times over. I really hope they don't make any more now. I believe this was the final nail in the Scary Movie coffin.\n\nI will give this film 5 out of 10.\n\n\"I'll pay you to get me out of this movie\"\n\nFor more reviews, please like my Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

As the latest installment spoofs Paranormal activity, Mama, Black Swan, inception, Evil Dead, Madea and so many other films. Like the last 3 installments most of the jokes are misses but some of them hit way better than they should. And with that being said I'll say that the latest entry is the best the franchise has been since the second film for better or worse. As the film opens Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen are in a bed ready to get it on as they spoof their various life choices cleverly for the most part. But as they are murdered by a sinister force their three children go missing. Months later they are found in the woods \"Mama\" style by a couple of stoners (Snoop Dogg) and returned to their Uncle (sexy Simon Rex) and his new wife (a perfectly vacuos Ashley Tisdale). Moving things along a spirit haunts their house, they have a super religious hispanic maid, Tisdale rediscovers her love for the ballet with a jealous new lesbian understudy and they go ins earch for an evil book that they changed the ghost into what she is. It's all fairly nonsensical but some of it is actually funny not enough to merit a recommendation but if your super bored or feel you must you could do a lot worse like Scary Movie 3 or 4. **.5/5"

Enter number 5 into the franchise but this time my twelve year old daughter wanted to see it too because Ashley Tisdale (Jody) was in it who she knew from High School Musical (2006). And I must say that she did have a few scene's laughing out loud, especially with the baby but after 30 minutes she went back to her multimedia. Do I need to say more?\n\nI watched it until the end and stated as 85 minutes it stops around 72 minutes, from there on it's the end credits but they warned the viewer, bloopers on the way. So I waited, and watched the bloopers who some looked like they were set in scene. Overall, I did had a smile here and there but still it's a turkey.\n\nIt's always so weird to see big names from back in the days coming into the franchise. There only for a few minutes in it so don't pick it up for that reason. This time the story is based on the horror Mama (2013) and the Paranormal Activity franchise. It do works here and there but some parts are really childish or on the edge of slapstick. For me the best part was the spoof on Evil Dead (2013),the split tongue and the removal of the arm, it's all there, and the lesbian scene of Black Swan (2010).\n\nThe producers clearly made it for teens because there's no nudity in it. Two girls do have a shower scene but are dressed in their bikinis. It's not good at all but I have to say better then the Twilight spoofs out there or zombie spoofs.\n\nGore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 1/5"

In this fifth instalment, slapstick runs rather dry and many, many gags outstay their welcome. Hits like Inception, Black Swan and Mama are spoofed earning some healthy laughs but many dated cultural references and pop culture gags fall flat, this isn't as bad as the first two Scary Movie films but it's certainly one of the weakest, reaching to the bottom of the barrel in desperation.\n\nScary MoVie sees young parents Dan and Jody raise their adopted nieces who have a twisted spirit overlooking them. Jody begins to experience paranormal activity in their new home, and soon realises an evil dead demon is stalking them, Jody must now venture to the cabin in the woods to find the book of the dead and stop the deadly curse, whilst Dan focuses on his job at the Ape research facility. The problem here is too many big films are being spoofed, from Inception, Black Swan, Mama, Evil Dead, Paranormal Activity, Insidious, The Cabin In The Woods, even Tyler Perry's Madea and Fifty Shades Of Grey. Writers David Zucker and Pat Proft cram it all in, the film is bursting at its seams with a lot of bad jokes and a feeling of desperation. The scenes where Simon Rex falls over whilst trying to set up the cameras drove me mental as it wasn't funny, the fight between Dan and Rosa, and the repetition of the Cabin in the woods joke fizzled out quicker than you can say boring. The dancing Mama and the Ape's talking about Matt Damon really killed hope, there's so much that falls flat, the Fifty Shades Of Grey scene was pointless and the Inception scene really felt forced.\n\nHowever, the whole Black Swan sequences work superbly, the Evil Dead book scene was hilarious and the opening with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan ripping their personal lives maybe lousy but it works. Erica Ash is superb as Kendra, J.P. Manoux is very funny as Pierre the ballet teacher, and Molly Shannon reels out some big laughs as a broken, alcoholic smoking professional dancer, there are some great jokes here, Ashley Tisdale is great at slapstick and she echoes an Anna Faris in the making, although Faris cannot be beat when it comes to these films. The found footage aspects are decent, especially when exploring their new home, seeing Jody smack the baby into the door frame, setting its head on fire then blasting fire extinguishers reign madness, it's unapologetically poor humour but I chuckled.\n\nRunning in at under feature length, Scary Movie 5 feels long and exhausting, it tries to be something big but it really is just a squashed mixed bag labelled as a movie, and Director Malcolm D. Lee does nothing to polish or let alone add craft to this tiresome spoof."

But actually, I liked Ashley! She put a fresh spin on the genre and is good at playing crazy. Everyone else? direct-to-DVD level acting. The jokes? Immature, gross, mildly amusing. Actually \"Mama\" and \"Black Swan\"'s spoofs steal the show.\n\nClocking at an 80 (last time I checked) minutes, this runs pretty short and without its credits, so if you're hurling at the inaneness of it, it'll be over in no time.\n\nMaybe I'm being more lenient on films because I feel I've been too picky, or maybe I'm just having a field day, but I truly believe there are far worse films out there. That's not to say these aren't bad, but for what I was expecting, not that bad. And Lindsay Lohan pretty much MAKES the movie, even though she's in it in the blink of an eye.

        "review_detailed_main": "In case you didn't know, Hollywood is becoming less and less original. The number of sequels or remakes even seems to be at new heights this year: \"Carrie\", \"Die Hard V\", \"Evil Dead\", \"Fast & Furious 6\", \"Iron Man 3\", \"Man Of Steel: Superman 6\", \"Star Trek 12: Into Darkness\", \"Very Bad Trip 3\" and so on. The strange thing is that people seem to want to see the lukewarm old stuff again and again and massively run into the theatres. Guess why I've switched to European and Asian cinema over the years. But from time to time, you go back to the movie theatres on a nostalgic note to watch some of those sequels. I've enjoyed the Scary Movie instalments when I was younger and when a few friends asked me to watch the new output I spontaneously joined them and gave this film a try.\n\nI must admit that this fifth part of the series had a couple of good laughs for those who know horror movies quite well. I laughed about the absurd sex scenes in the \"Paranormal Activities\" beginning, the stoned dialogues between Snoop Lion and Mac Miller on their way to \"The Cabin in The Woods\", the strange rituals executed by housemaid \"Madea\" Maria, the appearance of the intelligent ape Caesar as in \"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes\", the \"Inception\" influenced dream sequence about \"Fifty Shades Of Grey\" or the religious teenagers in the cabin in the woods reminding of \"Evil Dead\" were quite funny. On the other side, other passages were rather dull and had their lengths as the \"Black Swan\" and \"Mama\" scenes.\n\nI must admit that I got out of the movie theatres with a big smile on my face and I had really enjoyed this entertaining and short flick while it lasted. It's not the best \"Scary Movie\" but also far from being the worst part of the series. That being said it was better than I had expected it to be.\n\nWhat really struck me though is the fact I have some problems to call back in mind all the details of this movie. This is due to three reasons. The story line of the movie is even more stupid than usual and had an almost total absence of sense. The acting is even less impressive and more stereotypical than before. I'm aware of the fact that this kind of movie won't win any Academy Awards but this time the flick was only centred around quick jokes and a few cameo appearances. This movie is another meal of Hollywood junk flick food. It's entertaining but after all quite predictable and superficial of course. It's easy to digest but it's quickly gone as well.\n\nIn the end, the film can be resumed like this: it's entertaining and quite funny when you watch it but you will soon forget it as well as there is honestly said nothing memorable or outstanding about it. Fans of the first four instalments should watch this fun ride as well. Those who didn't appreciate the first parts won't like this movie either and probably hate the fact that these instalments have been brought back to life again."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I didn't really liked it and I didn't had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as bad as I had imagined and I didn't really enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was kinda interesting and different than the previous movies. However, the storyline wasn't well-written, because it was very silly. The characters weren't very interesting, nor well-developed and they were all so annoying. The filming location of the movie was mainly, inside a haunted house. In my opinion, that movie probably had the worst casting and their acting wasn't really good. It wasn't a scary movie and there weren't any jumpscares, even though there were some creepy scenes. Sadly, it wasn't a very funny movie and most jokes were so stupid. The ending scene was definitely predictable and it was just fine. Overall, \"Scary Movie 5\" wasn't a nice parody film, kinda boring and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have not seen any of the previous \"Scary Movie\" films. The reason why I chose to watch this one, the least financially successful and apparently worst one of them is that it has made it to the infamous Bottom 100 on IMDB....the lowest ranked major movies of all time. I have a weird desire to not only see tons of foreign and art films, but occasionally I love a bad film...particularly if they are unintentionally funny. In the case of \"Scary Movie 5\", it's a case of being unintentionally NOT funny!\n\nWhen the movie begins, you know you are in for a horrid film as the opening scene stars Lindsay Lohan and Martin Sheen! What follows is a very episodic film starring many C and D-list actors that parodies (or is supposed to parody) scary teen films and a variety of non-scary movies as well. During the course of the story there are jokes about weiners, drugs, feces, demonic possessions, vomit, farting, toilets and other intellectual subjects. These jokes are presented rapid-fire. Most fall pretty flat or are disgusting...and a few actually are funny...but only a few.\n\nOverall, this is a mostly unfunny movie starring many annoying actors....but, it is NOT so horrible that it deserves to be in the Bottom 100. Bottom 250...sure...but I can probably come up with at least 200 films worse than this mess...not that this is any sort of endorsement for you to watch it. If you do...don't say I didn't warn you!!"

Reason 2 - Two people who died in \"Scary Movie 4\" were back. They played different people though. They were Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex.\n\nIt was funny, but it should have been rated R. There is the bottom of a butt, nonstop sexual stuff, and one clear use of the f word, and the n word, used by the physic. If you are a big fan of the franchise, you should go see it, and if you never heard of the series, you can go, because it is not a continuation.\n\nRecommended for 15+"

        "review_detailed_main": "The fifth installment of the popular horror spoof franchise, 'Scary MoVie' is shameful in its badness. With a spoof consisting of mainly 'Mama' and the 'lost footage' horrors, as well as many non-horror films (such as 'Black Swan' or 'Rise of the Planet of Apes'), it is outclassed in every way by 'A Haunted House'.\n\nThe 'Scary Movie' franchise, while very fun, tends to lose a bit of strength in each next movie. This time around it is the absence of Anna Faris and Regina Hall, the only regulars since the first one, that brings it down a lot.\n\nInstead, the new cast is atrocious. Ashley Tisdale, of the 'High School Musical' (in)fame, is completely lacking in both the funny, acting or charisma departments; Erica Ash is even more atrocious, and tries too hard to be a substitute for Regina Hall but falls flat; Simon Rex, a returner from the third and fourth films, is likable but ends up far too silly to work. Lidia Porto is another particularly full of bad moments, while the kids are surprisingly better than the adult cast.\n\nAnd what is there to say about Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan? Their cartoonishly goofy scene at the beginning almost had me giving up on watching.\n\nThe jokes fall flat most of the times. Some of the ideas had potential, but were too badly handled to work. In particular, the 'Evil Dead' and 'Black Swan' spoofs and the scenes involving Snoop Dog (Lion?) could have been great; but the first two ended up too stupid to work, whereas the last one was just too dry/badly acted.\n\nThe closest to a saving grace this movie has is the 'Inception' spoof, which might be the only moment I laughed at all, and the fact this is a relatively short film at only 86 minutes long. This was just embarrassingly bad."

However, if you are just the slightest familiar with the \"Scary Movie\" movies, then you know what you are in for here in this fifth installment - more goofs, spoofs and cheap laughs.\n\nThe storyline is basically the same as the previous movies, a vague red line throughout the course of the movie, on which a series of spoof elements of other movies are built up. Does it work? Sure, as there is coherency in the storyline.\n\n\"Scary MoVie\" does manage to pull off the spoofs in the great way that the the movie series is known for and doing well, compared to other spoof movies available on the market.\n\nHowever, the movie never really manages to rise itself above mediocrity, rolling on jokes and situations that you see coming a mile away. Is the movie funny? Yeah, to a certain extend. Does it entertain? Yeah, to a certain extend. Is it a movie that is a must to watch? Hardly so.\n\nThe people cast for the various roles were doing great jobs with their given silly roles, as always and as in the previous movies. So they are keeping the style going from the previous movies. Also the effects in the movie were quite good and did really work out quite well in favor of the movie. And the movies spoofed in \"Scary MoVie\" were nicely made fun in great ways and isn't a good spoof always good for a couple of laughs?"

People can steal ideas from the wayans, but no one comes close with the delivery of satire except the greats.\n\nBut we're talking about the future of comedy here Leave the comedy to the comics the rapping to the rappers and the acting to the actors. How original was it to use charlie and joke about him dying and partying on. Its not even offensive.... Thats the problem here"

I've seen better low budget parody movies in the last 6 months, that probably had about an 8th of the budget as this. The actors used were of very low talent, and you know you've done something wrong when you cannot even get the series lead star to come back for the fifth movie.

What disappointed me the most was that these movies show that spoof is a dying genre, back in the days we had amazing spoofs, now we have garbage.

        "review_detailed_main": "David Zucker was the man responsible for some of the funniest spoofs of the 1980s - I'm thinking AIRPLANE! and the NAKED GUN trilogy - so it's sad to see how far his gravitas has fallen in working on the fifth instalment of a film series that was rubbish from the outset. The only good thing about SCARY MOVIE 5 is that Anna Faris isn't in it, which has to be a positive. Other than that, it's business as usual, with no story, tons of cameo appearances, and loads of lame, gross-out jokes.\n\nThis film's opening scene, featuring Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, is actually the funniest of the entire movie. It's a short spoof of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, and it plays out ridiculously over the top, as you'd expect, but it did make me laugh out loud. Unfortunately the film then shifts to a pair of uninteresting characters and virtually retells the plot of the horror flick MAMA while throwing in lots of other random spoofs along the way.\n\nThis series has always had a scattershot approach so we get riffs on the likes of DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, EVIL DEAD, and even BLACK SWAN for random measure. The humour is always stupid and only a small handful of the jokes actually work. I guess with Marlon Wayans being out of the franchise the film-makers had to bring in a black 'street' presence, so we get Snoop Dogg in some random, extraneous sub-plot. Terry Crews, Jerry O'Connell, Mike Tyson, and Heather Locklear have cameos. Overall, I'd recommend changing the channel."

        "review_detailed_main": "2013 has had a very serious lack of comedy. What we have been sold in the comedy genre has been embarrassingly bad, low-brow humor or indie dramatic comedies where the film's emotional core always over-shadows any potential laughs. They are cute but rarely deliver true laugh-out-loud moments. As we patiently wait in anticipation for the master of comedy, Adam McKay, to have his newest film, Anchorman 2, released in theaters, we find ourselves desperate for a fix of comedy. This is how we end up watching a film like Scary Movie V.\n\nThe original Scary Movie was a much needed parody of Scream and all the pathetic slasher film rip-offs that followed. While there were some scenes where the film was trying too hard to be funny, the screenplay flawlessly blended together all the slasher flicks that followed Scream and had it's own original twist ending that took bits from all the best films of the 90's. It was the first good parody film since the 80's when Jim Abrahams and Jerry and David Zucker were working together on such classics as The Naked Gun and Airplane!\n\nThe poster for Scary Movie had the tagline: No mercy. No shame. No sequel. Yet they didn't just make a shameful sequel, they made 3 of them. Even bringing in David Zucker to take over for Keenen Ivory Wayans as director for parts 3 and 4 didn't help. With every entry in the series, the films only got worse. Even as guilty pleasures to watch with friends for mindless entertainment, they stopped working as all the attempts at jokes were only pop-culture references that quickly became out-dated. We didn't think it could get worse than Scary Movie 4 but we were wrong, dead wrong.\n\nScary Movie V or Scary MoVie takes both film parodies and film itself to an unprecedented new low. While it's safe to say this will be the worse movie of 2013, it is an understatement. It is worse than that. It's one of the worse films to have ever been made and makes Grown-Ups 2 seem Oscar-worthy."

Its hard to believe how this film was even made and whats more shocking is that the actors actually thought it would be a good idea to be in it.\n\nI will point out that i am not a huge fan of horror films so i may not have a great knowledge on some of the movies being parodied. I shouldn't and wouldn't expect a movie like this to be 10/10 as it is just a silly parody movie and i have seen the others in the series. The writing was okay in the previous ones and there were definitely laughs throughout but this one the writing is awful and the movie relies heavily on slapstick humour. I half giggled once i think in the whole movie.\n\nI wouldn't bother wasting your time to see this, i even think 'A haunted house' is better than this and that is saying something. I can see why Anna Farris wasn't in it.\n\n1/10 I hope this is the last one."

        "review_title": "A parody film for the generation who can't sit still",
        "review_detailed_main": "If there was ever a franchise to run out of steam before it even began and was already too long and overdone simply by having one film in its series, it's a franchise belonging to the modern parody genre. I've mentioned before that this is probably the worst genre in cinematic history, and few other genres have experienced such a rapid decline in quality since their birth. The parody genre is still relatively new in terms of feature-length films, with works such as Airplane! and The Kentucky Fried Movie only dating back to the late seventies.\n\nWhy did those films work so well and why does Scary Movie V fail so miserably? Because their prime goal wasn't to parody as many films as possible, but rather try and make fun of genre-conventions and certain obligatory things audiences have become accustomed to for so long. When watching a film like Airplane!, it almost makes you a more aware moviegoer because you're seeing how often these clich\u00e9s are used and how laughable they actually are when put to a sillier context.\n\nScary Movie V has nothing - simply nothing - to work with, and for sixty-eight minutes does it lumber lifelessly to the next ridiculous and boring film parody before abandoning it almost entirely. There's so much going on, while simultaneously so little, that the film gets its story lost. It keeps changing tones, parody elements, themes, characters, and events to the point that this is nothing more than an overlong collage of cheaply redone scenes from other films of recent years.\n\nThe four main films the picture is predicated off of are Mama, Paranormal Activity, Black Swan, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Right off the bat, boy are we a dated party-guest trying desperately to be in-the-loop. Bloody Disgusting's website tells me Scary Movie V began shooting in September 2012, but the film managed to incorporate parodies of Mama and Evil Dead, which didn't hit theaters until the first and second quarters of 2013. This is obviously a move to try and remain current by the time the film comes out. However, because these movies weren't out at the time, the material used to parody them is thin and taken from the trailers, which isn't very convincing or fun. And even so, in three years, who will laugh at these references? More films along the lines of the aforementioned horror films will inevitably be released. Films like Airplane! never get old because their genre-clich\u00e9s won't allow to them.\n\nFor the first time in the franchise's history, Anna Faris and Regina Hall do not appear at all, and the dubious honor of being lead characters in a redundant parody film are handed to Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash. Other stars such as Lindsay Lohan, Charlie Sheen, Snoop Dogg, Mike Tyson, Jerry O'Connell, and Katt Williams star as predominately cameos in a film where itself is one big cameo in the field of cinema. Nobody looks to be trying here, and frankly, they don't need to. Pat Proft and David Zucker's screenplay leaves almost no imagination and in just over an hour's worth of time manages to make every joke go on for way too long and make one of the tedious comedy ventures so far this year.\n\nWhile I haven't formally reviewed the previous films in the series, I have seen them all in either the theater or on DVD. The first was a nifty little feature, following in the footsteps of Scream to a reasonably charming effect. The second film is one of the few cases where the sequel is actually more impressive and funnier than the original film (the same thing happened with Scream 2, in my opinion). The third and forth were instantly forgettable endeavors capitalizing off of the goal to make these films more of a competition of references than actual films with plot that feature jabs at conventions and modern films. The series fell off when Shawn and Marlon Wayans were booted, resulting in David Zucker taking over from there. This is when the films became safe, woefully unremarkable, stale, and disposable.\n\nThe word for Scary Movie V is \"lifeless,\" as everything from writing, acting, and even directing by Malcolm D. Lee seems to be nothing more than a pitiful cash-in on material gone dry. When a film dedicated to lampooning other films is trying this hard to make the audiences laugh, it doesn't seem to be any better, more sophisticated, or on any other level than the films being mocked.\n\nStarring: Ashley Tisdale, Erica Ash, Simon Rex, Molly Shannon, Heather Locklear, J.P. Manoux, Jerry O'Connell, Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, Mike Tyson, Snoop Dogg, and Katt Williams. Directed by: Malcolm D. Lee."

The film had some good ideas, like the \"Black Swan\" and \"Evil Dead\" but were poorly excited. The only character in the film I actually enjoyed seeing was the Spanish Maid. The rest were unmemorable and a poor choice. Simon Rex ruined this movie. I also loved how at the bottom of the screen (only when it is meant to be shot by video camera), they is the REC or the time, even when they are looking at different angles when there should be no camera there. Main example being when Rex is putting up cameras and he keeps harming himself and we see everything from direction but there are no cameras to be seen. Even when he is supposed to be screwing in a camera in his hand to the wall, we see everything for a cameras point of view from where he is going to put it. Overall, this new addition to the Scary Movie franchise was a letdown due to bad editing, bad writing, bad casting and the evident absence of Anna Faris."

        "review_title": "\"Scary Movie 5\" is certainly the worst of the series so far and t's time for the franchise to rest, being buried six feet under the ground",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is the bitter end to a series that brought the parody genre to the fore again in the early 2000s and, unfortunately, what we see is a depressing ending, and that is not a word that should be used to define a proposed film. Making you laugh. Gathering a handful of actors without criteria was definitely a bad idea and a lack of commitment to the loyal audience of the series, who valued the old cast. The embarrassment of seeing jokes being made without any effect, or the rescue of commonplaces already overused in the previous four features, is to discourage anyone who has followed the development of the first films. The frustration, among other reasons, is to see a comedy that once was so authorial become silly, with bad seats, jokes out of timing and an excess of nonsense that often does not fit the scene.\n\nAfter David Zucker passed the baton of direction to Malcolm D. Lee, the Scary Movie franchise reached its fifth volume, rivaling in formula and content with the production of Marlon Wayans, Paranormal Inactivity, even coinciding with the parody objects, using the typical first person footage of Paranormal Activity to start your tape. The first news that shocked fans and made us wrinkle our noses was the news that Cindy (Anna Faris) and Brenda (Regina Hall) would not return. How would they manage to make a film in the series without the two main stars? Perhaps the new part of the franchise could be saved by other characters, such as Mahalik (Anthony Anderson), CJ (Kevin Hart) or the president (Leslie Nielsen), but they also don't appear. In fact, \"Scary Movie5\" does not bring back any character in the franchise, absolutely none. Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex even return, but playing different characters, the first participates in the bad opening scene and the second is one of the protagonists.\n\nAfter a mysterious incident involving a couple, played by Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, their daughters Kathy (Gracie Whitton) and Lily (Alva Kolker) somehow - equally mysterious, but this time, because of the script - they end up in a cabin in the forest, where they are found by a pair of stereotyped drug addicts experienced by Snoop Dog and Mac Miller. After being rescued, the children are adopted by their father's brother, Dan (Simon Rex), and his wife Jody (Ashley Tisdale). After that, strange things start to happen at the family home.\n\nLet's talk more about opening this part. The scene begins with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan as a couple about to have sex and who are haunted by a ghost. The scene is ridiculous and sloppy from start to finish, with poor performances and an even worse script, full of exaggerations and appeals to make the viewer laugh forcibly, which does not work. Soon after, we have another \"opening scene\", in which two friends, played by rappers Snoop Dogg and Mac Miller, come across a hut in the middle of the forest and there are two children. The scene is as ridiculous as the first, with stupid dialogues and even worse performances.\n\nThis fifth part of the series focuses on the story of \"Mama\", but obviously makes reference to several other films - regardless of the genre - during the narrative, such as \"Paranormal Activity\", \"Evil Dead\", \"The Conjuring\", \"The Last Exorcism\", \"Black Swan\", \"Inception\" and the prelude to \"Planet of the Apes\". Originally, the feature would be a parody of \"Panic 4\", just as Inceptional was a parody of the first feature in the horror franchise. However, Wes Craven's film did not achieve the expected commercial success, forcing the parody producers to change their minds. This highlights the fragility of the proposal, which depends directly on the public's prior knowledge of other works to be minimally understood.\n\nReferences to horror films continue, showing Jody's dramas, with repetitive jokes that compare ballet to pole dance. The freak show involving ghosts and demons continues to haunt the existence of the couple, without any condition to make their viewer laugh, making the level of the first four films worse. The tape tries to mix all the aforementioned films looking for an identity, failing to find a minimally acceptable narrative line, since all the elements that add to Jody's drama are completely dispersed from any cohesion or dramaturgical structure. Few of the moments of humor manage to overcome the simple barrier of comedy, not even amusing the public accustomed to torn humorous.\n\nZucker's departure from directing, for him to only write and produce the film, exhibited a considerable decrease in quality, not even having what worked in the rest of Everyone in Panic. The complete absence of positive predicates makes fans more eager for this cinematographic subgenre to ask themselves if the format has any chance of returning to function as entertainment, because even the undemanding viewer this Scary Movie5 is unable to please.\n\nIncidentally, the main gags of the film are totally unnecessary for the story's progress, demonstrating the lack of creativity and resourcefulness of the writers. This incompetence can also be seen in the appealing content of some scenes, where the extreme bad taste gets to be offensive, especially in the scene involving Lily and an ice lollipop. Some moments try to emulate the silly humor style of silent films, even using stop-motion in a desperate attempt to offer something that the public has not yet seen in previous films. This is so out of context that they look like bonus scenes during the film itself. When a parody reaches the point of parodying itself - as in certain scenes that refer to the first feature of the franchise -, it is a sign that it has reached rock bottom.\n\nThe seven intervening years, which took place between the launch of Scary Movie 4 and the production of Scary Movie 5, served to age the type of humor that had been done so far very badly. The audience is different and has aged together. The poorly thought-out sexual scenes are not so pleasing to an audience that in the early 2000s was excited about the bizarre American Pie, and that Scary Movie explored so well. The jokes with the monkeys, the horrible prologue that makes the parody of Paranormal Activity, the first entire act contained of absurdity etc. Takes this film to the bottom of the well. Places that could be used so well here are thrown in the trash.\n\nThe prologue's metalanguage, of playing with the figures of Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen, does not bring anything new, in fact, it embarrasses the lack of humor in the initial scene, which does not even try to overcome what had already been done. A big problem in this film is the fact that many jokes need to be explained, reaffirmed, many times, by the character who does it. By the way, if humor needs to be explained it is a sign that there is no genuine connection between what is said and the recipient. Already aware of the lack of creativity in the script, many insights are explained within the narrative itself, as in the scene of the newspaper anchor's wife, who needs to reaffirm that she is betraying him - this after the joke has already been made - so that we realize that the scene has a touch of humor. Kind of like making a joke and explaining right away: \"Hi, I made a joke, you know?\". In fact, narration is used within the film, a resource not previously used, which only highlights the need for this film to seek grace at all costs, even if it explains its own jocularities.\n\nWith the departure of Anna Faris and Regina Hall, the cast became very weak. Simon Rex has never been one of the strengths of the franchise, but here it is ridiculously bad. The famous non-actors invited to participate, such as Mac Miller, Snoop Dogg and Usher only make things worse and there is more for Ashley Tisdale, the only one with a really good performance in the film. The actress is no Anna Faris, but she manages to perform quite well in the midst of so much mediocrity. Probably \"Scary Movie5\" will not have a continuation, not only because of the bad reception by the public, but also because it got the worst box office. If that happens, we will miss Cindy, Brenda, Mahalik, CJ and the others.\n\nAs if that were not enough, added to all of this we have a montage out of rhythm and continuity that further impairs the effectiveness of humor, which no longer works by itself. \"Scary Movie5\" is certainly the worst of the series so far and one of the worst films ever made in recent years. The sensation of total loss of time invades the thought of those who watch the tape until the end, making the prospect worse by imagining that there may be other numbers like this. The relief almost comes after 74 minutes when the final credits go up after it wasn't possible to have a laugh. Malcolm D. Lee's film suffers from the worst thing that can happen to a comedy film: lack of comic timing. It's time for the franchise to rest, being buried six feet under the ground."

Sure, when you watch this kind of film, don't expect brilliance, just open you mind and close your brain - this parody really works. Now i know for sure, when in the titles you see names Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein - this film is going to be good, they definitely know how to make movies work."

The beginning with Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan playing themselves was actually funny. They poked fun at themselves in a good way, but other supporting cast wasn't that good at all.I think after the first 2 they kind of lost their luster. Just kept getting more ridiculous. I get the point,but it relied way to much on physical humor. Simon Rex isn't that horrible of an actor, he just needs some better material. Bottom line is don't waste your time on this crap!

It's a shame really because with proper innovative writing there should have been many better spoof movies to be made with so much content to pull from and make fun of.\n\nNow for this movie, it is simply meh. There's a couple of chuckles here and there but mostly you'd have to be 13 and this is the first comedy you've ever seen to enjoy this really. A shame really because it does have quite a few talented comedic actors in it but I think they went to a junior high and asked them to pen the script or the \"adult\" writers were far too baked at work."

The plot is that a couple and their child move into a new house which is haunted. And that's it nothing else happens. This film is probably one of the worse films i have ever seen.

The movie also features a plethora of celebrity cameos from Jerry O'Connell, Terry Crews, Katt Williams, Snoop Dogg, etc. In a painful attempt to squeeze out a laugh from the audience.\n\nThis probably won't surprise any of you but.....All of Scary Movie 5' s attempts at humor are Needlessly Vulgar, And painfully unfunny and actually mean-spirited. The only time I remember laughing was Molly Shannon' s cameo. The biggest problem with this movie (Aside from the fact that it exists.)

It's actually more engaging that her counterpart in \"Mama\".\n\nThey pack in a lot of contemporary movie references, fascinatingly woven together, fun gags, some naughty stuff, cute little girls and a few pretty pertinent comments on the aesthetic choices of movies.\n\nWhy are people tearing into it?

You'd think with that long a wait, the creators would at least try to improve on the humor so it wouldn't rely too much on gross out toilet and sex humor, but sadly, we are mistaken.\n\nStarting with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to do a video (can't say which kind in case IMDb guidelines are against it) in a messed up parody of Paranormal Activity, the story begins with Sheen's children being found by two guys who were fleeing from cannibis growers (played by Snoop Dogg and Mac Miller), they are taken under the care of his brother, Dan Sanders, and his wife, Dina. However, by bringing them to a new home, they also bring home a terrible evil.\n\nBasically, the gross humor is back, and it's joined by another kind of humor: child abuse, as some scenes have the children being harmed in what looks like comedic situations (one scene has Aiden, the baby, get his head set on fire, with Dan using a fire extinguisher to put it out, which also launches Kathy, another of the three kids, into something that bumps her head). Also, this film has a lot of disturbing stuff for a film carrying the PG-13 rating, making me wonder how they got away with it. Stay away from this film at all costs."

Could it be that this latest and still equally redundant sequel is slightly better than the previous ones? Don't get me wrong, it's still a very lackluster effort \u2013 hence my four out of ten rating \u2013 and it's maximally on par with the mediocre original of the series, but at least I chuckled a couple of times and I even caught myself thinking that a handful of the gags and situations were moderately ingenious! Maybe it's because the annoying lead actress Ana Faris got replaced by the less annoying Brittany Murphy lookalike Ashley Tisdale or perhaps the parody veterans David Zucker and Pat Proft (\"Airplane\", \"Hot Shots!\") found their occasional old shape back? Who knows, maybe it's even linked to the fact there was a decent period gap of seven years since the last film this time, whereas the previous films followed each other with an interval of one or two years. Part five primarily focuses itself on spoofing the okay but vastly overrated \"Mama\". Next to that, it also makes fun of a series of other recent attempts at horror/thriller, including \"The Evil Dead\" (remake), \"Black Swan\", \"Paranormal Activity\" and the latest sequels to \"Planet of the Apes\". For me personally, it probably helped that I disliked every single one of these flicks. Simon Rex' stupid facial expressions are sometimes fun and particularly the parody of \"The Cabin in the Woods\" and \"The Evil Dead\" made me smile. Still 90% of the script is downright embarrassing and even too retarded for words, most notably all sequences with the Latina housemaid and the intelligent monkey. My advice would be not to spend any money on this, but watch it when it comes on television and don't be afraid to fall asleep, since you won't miss out on anything."

At times the movie is actually quite repulsing and disturbing with a humor that only the hardest of snuff fans would understand.\n\nThe humor in other parts of the film were at times worthy of a chuckle or a smile, but not the whole hearted roaring laughter that the first scary movie scavenged from me. I would not recommend this title to anyone who likes to spend their money on enjoyable movies and popcorn that isn't tossed towards the screen in a violent flurry.\n\nHowever, one aspect worth merit from me was the portrayal of Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen in the opening scenes as they were captured perfectly and did very well playing *themselves.*"

It's the one of the worst things I have ever seen in my life (so far).\n\nI had to try it out, although my friends told me not to, because I'm a fan of the scary movie saga. The first one was great, the second was kind of good, the third was hilarious and the fourth was good.\n\nThere are so many things that don't make sense in this movie. I didn't crack a smile the WHOLE 86 minutes. I'm being dead serious. It's not even funny because I wasted precious time of my life, but that's what happens when they make very bad movie attempts.\n\nI still have a few questions on my thoughts though... What happened to the movie parodies they used to do? Did they run out of ideas? Why is it so unoriginal, boring and stupid? What's with all the celebrities that don't fit in? Is this a celebrity hangout or something? Who would want to watch that? Is it time to end the scary movie saga here?\n\nIf anybody is kind enough to answer my questions I would really appreciate it..\n\nI'm telling you right now I would have more fun watching a rhino taking a dump. I didn't think it was this bad but I was wrong. If you are curious to see how bad it sucks just do yourself a favor and buy some candy or do something else with your money and time.\n\nBefore I end this I just want to say it is not worth the time nor the money so don't even try! You have been warned!"

The jokes are infantile and seem to have been written by a 13 year old. I give it a 2 because that's how many times I almost laughed at their jokes. This is supposed to be a funny film, but I found the jokes really dirty and immature. Scary Movie's jokes used to be mature and funny. Maybe that's just me, maybe I grew up for those jokes, but I bet if I watch the first one I'll laugh my pants off. I really wonder what came through the producer's minds when they made it. The plot is terrible, everything seems to be sped up, everything happens really fast and unprofessionally. I would not recommend anyone watching it. It was the biggest waste of time of my life. I don't remember watching such a terrible movie in a really long time. But oh well, what could we expect from a series of movies that has been inactive for 7 years. I only expected better quality and good jokes. I didn't get any of those, instead we see plastic babies and 12 year old jokes. I feel sorry for everyone who lost one and a half hour of their lives watching this crap. Cheers."

        "review_detailed_main": "...if you saw someone fall over in the street, not really hurting themselves, would you laugh? Probably. However, if you saw someone fall over in the street twenty to thirty times, would you still find it that amusing? Unfortunately, the latest in the Scary Movie franchise does to rely on people simply falling over again and again (and again) to get the majority of its laughs. And this is a shame, because - believe it or not - there are actually some quite amusing moments in the film.\n\nThe first Scary Movie (if you can remember that far back!) parodied Scream and, as a result, followed the story pretty closely. Therefore, Scary Movie (1) actually HAD a story. By the time we arrive at number five, it's a mish-mash of a dozen different horror films, therefore there's hardly a story to speak of. Yes, most of it tries to copy 'Mama' (and if you haven't seen Mama then most of the remaining gags will probably be lost on you), but expect moments from Evil Dead, Paranormal Activity, Inception, Black Swan and Rise of Planet of the Apes.\n\nHowever, it's not all bad. Ashley Tisdale is surprisingly enjoyable and dippy to watch (a reasonable substitute for the missing Anna Farris) and the opening with Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan mercilessly lampooning themselves is sheer comedy gold (just a pity they're only in the first ten minutes).\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, you may get some enjoyment out of it. I think it's certainly better than parts 2 and 4 (which I hated). However, you really have to know ALL the horror movies lampooned to get maximum enjoyment out of it (plus be able to overlook the numerous pratfalls which make up too much of the film)."

I don;t have the courage to watch other spoof movie in my life.\n\nSpoofing heck of a lot of horror movies, it turns out to be a horror to the audience. Cheap dialogs, gross-out sequences, vulgar references all induce repugnance, but humor. The main idea of the Scary Movie franchise is lost in this piece of extremely ridiculous depiction. I laughed countably 2 times and that I don't wanna remember. Supporting cast sucks with the lead ones. If one thing I liked about it is the spoof on Inception. That was funny.\n\nMusic is average, editing is fine. Awful direction & writing makes this a no-brainer. It has nothing to deliver. I thank the makers they did not instill flesh show. 2.0/10.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Not recommended. The worst film in the series. The worst spoof comedy ever.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family?

        "review_detailed_main": "'SCARY MOVIE 5': Two Stars (Out of Five)\n\nThe fifth installment in the never ending 'SCARY MOVIE' franchise, which began in 2000 with the Wayans brothers at the helm (the eldest, Keenen, directed the original film and his brothers Shawn and Marlon co-wrote and co-starred in it). It was a huge financial hit but was also loathed by most critics and movie fans. The second film was helmed by the same trio of Wayans, performing the same duties, but was much less successful at the box office and even more despised by critics and cinephiles. David Zucker (who co-directed and co-wrote such classic spoof comedy films as 'AIRPLANE!', 'THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD!', 'TOP SECRET!' and 'BASEKETBALL') took over directing duties (from Keenen Ivory Wayans) on the third film and Craig Mazin (who also co-wrote the 'HANGOVER' sequels) and Pat Proft (who co-wrote such classic comedies as 'POLICE ACADEMY', 'HOT SHOTS!', 'BACHELOR PARTY' and 'REAL GENIUS') took over writing duties. It was a huge hit and a noticeable improvement over the previous installments. Jim Abrahams (who also co-wrote 'AIRPLANE!', 'TOP SECRET!' and 'HOT SHOTS', as well as another classic 'THE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE') also joined the writing team on 'SCARY MOVIE 4'. It wasn't quite as good or successful as '3' but it was still a better film than the first two movies. Now we get 'SCARY MOVIE 5', which was written by Zucker and Proft but directed by Malcolm D. Lee (who's directed such hit comedy films as 'UNDERCOVER BROTHER', 'SOUL MEN' and 'THE BEST MAN'). It's not as bad as the Wayans brothers' two installments but it is a lot worse than the last two movies.\n\nLike all the other films in the series it spoofs mostly current hit horror films but it also parodies popular movies in general, as well as pop culture (like the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' novel). This one mainly spoofs the films 'MAMA', 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY', 'BLACK SWAN', 'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES', 'INCEPTION' and 'EVIL DEAD' (even though the last film was released just a week prior to this movie). The film revolves around Charlie Sheen and his three children going missing. Sheen's kids are then found in the woods, living like wild animals and having been raised by a spirit called 'Mama'. Sheen's brother and brother's girlfriend take the kids in. The movie stars Simon Rex as Sheen's brother (who also appeared in 'SCARY MOVIE 3' and '4', as another character) and Ashley Tisdale as his girlfriend. It features cameos from other stars like Lindsay Lohan, Darrel Hammond, Molly Shannon, Snoop Dog, Heather Locklear and Jerry O'Connell. It's the first film in the series to not feature Anna Faris or Regina Hall.\n\nThe film is bad, there's hardly a funny joke in the entire movie, but I still found it amusing. Mostly just because I like movies so much (and especially the horror genre) that I just enjoyed all the film references. I agree with all the critics that it's poorly written and just plain stupid but it at least isn't full of over-the-top gross-out humor like the first two movies and it isn't quite as stupid either (in my opinion). The Wayans' films were painfully bad and unfunny (for me). I couldn't stand watching them. This installment was at least amusing (for me) and I liked watching all the stars in it. It's not as good as 'SCARY MOVIE 3' or '4' but some film nuts might get a slight kick out of it (like I did).\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDL6l-UAwQ"

The earlier installments were undeniably cheesy and stupid but that's why I love them. This one was cheesy and stupid for the wrong reasons and I didn't laugh a single time.\n\nI finished it even though it felt like torture. Would not recommend you waste your time on this one."

Scary Movie 3 is by far the greatest, and Scary Movie 4 is not that fare behind. But then there is this....honestly, they should have never made this film. What made the first four film successes are gone. This film has some good moments but on the whole, it's not a good or funny movie.\n\nMalcolm D. Lee's film directs this spoof that spoofs films like the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Black Swan, Mama, and so on. It's basically about this girl who believes her house is haunted by this terrifying poltergeist.\n\nIs it even safe to talk about the acting? The acting is pretty lame. Ashley Tisdale has the makings of a good actress, but not here. Simon Rex, what on earth happened from the good ol' days of Scary Movie 3? Everyone here made Lindsay Lohan seem like an Oscar-nominated actress.\n\nOverall, Scary Movie 5 is very disappointing because it's just a lame duck. All the Scary Movies are stupid and dumb, but in a fun way. In this film, I did lots of grimacing. There were some good moments here, namely the real-life spoofs of Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen. Here's hoping they make no more of these films. I rate this film 4/10."

Flashes of brilliance amid a lot of unfunny filler.\n\nThe highest praise I can offer this one is that since they use none of the original characters (but a few familiar faces in the cast) they could release it without crediting Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer anywhere on it.\n\nIf you liked the previous 4 movies then you will probably like this one as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked the first Scary Movie film, it was a decent spoof of the horror genre and while the others are noticeably weaker they still have their moments. Scary Movie 5 has absolutely none of that and is sadly one of the worst comedy films I have ever seen, if not films I have ever seen. It isn't even a horror parody by this point, it's just references to pop culture at the time like in the Friedberg and Seltzer films, and it's just as bad as those.\n\nThe storyline is non existent, it's a string of completely humourless scenes after the other and it is difficult to watch. The acting is poor, even Charlie Sheen who is usually a pretty good actor falls flat, much of it is to do with the writing I would guess. Anna Faris did a decent job in the first 4 films and her deadpan and comedic timing weren't bad. Snoop Dogg should stick to rapping.\n\nThe characters are all so one dimensional and boring it makes you wonder how the writers were allowed to work on this film. One surprising fact is that David Zucker of all people worked on this, the same Zucker that wrote two of the funniest films ever made, Airplane and The Naked Gun.\n\nI didn't laugh once in Scary Movie 5, I found about 2 moments funny but not funny enough to generate a laugh.\n\nThe gags are so lowbrow even Date Movie's jokes are intelligent by comparison. There is no value to this film and its spot in the bottom 100 is well deserved.\n\n2/10. Awful."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first Scary Movie was decent. It didn't deserve a sequel let alone 4! Scary Movie 3 was alright, mainly because they had replaced the foul juvenile Wayans brothers with the writer of Airplane! and The Naked Gun. Getting rid of the scatological crude humor and bringing in the cleverer intelligent laughs worked. But Scary MoVie is just as bad possibly even worse than the sickening antics of Scary Movie 2.\n\nUsually in a review I would do a summary of the plot. But the writers of Scary MoVie haven't got time for plots! Ashley Tisdale and Simon Rex adopt some weird kids, movie into a new house and vulgar toilet jokes ensue. The weird kids are obviously meant to be like the weird kids from Mama. (SPOOF NUMBER ONE). And Simon Rex works at an ape training lab, which is meant to be like Rise of the Planet of the Apes. (SPOOF NUMBER TWO). His girlfriend Ashley Tisdale is a ballet dancer who is trying to keep the lead role of The Dying Swan which is meant to be like Black Swan. (SPOOF NUMBER THREE).When their asleep loads of jump scares and loud noises are happening, all while being filmed with surveillance cameras. That's meant to be like the Paranormal Activity franchise. (SPOOF NUMBER FOUR). At the beginning of the movie Snoop Dog and some other guy (who looks like Macklemore but isn't Macklemore) are going through a forest and find an old cabin in the woods, that's meant to be like you guessed it The Cabin In The Woods. (SPOOF NUMBER FIVE). Later on Ashley Tisdale goes to the cabin in the woods and a bunch of teenagers are there. There all praising religion and singing cheerful songs, which is the exact opposite of what they do in The Evil Dead. (SPOOF NUMBER SIX). A Morgan Freeman soundalike is narrating the movie, which is meant to be like all those movies which Morgan Freeman has narrated. (SPOOF NUMBER SEVEN). When Ashley Tisdale starts having messed up dreams she gets a dream specialist to help her out. The dream specialist looks exactly like Leonardo Di Caprio from Inception, they even have the bit where he's explaining everything at a cafe. (SPOOF NUMBER EIGHT). And finally for one reason or another Ashley Tisdale ends up in a bedroom about to bang with Christian Grey. That's meant to be like the book 50 Shades of Grey. (SPOOF NUMBER NINE).\n\nSo there are 9 different spoofs in an 86 minute movie. That's something like 1 spoof every 8 minutes. When a movie copies a scene or a concept from another movie but adds in some sh*t jokes, it doesn't make a parody it makes a sh*tty mess!\n\nTo makes matters worse all of the characters in the movie are annoying and deserve to die. I was trying to think of someone who was likable and appeared in Scary MoVie. But they don't exist! Simon Rex's character wasn't too bad at the start, but he got so stupid it was unbearable. This is just another 21st century spoof movie - not funny at all! There hasn't been an above average spoof movie since 1994 when the third Naked Gun movie came out. It seems to be no longer possible!\n\nOverall I give Scary MoVie 4/10 for 7 laughs throughout the whole 86 minute movie, mainly because of the mildly amusing narrator."

Since then there have been many mishaps with the franchise, but each film since its original has seem to appear lower than its processor (with some exceptions) due to subjectivity. However Scary Movie 5 appears to be the lowest the film has sunk. We are witnessed to an unfunny and tiresome spoof film where the directors use tiresome and rehashed jokes to fill time. The film does have certain moments but even in those moments the jokes rarely connect. In general the jokes are mainly misses and the film becomes uninteresting towards the final act. Perhaps it is for the best that this was the final nail in the coffin for the Scary Movie franchise.\n\n=== As a rewatch 01/04/19' Scary Movie 5 remains the worst of the franchise. Having watching the previous films upon the week, and having forgotten much about this film, one remained slightly unaware of how this film was.\n\nThis film is quite short in runtime, ending at about 73 minutes (excluding end credits) with many more misses in laughs than hits. The main parodies included Paranormal Activity, Black Swan and Planet of the Apes, along with the Cabin in the Woods, Inception and a few other major blockbusters (many non horror films).\n\nThe Inception scene parody was possibly the highlight, along with some of the Ape scenes. There were several cameo appearances but most of them were quite dull. Apart from that, this film was mainly unfunny and reason as to why this was the lowest grossing film of the Scary Movie franchise.\n\nAs a rewatch 04/06/23' opinions remain same. Easily the worst film of the franchise and what ultimately killed the franchise. Tries a little too hard in being funny where everything misses."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's the early 2000s parody formula but \"butchered\" in 2013. All you need is to base the story on few recent and successful high budget movies, make fun of everything and everyone in the most ridiculous ways, have action/horror which mostly leads to comedy which in this case leads to very bad comedy, sexy girls and everything else you would expect from a parody.\n\nIt took them 7 years to finally release another Scary movie. My expectations were low but I didn't realize it would be this bad. It has maybe a few funny moments but the rest of it for me was just painful to watch. I managed to watch it all despite that. I tried to watch it as open-minded I as I possibly could but overall the movie feels like it trying too hard and usually doesn't achieve the goal it pursues. I liked the original few movies of the franchise. They are not good but not too terrible. They are kinda alright and even watchable after all these years but this wasn't and feels like the Scary movie magic is gone.\n\nOverall I think a lot of people will not enjoy it and a small portion will. Personally, after watching the original movie this feels like the worst parody I have ever seen so it's a 2 out of 10 and only because I liked one scene otherwise it would be a 1/10 I wouldn't recommend this to anyone familiar or not with parodies at all."

I've been a HUGE fan of all Scary movie's (except the second one, which was awful but watchable), so I got very excited when I knew there was a 5th movie to watch, now that it's on Netflix I decided to continue watching the series but... oh god. I just couldn't stand more than 40 minutes, no laughing at all, the more that I got was some \"heh..\" twice, that's it. The movie got me SERIOUSLY depressed and I'm not being sarcastic, I was expecting to see another great movie and all I got was cheap repetitive and predictable jokes over and over, with non sense dialog leading no where. This HAS to be the worst movie Simon Rex has been, and that's sad.. because he can do way way better.\n\n2/10, I'll go back to scary movie 3-4 over and over to try and delete this one from my mind."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't even begin to describe how much I despise this movie. They seriously cram in as many pop culture references as possible. Some don't even have to do with scary movies! Scary Movie 5 is an unclever, unoriginal parody of films like The Paranormal Activity series and Black Swan (Black Swan, really guys? Are you that desperate for stretching your movie length?). The ONLY thing that I sort of liked in this movie was the stop-motion they used to parody Paranormal Activity, but still every single joke they crammed in there that actually worked they constantly repeated, ruining the joke altogether. It truly is scary what parody movies have become nowadays."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is this the worst of the Scary Movie films? Not really, Scary Movie 2 still holds that claim, but this movie just might be the killing blow to the franchise. The main parody here is the film \"Mama\" which I have never seen, probably never will, and as a result, a vast majority of the movies \"jokes\" flew over my head. The jokes I did understand weren't even that funny. The Inception spoof was probably the funniest part of the movie, but even that only provided a couple of chuckles. I laughed a few times, which is more then Scary Movie 2 (Zero) but the negative reception this film got, as well as poor box office will probably put this franchise to sleep for good."

The first and the second episodes of the series are unbelievably creative and magnificent which I believe makes everybody laugh, but when we move on the third and forth one we see drastic changes in the form of the series, which is expected due to the change of the director. But unbelievably On the fifth part, the series truns on its previous great shape; the fifth part has the lowest rate but i personally believe due to its hallucinating form of jokes is the best one."

You just have to have a sense of humor going into it. All the Scary Movies are the same. There's not much more you can do with them. If you didn't like the first one, you will not like any of them. Are they stupid? Yes!!! But they are meant to be!!! If you are looking for award winners, you shouldn't be watching this kind of movie anyway. These are meant for people with a sense of humor......and even a weird sense of humor sometimes. So all the one star submitters probably shouldn't have even tried watching this type of movie to start with. Bad acting....bad special effects. ...weird....politically incorrect scenes. ...is all part of it. So yes....I enjoyed it. It had all the things you would usually expect with a \"Scary Movie\""

If anybody begins a review with \"Scary Movie #5 had not ONE funny moment in it\", that reviewer is lazy at best and at worst, a liar. Then, other reviewers spend better than 2/3rds of its review discussing the plot and why it may be flawed. Then they score it a one.\n\nThis movie is very funny. This movie is often clever. Tisdale and Rex execute clever stuff beautifully. No doubt in my mind they will live up to good scripts and make bad scripts watchable,,--- No doubt.\n\nDo not press the play button with an edgy mood that fosters political correctness and inappropriate expectations, (whatever inappropriate expectations may be) or innovative genius. Expect a funny movie and damn the high brows, and me too if you like."
