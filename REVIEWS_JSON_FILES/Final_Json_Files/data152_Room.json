        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, 'Room' is a challenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But that is its sheer power. The Incredible Performances only add to the film's hefty nature.\n\n'Room' Synopsis: After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery: the outside world.\n\n'Room' is a disturbing story about bad things that happen to good people. But its also about hope & fighting back. Its shocking to see the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed & often disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son & mother escape. The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke down.\n\n'Room' is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is consistently powerful & the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny Abrahamson's Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic, unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Brie Larson & Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance. The child does wonders & makes 'Room' unforgettable. Of the supporting cast, Joan Allen & The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.\n\nOn the whole, 'Room' is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its power is undeniable."

        "review_detailed_main": "That review summary may sound very oxymoronic, but to me it applies to a film such as 'Room'. A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.\n\nWhat could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in 'Room', due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost.\n\nReally appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in 'Room', and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little.\n\nFor my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film's younger and more innocent viewpoint it's told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle.\n\nHowever, loved how the story was told and its approach. What 'Room' also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick.\n\nProduction values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. 'Room' is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that's both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly 'Room' is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness.\n\nCan't find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn't overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard clich\u00e9 role.\n\nOverall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won't work for some. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved (in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the best film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')"

        "review_title": "Awesome film - shame about the trailer",
        "review_detailed_main": "Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack's 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within 'Room' - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again?\n\nAnd that's where I'll leave this synopsis, since (if you've been lucky enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to unfurl here.\n\nThis is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and director (Irishman Lenny \"Frank\" Abrahamson) are to be commended in keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the 'evil kidnapper', is not painted as some predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised.\n\nThe film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay) but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comments that \"Nothing happened to them - - they just got on with their lives\".\n\nThe acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your vote here http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not that Boyega isn't great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here. She obviously won't give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as one of this year's weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two core performances lock in your belief in the story.\n\nSupporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy's mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the \"Bourne\" films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the kidnapper.\n\nAt 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true 'teaser trailer' this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but whoever it is they should be taken out and 'given a good talking to' for this travesty. It's like putting all of the twists in films like \"The Crying Game\", \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Gone Girl\" in their respective trailers. I've gone so far as to create my own One Mann's Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review.\n\nA leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of \"Die Hard\" or \"Fast and Furious\" fans. But for everyone else, this should be a must see.\n\nPlease visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks."

I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or less must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a first rate drama with stand out performances all round.

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a lot to admire about this film. The direction in the first hour and the final minutes, especially gets the most out of the concept and manages to make a 10 by 10 foot space seem like everything and eventually nothing. Likewise, the direction leaves much of the horror to the imagination and it is all the more chilling as a result. The screenplay is sparse and spartan in the way real life is around such horrific events. I like that several of the tensions in the story, i.e. grandfather's inability to deal with his grandson, are left unresolved. Finally Larson gives one hell of an understated, yet raw, performance that elevates the already strong material.\n\nBut much credit has to be given to Jacob Tremblay as well as the director for producing one of the finest, if not the finest, child performances of all time. I haven't seen a child actor as natural and real since at least Justin Henry in Kramer vs Kramer 40+ years ago. Tremblay has no artifice or pretension at all. Jack isn't cloying and so much of the emotional power comes from that character. It would be a remarkable performance no matter what but Jack is a hard character to play. Strictly speaking, Jack is the protagonist and it is his story-the movie at its core is a coming of age tale (abet a messed up one). The scenario that Jack is in is just hard for any person to really sell, let alone a child actor. It is a very good performance.\n\nThis is a good movie. It is hopeful in the end but it is intense."

The film's intimate setting, centered around a small room, feels almost suffocating at first, but it's this very confinement that heightens every emotion and interaction between Ma and Jack. Their bond is both heart-wrenching and beautiful, a testament to the human spirit's resilience in the face of unimaginable circumstances. The way the movie transitions from the claustrophobia of captivity to the vastness of the outside world mirrors the overwhelming mix of fear, hope, and discovery that both characters experience. It's a journey that's not just physical but deeply psychological.\n\nWhat's most striking about Room is how it balances darkness with light. Yes, the premise is intense, but the story is told with such tenderness and care that it leaves you with a sense of hope rather than despair. Jack's innocent perspective transforms what could have been a tale of horror into one of wonder and survival. By the time the credits roll, you're left in awe of how a single film can evoke such a wide range of emotions-from sadness to joy, from tension to relief. Room is more than just a movie; it's an experience that lingers long after you've watched it."

The movie moves forward and it does not stay stagnant at all. That is true regarding the story, but the characters have some other issues to solve.

        "review_title": "A Series of Plodding Events",
        "review_detailed_main": "At the start of Room, a young woman and her five-year-old son are living in the titular edifice, a backyard shed. The woman (Brie Larson) has always told Jack (Jacob Tremblay) that \"outer space\" is all that exists outside Room; as far as Jack is concerned, this is the gospel truth and the universe consists of Room and Room alone.\n\nIt is not giving anything away to note that Ma and Jack escape Room, as the movie is more about the ability of each to cope with the outside world. For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to Room, encounters different obstacles \u2013 the world has moved on, and she doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.\n\nI had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.) Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and (relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack and herself.\n\nTo say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things. We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing. We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot out of watching a whole lot of nothing.\n\nOnce they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents, played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them) grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.\n\nThe acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative, and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good \u2013 as is his character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than in the outside world (and with good reason).\n\nBut the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script. Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time contemplating things and not enough time doing them \u2013 or at least discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled \"A Series of Plodding Events.\" The second half goes a long way toward saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 'Room', there are lots of things we don't see. We don't see how the lead character, Joy, is raped by her abductor who keeps her imprisoned for more than five years with her little son Jack. We don't see how she is liberated by the police, after she manages to let her son escape. We don't see what happens to her abductor and rapist.\n\nThe director doesn't show all these things, because they distract from the theme of this movie: the way mother and son cope with their freedom. The surprising thing about this film is that this freedom turns out to be rather problematic in a lot of ways. Even so much so, that Jack starts to long for the intimacy and the routine of life inside the shed he called Room.\n\nThe film shows how life in Room is claustrophobic, but also intimate and familiar. There are no unexpected developments in Room, but there is a lot of love between mother and son. Once they escape Room, everything changes. For Jack, who has never known a world outside Room, this is very threatening. He has to share his mother's attention with other people, he has to get used to all sorts of impulses, he has to learn how things like a telephone work.\n\nIn this film, there is only one major dramatic event: Jack's escape and the subsequent liberation of his mother Joy. The rest of the film is rather uneventful: at first we see Joy and Jack in their daily routine in Room, and afterward we see them cope with all sorts of problems in the house of Joy's parents. Still, the film is almost never boring. The psychological developments make up for the lack of real action. And although there quite some emotional scenes, the director didn't make an outright tearjerker."

        "review_detailed_main": "Room stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. It offers Larson her best performance of her career and Tremblay a break out role. While he may not quite get past the whole \"kid actor\" stereotype he is admittedly better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets to see everything for the first time.\n\nYes it's an interesting plot that hasn't really been done before but it can't really pull it off. It's odd that it struggles so bad with making this a worthy adaption of the book seeing as the author actually wrote the film. Much like last years 'Gone Girl'. However 'Gone Girl' actually had a good director.\n\nThe one other film this director had done was 'Frank'. So I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, he may have proved to us that he is a one hit wonder. Because this film is not near as good as everyone is saying. This mainly steams from sloppy writing. Writing that would've probably worked in a book format. In that format you are able to show characters thoughts and feelings far easier than in film so you have to write accordingly.\n\nBut this doesn't happen. This is really the only reason this film fails. But it fails hard. From the first scenes of the film it was pretty clear that not enough thought went into making this a piece of cinema. Characters actions and reactions to everything feel absurdly artificial. Like a cop figuring out where the room they lived in was from one extremely vague sentence. Or how the film seems to pretend like these two had never made one single escape attempt.\n\nLiterally the second escape they try gets them out. I couldn't help think that they had never actually tried, because the guy didn't even hesitate to buy into their trick. In fact not one person in this film reacts naturally. Everyone was an extreme version of a normal person and it made nearly everyone in the film super unlikable. Especially the main two characters. They did virtually nothing aside from scream at whoever they wanted for no apparent reason.\n\nAlmost every conversation ended in an annoying screaming match between random people. A screaming match that either made no sense or just made you dislike the characters. So, when these two get out it's hard to legitimately care about them. You don't know anything about them other then the fact that they liked yelling for no reason.\n\n'Room' may have strong performances and an interesting idea to back it up but not much else. It has a hard time making you actually care about its characters. No one reacts like a human being but instead yells at each other when ever they feel like they need to. It wastes its best qualities with a limp and lifeless script that fails to appropriately adapt the acclaimed novel."

When Jack is five years old, Joy tells him that she lived with her parents in a comfortable house and a man called Old Nick lured and kidnapped her seven years ago. Joy plots a scheme to let Jack flee from the room and call the police. When they are rescued, they move to the house of Joy's mother and they have to begin the adaptation to the routine of a normal life. But is it not easy.\n\n\"Room\" is a sensitive and delicate film with a dramatic and realistic story of woman and child abuse and the effects in the aftermath. The screenplay is very well written increasing tension without the use of cheap means such as graphic violence, sex and gore but only subtle dialogues. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay have awesome performances, showing also fantastic chemistry, and with magnificent supporting cast including names such as Joan Allen and William H. Macy. In the end, \"Room\" is an unforgettable and unique film that touches the viewer's heart. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Quarto de Jack\" (\"The Room of Jack\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "Room (2015) has to be one of the most heart breaking films I have ever seen.\n\nThe story is about a woman named Joy (Brie Larson) who has been held captive against her will in a single room for seven years. The only thing that keeps her going is her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who was born inside the room never once leaving the confines of the small four walled room. Joy does the only thing she can possibly do in her situation. To protect her son from the brutal truth of their life and keep him safe from her abuser who keeps them locked away. Not long after Jack turns five years old. Joy begins to tell him more about the world outside the room. Joy begins to hatch an escape plan with Jack's help in the hopes that they may finally escape the living hell they have suffered for so long.\n\nThere aren't many films that have made me genuinely feel like crying or have left me feeling upset after watching it. But Room is one of those movies that really pulls at your heartstrings especially if your a parent or have personally been the victim of abuse. I honestly found myself in tears at certain points in the film as I wanted desperately for things to turn out ok for the films characters.\n\nRoom is superbly written and directed in a way that connects with it's audience in a very real way. Brie Lawson gives an outstanding performance that feels very real and genuine making you feel so much for her character throughout the entire film. Jocob Tremblay also gives an amazing performance especially when you take into consideration both his age and the subject matter.\n\nI definitely recommend watching Room (2015) it's one of the best films of 2015. I will say however that the film could be difficult to watch for some people especially considering the subject matter."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw that a new trailer for a film called 'Room was released online, i had a shiver cast through my spine, dreading that it wasn't a remake, sequel, or re-release of the 2003 monstrosity that was 'The Room'. How relieved I was to find out it was actually about a mother and sons journey of escaping from the single, enclosed room where they were held captive in and then watching the 5 year-old 'Jack' adapt to the huge world we live in.\n\nThe main structure of the film splits down into 2 parts; When they're inside 'Room' and when they've escaped. I completely felt for Brie Larsons 'Ma' having to raise a child who's only experiences in life have occurred inside 'Room'. Larsons performance was something that added so much emotional depth to her character as she manages to show the psychological damage 'Old Nick' (her kidnapper) has put her through. The 9 year old Jacob Tremblay added a believable performance from such a young actor who at times you really feel sorrow for.\n\nThen, when the riveting escape sequence is over, the film seems moved to its second half; The outside world. For me this felt like a complete shift in the films pass and tone, which I believe was a great decision as it was almost simulating how our protagonists felt when they were welcomed back into society. However, I really feel that, whilst the trailer didn't take anything away from the film for me, it would of been better not to of shown the fact that they became free of 'Room'\n\nGreat performances from everyone, an deeply emotional tone, and an overall great film to watch.\n\nOne of the best 2015 had to offer."

You probably imagine some sort of \"Life is Beautiful\" unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned. This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard. The quickly made TV documentaries after kidnapped victims are rescued (as in the case of Elizabeth Smart or Amanda Berry) look like Oscar winning stories in contrast and are actually watchable.

I found the first half actually set in the room to be nearly unbearable. I'm a father of young boys and trying to imagine the scenario set up in the book made me almost physically ill. I'm not sure I could have read the whole thing if the mother and her son had not escaped from their captor, but once they did, I felt like the air went out of the book and everything that happened after was much less compelling.\n\nThe movie spends much less of its time in the room itself, because what takes pages and pages to describe in the book can be conveyed much more quickly with a few carefully chosen images. Therefore, more of the film takes place on the outside, but the filmmakers do a better job of making that the compelling narrative. The movie becomes a tribute to the resilience and adaptability of children, and captures that feeling parents experience when the world and all it contains once again becomes a wondrous place because they're seeing it through the eyes of their children.\n\nBrie Larson won an Oscar for her performance, and while I certainly don't begrudge her the win, I didn't feel that her performance was necessarily the slam-dunk best of the year that her dominance of the awards circuit suggested. The one who amazes in the film is Jacob Tremblay, playing Jack. He carries the film in a way that many adult actors can't manage, and some of the later scenes, especially those with his grandmother (played by a wonderful Joan Allen), quietly reduced me to a quivering mess.\n\nGrade: A"

For the boy, the room is the only world he has known. The only medium he can see outside is the skylight in the room. The story may sound a nerdy fiction; but the film focuses much on the psychological aspects and discovers the story of desolation and motherhood which comes vividly alive on the screen. There are few scenes in which the boy and the mother have screamed to each other which could have been avoided alas they were like the scenes demanding the Oscars. Nevertheless, the film won an Oscar for the best performance by an actress. The film avoids big star cast or sets; but still the film is rich in emotions, performances, and beauty. The film just beautifully portrays the perspective of a five year old boy who doesn't know the world for real except for what his mother has told him or what he has seen in the TV screen. The emotional attachment portrayed between the two is awesome. Brie Larson's performance doesn't yet equal the winning Oscar performances from Julia Roberts or Hilary Swank, but still she appears stunning and well portrays a petrified lady held captive for six years. Few sequences are pretty familiar, but there are certain moments in the film for which you are drawn to it.\n\nRating: 3 stars out of 4"

I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and was hoping the psychological aspects of the film would step up in the second half but it didn't do so, the second half completely changes the situation for worse, there are new problems to deal with and the movie goes about them in it's usual half committed way which was prevalent in first half. The acting is definitely the strong suit of the film, Brie Larson is amazing and I would be OK with her winning the Oscar, though I didn't think much of the film I thought she was great. The kid played by Jacob Tremblay showed amazing depth and variety for a young child. The weakness of the film is direction, it does not capitalizes on it's setting, it has no great scenes and does not visually grab you at anytime (I am not reading a book I am watching a movie), also sometimes Brie Larson's character is quite inconsistent and unrealistic sometimes, she shows very few signs of PTSD, it sometimes feels she was trapped in Room for weeks not seven years, not her fault though, another misstep by the director, along with not capitalizing that Jack maybe better off without Joy (it touches so less on the REAL issues it's infuriating)."

She is locked in a small room in a shed with only a skylight. She has been raped by a man called Old Nick and given birth to their son, Jack.\n\nJack now 5 years old has grown up in this captive world, every morning he addresses the thing in the room. His only view of the outside world is what he can see from the skylight.\n\nHowever Room is not a movie about a mother and child locked in a room while Old Nick abuses them. It is about Joy planning their escape and then trying to adapt to a new life with her mother, now split from her father. Her dad meanwhile has difficulties accepting Jack.\n\nThe film is rather bland. Of course the first portion of mother and son living in such distressing conditions is harrowing but Jack looks a little bit too healthy apart from his long hair. Joy only seems lost when she tries to fit in to her new circumstances once she has left the room.\n\nThe film was rather underwhelming and uneventful. Jacob Tremblay gives a good performance."

The fact that life after captivity isn't necessarily as fulfilling as it always appeared, and freedom having its own challenges. That was done so extremely well, and I have not seen it done before.

        "review_title": "ROOM is an Emotional Juggernaut; One of 2015's Top Films",
        "review_detailed_main": "Lenny Abrahamson directed one of the best hidden gems of 2014 in FRANK, a strange little film starring Domhnall Gleeson and Michael Fassbender about an indie band getting an unpleasant taste of mainstream success. It was a dark comedy with some real emotion sown into it. A year later, Abrahamson returns with a new film where he goes straight for the heart with a vengeance in ROOM. This man is one of the best directors I've found for emotional impact, keeping in mind I've seeing nothing else of his work but the two mentioned. But there is no denying the emotional gut punch you get watching ROOM. Based on a source novel from author Emma Donoghue (who also penned the script), it's a disturbing (and eventually uplifting) tale told primarily from the perspective of little Jack (Jacob Tremblay). As the movie begins, Jack is awakening for his fifth birthday in Room, the only world he knows. He was born in Room lived in it all his life with his mom (Brie Larson). He's a relatively happy child who believes Room to encompass the entirety of the world. Except, now that he's five, his mom believes it's time for him to know the truth. Seven years prior, she had been tricked and abducted by the man he knows only as Old Nick, the mysterious visitor who comes at night while Jack's asleep to bring food and supplies. Old Nick locked Jack's mom in the little 11' x 11' garden shed and she's been trapped there ever since. Now that Jack is getting older, his mom wants him to help them escape to freedom.\n\nROOM is divided into two distinct halves: inside Room and outside Room. The first half of the movie is arguably the best material in my opinion. It paints a picture of daily life for Jack and his mom, giving the audience a glimpse into their meager existence. Ma tries to make the best of a bad situation for Jack but there's only so much she can do. Until now, Jack has had zero knowledge of a world beyond the walls. He believes TV shows are from other planets, believes common things like trees and dogs are make-believe, and addresses every item in Room as if it were one of his best friends. While Ma has done her best to keep Jack somewhat normalized and happy, she isn't faring as well. She's been beaten, tortured, and raped. She's been trapped in this room for seven years with only a small skylight in the ceiling giving her a glimpse of the natural sky. There are days when the pressure just gets to be too much; Jack calls them her \"gone days\" when she lies in bed, not moving or speaking a word. It's a nerve-wracking first half to a film and ramps up to the eventual escape planning. Again, the emotional gut punches keep coming as Ma realizes she will likely have to put her son in mortal danger if she ever hopes of getting him out of there with the chance of a normal life. Meanwhile, Jack is confused and scared out of his wits. His mom has turned his entire world upside down with talk of how there is an enormous world outside the four walls and how all those things he believed imaginary are real.\n\nThe second half of the movie loses a little steam because we don't have the built-in tension that comes with a captive and her son living in a box with an unstable kidnapper, but it delves into life after Room. It shows how Ma and Jack begin to adjust to the real world. To Jack, of course, this is more than his mind can process at first. I mean, the kid has never seen a horizon before and now he's faced with new environments, new experiences, and new people. While Jack does have his own troubles acclimating to the new life, Ma seems to have it worse. She seems all right at the start, relieved to be free and happy to return to normality, but after seven years of that sort of tortuous existence, normal doesn't come easy. Her parents have since divorced and her own mother has an old friend as her new live-in boyfriend. Her father has moved away and returns to reconnect with his long-lost daughter, but he has trouble accepting Jack and his\u0085well\u0085origins. Brie Larson does a phenomenal job with this material. Ma is a complex, deeply troubled character and Larson positively nails it with a very natural, genuine performance. She deserved every award she brought home for this role. Equal accolades belong to young Jacob Tremblay. In my experiences, the grand majority of child actors turn in stiff, unnatural performances but there are exceptions and Tremblay is top of the list. I believed every moment of his performance in ROOM and it's a real accomplishment for both him and director Abrahamson. ROOM is undoubtedly one of the best movies from 2015 (again, my opinion but I strongly believe so) and it comes with a strong recommendation from me. You'd have to be pretty dead inside for this movie to have not even the slightest emotional effect on you."

        "review_detailed_main": "there are those films, like 'Schindler's list', that as magnificent as they are, only one viewing is all you can handle. this film is so brilliantly and subtly done, I can sit through it over and over. it is emotionally exhausting, yes, but also SO rewarding. everyone in this film brings their A game to this film, particularly Jacob Tremblay, whose acting ability and vulnerability makes the movie especially Beautiful. Academy Award Winner Brie Larson is exquisite as Ma/Joy, a complex, complicated, nurturing mother but also brutally traumatized kidnap victim and sexual assault survivor. At first I wondered what people were talking about when they said Ma was 'such a good mom' to Jack, as she has her bitchy moments almost from the start of the film, but then i stepped back and realized I'd be that way too. To expect the character to come away unscathed is just unrealistic, but for the years she's in Room, she does a great job sheltering her son from the realities of life until its unbearable. To the people that say Jacob was robbed of an Oscar nomination at least, i would agree, but i would also remind them that doesn't mean Brie's win was not deserved. Her character was MUCH more complex. It's easy to play a kid unaware of a situation, its much harder to play a character that has to deal with the trauma of an event once they're free, and they've got other people watching their kid, so they can just fall apart. I know a lot of people worry about this film and what you see, but as its from the son's perspective, you don't have to worry about anything gratuitous. A Gem of a film I wish everyone would see!"

It's striking just how superior the movie is.\n\nI wouldn't actively reccommend it but if you want to (or must) go through it, it's good enough to say the least."

Nothing odd about that, you might think - well, except for the fact that thus far in his short life, \"Jack\" has never actually left the room in which he lives. He eats there, plays there, sleeps there - he knows nowhere else. As he ages though, he begins to get itchy feet and his mother finds it more and more difficult to contain his enthusiasm for finding out what is going on outside. What also emerges from their scenario is that \"Ma\" herself is not exactly free to move about. She was taken by \"Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) many years earlier and it soon becomes clear that he is likely the father of the boy she is so desperate to protect. Are they better off indoors or seeking freedom? Well, she decides that the latter offers them a better chance of happiness (and quite possibly sanity, too) - but the execution of that plan is not without risk! Lenny Abrahamson directs this with quite a bit of subtlety. He allows the audience to become immersed in the relationship between the two principals; he lets them do the talking and as the narrative unravels we realise that the story is anything but what we may have expected at the start. There is a palpable chemistry between the confident Tremblay and his more experienced co-star, and she complements that well. This is a nuanced and engaging tale offering us plenty of parallels of modern life - good and bad; with a dialogue that is both poignant and frequently heartfelt too. Certainly, it was nothing at all like I was expecting and it's stimulating and enjoyable in equal measure. Well worth a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film was honestly really touching. It brought out a lot of emotions and really changed my perception of Brie Larson.\n\nRoom follows Joy and her son, Jack, who've been held captive in an enclosed area which they've referred to as Room. One day, they get their freedom and her son gets to finally experience the outside world.\n\nWhat I really loved was the first hour. Director Lenny Abrahamson really managed to capture the claustrophic aspect of the 10 x 10 room as well as the lifestyle they had to adapt to for the years they were in there and made me genuinely care a lot for Larson and Tremblay. Putting us through the perspective of Jack was a clever choice by writer Emma Donoghue as we got to see his interpretation of the world compared to ours, making the film wholly interesting.\n\nFor me, personally, the second half wasn't as engaging. It was still fascinating nonetheless as we got to witness Jack discovering and exploring this new world he wasn't familiar with as well as the psychological issues Brie Larson's character goes through when coming back. However, the film wasn't able to carry the same level of interest that I had in the first half.\n\nAside from the tight script and direction, the two lead performances are what carry the film. I'm not really a fan of Brie Larson but I have to give credit where credit is due. She was terrific. Her emotions and facial expressions were executed perfectly. No wonder she won the Oscar. The one who really suprised me was Jacob Tremblay. It's insane how good he is throughout this film especially for his age at the time. These two are really believable as mother and son and have a wonderful connection with each other.\n\nRoom will definitely make some people tear up. The story is very touching and the relationship between Larson and Tremblay make it all the more heartwarming."

        "review_detailed_main": "The crime of kidnapping and extended captivity is well known through media exposure that sensationalises the psychological horrors of confinement in claustrophobic spaces. The dependency of some victims on an abusive captor or prison is just one of the many strange twists found in captivity stories. But this one is different because it is narrated through the eyes of five- year old Jack who was born in a fortified shed with only a small overhead skylight visually connected to what is outside his world called Room. His mother was abducted at seventeen and has been a captive for seven years, raising Jack as best she can in a co-dependent relationship that shines beautifully in their small prison. When tormentor Nick loses his job she knows he will not keep them alive, and that's when the slow-paced narrative opens predictably towards a fast world full of frighteningly wonderful sights and sounds and feelings expressed through the naivety of a newborn five-year old.\n\nThis film would not work without the emotionally intelligent acting of Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Being almost ten and convincingly presenting as half his age is nothing short of remarkable. He describes his new world through wide eyes and lyrical words that capture the exploding space into which he is thrust, and he alone holds this film together. As Ma, Brie Larson's acting fixates on maternal dynamics at the cost of a convincing portrayal of captivity trauma. The scene where Jack and Ma re-visit Room after Nick is caught has all the nonchalance of strolling through a museum, as the story winds down from the highs of a taut psychological thriller to a modest melodrama. It is after all a film that strives for insight, not entertainment, while remaining true to the book upon which it is based. It does this thoughtfully in the first half, but slowly loses focus as it drifts aimlessly towards the end."

        "review_detailed_main": "'ROOM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nThe critically acclaimed dramatic thriller flick; directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by Emma Donoghue (based on her 2010 novel, of the same name). The film is about a young mother, being held captive in a locked single-room, with her 5-year-old son. The boy has never known life, outside of the room; so his mother creates a complete alternate reality, inside the room for him. It stars Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay, as the kidnapped mother and son. It also costars Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. The film is predicted to be a likely Oscar contender, come awards time, and it's received almost unanimously positive reviews, from critics. I liked it.\n\nJack (Tremblay) is five-years-old, and he's been locked in a single- room, with his mother Joy (Larson), all of his life. He's never seen the world, outside of the room, and his mother has taught him 'room' is all there is. We later learn that Joy was kidnapped when she was 17, and her captor impregnated her, with Jack, five-years earlier. As Joy becomes even more desperate, to escape, she finally enlists Jack's help, in a dangerous plan.\n\nThe film is really dark and depressing, but there's also a slight bit of hope (in the darkness). Larson is fantastic in the lead, and Tremblay is also amazing (especially for an actor so young). The movie is very moving, intense and heartbreaking; it's beautifully directed by Abrahamson, and brilliantly written by Donoghue. The film is basically everything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'. It's pretty hard to watch though, at times, but it's worth it.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/MylbbGyo_MU"

Jack's understanding of the outside world is limited. It's soon obvious that they are prisoners of a man they called Old Nick. Ma finally tells Jack that her name is Joy Newsome and she was taken when she was 17 some 7 years ago. Jack angrily disbelieves at first. Joy comes up with a daring gamble to escape back to her parents (Joan Allen, William H. Macy).\n\nThis is a star-making role for Brie Larson. Her performance in 'Short Term 12' is amazing but little seen. She once again delivers a top-notch performance. She has inner strength and humanity. Jacob Tremblay is a wonderful discovery with his squeaky little voice. It's an almost perfect little film. I was wondering where this movie was going at certain points in the middle but I think it ends in the perfect place."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow. This film completely blew me away. I was expecting something special what with Brie Larson winning the Oscar for her performance and the numerous good reviews, but I wasn't prepared for how powerful, emotional and moving this film was.\n\nRoom is such a whirlwind of emotions, from utter despair to hope this will have you feeling everything. I was in tears for near enough a whole 10 minutes in the middle due to the swell of emotions. The plot is perhaps one best left to experience yourself, so I won't go into any depth, but suffice to say it is devastatingly heart-warming (despite the paradoxical nature of that statement I believe it's apt!).\n\nAt the heart of this film was the beautiful, close yet complicated relationship between Ma and Jack, portrayed so incredibly well by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. I can't emphasise enough how astoundingly good both of them were. The character of Ma was so well written, with so much depth and nuance. Her interactions with Jack were so captivating and engaging, I almost want to watch Room again straight away to experience them again immediately.\n\nI'm always in awe of films which manage to draw so much out of such a small space, and the way that the confined environment of Room was used and explored was magnificent. It's a real lesson in cinema and technically its a spectacular film, as well as being so visceral.\n\nRoom has to be one of the best films I've seen in recent years. I've called a few films a 'must see' before, and the term gets bandied about perhaps a bit too loosely at times, but it could not be more apt when it comes to Room. One of the best experiences I've had watching a film, truly phenomenal."

        "review_detailed_main": "Emma Donoghue's novel, inspired no doubt by the likes of the Josef Fritzl case in Austria, 2008, has been rewritten by the author herself for the screen. It's a mighty challenging undertaking and benefits to some degree by not being 'based on a true story' even if the inspiration was so obviously horrifically apparent.\n\nIt tells the tale of a young mother, credited as 'Ma' but actually known as Joy (how ironic) played to Oscar winning standard by Brie Larson and her five year old son, Jack, who was born in captivity some time after Joy was absconded by a man entrapping her with the aid of a sick puppy.\n\nThus begins Joy's nightmare.\n\nAt some point Jack is conceived at the hands of her rapist jailer, Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers. (It's a casting that may have given him some personal nightmares because he's not what you could describe as a sympathetic character). It's fair to say that although Ma tolerates Nick's visitations, she has to to protect her child and to be fed, no Stockholm Syndrome has developed.\n\nThe movie begins on or around Jack's fifth birthday.\n\nJack has never left the room in which he was conceived and into which he entered his insular world. He knows no place other than this, has never experienced any weather (or air even), never played with other children, never been admonished for fear of upsetting a very delicate ecology between him, his mother and the 'room' where they live.\n\nAside from the nightly visitations of Old Nick for the daily rape of his mother he knows no other human being.\n\nMa and Jack have a TV, so Jack has a perverse awareness of the 'world' but it's seen through juddering images and is as real to him as martians are to you and I.\n\nBut somehow Ma and Jack soldier on.\n\nWe catch them at the end of Ma's tether. After five years of protecting Jack from the fact that they live in a parallel existence she's decided it's time for the facts of life and so begins a plan to escape. You'll have seen the trailers so you'll know that ultimately the escape bid is successful and so begins the painful psychological process of leaving an almost feral yet totally sheltered existence into a world that's overwhelming.\n\nRelationships in the family have moved on in the years since Joy's disappearance. Mum and Dad, although both still alive cope in very different ways. The media go mad for the story, Joy finds the whole thing extremely difficult to cope with and we spend a very moving hour or so watching them come to terms with an existence that's completely alien to Jack and totally overwhelming for Joy.\n\nThis is a life affirming movie. It's directed with great skill and sensitivity by Lenny Abrahamson and in Brie Larson and five year old Jacob Tremblay we can pretty much believe that this is not fiction but very real reality.\n\nA remarkable film that deserves all the awards that are about to come its way.\n\nDeep respect."

The story is an emotional ride with phenomenal acting from all involved. For this alone it's worth watching. The film really illustrated well the physical and mental issues a mum and kid would have in this situation and it's that detail that really makes the film better.\n\nMy major beef I have with this film stems in the 2nd hour. Mainly because nothing of interest really happens. 1st half you're gripped as you watch her lose her mind yet and try to escape. 2nd half, sod all actually happens and it skips out certain storylines that could have made it more interesting. All other characters played a really small role there was no point in them. I get that it's focusing on the mum and son. But the film needed that something to keep the audience somewhat entertained. Because you know how it's going to end, so you feel like you're just waiting for it.\n\nOverall, it's a lovely watch that gripped me emotionally. But slightly let down by the 2nd half of the film. 7/10 for me."

But this is about survival and hope, neither of which comes without agonizing risk. It's also about how people deal with things for which they have no true appreciation. I refer to two characters. The first is the father of the young woman. He must deal with what he sees as the devil's spawn. The second, a reporter that begins to malign her because she hasn't done what \"she\" sees as heroic. Her interview made me crawl, but I also thought this is exactly what we do to people who gain celebrity through pain. There is a great deal to be learned from this film, but I fear this is an eternal problem."

I am happy to say that this movie surpassed all my expectations and then some.\n\nThe plot of Room is one that we've seen before. While it's not horribly original, it's presented much differently than you'd expect. It's more mature than others, and much more personal. The idea of someone living their life away from society and suddenly being exposed to it again is typically used in a more comedic or 'big picture' way. Room deals with the transition in a much more personal way, and it makes way more sense. The characters spend most of their time indoors, dealing with the new problems of living outside of a single 10 by 10 foot room, and there still feels like there's a reason for it. It really is quite a beautiful story, despite how unhappy that it can be.\n\nThe characters are brilliant, and the obvious driving force of the movie. Considering for the first hour or so we've only been exposed to three people you really get to know them well. But what are great characters without great actors to portray them? Luckily, Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack are both fantastic. For a child actor Tremblay is phenomenal, and really sells his character. Larson is fantastic too, playing a single mother who's not exactly in the best shape. Everyone else is great too, but the two main protagonists stand out the most.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this movie was the realism. From the opening to the end, everything felt real. Emotionally, it was real (I've already stated that), but it was also visually real. The characters looked real. At the beginning of the movie Ma has a bit of acne, and that really stood out to me. Finally, a movie where people don't have make-up coating their face so that they appeal more to the audience. Brie Larson looked her part, she had acne, bags under her eyes, bad hair. She didn't look like she was trying to impress anybody, which is because she wasn't. This is something that I don't think I've ever seen in a movie, where people look bad and it's never part of the story or addressed or anything, and it really adds the level of immersiveness in the film.\n\nThis movie is very emotional. And I don't mean that there's just some climatic sad part at the end, it's spread out. Throughout the movie I felt myself on the brink of tears, and that was with resistance. It brought me closer to crying than any other movie that I've ever seen.\n\nOverall Room is absolutely amazing. It's one of the few movies I've seen where not a thing about it has bothered me. I found no flaw in this movie, making it easily one of the best movies of 2015, if not the best movie of 2015. It's realistic and unique, something that so many movies seem to lack. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, whether your interested or not."

She was abducted by a stranger, Nick, and has been there for seven years. Jack was born there and the room is his entire world. Then one day they escape and get to live normal lives. For Jack, the world he now is confronted by is a very foreign place.\n\nA wonderful movie: highly original and incredibly emotional. Just the initial plot - a mother and her son imprisoned for several years and how they escape - was original enough but then we have the psychological and emotional implications of returning to society (or, in Jack's case, joining society for the first time), and this takes the plot to another plane.\n\nJack being confronted by and adapting to his new world is wonderfully and very sensitively told. His mother having to deal with all her doubts regarding Jack adapting, and any residual guilt she feels from their time in captivity, is a great, and quite natural, story line too.\n\nGreat, emotional ending that perfectly ties up the movie.\n\nBrie Larson got a Best Actress Oscar for her performance and deserved it. Jacob Tremblay, 8/9 years old at the time, is fantastic as Jack, showing acting skills well beyond his age. Solid performances from a supporting cast that includes Joan Allen and William H Macy.\n\nMy favourite movie of 2015."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ma: \"You're gonna love it\".\n\nJack: \"What?\".\n\nMa: \"The world\".\n\nRoom tells the story of a relationship between a mother and son, as she raises him while confined to a 10x10 room and what happens when they finally get out.\n\nSince the 2016 Oscars are on Sunday and I've been lacking quite a bit on seeing as many Oscar contenders from last year. Room was one of those movies, as I've heard nothing but great things about it and how truly unique it is (from what I heard). It was a real shame that I had to wait for a while to get a chance to watch this movie, because it's been a very slow month over here in jolly good England. But after finally seeing the movie after that long wait, I can say that the movie was pretty underwhelming, and that's really disappointing saying that.\n\nBrie Larson has been sweeping the award season this year, by taking home: The BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice award and the SAG award, and it's very deserving. Brie Larson delivered a tremendous performance and she was without a doubt the best part of this movie. I'm so happy that Larson is finally getting noticed since everyone pretty much forgot about \"Short Term 12\" and her performance in that film that got very unnoticed. Larson shows off her acting skills in this movie and I know for a fact that she will receive an Oscar on Sunday night. She was truly brilliant in this movie and one of her best performance so far.\n\nLenny Abrahamson (director of the movie) brought us the 2014 film \"Frank\", which I really liked and I couldn't wait to see want he will bring to this movie, and what he brought was somewhat of a mix bag for me. I'm happy for him to get an Oscar nomination, but I didn't find anything that special or groundbreaking when it came to it's directing. Most of it is just copy and past from the book that this movie is based on, so Abrahamson can look on what he's doing. I didn't read the book (and never will) but I've heard a lot of people who did read the book say that the book is better than the movie, and even the author herself said the same thing. The directing isn't anything Oscar worthy, but it's decent directing at best for Abrahamson.\n\nThe first act of this movie was very strong and it did kept my interest. That's the biggest positive I had for this movie is it's first act.\n\nJacob Tremblay is an unknown star to me and for everyone else, so this is basically he's break out role. I did look up on what Tremblay has been in before and I found out he was in \"The Smurfs 2\" which wasn't that good. But all that aside, I thought he's performance was alright, nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. He's better than most kids I've seen in recent movies, but I also have seen better ones as well.\n\nNow for the problems: The second act wasn't as strong as the first act. The movie did lose me a couple of times as I became disinterest as it went along.\n\nThe movie did feel like a sugar-coated version of the book and as I said before I haven't even read the book, but for what I heard from other people, the book is more graphic and dark than the movie. I get this question asked a lot when I say the movie sugar-coated from the book, \"Would you rather have graphic scenes of rape from the book\", well if that's what the book is suppose to be, then yeah, and it's not because I want to see someone get raped, but if you what me to give a crap about the characters and their struggle to see how their suffered, then the film makers shouldn't have sugar-coated it. I feel like if this movie was handled by a different director, it would have been a much better movie. The movie is basically telling you that there's violence and rape that happened, but there's nothing really graphic about it. The movie tells you to care about things that it never bothers developing and if you are going to make a movie on a subject like that, and pretend that this horrible thing that happened, again, you shouldn't sugar-coat it. Take \"12 Years a Slave\" as an example: That movie was graphic, brutal, honest and that's what made it an amazing movie, because it took a real life story like slavery that's suppose to make you feel for the character's and makes you look at what their been through and say to yourself \"Wow, that was truly awful\". Now look at Room, we have a single character and the movie is telling you to feel bad for her and what shes been through, but it didn't show any of it, and it's not like it has to be graphic for the sake of it, but it didn't even try to develop it.\n\nOverall Room was very overwhelming and kind of bland. I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for not loving this movie as they do, but that's just my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes a person's world can be as small as a stifling room. Specifically, when a 17-year-old girl is kidnapped by a man who uses her as his sex slave, having abducted her sever years earlier producing her child. Surprisingly the movie is now 125th ranked IMDb movie of all times,but bewildered movie's director, Lenny Abrahamson, should have realised some troubles in this 118 minutes. Firstly, we all thought the boy was a girl. Is it so difficult to cut his hair a little bit? So, we are expecting Ma to have lied about his gender so that he would not be a rape target. But not \u2013 towards the end you realize it is a boy. Why were we so distracted by that for absolutely no reason? Then the director had created 50 intriguing first minutes provoking questions like: 'are they going to die enclosed?' or 'will they somehow try to escape?' whereas in the second half he fabricated a clumsy and infinitely one-dimensional and boring drama. There is just no real connection between the first and the second act. The seven years Ma previously spent in the room might as well have been a written premise at the start of the movie. But with no deeper layers to the film and with no character really fleshed out, the picture feels aimless. Maybe the first part of the movie was that brilliant that the second half does not live up to it. Unfortunately, the Irish filmmaker did not find harmony like he previously did in Frank (2014) and What Richard Did (2012). If the movie had finished just before they have escaped from the garden shed that would have been great. He should have probably said to himself: \"As the movie is so-called 'Room', I must focus more on what happens inside the room and go with the flow with all the rest of it\". Nice effort 'my friend' but this does not work like this, mainly because this is a potential Oscar winning movie and what you have done is just not even enough to be nominated for the Oscar awards. With such a bloodcurdling topic, a seven year prisoner who has been abducted and her little child discovering for the first time the existence of a brand new world outside a room where he was born, the story struggles to hold our interest as the outside world intervenes. The issue as cinema-goers is that we have simply expected to find the cherry on the pie \u2013 to see something unexpected and pleasurable, and what Abrahamson does to all cinemaddicts is living them starving because nothing interesting happens at all. Put simply, we know how this part of the story goes \u2013 they both are stressed, later they come down and eventually adapt to the house rules. That is really sad and the worst thing is that with a sort of plot like this, the movie has got a score of 8.3 out of 10 on IMDb! How come this movie is better than The Truman show (1998), A beautiful mind (2001) or Gran Torino (2008)? You should open your eyes and ears people and do not rate movies so generously next time. This is definitely one of those movies that the IMDb rating makes you imagine some sort of Life is Beautiful unfolding in a room. In here all is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional that the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this two hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Room' is the harrowing story of isolationism, and then, later on, immersion. We're first introduced to our two main characters, twenty-something Ma (actress Brie Larson) and four year-old Jack (up-and-coming Jacob Tremblay), inside a garden shed. We are, of course, unaware that this is a garden shed, but the size is what's immediately noticeable. Small, dark, and dank, with a single skylight. Jack, the product of Ma's kidnapping despite her insistence of his immaculate conception, is oblivious to the space of the room, or lack thereof, and equally of the world outside it. Ma, we're later told, has been living in the confines for seven years. It's seven too many, and when she decides quite suddenly that some attempt must be made to free one or both of them, plans are quickly set in motion at her behest and against Jack's wishes.\n\nI'm hesitant to mention their escape at all, but the always inexcusable trailer not only alludes to the escape but presents it as a first- act occurrence, mostly using the opportunity to list the other notable actors of the production. It's an unfortunate introduction to the story, as the audience does benefit from the time spent in the shed, however fully expecting the scenery to change in a moment. We come to understand their lifestyle: stretching in the morning, TV, eating canned slop, TV, running from one end of the shed to the other, TV. They have each other, and TV. It's been the source of Jack's entertainment, and no doubt his education, for much of his life. So when Ma tries to explain that TV holds some truth, that other people exist, and so too does a world outside of Room, it's hard for Jack, now 5, to grasp. \"How does it all fit?!\" he asks out of a serious incredulity (a single line delivered in a way that certifies Tremblay is one to watch).\n\nNevertheless, he does grasp it, or he pretends to. He audibly bounces back and forth between acceptance and some acting form of denial, but his trust in Ma ultimately outweighs his fear of something larger, and then, halfway through the film, the outside is revealed to him. It's an abrupt and belated transition and his daring escape doesn't seem at all plausible but paints our everyday surroundings so empyrean that you more than forgive it. Triumph of the realization is replaced with a terror. Talking to the strange people he's only just recently come to see as real instead of \"magic\" is too much, too soon.\n\nA female officer warms to Jack, and his bravery leads to Ma's rescue. The two are reunited with the family he's never known, but a reluctance to engage with anyone besides his Ma is apparent. By this time, the film feels unbalanced. Its pacing is jarred, and the idea is that it's supposed to, but it feels less like a new, eye- opening experience and the slow understanding that comes with it, and more like a train wreck in slow motion. The second half offers little to the viewer. The meat of the story is left behind, and while it wasn't exactly Kobe beef, what we're left with is little more than the canned slop our duo had been subjected to in the beginning. Joan Allen does her best with what little she's given, William H. Macy isn't much more than a snapshot and a stepping stone to Ma's character development, Tom McCamus surprises, and Sean Bridgers eerie acting as the deluded kidnapper is oddly missed after his exit, which is without any real resolution.\n\nThis proves to be a compelling story, and is at times emotionally gripping, but is ultimately ill-fated for a film adaptation. Best suited as prose, or as a journalistic publication on which the narrative is based, it falters in being brought to screen. Neither first-time feature screenwriter Emma Donoghue nor Lenny Abrahamson are at fault, as both do greatly with what is to be offered, and the casting, particularly the ever-impressive Larson, is inspired. Still, in leaving the theater, something is left to be desired.\n\n\"Room\" will prove to be a nice addition to the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of any involved, but with little shelf life beyond the awards season.\n\nB-\n\nAndrew Paul, occuris.com"

It's a powerful, unforgettable, and emotional experience that hits home in every way you can think of. There is no doubt in my mind that Brie Larson deserves every award she got for this film. Some people criticize her online for her acting being dull, similar to what people did earlier in the career of actress Jennifer Lawrence, but after watching Room there is no doubt in my mind that she was perfect for the role and is capable of so much when it comes to work on the big screen. Jacob Tremblay also provides an emotional and core performance to the film as her son, Jack, and perhaps provides the best performance I've ever seen of someone of such a young age. His character can be a bit predictable at times, but Tremblay brings a life to it that would have otherwise been missed. The direction can be a bit broad or dull at times, but due to Donoghue's terrific screenplay and all the talent involved the film transcends its flaws and makes for quite a brilliant and very memorable experience.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever since I've been following the Award season, I was wondering what was exactly about this 'Jacob Tremblay' kid. I had never heard about him, but the more awards nominations he got, the more pictures of \"Room\" I was discovering, the more intriguing that skinny pale-looking child with unusually long hair was, especially that movie snapshot of his stunned look crossing as you could tell he was witnessing something of hypnotic beauty.\n\nFirst, I thought Tremblay was portraying some kind of autistic kid, then the story of a mother and her child trapped in a room made me expect a movie about confinement, and the ability of creating a world out of a horrible situation. And the kid looked strange enough to make me believe that he was victim of a condition forcing him to be isolated. Lenny Abrahamson's \"Room\" was the kind of film that is surrounded by an aura of mystery, but that alone wouldn't have been enough without the whole awards-buzz, so like many others, I saw it to see what was good about it.\n\nAt first, I was disrupted by the whole voice-over narration, I wasn't really ready for some abstraction \u00e0 la \"Tree of Life\", and I wished the kid wouldn't be too strange, even within the story's strangeness. But doubts immediately vanished, Jack was a normal kid who loved to play, to please his mother Joy, played by Brie Larson, to be told that he's grown up, to write, to draw, except that everything he does, and been doing since he was born, took place in that small shed, whose only door to the world is a skylight. And as the story goes, we get the circumstances of their presence there, especially when there's a sort of figure named Old Nick who's the only known outsider.\n\nThe film echoes many news items about women or kids who've been abducted for years and years, being raped and having children with their own captor, the kind of stories that make you wonder how can anyone survive from such conditions. It's the mark of great films not to answer questions directly but to make you answering them on your own. Jack, unlike Joy, doesn't know what he missed and the whole world, as far as he's concerned is the room and whatever is in the room is real. A mouse is real, a spoon or a kitchen sink or a wardrobe are called by 'mister' or 'mrs' but whatever appears in that box named TV is made of pictures and can't count as real. And as far as humanity goes, there's him, his mother and Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers.\n\nJack can't be unhappy or his unhappiness is limited to his world. However, his mother spent only 7 years of her life there; she not only knows what she's missing but she knows damn well what Jack is missing. And if Jacob Tremblay deserves the praise for his performance, there's something in Larson's acting that cuts straight to the heart. She is devastated but she must hide it,, the presence of Jack is the only thing that keeps her alive, otherwise, she would have killed herself. Jack is her skylight. But there comes a point where enough is enough, and for his own good, she can't let Jack drown in a fantasy-world that might eventually destroy him. This is a story of a mother's responsibility, and she's got to stop pretending and get her son out of there.\n\nShe first thinks of faking illness so Nick can take Jack to the hospital but instead of that, Nick goes outside to buy antibiotics. She then teaches Jack how to play dead, so she can wraps him under a carpet and ask Nick to 'bury' him, this is where Jack must free himself. They say even a frail mother can increase tenfold her strength if her child is in danger, the same goes when Nick wants to check the body. Joy learned how to fake emotions, but now, she has to make it 'Oscar-worthy' so that Nick is convinced not only to take the body but not to bury him in the garden and take him on his truck. Joy keeps her head on the carpet not to let anything betray her nervousness, and the plan works. I guess there's a justice if Larson wins the Oscar if only for that scene where she gave her best acting in order to forever stop acting after that, the climax of her room years of pretension.\n\nAnd a lesser film would have made it the real 'climax', and make \"Room\" a sort of mother-and-son version of \"Life is Beautiful\" with a heart-warming slow-motion reunion at the end, people crying and some cheerful happy-ending music but \"Room\" is respectful enough to our intelligence not to tell us that everything will go perfectly right after such an experience. The second act consists on Joy and Jack coping with their trauma, and building new relationship with family members who's either strangers or estranged to their world. \"Room\" isn't about people stuck in a room during seven years, but stuck in the world after such experience, and this time, it's harder for Jack.\n\nIndeed, I finally saw what was beyond that picture, Jack had a stunned 'where am I?' born-baby look, with his vision blurred because of the years spent in obscurity, he was reborn, but life will go very fast for him. One day, he'll ask his grandmother (Joan Allen) to cut his hair (a vivid symbol of \"Room\" days, his Samson-like 'strength' as Joy told him) and this action ironically makes him even stronger, and is a positive signal for Joy. Then they visit the room again and Jack realizes how small it was, just as when we visit a childhood place. He didn't grow much physically after the \"Room\" but he could finally enjoy life now that he discovered how wonderfully big it was."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I didn't know if there were films that could surprise me, this film was able to do that. I believe that it is not a perfect film, there are some flaws and weaknesses in the script, if we have time to analyze it more deeply. After some reading I realized that the film is based, very vaguely, on a real situation that occurred in Austria just over fifteen years ago, and that it was a true horror film turned into reality.\n\nThe film is profound and touching in many ways. First, because it brings us a cruel history of deprivation of liberty, rape, abuse and suffering. Second, because it tells us all this from the innocent perspective of a child who has never seen the world beyond the room where he was born, and where he lives imprisoned with his mother, at the hands of a cruel man, who is also his biological father, but that the film will make clear that he is not the boy's father. And in fact, what father would deserve to be treated as such after doing something like that to a son, isn't it? The film is truly beautiful and elegant, and wonderfully harmonizes the child's perspective, who sees the world and things in his own way, and the mother's perspective, which is basically ours too, and who has a clear sense of what is happening and the drama they're experiencing.\n\nDespite the harshness of the story told, the film never assumes itself as a thriller or a drama. In fact, there is a touch of fairy tale that greatly softens the tone and ambience. At no time did we feel truly tense, despite the situation of the characters being tense and not envisaging much success. The second half of the film is even smoother and more luminous, and shows how mother and child will try to rebuild their lives and their families after all that tragedy.\n\nThe film does not have a big cast, and the characters have plenty of time to develop and take on complex psychological nuances and contours. The most developed and interesting are clearly the Mother and her son, Jack. And Brie Larson was amazing at how she brought this desperate and brave mother to life. She was capable of one of the most breathtaking and professional dramatic and interpretive works I have seen in some time, and deserved the awards she received for this film in all fairness. Jacob Tremblay, who brought Jack to life, also deserves congratulations. Apparently, and despite his young age, he already had some experience as an actor when he made this film, but there is no doubt that we rarely see actors so young shining so completely. He did a better job than many adults would have done, I am sure of that. And the way both actors interact in front of the camera is magnificent, dignified, credible and genuine. I also really liked the work of Joan Allen and Sean Bridgers, although the film does not reveal what happens to the villain, who just disappears.\n\nTechnically, it is a superb and intelligent film. One thing that I observed carefully, and that I did not want to miss, was the quality of the dialogues, in particular Jack's monologues, in which he makes very pertinent and intelligent observations to the world around him. It is wonderful to enter the child's mind and see the world through his eyes. Cinematography is equally extraordinary, especially in the first half of the film, due to the way the camera manages to convey the feeling of being in such a limited space. The setting and the smallness of the entire physical filming space clearly helped and the construction of the whole set and costumes was also a smart bet on the part of Lenny Abrahamson, who ensured the direction of the film. It is a slow-paced film, with time for many reflections and ramblings that never seem to be too much in the film. The soundtrack is quite good, but it does not distract us from the essential, which is the story told and the relationship between that mother and her child, and between that child and the new world that opens up for her."

        "review_detailed_main": "Abducted and held in a backyard shed with a young son fathered by her captor, a young woman attempts to escape in this grim drama starring Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Some of the finer plot details do not quite add up (in seven years of captivity, she should have been able to work out a four digit security code) and the first half of the movie is a tad repetitive. Things gets more interesting in the second half though with the escape plan in action and superb point-of-view shots as we literally and metaphorically see the world for the first time through the young boy's eyes. Tremblay is excellent as the youngster in question; not all his temper tantrums ring true, but he is great in the quieter moments in which he simply sits back and observes. In fact, the film is more about Tremblay than Larson even though she was the one who garnered all the awards attention. With all the focus on Tremblay though, several plot points feel undernourished; an impending trial, having to eventually tell Trembley who his father is, and acceptance of Trembley into the family are all issues that are mentioned once or twice and then later forgotten. Some have complained that the film runs too long but the ending comes as abrupt if anything with so many avenues left open. The uncertainty is arguably fitting though, and with two very solid lead performances, this is a hard film to look away from, but its resonance will vary depending upon how one feels about all the issues and ideas here that are unexplored to make room for its depiction of a boy seeing the world for the first time."

Brie Larson has done a career defining role who i firmly Believe deserves every award this season but the ultimate acting \"masterclass\" at such a tender age has to be the kid playing her son. Imagine discovering whole world again right from the Beginning like you did when you were a kid. Remember the first time you saw a dog ? The First time you saw trees ? The first time you made a friend ? The first time you left your mom ? This movie shows subtleness of mom- child relationship in such a beautiful way that it Forced even a heartless beast like me cry. The movie never drags, is unapologetically intense Cinematography makes you feel like a 5 year Old again. The direction is immaculate and Script is powerful. Probably one of the best movies of 2015 ! Must watch :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: I really enjoyed the beginning of this film, when Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay), were living in a small room with no access to the outside world but the second half of the movie took away the originality that was set at the beginning. The acting is superb from Brie and Jacob and you can't help rooting for them, when they were plotting and executing there escape but it was sad to see how the whole ordeal took its toll on Ma. The way that Jack's character was written, was perfect and for such a young boy, he really did bring realism to his character but I would have liked to have seen more scenes of them in the room, which was the most enjoyable part of the movie. It was amazing to see them make the most out of everything in that little space, including the mouse and the little birthday cake, so it wasn't surprising that it took so long for Jack to adapt to normal life. That wasn't the same case for Ma, who was locked up for 7 years and forced to have sex for food but I have to commend her for bringing up Jack under such abnormal and cruel circumstances. When she eventually came to terms with what she had been through, it was good to see her back with her little boy but I'm sure that it's something that will stick with her, for the rest of her life. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad that it got all of the recognition that it deserved. Original & Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up: For such a small movie which is based in a little room around 2 characters, it's good that it made such a profit at the box office, and with Brie Larson winning an Oscar and a Golden Globe award for the  Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, it certainly went down well with audiences around the world. Personally, I think that Jacob Tremblay, equally put in a brilliant performance and it's a shame that he didn't get any awards for his amazing contribution. It was also up for an Oscar in the best picture of the year category, along with an director award and screenplay award, so it was a smash hit, in terms of the recognition that it received. The movie was directed by Irish born, Lenny Abrahamson, 49, who also brought you Adam & Paul, Garage, What Richard Did and the extremely strange movie, Frank starring Michael Fasbender. He certainly got the most out of the actors, who all put in emotional and believable performances but he did take his foot off of the gas towards the end.\n\nBudget: $13million Worldwide Gross: $35.4million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramatic movies starring Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridges, Wendy Crewson, Joan Allen, William H. Macy and Matt Gordon. 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Irish filmmaker Lenny Abrahamson has been making terrific films since 2004. \"Adam & Paul\", \"Garage\", \"What Richard Did\" are all excellent small films, marked by top rate acting and rich characters. With the oddly funny and surreal \"Frank\", Abrahamson finally started to get some attention here in the states.\n\n\"Room\" may be his strongest film yet -- a vertigo inducing mix of thriller like tension and complex and sometimes disturbing character studies.\n\nAgain, he gets great performances; from the young and extremely talented Brie Larson, to great old pros like Joan Allen and William H. Macy, to a remarkable performance from a child, Jacob Tremblay, in a seriously difficult and demanding part.\n\nI've seen a lot of films, but - even with no blood or gore, and little violence - this was so harrowing it was downright hard to watch at times. But in a way that never felt exploitive, but always in service of bigger themes and ideas. This is a film where knowing too much about the plot can work against the experience, but it's not giving away too much to say at the start we find a mother and child locked in a small room, having evidently been there for the boy's whole 5 years of life. They are scared, thin, holding on the best they can. We slowly come to understand the situation, at the same time getting a fascinating, and often chilling peek into what the world might seem like to a kid who has only lived in one small space.\n\nThe film is beautifully shot: the ultra-tight closeups, and wide lenses feeding the dizzying and nerve wracking sense of being trapped, and giving the \"Room\" (a character in itself) a plastic sense of shifting size and shape.\n\nThe score occasionally seemed a bit much to me - there's plenty of emotion here without needing the music to convince us - but those moments were few, and certainly not enough to seriously hurt the film.\n\nIt won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's dark, sad, complicated, scary and uncomfortable at times - although, as in life, lighter moments and hope find a way to break through. It's not light entertainment. But it's not like anything I've seen. It made me think, and has haunted me in the days since I've seen it. That's a lot for any film to accomplish."

Just many scenes of getting back into the real life and mundane grievances. The narration by a boy who is far too old to be a 5 year old is about as irritating as it can get, but I can cut some slack with American child labor regulations. The story is rather flat, in dialogue, in relationships, in story line. Horrible what happened to victims like kampusch but that fact just isn't enough to make this particular one Oscar material. It certainly doesn't compensate for poor directing and flat writing. Not impressed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. Tragically, stories of women being held captive have become all too common in this sometimes frightening world in which we live. Emma Donoghue had the high profile, real life situations of Jaycee Dugard, Elisabeth Fritzl and Amanda Berry (Ariel Castro) to draw from for her terrific novel upon which this film is based. While not easy for anyone (especially parents) to watch, it's a well made movie with outstanding performances \u0085 including a career-changer from Brie Larson.\n\nDirector Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, a critical favorite from last year) takes us inside the world \u2013 or more accurately \u2013 the walls where Ma (Brie Larson) and her just turning 5 year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live. Seven years ago, Larson's character was abducted while walking home from school, and since then she has given birth to Jack, and the two have been held captive in a small shed with only a skylight connecting to the outer spaces of life. The captor \u0085 known as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) \u0085 periodically brings them supplies, while also regularly visiting to satisfy his more base needs with Ma.\n\nFor the first half of the film, we as viewers are held prisoners right along with Ma and Jack. We see what a patient and wonderful mother she is as she strives to provide some semblance of hope for her son, though in a nearly hopeless situation. When Jack turns 5, Ma begins to explain the outside world to him, as she knows they must try to escape in order for her son to have any semblance of a normal life. During this time, we are in awe of this 10 x 10 environment and how it is every bit the nightmare we have imagined while reading the articles and seeing the reports on real life ordeals.\n\nThe second half of the film is equally fascinating, as we watch young Jack and his sense of wonder and caution at discovering the real world. We also see the psychological trauma that Ma experiences after staying strong for so long. Assimilating into society brings different challenges for both Ma and Jack, plus those of her mother (Joan Allen), her father (William H Macy) and her mom's new beau (Tom McCamus). The film doesn't shy away from their reactions, though some are easier to stomach than others.\n\nProviding any more details would soften the impact of the film, and this is one that is meant to be felt \u2013 even if it's a true kick in the gut. The film is well cast and well acted, and young Jacob Tremblay captures our hearts quickly and joins the short list of child actors who go far beyond \"cute\" and into profound. Brie Larson exploded onto the acting scene in Short Term 12, one of my favorite movies of 2013; but it's here where she steps into the elite level of actresses. She brings a tenacity and emotional strength that leaves us never doubting whether she has \"her strong\"."

        "review_title": "Brie Larson in a searing, troubling, and ultimately uplifting story: big message in a small bottle",
        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't see Room (2015) when it first hit the theaters because I knew it would be something of a downer (or worse) and I tend not to opt for those. But that, of course, is pretty short-sighted. My wife thought I should watch it even if just to see Brie Larson in her Oscar-winning role before I went to see her as a big-budget superhero in Captain Marvel (2019), so we watched Room on Netflix this week. And of course she was right -- this is a carefully thought out and crafted film that sticks in the mind afterward. Although it's fictional, sadly it's not all that fictional. We read in the news all the time about kidnapping and abduction of young women for sex-trade purposes or worse.\n\nI'm not going to worry too much about \"spoilers\" in my review, coming 4 years after the fact -- the IMdB synopsis itself gives away the bare bones of the whole plot -- so I'll just go ahead with my reactions. Larson plays Joy Newsome (\"Ma\"), abducted on the street at age 17 by an unnamed predator (Sean Bridgers) who keeps her locked in his backyard shed as a sex slave (no other way to put it). 7 years later she now has a son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who has no knowledge of the world outside their Room except for what appears on TV. The first half of the movie shows them in their tiny, gruelling world day by day. Joy takes advantage of a temporary power outage to concoct an escape, which beyond all hope actually works. The second half of the movie is their adjustment after re-entry to the world outside (or in Jack's case, first-time entry).\n\nBut no plot summary gets across the emotional impact and at-times surprising turns of the story. Though Jack is utterly bewildered at first by the reality of the larger world, as young children are very good at doing he adjusts, learns, adapts and accepts over the course of the next few weeks: meeting his grandparents, finally dressing and eating well, just being outside, making a neighborhood friend, delighting in the family dog. It's Joy who has much deeper trouble. After the Great Escape, dealing with the police and the doctors, and making the transition back to her own family home, things are not all rosy. She's unpredictably short-tempered; impatient; aimless; unhappy. She doesn't know what's wrong, experiences a physical breakdown. Shouldn't she be happy and fine? The obvious answer staring us in the face, of course, is that she's exhausted: flat-out, bone-deep exhausted, after 7 unrelenting years of captivity and five years looking out for her son every minute of every day -- protecting, feeding, training, teaching. Healing happens, but it takes far longer. This is a deeply sympathetic portrayal of a very ordinary person pushed far beyond ordinary limits, and Larson delivers every bit of it.\n\nWhich brings me to the stylistic part of the movie. Everyone here is an ordinary person and acts that way. When abducted, Joy was an average high-school girl with no more personal resources or courage than average, pushed into an impossible situation. She has no particular training in dealing with motherhood, or sexual predators, or isolation and deprivation. Jack is what he is -- a kid with a kid's typical mix of behavior that is variously affectionate, obedient, self-centered, kind, shy, peevish, frightened. Their captor (\"Old Nick\") is menacing but also banal -- a social loser who can't hold a job and has minimal competence. Joy's escape bears no resemblance to the kind of McGyver scheme that a normal action thriller hero would come up with; her plan is not really a very good one, is also extremely risky, but it is just bold enough to work. The police officers and doctors who find them and care for them are unspectacular in turn, but they are seen to do their jobs sympathetically and well. Finally, Joy's parents Nancy and Robert (played by major actors Joan Allen and William H. Macy, in strong supporting performances) are ordinary suburban dwellers who had been forced to presume their long-lost daughter was dead. In the intervening years they have separated, and Nancy has a new partner Leo (played very effectively indeed by Tom McCamus). Both Nancy and Leo turn out to be the strengths of their newly rebuilt family: Nancy takes over Jack when Joy cannot, and Leo succeeds in making friends with him while Robert finds that he cannot.\n\nThe media feeding frenzy that usually accompanies sensational news stories like this \"Woman Held Captive for Seven Years Escapes! News at 8.\") is shown too, but not all that much time is spent on it. What little we get, though, does not cast reporters in a very good light. We see one very telling scene where Joy consents to do a TV interview, and the interviewer (Wendy Crewson) sideswipes her with appallingly self-righteous, judgmental questions about what she did with her son.\n\nLastly, a shout-out to young Jacob Tremblay. He was age 9 when making the film, playing a 5-year-old, and breathtakingly convincing at it. It never occurred to me while watching that he was that much older in reality. He's just as major a figure as Larson at carrying the movie and in certain sections has to effectively carry it alone. We know how Brie Larson's career has taken off (literally, in Captain Marvel!) but it's nice to see that Tremblay is beginning to make his mark as well in other features."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is an old saying, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" I feel in terms of movies, it would translate to something like, \"Don't judge a movie by its trailer.\" After watching Lenny Abrahamson's Room, I believe even more in the validity of this statement.\n\nIf there is a way to experience a film like Room, then it is only one, and that is to jump into it with a childlike curiosity. Not a single word needs to be read beforehand, nor a frame of the trailer watched. With this statement, I feel its absolutely worthless for you to read this review and for me to type this.\n\nThere is nothing special in the story, yet everything is so special. Even though it wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of the countless similar cases of women enslaved by warped men and their tales of survival. Room is about another similar story of a young mom, Joy, better known as \"Ma\" who got kidnapped when she was 17 and has been held captive for almost 7 years now in a locked shed by her captor, who uses her as a \"sex slave\". Jack, is a five year old boy born to \"Ma\" who turns into her ray of light, her hope, and her survival in the end.\n\nI'm not going to talk about the plot here, as it's quite obvious from the trailer. If it isn't, better yet, go watch the movie directly and skip the trailer all together. The trailer was something holding me back from watching this movie for the longest time, and when I did finally saw it, I realized why the director chose to reveal almost the entirety of the plot in the trailer. Because this movie is not about its story, but about the way it is presented. Its about the emotions and the feelings of the characters and the way they drag you into their world, their pain becomes your pain, their small moments of joy become your moments of happiness.\n\nRoom is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to its two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn.\n\nIt is not an easy film to watch. It has the rare ability to actually make you grip the sides of your chair at particular moments. I believe any high tension scenes involving kids are sometimes deliberately put to manipulate the emotions of the audience. But Lenny actually managed to pull this off very well in this movie. The tension in the scene when Jack tries and finally manages to escape from \"Old Nick\" is so high that it get almost impossible to bear. It is perhaps a cruel coincidence that the music that places over this scene is by the great instrumental band This Will Destroy You.\n\nThe film opens and ends in a 10 by 10 room (which I believe is the main character in the film, more on this later), that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead skylight. The tone with which the movie opens, actually makes you feel like it's a Christmas movie at first! Jack running around saying good morning, to the objects which is all his world consists of; the lamp, the sinks, the plant, the refrigerator. Every inanimate object is like a dear friend to Jack. For him, they are all real. Together, they survive incomprehensibly difficult lives. With as much joy as the film opens to, it drops its tone immediately as we slowly learn the bleak and grim reality of the room. It is but just a prison of torture for his Ma.\n\nBy incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept it.\n\nDirector Lenny Abrahamson has created one of the greatest fairy tales ever put on the screen. To try and make whatever sense she can of their harrowing situation and provide for Jack a 'normal' childhood, Ma creates a world of imagination. The TV Old Nick has stationed in a corner is their only window into another world. The skylight on the roof has become more like a painting.\n\nThe second half of the film focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son.\n\nThere are some scenes that are so heart-warming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever.\n\nThe best actors are the ones able to transport you into their characters' own universes, no matter how isolated from society they happen to be. Larson, Tremblay, and Joan Allen all have a tremendous range of emotional ability and are able to sell you on their story not just for two hours, but for an entire lifetime. With Room, Abrahamson goes the extra mile with his direction, and director of photography Danny Cohen keeps all eyes on Jack. The film asks us to examine how we view the world and how this viewpoint is shaped by our nurtured upbringing. The result is a breath-taking experience brought to life, one you won't soon forget.\n\nThe cinematography in the room itself was surprising. I think most films would have tried for a more claustrophobic look. Instead, the dimensions in this are simply defined and unjudged. The abrupt camera pans while Jack is running from wall to wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. This place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the room is trivial, but also the greatest possible distance. Victory and closure is achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect perspective when the room is seen from the outside.\n\nDirector Lenny Abrahamson is no stranger to the strange, and with Room he's made a masterpiece of filmmaking. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. What I loved about the book was its focus on Jack and how he adjusts to seeing this new world for the first time, and the movie never loses sight of that.\n\nThe director & the writing team made sure there was not one dull moment. The addition of \"insignificant\" characters and plot twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this story one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most beautiful way.\n\nRoom is wise. It is a movie of extremes. In it's own magical way, the film makes staggering observations about life. What is real, what is not? What is our place in this endless universe? For Jack, Room is his entire world. Everything he knows and loves is right there. He looks up and sees the sky out of the skylight. Sometimes a dead leaf tumbles down. He questions it. Just like we do when we stare at the night sky glittering with shining stars. What lies beyond our microscopic corner of the universe? Will we ever be able to comprehend it? Can we ever be as brave as Jack?\n\nIt is a bleak film, yet so full of hope. We live meaningless lives on a little blue dot. But that's not how we look at it. To us, we are the center of the universe. We are Jack. The world is our room.\n\nIn one of the best child performances I can think of, young Jacob Tremblay essentially carries the movie on his tiny shoulders, especially in the second half. He gives it his strong. Together, they are heart-breaking, unforgettable, resilient and joyous.\n\nRoom is timeless. It will live forever, and in its immortality, it will continue to inspire generations after we are all gone. It is one of the best films of the new millennium and after its two transcendent hours, you emerge a changed person, one who has a new appreciation for the tiny miracles of life that are usually ignored. Room is an ephemeral moment in time and I will always remember it with fondness."

While those minutes are crucial to the rest of the story, seeing how a grown woman and her five-year-old son survive while locked inside a 10ft. by 10ft. outdoor shed is a tough task for any viewer. Director Lenny Abrahamson and screenwriter Emma Donoghue, adapting her own novel, free the captives (and the audience) before too long--and yet, mother and son's new life in the suburbs is nearly as uninteresting as life in that shed (I'm not sure this is intentional). Thankfully, Brie Larson's Oscar-winning performance as the exhausted, anxious (and guilt-ridden) single mom facing a strange new world is riveting on occasion, while the (not implausible) center of the story--an awakening, if you will--is emotional, if never quite fascinating. As an acting exercise for this cast, the material must have looked like a godsend. Abrahamson is careful with his actors; he allows them to think and breathe and hurt and heal. But all this drama could take its toll on an impatient audience, so personal judgment will have to dictate whether or not the movie is a success. **1/2 from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "It opens badly, but this is deceptive. If you watch carefully, are very, very patient, look at what's actually there, and give it three minutes-----it gets worse. But wait. This too is unfair. Are you actually seeing what's in front of your eyes? Are you sure? The film demands that you give it at least another ten minutes, and you do. And as soon as you do, it gets worse. After that it gets worse, and then worse, and worse, and worse. And it's only just begun. The setting hasn't even left the room. Then it does. Finally. Surprise! A goodly portion of the film, in fact, at least 30 percent, takes place outside the room. I have no idea why. To show that the outside world is just as claustrophobic? That would've been a good point, but the story doesn't allow it! The writer is adrift. The shift of scenery doesn't help. It makes Room even worse - and it gets worse yet, and even worse than that, despite the brief, welcome, charitable appearance of two superbly talented actors (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) who can actually act, whether they have a character to play or not. Acting, in fact, is not an issue in the movie. To be fair, the child star of the film, Jacob Tremblay (made deliberately genderless as only a 5-year-old could be) gives as execrable a performance as any adult ever has, and deserves a lot of credit for it. If the director intended it that way, he probably either has no children, or doesn't know or like any. It's not totally Tremblay's fault: he obviously found it impossible to believe in the story, as did the writer, director, actors and producers who concocted this infinitely boring, one-dimensional, unfelt drama. Here and there throughout the story, that sickly, treacly piano that has invaded the soundtrack of hundreds of anemic films like a skin rash makes an appearance. To top it off, Room is made with the highest of production values. They are the only values visible, and may lift the movie to the heights of Trumpian emptiness. Americans love nothing better in their movies: production values are the new family values. The overall impression is of a movie, clunkily directed by Lenny Abrahamson, written by someone (Emma Donoghue) whose entire experience of life must have been acquired in a room, probably a classroom, possibly a cloakroom, a writer unashamed to display her bad handwriting, and constitutionally unable or unwilling to share with the public how little she knows or cares about the world she inhabits. A lot has been written about the hell the cinematographers went through to make parts of this movie, jamming their equipment into a tiny cramped space for countless hours. It doesn't show, and what does is not interesting. If they'd shown us the hell, and not the Room they made of it, I'd have had a lot less to say but would've left with more than a craving for a quick burger on my mind."

The story is told from the eyes of the little boy. Here the perpetrator is a stranger who kidnapped and keeps a 16 year old girl captive in a 11X11 feet cramped room (which has a tub, wash-basin, toilet, kitchen bed, cupboard, a TV and only one skylight) for 7 years.\n\nThe movie starts when Joy is 24 year old women with her 5 year old son Jack in this tiny space where they create their own world.\n\nIt is a gritty story of survival of Joy and her mother's instinct to protect her son Jack and planning an escape so that they are freed from this hostile and captive room for Jack to see the wonders of the world.\n\nBy the mid-point of the story Joy succeeds in her plans and is rescued by police. The second half focuses on re-integration of Joy and Jack within the society and their family but skips the perpetrator's arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe main three characters Joy - (Brie Larson) Jack - (Jacob Tremblay) and Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) play their parts beautifully.\n\nBrie won the Oscars Academy award as Best Actress for this role and another Jacob had 45 award nominations from which he won 19 awards as best supporting young actor.\n\nThe movie did excellent business after the Oscar award for Brie Larson. On a budget of 13 million, it did a business of 36 million world-wide.\n\nThe Director Lenny Abrahamson has done a marvelous job in remaining true to the novel, thanks to the help of the author Emma who also wrote the screenplay of the movie.\n\nThe movie is rated all time 136 best movies of the world rated by IMdb and has 239 nominations from which it has won 130 awards. Phenomenon.\n\nGood thing about the movie is that even after undertaking such an abusive subject, Lenny and Emma have created a clean, touching movie that moves us to tears and smiles and final triumph of human spirit.\n\nA bit slow but to transport to the lives of Joy and Jack - one needs to hold the flag of empathy. A good Drama thriller.\n\nI would go with 7.25 out of 10\n\nP.S. Just for those who are interested in Fritzl case, the father is life-imprisonment till death in Austrian prison and the daughter was a given a new identity and lives with her children a normal life."

The film is a bit artsy and will bore some audiences and captivate others. Each of the characters are beautifully written and dynamically flawed in one way or another. The film has suspenseful elements and heart strumming ones too.\n\nBrie Larson's character deservedly won the Oscar that year, even if Brooklyn was a better film over all. She wore no make up for a majority of the film and relied on her acting to sell the audience her character.\n\nJack played by Jacob Tremblay was impressive. I can't say if he was just a genuinely talented performer or if what happened to Jack had also happened to Jacob. His performance was that convincing.\n\nHow a major scene happens in the film is because of Amanda Brugels character who I can't remember her characters name. That being said I loved how the movie transitioned from act one to act two because of this Police-woman's actions. You'll know which scene I'm talking about because it's the most suspenseful moment in the film.\n\nWilliam H. Macy is in the film and is thrown away immediately to add to the underlying theme that some men can be horrible people, just like Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers who played Johnny Burns from Deadwood, one of my favorite (canceled before their time) TV shows.\n\nJoan Allen play's the main character's mother who takes on the motherly role for a certain reason and does a wonderful job making the audience hold their chest in many emotional moments.\n\nEnough with the superb acting. The film has flaws. Mainly direction and storytelling. A film shouldn't take you out of the scene because of boredom or nothing to really take in. Many scenes felt longer than they needed to be. Timing is a problem in the film as it felt like The film felt like it was almost over at the 50 minute mark, then had an hour epilogue.\n\nVerdict: Watch if you enjoy drama. I can't recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching the Transformer movies, because this is the polar opposite."

        "review_detailed_main": "A very dark topic handled with such poetry and softness. Most films about abduction, imprisonment and sexual abuse of women tend to portray those aspects in ways that are sexually gratifying to a male audience. Not this one.\n\nTold from the point of view of a child, to whom the violent and frightening nature of his mother's situation has never dawned on, this film has no graphic depictions of violence or rape. Instead we get to see all the rest of their daily existence: mundane details of passing the endless repetitive hours. What that gives us is a portrayal of survivors, not victims. Rather than concentrate on her helplessness, the film depicts the mother as a thoughtful, brave individual who is making the best she can out of an awful situation.\n\nThe colour scheme and the composition of images throughout the film are beautiful and unexpectedly peaceful. The overall atmosphere is calm in a way that gives the thrilling moments a much stronger impact than they would have otherwise.\n\nAfter seeing this film half a dozen times I finally read the book, and I think anyone who has loved the book might be quite happy with the film adaptation. Many details have been changed, but the overall storyline and the general feel remain the same."

        "review_detailed_main": "Room is bleak. Even after the initial subject matter is concluded, the bleakness does continue.\n\nIt isn't about the event itself (a man holding a woman and her child captive), but the impact it ultimately has, both for those directly involved, and the people it has impacted elsewhere.\n\nBrie Larson is the driving force here: a woman so devolved from her previous self that any sense of normality has been shattered by the psychological trauma of her experience.\n\nUnfortunately, something I couldn't help but feel was that the Jack's behaviour made no sense. As a five-year-old who has spent their whole existence captive, his actions, emotional outbursts and general demeanour feel misguided and nonsensical. It is not that the role is portrayed badly - I just think the character wasn't written brilliantly.\n\nThe standout scene (where Jack lies in the back of a truck looking at the sky) is excellent, beautifully shot with some quality music to boot. From that point on, however, I felt a lack of investment in the story's developments, confused by some of the reactions of the parents and the media surrounding the story.\n\nI wanted to enjoy Room, but had it made clear it me early on that that wasn't really part of the deal (and I am fine with that). Regretfully, I didn't feel totally invested either, sucked out of the moment by a child's irrational actions in the first half."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a sucker for emotional dramas, and even more so if they deal with difficult and/or sensitive subject matter. ROOM is both of those things and does so in a tasteful fashion. I also haven't been so emotionally invested in a film since probably PRISONERS. The story revolves around and Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma (whose real name is Joy) was abducted as a teenager and lives in a garden shed, affectionately (or not so, depending on how you interpret it) referred to as 'Room,' with her now-five-year-old son, Jack. When the opportunity arises, Jack escapes and the real meat of the story begins. First off, I was very impressed with performances in the film. Brie Larson does excellent work, but I was even more surprised by Jacob Tremblay. Even though he's quite young, he was able to convey a dramatic range that, although suiting the role in particular, sometimes isn't achieved by older actors. Playing someone who's spent his entire life in captivity, he portrayed the wide-eyed curiosity required as well as the confusion in someone whose perspective on the world is fundamentally changed. There were a number of intense and/or emotional scenes, and he nailed every single one. I also liked how, even though the story deals with women who have been abducted, there was a bit more going on under the surface. Separating the narrative from the obviously horrible situation in which a woman is raped repeatedly, you can see the film also dealing with the psychological effect when a woman has motherhood thrust upon them, the culture shock when someone who has lived in isolation comes into contact with the \"real world,\" etc. There was a lot going on than a simple escape from captivity, in other words. The only issue I could possibly come up with is that the second half of the film doesn't quite live up to the suspenseful first half. Once mother and son are freed, the narrative drive is somewhat lost, or at least goes into a holding pattern for a while. The difference in pacing is noticeable, although I wasn't terribly bothered by it. And, the film wraps up in a satisfying way anyway. All things considered, ROOM is an extremely compelling story that will have some people reaching for a tissue. It has great performances, cinematography, score, etc., and is certainly one of the best films of 2015."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't watch the trailer, so I never knew what exactly was going on. So when I started watching the movie, I was genuinely surprised and shocked with the circumstances that these characters had to go through, along with how deep and emotional this movie was. The film was able to do so much skill from the director and being able to bring a heavy hitting emotional film.\n\nI really liked how the film allowed us to be in the perspective of the child and to see the world from his point of view. You can tell from where they were that something is off about the room the mom and Jack were living in; especially with how cramped and dirty it looked. However, as we see it in his perspective, we understand that since this was the only thing that he knows, we see the beauty and the enjoyment that he has in that small place. Even when they escape the room, you see everything in a new light as we are in Jack's shoes and a simple room in a hospital will look heavenly. You see everything as if you are seeing it for the first time and this is what the director was able to do very well. The cinematography and the overall structure of the scene works perfectly well, allowing us to be in his shoes and to be amazed with the boy.\n\nThis is not an easy film to sit through due to the bleakness and how daunting what the mother and son had gone through, along with her parents can be. This film provides so much depth and emotion to all of the characters and I cannot help but give praise for what this film was able to accomplish. As the mom and her son was able to get out of their room, I really loved that we get to see how something like this can ruin people emotionally and that things do not end happily so soon. We usually see the family become happy and the characters who had gone through trauma will miraculously get over it. But this film doesn't do that as it dives deeper into the turmoil of what had happened. The main character is going through some emotional distraint, the boy is struggling to understand the new reality he has entered and we see that the parents of the main character also have to struggle to deal with their new reality. Despite all of this, not everything is a disaster as there were moments of enjoyment and happiness that had me tearing up. Which is another reason why I loved this movie. The film perfectly combines the darkness with the heartfelt moments well, adding more emotional element to the overall story.\n\nEvery character here goes through so much and this is all due to the performances. Brie Larson was absolutely amazing as Jack's mom. She has to carry part of the film and the emotion that she was able to deliver was just great. I really liked that we get to see that even after it is over, things won't go back as they were before and you see the inner turmoil that she goes through. She did deserve every praise and awards she has received for this film based on what she brought to this movie. Also, even at a young age, Jacob Tremblay gave such a fantastic performance. Just like with Larson, he provided a lot of depth and emotion to the character as he also has to carry the film and based on his performance alone. I was able to buy that he knew nothing outside of the room he stayed in and that he is totally oblivious to the world around him. You also have great performances from Joan Allen, William H. Macy and Tom McCamus, whom I really liked, especially with what he does in the film.\n\nEven watching it a second time, the emotion and the tension that I felt, the connection I felt with these characters and crying non stop in some of the more emotional scenes really made me appreciate this film and consider this as one of my favorite films of all time."

I did think we could have seen more of Joy's father, who is portrayed terrifically by William H. Macy, for only three scenes, they clearly had a complicated relationship and I left wanting to find out more, it is probably established fully in the book. The performances are outstanding, Brie Larson is entirely engrossed in her character in a way that would be frightening for most actors, but she did it without half measures, and the chemistry between her and Jacob Tremblay is absolutely brilliant, it is very tough love, which makes it real. Heartwarming, thrilling and dramatic, Room will leave you experiencing many different emotions, and you will be happy that it did, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama.\n\nA loving mother convinces her son that the room they are trapped in is the whole world, until he is old enough to help her plan an escape.\n\nBest Performance: Brie Larson"

        "review_detailed_main": "'Room' is an immensely powerful film. It has the ability to make its audience care from minute one right until the dying seconds. There isn't a weak scene any where in sight and the result is two hours of magnificent cinema. It's rare that a film can succeed in so many different aspects. The drama throughout is second to none, taking the audience on an emotional roller coaster that is genuinely moving. There is a scene of suspense that Hitchcock himself would be proud of. The intensity in this scene would struggle to be matched by the absolute best action directors Hollywood has to offer today. I haven't been that on the edge of my seat in a long time. The script is also incredibly thought-provoking. The character of 'Jack' played by Jacob Tremblay delivers some truly beautiful voice-over work. If you truly listen to what he's saying, in context, you can appreciate just how much we all take for granted the small things in life. Behind everything else the film has a wonderful message.\n\nDirector Lenny Abrahamson, who has deservedly been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for his work in 'Room', has done an unbelievable job of balancing all these aspects of the film. He was helped a lot too by his two leads giving near flawless performances. Tremblay gives one of the best performances by a child-actor I can remember in a long time. Sadly the category of Best Actor is simply too strong for a child to be nominated in it this year, but make no mistake, anyone who sees this will be blown away by his performance. He's definitely one to be watched out for in the future. Brie Larson has received a nomination in the Best Actress category and deservedly so. The girl can act. She's been around a long time now but has really found her niche in the last couple of years seemingly. Here, she perfectly puts you in the shoes of the character and makes you feel every emotion and every shred of desperation as realistically as if you were actually in that situation. Based on what I've seen here, I'd call her a shoo-in to win the Oscar.\n\nThere's not a lot else to say about this work of perfection, other than make sure you see it. The title could be considered a little bland and I hope it doesn't put anyone off giving it a chance because the product itself is anything but. Perfect direction, a beautifully written script and superb performances, all equal one of the best films of the year. I don't think it has quite enough momentum behind it to win the Best Picture award in what is a very strong category this year, but the fact it's been recognised with a nomination, and thus more people will get to see it, is a bonus if nothing else. A flawless film."

I expected it would be about the difference in feelings between mother and child about their situation (In the Room as well as outside). And in a way it was, especially the first half of the film, which was really good. The second half disappointed me a little bit. It even was a bit boring and sometimes over the top sentimental. Where the movie made me cry in the first half, the second half made me laugh. Because it was funny to see how over the top wise Jack was. And everything was done to make the viewer feel something. However sometimes less is more. Over the top is funny. But the American audience will love it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\nHere is what a professional film critic from New York Post has to say about \"Room\" (2015): \"Dopey as the film is on a plot level, it's equally vapid in its psychology\". Here is what i have to say to this \"professional film critic\" - \"Dude, please, change you profession, ASAP, thank you\".\n\n\"Room\" (2015) is THE best drama that came from 2015. It features great performance by Brie Larson for which she deservedly must win Oscar, great supporting work from veteran familiar faces, and probably THE best acting from a child i have ever seen. This movie could have felt apart very quickly if it weren't greatly played by actor portraying Jack, in my opinion the key character in this story. Fortunately Jacob Tremblay gives unforgettable, jaw-dropping performance that glues this movie together. Superbly crafted by director Lenny Abrahamson and amazingly written by Emma Donoghue (based on her own novel), \"Room\" tells the hard, gritty, and sometimes very difficult to imagine story, that unfortunately has happened in a real world just months ago (without children as i read).\n\nThe first hour of this movie is simply a masterpiece. I won't spoil anything, but the second hour goes in a different direction, but never looses it's reality or great movie craftsmanship. I was waiting for this movie months after i heard about it, and finally seeing it i'm so glad it delivered everything i have hoped for - not that i wanted to see such a story - i wanted it to see happening on the screen, in a movie world. \"Room\" is as good as movie drama gets it.\n\nOverall, i can't praise this movie more - this is the best movie that i saw in 2015. There are more movies from Best Picture contenders that i haven't seen it yet, but those will be more visceral experiences. \"Room\" is different kind of drama. It unfold just in front of, keeps you glued to the screen for all it's running time 1 h 50 min. Sometimes it will be difficult to watch, but don't turn away - this is the best movie of 2015."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is not much to say about a film like this. No complicated plot lines, no unnecessary character setups, just a well written story, a camera and a crew that understands what is going on.\n\nThe acting is probably the best i have seen in years, at no point do you get thrown out of the story. Even though one could argue the filmcould be chopped in half, the acting is so consistent up into the tiniest roles, that at no point you feel like this isn't really happening. the emotional arc from the two leads is enormous, and as an audience you are in it the whole way. If Larson is perfect, then for Tremblay we need to invent a completely new word.\n\nThe story reveals itself gradually, which is always brilliant as it keeps you busy on what exactly is going on. nothing is nicely 'explained' to you.\n\nto me this did not feel like a story but like a reality show, with a very grim topic all the way through. This is one of those lonely gems in film and let's hope prizes may rain on these actors, writer and director for their enormous efforts. I hope it won't be missed in the bulk of big budget nonsense we had to sit through this year. Don't hear about this film, go see it!"

It wasn't sensational at all where it could have been.\n\nThe acting is fantastic, Brie Larson was excellent and I thought she would be good when I heard she was cast as she impressed in short term 12. No disappointments there.\n\nThe boy, Jack, was just brilliant, I see so many films where the child actors overact and are over cutesy. He did neither, he was perfect. He really broke my heart with the smallest expressions and quiet words.\n\nI would like to see them both nominated for Oscars and this is without doubt one of my films of the year.\n\nEnjoyed this much more than the book. Go see it. It's fantastic. Bring a tissue!"

        "review_title": "A breathtaking journey through one of the most haunting stories of recent years",
        "review_detailed_main": "This indie drama directed by Lenny Abrahamson is a movie with not enough words to describe how breathtaking it is from beginning to end. Based on the captivating novel by Emma Donoghue, this indie flick rounds up a gripping testament of one of the most powerful bonds between a little boy and his mother ever told on screen. And with an awe-inspiring direction by Lenny Abrahamson and lively storytelling that holds the effects of making you cheer with utter joy at one moment, then leaving you reaching for the tissues the next; and by the end when the credits start rolling, it's difficult to leave the film without garnering a feeling of haunt, or imagining how it would feel to step in the shoes of the characters as they face an near-imaginable predicament. This film follows of the story of twenty-something year old Joy (played by Brie Larson) and her five-year old son Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay) who have spent many years incarcerated in a small shed by Joy's abusive lover who she calls Old Nick (played by Sean Bridgers) who's only means of support is bringing them food and water; while keeping them locked up in the shed using a number combination only he knows. Spending his five young years cooped up in the small shed crammed with a twin-sized bed and a sink, Jack has absolutely no knowledge of the outside world; he makes friends with inanimate objects including a wardrobe and a sink, he believes people on television are just characters made of abstract colors. This is until one day when him and Joy finally make their escape, they go out where Jack experiences the outside world for the very first time.\n\nThe film introduces an idea that may lay some familiarity on some film goers, an idea of innocent souls held captive in a small enclosed area and alienated with society for many years which you may have heard in some news articles dating back to the Baby Boom era. Lenny Abrahamson however, executes this concept in a way that not only breathtaking, but simply magical. Abrahamson takes the harrowing story of a mother and her little boy enclosed in tiny, old world free from society, successfully captures the deep emotional atmosphere surrounding the lead characters and conducts the story in a way that feels incredibly realistic as if you are actually another character trapped in the small room. Just about every scene taking place inside the small room is beautifully shot with decent lighting to make sure you are able to capture the intense feeling of the characters and their interaction with the small place outside the world the little boy believes is imaginary made up by his mother. When the little boy finally reaches his chance of examining the outside world for the first time, it fuels the emotional core of the story, even more so than the relationship between him and his mother which serves as a key figure of the film. And the emotional gravity continues as the two are forced to adjust to their new life outside, with plenty of moments to allow our characters to shine, and never feeling the need to manipulate us with sappy storytelling. Brie Larson gives a performance that is simply phenomenal and bound to pull at the heart strings. Jacob Tremblay who's only eight years old playing a five-year old child is also tremendous in his role, especially for a cute kid his age. Sean Bridgers, though not given too much do, makes a good source for some intense, heart-pounding moments during the first half. The rest of the cast including William H. Macy and Joan Allen are simply mesmerizing, though fall short below the gold of the two main leads.\n\nRoom is riveting, triumphant journey through one of the most stories ever told on film in years. With unforgettable performances and lively storytelling, this film is one piece of cinematic artwork that is definitely too breathtaking to ignore. Yes, it can be tough watch at times and there are moments are destined to scouting for tissues or crying on the shoulder of your friend next to you. But ultimately, the film is a rewarding experience."

Full of absolutely heart-wrenching moments and yet ultimately positively life-affirming, Lenny Abrahamson and Emma Donoghue have written and directed a true masterpiece. There is a certain sequence in the middle of the film that left me breathless and an emotional wreck! Cried the first time watching and as soon as I started watching the film again, started tearing up as soon as it started. A beautiful film about a mother and a son that will be cherished!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The kidnapping, incarceration and rape of children is incredibly difficult to represent authentically on screen. 'Michael' shows how damning the effect can be when genre demands are prioritized over authentic portrayals. The first half of Room offers up a subtly plausible account of how a young woman copes with appeasing her captor in order to avert his gaze from her son. The performances of Brie Larson and an outstanding Jacob Tremblay are crucial here. Jack craves affection but also explores revolt, and the parent-child bond is utterly convincing. Sean Bridgers as the captor Old Nick takes a banality of evil approach: this could be your cousin, your neighbour, your boss. When Jack escapes and Old Nick makes the decision to abandon him in the street, the way he throws the boy down completely conveys the psychopathic nature of the man. The second half of the film, about Ma's difficulty in re-adjusting to society, works less well. Her father is wheeled in then wheeled off in order to make a point about the difficulty of accepting his grandchild. The A-list casting here did not help - a more anonymous face in this role would have given it more of an everyday dark fear appeal. The ending is low-key, but is in its own small way triumphant, a full stop placed right where it was needed. These two characters will go on. They will heal. Thoughtful, mature film-making that stays with you after the curtain closes."

He was able to run away very easily and then the rest of the film was about their life at the grandparents. William Macy is a great actor but I don't know why he was needed in this role. He could have been a good kidnapper. Ma attempting suicide was not believable as no one who had been confined to a room would ever imagine committing suicide after what they both went through and were given a new life.\n\nBrie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were good as actors so I have some hope for them. Novels are whole different world from films."

        "review_detailed_main": "Room -\n\nA gross irresponsibility of the writer of this film, along with a supporting production crew, and cast. The story glamorizes the process of being held hostage, using a young women and her child. I am afraid why a story teller would choose such a topic, and why would he be so consumed as to make a message of this to the general population. Although it may seem cute at first seeing how a boy senses the room, and world around him; I am left with the taste that it only desensitizes others. This is not a story we should expose ourselves to like this, as a human race we might be tempted to play it down if it happens to others in real life, or make it seem to others it is not so bad to commit such an act to others.\n\nThere is a responsibility here when you interact with the public. I realize art is based on trying to work through what happens to you or what you have experienced, the art part being you are trying to get others to feel and communicate with you and what you are experiencing. But if that be the case here, then a more appropriate form of art in the direction of it should have been a movie portraying the horror of being held captive, and better yet maybe even realize this is too hard a topic not just for the writer to articulate but also too hard for the general public to consume.\n\nI give this film a rating of zero, and suggest this film maker and crew take a different occupation to make money. I don't want to be a part of any of it anymore. And yes, there are many movies which could be labeled as I did with this one, but someone should write an honest review, a responsible review."

        "review_detailed_main": "How many times in your life have you been forced to finish a bad movie, book, or story, all the while just wishing it would end? Rarely is that longing as desperate in our reality as it is for the characters in Room. When Jack screams at his Ma, \"I want a different story!\", you know there's more to it than just a hunger for a different bedtime yarn. Her response, \"No! This is the story you get!\", punctuates their situation, and ultimately our own desires, with such force it nearly knocked me out. Room, a powerhouse of horrifying drama and real-life suspense, breaks out from its confining premise with enough gentle moments of love to make it one of the year's best. If you can't tell, I'm being careful with the details of the plot. However, know that it's a setup that's about as bleak as one can imagine. Director Abrahamson (maker of the criminally underrated Frank) creates an atmosphere of intensely palpable desperation in his small sets. In lesser hands, Room could've been either an oppressively gloomy downer or dishonestly optimistic hack-job. Instead, it's both strikingly candid and beautifully grace-filled This compassion for its subjects is thanks in no small part to the much-deserved-Oscar-nominated Larson, and young actor Tremblay. His character, in particular, presents such a powerful look at childish na\u00efvet\u00e9, he gives us one of the most amazing examples childhood trauma and perseverance I've ever seen. That theme (determination through suffering) creates an experience that harbors as much exhilaration as it does tears. Piercing and gut-wrenching, Room is a film you may want to escape, but will be glad you endured."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you're itching to see a masterpiece in film, then go out and watch Room. It's the perfect example of filmmaking that doesn't dumb itself down for its audience. And at the same time, it isn't highbrow or overly complicated.\n\nRoom starts out in a padded room with a young boy, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), and his mother, Joy (Brie Larson), lying in a bed together. We're not sure why they're there at first. But eventually we figure things out. Joy was abducted 7 years prior and Jack is her son by her captor.\n\nJoy is a normal mother. She loves her son. She get's annoyed by him from time to time, just as a normal mother would. Everything is not hunky-dory, but the two of them are content there with each other. Or at least Jack is. You can sense, in Joy's eyes, that she is hiding pain. Jack doesn't know of anything that's happened. He knows of no world beyond those walls.\n\nIt's not until about 25 minutes in where we realize what's going on. But we don't mind because the journey there is just as riveting. The plot is revealed very slowly, as the filmmakers let us figure things out on our own, and do well not to spell things out for us. They don't assume the audience is stupid--at least those who are willing to commit to the storytelling. Nothing is ever stated, but we have a grasp on background and character dynamics due to brilliant exposition.\n\nRoom is slow, I admit, but consistent. Director, Lenny Abrahamson knows what he's doing at all times. Besides getting fantastic performances from his leads, I'm thrilled with every choice he makes. From what he includes to what he omits, he understands what's necessary for us to get as organic of an experience possible. This movie could very well be depressing, but it intentionally never stays in one place long enough to do so.\n\nLarson is something to behold in this film. She's pretty much gives as flawless of a performance that anyone possibly can. It's perhaps the best female performance I've ever seen. And Tremblay, for a child, is extremely believable the whole way through.\n\nThe film is ultimately about moving on. And that process can be long and drawn out and never- ending. There are times while watching this film when we ask ourselves how it will end. Not because we want it to, but because we're not even sure how any ending would be enough. But then we find out we're not looking for an ending at all, but a beginning.\n\nTwizard Rating: 100"

        "review_title": "A tremendous mix of drama and science-fiction that will eventually resonate with nearly viewer at some point in time",
        "review_detailed_main": "I remember seeing a trailer for \"Room\" months back in 2015 and being almost entirely mystified; it looked like a strange, almost ethereal mix of drama and science-fiction that even the trailer couldn't adequately communicate. Not until seeing it, I realized that this is a film that isn't easy to summarize in a brief two minute trailer, and I'll undoubtedly struggle to illustrate the film's genius with its review. This is the kind of film one needs to experience and feel; a film where words often feel either exaggerating or shortchanging in attempting to illustrate the film's emotional power and exceptional narrative.\n\nSimply put, \"Room\" is the emotional movie-going experience of the season. A deeply moving film that combines the aforementioned genres of drama and science-fiction, \"Room\" is the kind of film that hits you with its most powerful shot after you walk out of the theater or turn off the TV. It lingers in your mind and the characters, their motivations, their conversations, their struggles, and their thoughts don't escape you, unlike most dramas, where character names are probably not even remembered by most following the end credits.\n\nThe film opens with a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her small child named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who live their life in an enclosed garden shed of about one-hundred square feet and their only available sunlight is a skylight. They eat, sleep, bathe, and cook in there, and for Jack, it's the only life he has come to know. At first, their routine actions and close relationship lead one to believe that they've chosen this life in order to free themselves from the constraints of society. However, we see the horror of their reality soon enough.\n\nSeven years ago, Joy was tricked and kidnapped by a man known as \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers), who raped her and had her give birth to Jack. Since then, she has lived inside this closed space; it isn't until their escape-plan is successful that Joy goes back to her mother and father and Jack finally experiences the outside world. Previously, Jack believed, largely in part of his mother, who tried to make their life seem a lot less hellish, that outside of the four walls of \"room,\" as they referred to it, was outer space. The people on TV were just flat, and nothing else besides them and Old Nick existed.\n\nUpon finally escaping and trying to return to a life that seems brand new to them, Joy struggles to get Jack to assimilate to the world. His entire life was predicated upon just him and his \"Ma,\" as he was largely kept hidden in the closet whenever Old Nick would come pay them a visit. Now, he must be socialized into the world at age five, and learn that there is not only a larger life, but a larger world outside of \"room.\" His mother, on the other hand, must grapple with her demons that have haunted her since she was captured.\n\nIf you look at \"Room\" from the perspective of Joy, you find a drama about being re-socialized into the world after living your entire life in captivity. It's a familiar story, but one that is truly sad and potent, and Brie Larson brings such life and emotion to the role for a woman so young (her precocious acting reminds me quite a bit of Jennifer Lawrence). However, if you look at the film through Jack's perspective, you see a film that plays with the realm of science-fiction. While nothing about \"Room\" deals with supernatural or \"the unknown\" in a grandiose sense, we do have a character who has never experienced life first-hand and sees everything around him not only as foreign but, for lack of a better term, alien.\n\nThis results in a film that's very lucid and ethereal, largely in part because of Lenny Abrahamson's (who directed 2014's \"Frank,\" a strong film dealing with mental illness) unique direction and cinematographer Danny Cohen's dreamlike grasp on reality. These beautiful and immersive aesthetic choices make the world and everything we take for granted and overlook on a daily basis look as if it's an unearthly object, with extreme close-ups and high-contrast depictions employed by Abrahamson.\n\n\"Room\" is a film largely bent on repetition; everything from Joy and Jack's daily actions in \"room,\" Jack's attempts to socialize with other adults, Joy's attempt to come to terms with returning to her old life, and more are all showcased as recurring events in the film. This slowburn narrative tactic allows character motivations and interest to rise and boil accordingly, creating a film that turns impacting and even emotional when bigger, more elaborate events occur (the truck scene may be one of the best sequences I've seen in film last year). With all that and more considered, \"Room\" is a wonderful treat of a film; one that will hit everyone differently in a sense that it's not a matter of if it will resonate with you but how it will eventually manage to do so."

The directing was also brilliant. Emotions and drama are well established in the film. My only problem with the video is how the boy escaped from the room, which was performed in a frenzy. In fact, it is impossible for anyone not to see a child who is dead or alive at the insistence of his mother! It was ridiculous, but other than that, the whole movie is great and brilliant. 8/10"

Ma has been locked up in a tiny room for seven years, Jack his entire life, for he was born there. But as Jack turns five and his curiosity starts to grow, Ma decides to attempt yet another escape.\n\nThe first half of this film is chilling. To live in such a closeted space, with only the barest of necessities. Never feeling the wind on your face, barely even seeing the sun. With only one other person for company. Their kidnapper should not be counted. And what makes it even more chilling is the fact that it's told from Jack's point of view, who of course treats it as completely natural. He quite literally doesn't know anything else.\n\nPowerful premise, given even more strength by the performances of Larson and Tremblay. Larson quite deservedly collected an Academy Award for this role, but I have to praise Tremblay as well. He sells his character beautifully, even though Jack's upbringing is about as far from normal as is possible. But in Tremblay's hands Jack's humanity shines through.\n\nIf I had to name a flaw, I really shouldn't, but if you were to force my hand, I'd say that the second half of the film lost something. It was still chilling, but more as a mundane drama. It ceased to be otherworldly and barely conceivable, becoming a story of mother and son trying to live. Which is still good cinema, but not quite as intriguing.\n\nNevertheless, one of the best dramas I've seen in recent years and well worth its praise."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whereas often movies will chronicle the process of being abducted, Room immediately takes us right into the lives of people who are amidst the misery. This is a poignant, harrowing film that offers a detailed account of the human condition. The essentials of human existence - like emotionality - are wholly dissected in this film. Room certainly succeeds in (believably) doing so and thereby avoids falling into a domain of superficiality where other films depicting difficult subject matter have. Seen through the eyes of an innocent child, we are reminded of the saying ignorance is bliss.\n\nLarson was absolutely phenomenal in the lead role, as supported by her deserved Academy Award for Best Actress. She convincingly immersed herself into the psyche of a woman with palpable psychological damage and did so in such an unpretentious and altruistic manner. The tenderness and motherly solicitude she displayed felt extremely genuine and almost made you forget it was a film you were experiencing. In what was a profoundly intricate character portrayal, she really delivered on this one.\n\nThis was a film that heavily depended on its acting. There was no flashy CGI, no dazzling special effects - just a true-to-life story, credibly depicted. The central performances were superlative and the chemistry Larson and Tremblay showed together was remarkable. Both incredibly humanistic and exercising a compelling charm that is truly touching and hard to not feel for as you watch them evolve. The acute dialogue, the breathtaking cinematography, the excellent supporting actors, the moving score - all executed to perfection. A spectacularly crafted, must-see film."

        "review_detailed_main": "22 November 2015. What is remarkable about this movie is that the audience members didn't fall asleep for the first half of the movie and that's a great thing. Unlike The Diary of Ann Franke (1959), the underlying and ominous tone of Room doesn't have the constant and imminent death threat from Nazi occupation that helps to sustain the visceral tension that Ann Frank was subjected to. Instead the director was confronted with the challenge of somehow making the mundane and likely boring life in a small room something of modicum of interest. In a way, the audience experiences the same efforts of the mother to keep her child preoccupied as much as possible with the few resources possible. Overall this movie has a deliciously balanced and sustained plot development often times left out of the confined and happily released plot outlines of most mystery thrillers.\n\nThe performances are superb and so consistent with the storyline, there isn't any pretense that any of this was stage or acted. The relationships are well developed within the timeframe of the movie and are delightfully varied to reveal the breadth of human responses to such a tragedy. The presentation mostly from the child's perspective made the directorship's job tremendously more difficult but at the same time more captivating and absorbing for the audience. Instead of the usual death lurking around every corner horror genre or the sensationalism of publicity drama, the movie narrowly and richly captures the amazing and arduous behavior of the mother's attempts at some form of normalcy and the doubts surrounding her own competence in having done so.\n\nLike The Miracle Worker (1962), the depiction of a world beyond our own universe, our senses, Room offers up a new way of examining our own environment. Unlike Helen Keller, though the child in Room wasn't limited by his senses, but by his limited surroundings. Nevertheless, the audience is exposed to a refreshing and innovative way to re-examine our own limited senses."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie had me feeling whatever the characters felt the entire time. No matter if it was a sad, funny, happy, or anxious scene, I felt as if I was living in the moment and truly enduring what the people were going through, especially the five year old son.\n\nThe movie is basically in the perspective of the five year old who is the son of the woman who was kidnapped and the captor. In almost every scene, if not all of them, the five year old boy was in it. The only time the viewers left room or any other location in the realm of the film, the child was as well. For example, we never left \"room\" until the son did and we never saw anything past what he was seeing.\n\nA lot of films have hard times staying in the perspective of one character, but this one beautifully captured the little boy's thoughts, actions, and emotions.\n\nA lot of people are talking about how the film makers could have branched out onto the backstory of the captor and the woman who was kidnapped, what took place seven years prior, and much other various things that are involved with kidnapping. But, in my opinion, that all would have ruined the movie because it would have taken us out of the five year old's perspective and thoughts. If he never saw something, we did not either. The five year old did not have an understanding of the world for most of the movie and he did not understand his situation in \"room.\" Therefore, the viewers were not supposed to completely know and understand how the mom and her son got trapped into \"room.\"\n\nStaying in the young child's point of view is very unique for a hostage/kidnapping story because in almost every other film like this that I have seen, it always drifts into the psyche of the person kidnapped or their captor. This film would not have done so well if it was not in the perspective of the child. If it was in the perspective of the captor, the woman kidnapped, or even the family of the woman, it would have been just like any other kidnapping/hostage film and it would have nothing to set it apart from those films.\n\nBeing in the five year old's mentality for the entire film also brings in a new way for us to see real life kidnapping and hostage situations. We often only think about the twisted kidnapper or the person who was kidnapped, never really the child going through it all. Whether the child was the one kidnapped or was conceived by the captor and the person kidnapped, we probably will rarely think about them and what they could be going through. All in all, this film definitely is something that I will remember for a long time and will inspire me to create better, original, well-thoughtout, and real content that others can enjoy like I did while watching Room."

        "review_detailed_main": "Room was an impressive from the start, it unveiled more and more mystery and intrigue as it went on. In the confines of a small room and space a great story of struggle, sacrifice and sadness is conveyed. The film is effective in getting the viewer to formulate numerous thoughts as to why a young mother and her son exist in this small room. We gradually wonder until a shocking and unspeakable truth is revealed to us. After this revelation a number of things makes sense. Like little Jack is slowly coming to terms with reality it gradually sets in for the audience. Lenny Abrahamson cleverly keeps his audience within the confines of that room until he reveals its cruel reality. Its a shocking truth to most who perhaps conjured up all kinds of science fiction related reasons, the reality is bleak.\n\nThe first half of Room was suspenseful, intriguing and became increasingly poignant as it went on. The strength of the film was in the build up and longing of the mother and her son to escape into the world. The second part of Room while pleasing at the start took a dive as the mother went through emotional turmoil and took the audience through this sad journey. The film wasn't long enough to explore the long ranging effects and aftermath such entrapment would have on the mother and son. Hence it was an unnecessary emotional downward spiral. If the film had built up the need for escape, the difficulty of it and painted a fairy tale picture of the outside it might have been even better. Escape happened far too soon, perhaps this could have been prolonged and intensified so when they finally escaped it would have been a lot more rewarding and satisfying. The outside and final scenes could have been drastically shortened to show a happy and free mother and son.\n\nOverall a decent film, Brie Larson gives a stellar performance and one can see why she earned the Academy Award for best actress.\n\n7.5/10"

Those claustrophobic yet wide shots. This one is truly a lot to take in.\n\nAnd Brie deserved that oscar."

Its strength lies in the delicate balance it maintains between heart-wrenching despair and the glimmers of hope that punctuate the characters' lives. The confined setting of \"Room\" becomes a microcosm of the human experience, exploring the depths of resilience and the intricate complexities of familial bonds with profound insight.\n\nBrie Larson's portrayal of Ma is exceptional, but it's Jacob Tremblay who steals the spotlight with his remarkably authentic performance as Jack. Tremblay, at a tender age, navigates the character's innocence and vulnerability with a level of skill that belies his years. His portrayal adds a layer of realism to the film, allowing the audience to empathize with the challenges faced by a child born into captivity. Tremblay's performance is a testament to his extraordinary talent and serves as the beating heart of \"Room.\"\n\nThe film's commitment to realism is evident not only in its performances but also in its cinematography and direction. Lenny Abrahamson captures the confined space of \"Room\" with an intimacy that immerses the audience in the characters' emotional struggles. The deliberate pacing and muted color palette contribute to the film's authenticity, creating an atmosphere that feels genuine and deeply resonant.\n\n\"Room\" skillfully explores the psychological aftermath of trauma and captivity, avoiding sensationalism and opting for a more nuanced portrayal of the characters' healing process. The film's realism extends to its exploration of the challenges faced during reintegration into society, providing a thought-provoking and realistic perspective on the aftermath of such harrowing experiences.\n\nThe unique narrative perspective, seen through the innocent eyes of a child, adds an extra layer of complexity to the film. This choice not only enhances the emotional impact but also allows for a fresh exploration of the mother-son relationship and the resilience that can emerge from even the darkest corners of human existence.\n\nA deeply affecting and thought-provoking experience, this film stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and the exceptional talent of its young lead. A must-watch for those who appreciate raw, genuine portrayals of the human spirit in the face of adversity."

The actors did very well.\n\nMost of the movie isn't situated in the room but about the aftermathof the ordeal. It's a story about the deep bond between mother and child. Some parts were a bit soapy and long winded, but overall I liked it.\n\nI still feel ambivalent, though, given the true story it was inspired on, which part of me feels should be left alone, unless Elisabeth Fritzl ever decides to write or talk about it herself. Watching this made me realize even more what that poor woman must have endured, as the real story is far more harrowing yet, starting with the unfathomable amount of time, 24 years of imprisonment, the perpetrator being her own father, and bearing 7 children (and losing one) of which 3 lived down there with her. The real \"room\" is something way, way beyond any kind of comprehension. I so hope Elisabeth and her kids are okay, wherever they are."

She is often depressed, Jack is bored and full of questions. Eventually the viewer realizes that Ma is being held captive in this enclosed space, Old Nick comes for his rape visits and Jack hides in the wardrobe. Ma has been here for 7 years. The story is hard to watch.\n\nThey finally gain their freedom and Jack is able to experience the outside world for the first time. Interesting details brought up you wouldn't think about; like the kid can't do stairs, never seen the sun or real daylight, never been alone, or exposed to germs. Jacob Tremblay is amazing throughout Brie Larson shines in the second half, finally breaking down when she is safe and can relax enough to let herself go at her mother's house. William H Macy (with top billing) is in this for about a second as the dad who can't look at her."

Imagine living your entire life in Room, thinking the outside world is not real (it's just TV and magic), then at age 5 you break out and are overwhelmed with what the world really is.\n\nThe acting on the child and the mother's part was very good. I saw Captain Marvel first, and was pleasantly surprised at how great of a dramatic actress Brie Larson is.\n\nIf you watch this movie you're gonna need some tissues, because 30 minutes in you will begin to cry and then keep crying until about 30 minutes after the movie or longer. It's exactly what one needs to watch when they need a good cry and a chance to see that the outside world is beautiful and there are a lot of things we don't notice.\n\nAlso the chemistry between the son and mother is beautiful and believable. Which is very important for films of this nature. They help each other get through the experience of escaping room the place they were held captive for several years, the place the boy was born.\n\nI would recommend watching this as I said alone with a lot of Kleenex."

The director has tried a silent approach to take out the emotion and concentrate on the subject matter but has gone too far and left it a bland and dim affair. I was expecting a lot more from the confined direction but not once did I get feeling of claustrophobia. Every character was also very one dimensional and stereotypical.\n\nToo many issues all going at once but none of them were dealt with properly. It's not a bad movie but I think the bland direction and lack of narrative let it down...I would imagine the book would be far,far superior. Still worth a trip to the cinema because I love movies on the big screen...where they should be...and it will not show well on T,V or DVD.\n\nOne of those movies that try to make you think but come across as somewhat pretentious and believes it's own hype..will not win a single nomination...let alone an award."

        "review_title": "A bona fide masterpiece of emotion and storytelling. Best film of the year hands down.",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard for me to fully express the staggering impression that Room left on me using only the written word, but I'll have a go at it anyway. First I'll say that it's hands down my favourite film of the year thus far, and I left the theatre with many emotions swelling in me, affected in a way the only a small group of films have been able do for me. It's a patient, mature study in psychology and a sweeping symphony of complicated emotions revolving around a terrible, tragic situation that seems like a well of hurt and pain until in climbs it's way out into a tenderly heartfelt, incredibly life affirming resolution that never dips into half assed melodrama and feels earned and appropriate. The film casts such a powerful spell that it briefly changed the concept of time for me; Upon arriving near the end, I felt as if years had actually passed for me in theatre since I embarked on the film's journey. The camera, script and actors kept me so intimately close to the characters for the duration of the piece and made me love and care for them so much that it brought me right into their timeline with an intimacy that rarely happens for me in cinema. Now on to the actors. What brave, compelling work from every single performer on screen, right down to the bit parts. Every role castes with a sharp eye for detail and reverent contemplation of who is right for what, creating a roster of heavy hitters and up and comers to be reckoned with. Brie Larson gives a beyond award worthy turn as Joy, a girl who was kidnapped at a young age and held captive by a horrible man (Sean Bridgers, displaying smouldering volatility in terrifying proportions) who impregnates her. She raises the child in the dour, tiny garden shed he keeps her in. Faced with the unthinkable task of creating a nurturing environment for her little one, she tells him that the shed is 'Room', their kingdom, and that the people he sees on their little TV are fake, imparting that they and their captor are the only real ones and there is no outside world. This reminds just how mouldable our minds are when we are small, and the film beautifully explores the psychological ramifications of how we raise our young, how nature vs. nurture comes into play in startling ways during the darkest of times, and the decisions we are forced to make on our own to ensure that our children are safe, even when things have gone beyond wrong, as they have for the poor girl. Old Nick, as she nicknames their captor, rapes her every few days, and treats the two of them like animals. Her son Jack reaches an age where escape becomes vital in his mothers eyes, and she takes her chance, orchestrating a harebrained ditch effort to break free, which is my favourite sequence of the film. It's also one of the most tension filled, seat gripping scenes I've ever seen, as the character buildup has set our personal stakes epically high, which combined with the excellent set up makes for a clammy nightmare of an escape. The director makes the fascinating choice not to use any music at all until they reach freedom, which I noted. As soon as they are out, I let out a cathartic, audible sigh of relief, as the dank hell they undeservedly spent almost a decade in gives way to a vibrant, strange new world for little Jack. The camera takes his perspective and pores over every aspect of the outside realm with the patience and curiosity it takes to place us in his psyche, a child viewing the world in its entirety and true form for the very first time, essentially a second birth, a theme which the film handles marvellously. I must speak about Jacob Tremblay, a Vancouver native who plays Jack and gives the most soul wrenching performance I've ever seen from a child actor. The levels of sheer intuition and innocent truth he infuses in his work at such a young age are just unbelievable, and he should be in the riding for Oscar gold as well. Larson and him have uncanny chemistry, the love shown in the early scenes a blooming Rose of hope that fends off the looming darkness they dwell in, which is tested by the inevitable complications they face upon entering the real world once again. Larson burst onto the scene with 21 Jump Street and Don Jon, fun but inconsequential fluff. Here she shows us that she means business, and wants to tell stories that are important, and show audiences what it means to be human through her work. I look forward to where this extraordinary girl takes us in her next cinematic journey. Joan Allen makes subtly heartbreaking work as Joy's mother, William H. Macy is briefly present as her Dad, Tom McCamus makes compassionate work of her stepdad and like I said, everyone else is superb, right down to the day players. I was crippled by emotion and raw with nerve jangling suspense after this one, exiting the theatre soaring on the high I eternally strive for in my cinematic adventures. The fact that only one theatre in Vancouver is playing this one is an affront to the universe. Get down to Tinseltown and see this one before it's gone. You'll thank me."

His world was the distance from a hut to a skylight. How could he survive when he came out of the trap and saw the real birds, the blue sky, all kinds of people, exposed to the bacteria of the air and the complexity of human nature?\n\nHowever, I never expected that, although Jack began to have trouble fitting in, as a child, he soon learned everything, learned to contact and care for the grandparents he just met, learned to be strong and independent, and made friends of the same age. Instead, the mother collapsed in the face of everything lost and recovered and the pressure of public opinion. Why?\n\nThere is a plot that I think is very well designed. Joy is showing Jack a picture of her with her friends when she was a student, and she says, \"do you know what happened to them?\" Jack says no, Joy says exactly, nothing happened, and then she has a fight with her mother and even blames her for what happened to her. She is dumbstruck by the host's questions on the talk show, and finally fails to commit suicide by taking drugs. This is a very clear expression of her psychological process. Joy was only a girl when she was cheated and imprisoned. From the swing set behind her grandparents' house that she had been telling Jack about, it can be seen that she grew up in a harmonious family environment and was a good girl who was healthy and had no bad habits and was willing to help others. Maybe she had never experienced a real love heartbreak. When a person is suppressed in a few meters square room, she thought only how to escape, and when the real escape, she began to lose the seven years of heartache, is much transformed, parents are not together, that of his friends about also have their own family business, and she is just one of the world's most insignificant a single particle, didn't she, on the earth is still in turn, others are still in the forward, live a life, only oneself, and this world all contact solidification in seven years ago, out of place. There is only one achievement, and the seven years has brought up Jack lived alone with yourself, so when the host asked you have never thought in the Jack was born Old Nick put him in the fire department or hospital to let him have a real childhood, this is the last straw breaks the camel's, she's the only meaning there seven years were rejected, she the meaning of survival and life values must be collapsed. However, he was saved by his son Jack, who cut short his long hair and integrated into the society. However, he still kept the pure heart of being dependent on his mother.\n\nI believe that in the end, the mother and son returned to the room, where many people were in tears. At first, I thought the plot design was a little abrupt. Why should I go back to the place where I was imprisoned? After watching it, I wanted to ask the screenwriter to take my knee. I felt that the last scene cleared away the haze and heartache that the whole movie had brought to the audience. Suddenly, I realized that the film was not about how to escape, but how to make peace with the heavy past and finally move forward with hope. Some people may think the latter part is too much chicken soup, but I think in the treatment of the mother and son relationship, this degree of soft chicken soup I am still very willing to drink it, after all, did not cry to tell my mother to love me again, but is gentle and romantic, directly to the heart.\n\nIf there really is a mother and son in some corner of the world or in some parallel universe, I would like to send my blessing to you, whether in a small room or in a big world, I hope you two can stay together, you and me agianst the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Room\" (2015 release; 117 min.) brings the story of a young lady named Joy, and her son Jack. As the movie opens, Jack wakes up and can't wait to tell Ma that it's his 5th birthday. He goes around the room, exclaiming with joy \"good morning rag, good morning TV, good morning sink!\". It becomes clear very quickly that, despite Jack's innocence and joy, they are actually held captive and Jack has never known anything other than \"Room\", as they call this place. Joy is trying to figure out a way to deceive the man who is holding them captive, so as to escape. TO tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: first, this is directed by Lenny Abrahamson, who just last year brought us the delightfully quirky \"Frank\", and Emma Donoghue, who wrote the book on which this is based, wrote the script. I have not read the book, so I do not know how closely the movie sticks to the book (I'm guessing quite closely, though). Second, as the movie's trailer makes plain, Joy and Jack do end up getting out of \"Room\", and as a result this movie really consists of two separate parts: before and after, and each takes about half of the movie's running time. The \"before\" part is nothing short of extraordinary, as we observe Joy and Jack living in their cramped quarters (which look quite big to Jack). Third, everyone's been talking about the Best Actress Oscar chances for Brie Larson in her role of Joy/Ma, so imagine my surprise when it turns out that yes, she is quite good, but the young boy playing Jack simply steals the movie, period. Jacob Tremblay brings one of the more astonishing and accomplished performances of such a young actor or actress in recent memory. Joan Allen (as Joy's mom) is quite powerful too, but also keep an eye out for William H. Macy's short (less than 19 min.) but impactful role as Joy's dad.\n\n\"Room\" opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had an opportunity to see it. The week night screening where I saw this at was attended surprisingly well for a week night, which is great news. I imagine that \"Room\" will pick up quite a few nominations in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so. \"Room\" is an outstanding movie on so many levels, and I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. \"Room\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

The same old plot rehashed, good vs evil, victim vs oppressor, with the good oh so perfect and the evil eventually getting their cummuppence at the end of the film? If that's what you want, don't watch this film. If you want all action scenes, if you want in depth character analysis, a view into the psyche of a kidnapper, a morality lecture, a commentry of the state of society, the trauma of rape, or just like seeing the bad guy eventually getting killed after the mandatory end of film fight when he rises from the apparent dead before eventually being finished off, but not before some trite final exchange between the hero and villan, then don't watch this film. You'll be disappointed. If that's what you want, there are 1000s of other films you can watch. This film tells the story entirely from the point of view of a 5 year old child. Elements of the story that don't involve the child aren't shown. Issues with the characters that don't affect the child aren't shown, and those that do affect him are only shown in that context. No attempt to explain or analyse why the adults are behaving in the way they do. Lots of unanswered questions that an adult would ask, such as about possible methods of escape, which are not dealt with. Because the film is not from the POV of an adult. That's what most of the critics of this film simply didn't get. It also doesn't follow the usual flow of a film. It doesn't build to a climax at the end, the climax is in the middle. Whether you like or hate this film, at least you won't have seen it before, or most likely anything like it. If you prefer your films to follow traditional plotlines and being told from a traditional angle then don't waste your time. But if you want to see something different, if you want to see a story from a different angle, then you might just love it, as I did."

Than one day shortly after his 5th birthday, he has to come to grasp with the fact that \"Room\" is a very small part of the world.\n\nI thought they handled the situation perfectly, especially Brie Larson as Jack's Ma, Joy. Room was semi narrated by Jack, but this was his mother's story, of how she used Jack to keep her sanity while in the room, and she was still in that room even after she physically was let out.\n\nIt was interesting watching the two in the room living there day to day life and how she explained the limited world they live in. It was suspenseful as Mamma Joy used Jack as part of her plan to break free and it was fascinating watching Joy readjusting to the world and Jack discovering it.\n\nI thought it was a well done picture with some great acting going on that revolves around Brie Larson but gives even small parts like the one William H. Macy had, as a dad who can't deal with what his daughter went though, the kind of subtle development that gets under your skin.\n\nIt walks slowly buy says a lot, and I really like that."

        "review_detailed_main": "We all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.\n\nThe both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.\n\n\"If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.\"\n\nThe movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.\n\nIt was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.\n\n\"When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything.\"\n\nIt was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.\n\nWhen a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half. Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.\n\nThere were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything!\"\n\nIt doesn't feel right to call Lenny Abrahamson's latest film a small one because it is such a rewarding and emotional experience. Yes, it is a low key and small scaled film, but it has such a profound impact on the audience that it is far from being small. The first half of the film takes place in a very confined space, which makes the second half of the movie even more rewarding as the world around these two protagonists expands. Very few times in film has a director captured such an interesting and authentic mother and son dynamic as we find here with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's performances. Larson is guaranteed to win the Oscar for her lead role here and she fully deserves it as this mother who has endured the worst of times, but found a means of surviving through her son. She truly lives a nightmare, but Abrahamson doesn't focus on that as much as he does at making us experience their world through the young son's eyes. He is innocent and has never seen the world outside of the small room in which he unknowingly has been held captive since his birth. His mother has done everything she can to give him a happy and normal life despite the situation. Tremblay delivers an equally impressive performance, and his young age shouldn't have been a factor when it came to voting for the best performances of the year. He was outstanding and held his own in each scene he shared with Larson. The two performances are the main reason why Room has achieved such greatness.\n\nRoom is based on Emma Donoghue's best selling novel about a 5 year old boy who experiences the world in the confined space of a small room. The only person he has direct contact with is his mother. His only contact with the outside world is through a small TV, but his mother has told him that the images are of other universes far from theirs. Jack also knows there is one other person that exists in their world, as some nights a visitor comes into the room from a locked door, but his mom orders him to keep away from him and stay in his wardrobe. Jack's mother has done her best to give him love and nurture, but as his curiosity begins to grow there is only so far she can go with her story. What will happen when young Jack realizes that there is actually more to the world than the small room in which they have been confined in? What follows is a deeply emotional and profound thriller that shook me to my core.\n\nLenny Abrahamson is known for delivering original and unconventional stories. Previously to Room he had directed Michael Fassbender in Frank, a film in which the main protagonist wore a giant paper-mache mask throughout the story. Room however goes a step further delivering a thriller in a very unconventional way as we get to experience the harrowing events through the innocence of a five year old boy and the depths his mother goes through to give him a normal life. From the very opening scene we know there is nothing normal about their lifestyle, but at the same time the film avoids the typical atmosphere we are used to seeing in crime related films. I don't want to say too much about Room because the less you know about it the better, but the second half delivers even more thrills and engages the audience with even more to ponder about. Finding freedom is only have of the battle, and most of the time these films fail to focus on it, but Room manages to deliver on both ends. This is an effective and powerful film and I'm finding it incredibly hard to put into words how much it affected me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Room deserves to receive Best Picture this year. Hands down Room deserves to win. Forget The Revenant, which is an absurdly violent study in male macho-masculinity with only one woman character for a split second who is being raped.\n\nRoom is a profoundly deep film told from the perspective of both a young woman and her child born unto her in captivity via being a hostage sex slave. The film tells much of the story from the eyes of an innocent 5 year old who knows only this Room and his Ma. The young woman does an amazing job holding it together to take care of her young child. It is a story of human survival, motherly love and the ultimate strength and goodness of (most) people.\n\nThere are so many layers to this movie. I felt for everyone. The story of the young woman (Brie Larson) is rather downplayed. There was so much more to tell about her - how did she endure the nightly (or near nightly rapes), how did she give birth by herself in this Room, how did she manage on so many levels? I also felt for her parents, it would be hard to accept this child, the child born from rape and forced impregnation. She was a 17 year old, a little girl, the last time her parents saw her, now she is a woman with a child born from these circumstances.\n\nThe perspective of the child is fascinating. Never having seen \"the world.\" Knowing only his Ma. So innocent.\n\nThis movie is disturbing and haunting. I left the theater thinking about it off and on for the next several days. Thinking through all the complexity of what she (Ma / Brie Larson) went through and her parents and all sorts of things.\n\nSomehow, for such a horrific subject, the film manages to bring out the positive in how hard a woman can fight for survival, how strong she can be to take care of her child. It is an amazing film. It's heavy and heartbreaking but it's also beautiful.\n\nIt deserves all the awards!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Today's movie shares a big trait with True Grit that was debated when the awards season came out; with who the main character was. True Grit's marketing pushed that Jeff Bridges was the main actor of the movie even though the story really shows that Haliee Steinfeld was the focus. Once the awards season came, she was given plenty of supporting actress accolades even though most people felt that she was more in the reigns of best actress. Room will probably have this same issue with one of it's actors.\n\nI think the reason the studios tend to put great child performers into separate categories away from the big A-listers that are nominated for other movies because their afraid that they either won't have a chance at winning or if they do win, no one would take the award seriously. Children need to be taken seriously.\n\nToday's movie Room may be a mother/son bonding story, but it's really about the psychology that goes through their minds when after years of being together, are going on a journey that separates them physically and emotionally. It's about two people growing up despite being different generations as Room portrays.\n\nJoy Newsome (played by Brie Larson) is a young woman that has been living in a shed converted into a small home for the past seven years by her kidnapper she calls \"Old Nick\" (played by Sean Bridgers). In the time since, she gave birth to a child (fathered by Old Nick) that she named Jack. In the years growing up there, Joy tried as hard as she could to be a good mother and protect Jack from the situation and raise him like any other child. Now turning five, Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay) only sees the Room they live in as the world and that anything outside is \"outer space\".\n\nJoy finds out that \"Old Nick\" has lost his job and is low on money, which will mean fewer resources for food and heat. It is now that she tells Jack about the outside world (the only thing they had for information or entertainment was television that was mostly tuned onto Dora the Explorer for Jack) and that they need to get out. She knows that the only way out is if \"Old Nick\" realizes that Jack has to get out due to illness. The first half of the movie is planning on the escape and the second half is about what happens after wood.\n\nI can barley say anything about Room as most of the movie contains major spoilers. All I can say is that even though this is a thriller, I count this as a coming of age story. A really good one as well considering that we have both a young woman and a little boy who know little about the world around them. Brie Larson does phenomenal as Joy who has the hard task of both remaining forever frightened of \"Old Nick\" and being a proper mother.\n\nSpeaking of which, Jacob Tremblay may be the frontrunner for most supporting actor awards as his performance is better then a lot of child actors. How they got a kid this young to pull off the necessary emotions that few adult can properly show off? I don't know, but this is defiantly his movie. Is perception on the world and the adults around him remind us why we were frightened by the rest of the world as children. When our parents aren't around, we might as well be on an alien planet, stepping around strange sounds and sights. This child made me realize how one can see the world differently at a different age.\n\nI'll give this ten imaginary dogs out of ten. Room is an emotional, but rewarding coming of age story that may be hard to sit through the first half. But once the second half starts, you'll realize how strong bonds are between parents and children. You'll realize that in order to move one, part of your old self has to go away. Room is one of the 2015's best."

        "review_detailed_main": "Room opens on Jack's world on his 5th birthday. To him, the universe is as expansive as the four walls he knows. Jack's mother known simply as Ma (Brie Larson) is driven by one mission in her life, to shield him and protect him from the true and harsh realities of their life in spite of the harrowing circumstances.\n\nI first heard about the book Room through a friend. She told me the concept and I was immediately intrigued and quickly added it to my Need to Read pile. But it had the reverse effect when I heard there was going to be a film adaptation. I was concerned how the distinct style and voice would transfer over. The wisest decision filmmakers and A24 made was to have the book's author Emma Donoghue also write the screenplay for her bestselling novel. Her faithfulness to the original source is unmatched and her expertise in expanding upon the literature for film should be a basis for all future movie adaptations of novels.\n\nFor those unaware of the subject matter, Room is about a young woman being held by her kidnapper. She has been there for some time, long enough to have a five year old son named Jack. She creates a wondrous life for him in the confines of that 10\u00d710 room in an effort to protect him from the horrors of their situation so may grow to be a happy child. What we the audience see is this life and the effect Jack's curiosity has on Ma, spurring a desire to escape to the outside.\n\nThe beauty of Room lies in its unique perspective and distinct mechanism through which it chooses to tell the story of its two characters, through the eyes and mind of a five year old child. In that regard, it is awe inducing. In doing that, a film about several different simultaneous traumas is bearable when in reality it should be like living in a raw nerve. And still, the harrowing emotions these characters go through is palpable, going through the screen straight through your soul. There is a constant tension and quiet terror to Room, an anxiety that leaves you restless, wriggling in your seat as you desire to help the characters. I was left nauseous, an amazing feat given how restrained the film is and how perilous it may have been in someone else's hands other than Lenny Abrahamson. He showcases the two sides of this story, inside and outside Room, with balanced finesse and an artist's eye and accomplishes a film that is both tender and terrifying without being far-fetched or jarring.\n\nYou really can't talk about Room without talking about its two stars: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Both of whom give outstanding performances with the former perhaps having the luck of earning the role of her career. With as many complex layers to the film as it has, it rarely resorts to telling and virtually relies entirely on the actors' performances and the audiences' abilities to observe minute details. The character of Ma is strong, vulnerable, traumatized, scared, desperate, hopeful, and angry, along with scores of other gentler emotions and Larson does it with a quiet grace and inherent awareness of her craft. Her commitment to the character is so honest that there is no Brie Larson.\n\nYou may not be ready for the intense subject matter of Room, and that is okay, but we implore you to give it a chance. Room is one of those films that will touch your soul and feel for your fellow man.\n\nPlease check out the site for Archon Cinema Reviews for full reviews of all the awards season contenders!"

        "review_detailed_main": "A Canada-Irish co-production from Irish director Lenny Abrahamson, the follow-up of his kooky psychodrama FRANK (2014). It wins Brie Larson a coveted Oscar for BEST LEADING ACTRESS, but the real backbone of this bracing indie drama is its 9-year-old child genius Jacob Tremblay.\n\nJoy (Larson), is captured by a man she calls Old Nick (Bridgers) 7 years ago, as his sex slave, she is locked inside a room with only a skylight above, and she gives birth to a son named Jack (Tremblay). Now Jack is five years old, he has never been outside the room, and Joy hatches a daring escape plan which puts Jack at the mercy of his luck, but it seems to be their only chance to get out of the living hell.\n\nThe first hour (before Joy's plan) is entirely shot inside the room, a small shed, Abrahamson has done a phenomenal job to circumvent the claustrophobic setting and elicited an exceptional two- hander between Larson and Tremblay, especially the latter, who is born under such a unique situation, which makes his view of life worlds apart from our common sense and himself a perfect focus point for viewers to scrutinise under the lens of the dramatic sea change soon he is going to experience. Joy's protective strategy works well for a toddler in this extremely unhealthy growing environment (he has to submerge into imagination for companionship, believes everything shown on TV is not real, and the room is their whole world), but when she needs him to assist her in the plan to escape, she must shatter the entire fabrication and tell him what is the real world, here, the clash reaches its boiling point, again, Tremblay is such a godsend to watch, accurately expresses Jack's confusion, denial, fear and maturity from writer Emma Donoghue's taut but rational script.\n\nThe next hour is less engaging, when Joy and Jack reunite in the outside world, Jack meets his grandmother Nancy (Allen, a fresh welcome to high-quality cinema since she is so overdue for recognition) and grandfather Robert (Macy, a small cameo, but his reunion with Allen as a couple hits the nostalgic sweet spot) for the first time, although they have separated since the missing of Joy, the cognitive knowledge of the real world is a lengthy and time-consuming progress for Jack, but thankfully he has no sequelae of the captivity and it turns out fine for him. It is Joy, who is struggling with depression, anger and guilt, collapses in the real world, Jack becomes her sole strength to overcome her psychological hurdles and there is a brand new life awaits them.\n\nROOM has an all-approaching, soul-touching story at its kernel, burnished with a brilliant cast (the film is unswervingly taking the stance from Jack's viewpoint, which does make Larson's Oscar- winning showcase less reverberating than in SHORT TERM 12, 2013, although Larson's tenacity and mastery of emotions are peerless), and a humble diegetic approach through a child's eye, it adamantly gives rise to a heartfelt sensation without sensationalising its characterisation, a singular accomplish under the belt of Abrahamson and the sterling teamwork."

There are so many plot holes like that. The movie also lingers on contemplative shots far too often and for too long. It just artificially inflates the movie by pretending like things are more impactful than they actually are. The kids high-pitched voice gets annoying too. The movie is decent, but lacks any kind of substance. It's just a story told in a slow, idling manner. After which, you just think \"Alright, well, that wasn't much of anything\".

        "review_detailed_main": "It says a lot about the quiet yet assured power of Room that despite the fact half of Lenny Abrahamson's film takes place in the titular and small \"room\" or really prison that Brie Larsons Ma and her son Jack played by impressive newcomer Jacob Tremblay are kept in, scenes in the film constantly engage the viewer through terrific performances, a taught and sharp script by Emma Donaghue (who here adapts her own book) and there's an emotional resonance that will catch many viewers off guard.\n\nRoom is not by any means of the word an easy sell or even a typical cinematic piece of entertainment but Abrahamson who showed promise with the sporadically brilliant Michael Fassbender starrer Frank has a clear affiliation for the tricky material that Donaghue created.\n\nFocusing on telling the dark and in more ways than one horrific story through the eyes of Tremblay's innocent and impressionable Jack, who never once has set foot outside the thin yet impenetrable walls of his world that he and his mum inhabit, Abrahamson finds himself directing many of Room's proceedings as though they were being seen through the eyes of a 5 year old child just as Jack is. Utilising a sparring yet effective voice over from the young boy that tells us all we need to know about how he sees the life he lives and constructing impressive visuals even in the films tight surrounds, this is Abrahamson's real calling card after two commendable early efforts and the cast also join Abrahamson in an reaching another level of success.\n\nShe may have just recently won a surprise Golden Globe for her committed and believe able turn as a loving mother but Brie Larson has been carving out a noteworthy collection of films over the last few years so the true breakout of Room is young Tremblay.\n\nTremblay delivers a deep and beyond his young years turn as Jack and it's thanks to this child actors success that Room becomes the film that's been resonating with audiences the world over. While Larson will be billed as the star here it is Tremblay that carries the film through its sometimes murky middle half and whenever he and Larson share the screen, Room is an often faultless exercise in dramatic filmmaking. It's a stunning turn and one that will likely seeing the young performer be an in demand presence in the years to come.\n\nWhile it arguably loses some head of steam after a breathtaking opening half in its exploration of the opportunities that lay outside the prison walls, Room is a unique and emotionally strong tale of the bond mothers and sons share and in a strange yet touching manner, a tale of what it means to be alive in this great big beautiful world we call home.\n\n4 remote control cars out of 5"

        "review_detailed_main": "When the four main components that make a movie better than average are brought together the result can be striking. First, is the importance of a good script with a strong story that many should be able to relate to & when this essential element has its basis in fact, it's already well ahead. Emma Donoghue's script supplies all this. Follow with a director who has a personal passion to bring this particular story to life & Irish born (of Eastern Jewish parentage) Lenny Abrahamson was the right choice.\n\nIf Performers have a large role in convincing us to care and feel for the subjects they play - this film certainly has those! Next comes someone to create images that will draw us into each situation and with Award nominee Cinematographer Danny Cohen ('The Kings Speech') this is almost perfectly achieved. I say almost, as the 11 x 11ft set he was given to capture a large degree of his shots in would have been extremely limiting - this no doubt created obstacles i'm sure everyone would have preferred to do without (referring to a couple of clumsy but minor, hand help shots). A sympathetic producer who wants the best result caps a good production off.\n\nStephen Rennick's sensitive Music Score and carefully detailed Editing lifts this work even higher. Multi-talented Brie Larson certainly earned her well deserved Oscar as 'Ma', with young Jacob Tremblay surprisingly impressive as son Jack. All cast members work hard to make this harrowing film unfold in a naturalistic manner. When generally mindless 'action' movies win massive amounts of Awards and spend obscene amounts of money achieving this \u2013 it's refreshing when a life affirming gem like 'Room' comes along to add balance to the industry. With the task of pleasing everybody being just about impossible - some won't be able to relate to 'Room's' highly claustrophobic, personal situations so, the hard and fast action aficionados won't understand the accolades. Others will be astounded and may even come back for a second visit.\n\nIf being technical, I'm perhaps a little perplexed as how the 'garden shed' with its skylight kept the screams out of neighbor's ear range and the captors in for so long but, perhaps this demented captor had rebuilt the internals with heavily padded materials - I understand the original situation this story is based on took place in a European cellar (not sure why this was altered). Maybe the captor was also overly naive in not checking the body in the carpet (?). Other than these plot details , 'Room' is not to be missed by appreciators of discerning films."

Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical-- they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.\n\nThe star of the film is Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson does a credible turn as Ma and the 'outsiders' \u2013 Ma's parents Joan Allen, William H. Macy and her kidnapper Sean Bridges \u2013 carry their weight. The film is unnecessarily long and that need for editing diminishes the extraordinary impact of Jack as he discovers the real world. If young Canadian actor Jacob Tremblay secures the right agent he could become a very important actor in the future. The story concept is excellent and carries many messages to which we should all pay heed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Room (2015) : Brief Review -\n\nInnocent perception of a Child somehow brings conviction in this inconvenient and Harrowing Film. Room is about a child and his mother who were locked in a Room, they manage to get out but finds it tough to conform with the real World outside the Room. Let's move to the plus points, the major factor and the most convenient thing about this film is the Child Jack. His innocence, his perception about the world inside the room and the outside world makes a clean and coherent sense. Imagine yourself as a 5 years old kid who hasn't got out of a Room since birth, how would you react when you see the Real world? How would you adjust your imagination about the thing called 'The World'? How would you survive? This all makes it very intelligent scenerio and almost nobody can find any contradictions in this part at least. The second best thing about the film is partition of the narrative in two parts, one inside the Room and other one about outside the room. Jacob Trembley and Brie Larson gave beautiful and natural performances. Almost 90% screentime is focused on them so they got every variety to try. Director Lenny Abrahamson has definitely made a very good film and his direction is one of the major reason behind it. I liked the way he used background score and camera while showing the child's perspective. Especially when he sees the outside for the first time, the camera shoots from inside the rolled mattress and trees pass by. Now coming to the minuses, there are many inconvenient things about the story in the first half. In the second half, it tries to explore depression for no valid reason. I mean the girl has just got out, she must be happy and curious about Future but instead she's drown in the memories of the horrible past. The depressing thoery doesn't work entirely hence film loses the main motive. Overall, A Very Film but IMDb Top 250 seems unmeritable.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

Room deserves totally to win an Oscar, even more than one. Room is a movie that I will remember for a long time, while the other one I already completely forgot about it. The story is very poignant, a rollercoaster of emotions, from hatred to hopeful to sad. I almost never cry with movies but here I have to admit I had a couple hard times containing my tears. Brie Larson deserves her Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, there's no doubt about that, but the young Jacob Tremblay was to me the big star of this movie. Even at such young age he deserved an Oscar for his performance. What a powerful piece of acting that was. For once I was blown away by an Oscar winning movie. To me it was just the movie of that year and it should have won the big prize. A movie that I for sure will watch again in the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "Adapted by Emma Donoghue from her own novel, this Fritzl-esque tale of brutal long-term abuse may come across as the easier, Hollywoodised alternative to Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but that description misses the point. Room goes beyond the horror of physical incarceration and explores arguably the more challenging issue of the psychological incarceration that follows. It's easy for cinema to show suffering; harder to portray recovery, especially the stuttering kind.\n\nJoy (Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) are imprisoned in a tiny room by an abuser known only as \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers). Jack hides in the closet when Old Nick visits Joy every night. During the day, Joy teaches Jack about the world outside Room (note the lack of definite article). There's wonderful humour and pathos in her struggles to explain reality and fantasy via images on a fuzzy old CRT TV. But for all her efforts, Joy comes to the conclusion that she must help Jack escape and see the world for himself.\n\nI'll plant a minor spoiler alert here.\n\nWe have a movie of two halves. The first half takes place entirely in Room. The second follows the escape of Joy and Jack, and their efforts to recover in the brightness and busyness of the wider world. There's no trial for Old Nick. This is not a movie about the all-healing power of justice. It's about a mother and son adjusting to long-term trauma, and how it affects their relationships with the (grand)parents who've been living in their own dreadful dark for the past seven years.\n\nIt may be surprising to hear that this comes from Lenny Abrahamson, who last brought us the relatively slight and irreverent Frank. While that movie was distinguished by its irony, the earnestness in Room is almost suffocating. It's not always subtle, proudly wearing its intention to devastate, making it not so much a weepie as a complete and utter bawlie, expertly tailored to tug the heartstrings. In some scenes this can be a curse but overall it's a blessing. It's no small feat to reduce an entire auditorium to a blubbering mess.\n\nAs Joy's mother, shattered by her relief, Joan Allen almost steals the show with an amazingly detailed performance. In the middle is Larson, playing Joy as powerful and principled, carrying her hidden brokenness out into the real world. But the movie belongs to Tremblay. Abrahamson has drawn an astonishing performance from the youngster. For a start, the kid really acts like a kid \u2013 it's not one of those creepily precocious manchild performances that American cinema sometimes conjures. Through Jack there's a sense of genuine wonder at the world, whether it's within the confines of a sound-proofed shed, or outside where the sky goes on forever. The youngest Best Actor in Oscar history up to this point was almost 30. Just saying.\n\nI can't say I was on board with every filmmaking decision. Stephen Rennicks' soaring, Johann Johannson-style music is frequently grating, seeming to exist to make us the audience feel all fuzzy rather than having any real relationship with the narrative. And there are certain scenes which don't quite ring true. For example, the primetime TV interview \u2013 an exercise in awkwardness \u2013 is unconvincingly thoughtless. I mean, as if we need any more help sympathising with Joy. Perhaps US TV journalism really is that insensitive, but it felt like low-hanging fruit to me.\n\nThere are no answers to the evil of Old Nick, nor for the suffering of those he's abused. But uncertainty and doubt are not the same as hopelessness. I felt manipulated \u2013 but that's what good movies do. In its soul-scouring search for truth, inevitably the film dips into sentimentality. But let's applaud Room for bringing to a broad audience an extremely difficult subject and making it as accessible as it can possibly be."

        "review_detailed_main": "Emma Donoghue's Room (2010) is sublime alchemy, switching from heart wrenching horror to endearing tenderness with an air of innocence permeating throughout. It is a book that is so profoundly good that immediately when I was done I realized that even though the world is still the same everything feels different; I have changed. Narratives like this don't come very often for me. I love the book so much that I started and maintained a book thread in an internet forum (http://www.xtremeplace.com/yabbse/index.php? topic=99456.0). In prose, the harrowing subject matter is pushed to the background by using a very clever narrative device - the entire story is told from the perspective of a five- year-old child. We become privy to his thoughts, his emotions and his voice of innocence. I had my doubts whether this narrative stance could be replicated on film without losing its emotional impact. From the get-go I realized my fears are totally unfounded. Lenny Abrahamson has directed Emma Donoghue's adapted screenplay magnificently and it is buoyed by two stellar performances by Brie Larson and newcomer, Jacob Tremblay.\n\nHow the film manages to avoid all the usual trappings of exploitation and emotionally manipulativeness is a case of absolute marvel. Room deftly dances around these big holes of hysterics and histrionics, but yet still manages to make the horrendous situations feel authentic and heart-hitting. From top to bottom the cast shines, especially with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson has turned in a career defining performance and I think she is the one to beat at the Oscars. Such humanity and honesty, and through her character arc we are graced with what a mother would do for a child. She essentially creates a cocoon to nurture her child and to protect him from the cruel reality. Newcomer Jacob Tremblay is also phenomenal and he carried the film's weight on his little shoulders. He would of course say it is his long hair that gave him \"strong\". This is not a dutiful and obedient boy that does everything his Ma says. They do quarrel and have shout-fests but their diamond-hard bond is the beating heart of the story.\n\nI do feel the movie is largely spoiler free but I don't think I should say more on what happens after their escape from Room. The second half is essentially their journey back into the world and I am thankful that the movie doesn't whitewash everything into a stroll towards a golden sunset.\n\nJust like reading the book, I came out of the cinema feeling everything has changed, and I am grateful for the story of an unconquerable love between a mother and her child in harrowing circumstances. This is the first great film I have seen this year and I feel it is a profound cinematic and emotional experience to have lived in Room for two hours. Do yourself a favor by checking in at the earliest convenience."

This could be seen as properly measured, of course, and preferable to most viewers, but I'd expect a more incisive and explorative recount, with all the squalor and darkness such abuse and rehabilitation would entail, before the opening to a new life. One also wonders about the missed chances of making enough noise to be noticed, and I spotted an obvious stylistic error in the camera vehicle's shadow as it follows the captor's truck.

I confess I was a tear-stained rag at the end.\n\nThe presence of Joan Allen and William H. Macy in supporting roles is a testament to the quality of a project they clearly felt they wanted to be part of. Sean Bridgers, Tom McCamus and Amanda Brugel also make noteworthy contributions.\n\nOn the basis of this, and of that excellent, eccentric movie FRANK, it's easy to see that Lenny Abrahamson is a superb director of actors, with an interest in and an understanding of the complexity of people's relationships."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a perfect example of a film that sold me just by its premise: A boy who has been kept in one room his entire life by his mother, begins to wonder what the limits of the world beyond the walls of the enclosed area are. It's also a film that if you're planning on going to see, you shouldn't watch any of the trailers or even read the IMDb synopsis. Just go out and see one of the best films of the year.\n\nBrie Larson, who impresses more and more each film she appears in, plays Joy, mother of Jack. Larson hides the depths of her character for a good portion of the film, which makes the emotional moments all the more powerful later on. The story of a mother and son trying to escape this 'room' and their whole emotional journey is what drives Room to greatness. The film itself has a unique structure in that it seems the film could have ended about 45 minutes before it did, but yet it keeps going. It's not that that time is wasted, but I think the flow and rhythm of the movie isn't always there. Which is why the emotional moments midway through are what stick out to me most.\n\nJacob Tremblay absolutely kills it as Jack. At 5 years old and an extremely demanding role, it's hard not to think he deserves some awards attention as well. He pulls off every emotion that is called of him and his chemistry with Brie Larson couldn't be better. The supporting cast is really good as well, but that can get into spoiler territory so I'll stick with the two leads. I also should mention Lenny Abrahamson's directing. I loved the way he chose to unveil why exactly Jack and his mother are stuck in this room and the revelations that follow.\n\nRoom as a whole isn't always as smooth as it wants to be, but the performances are among the years best, and I think the story will take you on an unexpected emotional roller coaster.\n\n+Larson\n\n+Tremblay's performance is an anomaly\n\n+Emotional journey\n\n+Meticulous directing\n\n-Second half doesn't live up to the first\n\n8.7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Room\" starts in the middle of a horrifying tale of abduction with little back story and little history. And that works wonder. It places us right in the middle of the claustrophobia of the two main characters, Joy and her son Jack. The first third of the film made me almost as uncomfortable as I was during the whole masterpiece film, \"The Act of Killing.\"\n\nThere are so many times when this film could have gone awry, sappy and melodramatic. In fact, the sappiest thing about the film was the music, being far too uplifting and loud for the themes in the movie.\n\nThe framing of each shot in the first-third of the movie augments the feeling of being trapped. The shots are as beautiful as they are terrifying.\n\nThe acting of the two main characters is spot on, especially the five-year-old boy Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson plays the complicated role of Joy, the mother, who goes through untold agony. We aren't told what happens in detail; we see it on her face, in her body.\n\nThere were so many times this film could have gone for cheap sentimentality; they could have gone for the easy reconciliation and happy ending, and it didn't. Put one in the win column for small, well writing, well directed and well acted cinema that doesn't involve stunts or explosions.\n\nRating: Pay Full Price\n\n\"Room\" is excellent. While it didn't play for cheap emotion and the issues it addresses are horrifying, it could have used more detail regarding the aftermath of events for the mother. The son's issues were dealt with well if not completely. The framing of the shots? Fantastic! The music? Terrible.\n\nBrie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscars nominations.\n\nPeace,\n\nTex Shelters"

        "review_detailed_main": "I can appreciate all the critical love for Room, even if I can't agree with it.\n\nWhat I can subscribe to, is that the film is anchored by two wonderful central performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.\n\nAnd though I haven't read Emily Donoghue's adapted novel, I applaud director Lenny Abrahamson's reported decision to upgrade Ma's role for the screen version. For me, it's the complex character of Ma/Joy that holds major interest, rather than 5 year old Jack, through whose perspective we view much of the action. We are told very early on in the second of two clearly defined halves of Room, that young Jacob is resilient and very likely to shake off the effects of 5 years of confinement with his mother. We (at least me anyway) don't need huge amounts of onscreen time devoted to watching Jack atune to his new environment. It's here the film really falls down, with a now plodding pace, as Ma disappears from the screen for very large tracts of time.\n\nOf far more importance and interest was exploring the more edgy personality of Ma and the vast challenges, which are really only paid lip service, on her repatriation from capture. A bit of a spat with her mum and a testy TV interview and all of a sudden Joy disappears for way too much of the second half, when things were just starting to get interesting.\n\nWithout turning Room into a police procedural, I think the movie could have spent a little more time following up the arrest (and likely conviction) of Old Nick. His character generates much of the suspense and he goes virtually unreferenced in the film's second half. In fact the only indirect link is when Ma and Jack return to the room with the police at the end of the film. It looks so ramshackle and flimsy, that even I found myself wondering how Joy had not really managed to create any other escape attempts. It just didn't have the appearance of a virtual escape-proof cell.\n\nRoom is an unconventional and very professionally produced vehicle about a none too uncommon issue which has affected many women and children over the years. But for me any thriller/suspense elements disappeared when characters such as Ma and Old Nick were off screen, so as to allow an unfettered, somewhat repetitive look at Jack, adjusting to his brave, new world."

A roller coaster ride of emotions, a story absolutely riddled with thought-provoking ideas that eventually reflect the deepest points of human empathy and connection\n\nAs a viewer, you can't help but feel sorry for these two characters. I'm not sure if the story is based on an actual event (there's a decent chance it is), but I can't imagine myself ever being in that position.\n\nI'd go insane if I had to spend seven years held captive with no contact with outside civilizations, let alone with very few necessities to survive on. Even thinking about it makes me shiver and doubt my sanity, and I am not even claustrophobic. Consider what it would do to people who have a fear of enclosed spaces; they would almost certainly suffocate.\n\nRegardless, it is an incredible movie that conveys what freedom means to some individuals. We all have a tendency to take our freedoms and the ability to make our own choices for granted; we very seldom recognise the true worth of independence and free will, and I hope this film alters our preconceptions. I hope it fosters a fresh perspective."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't really have any big expectations when going into 'Room' - I initially thought it looked like one of those Oscar bait titles that tries way too hard to be emotionally powerful and becomes an overdone melodrama. However, after seeing a few scenes and realising that it's directed by Lenny Abrahamson (previously having directed the quirky masterpiece known as 'Frank') it intrigued me, and started to look like a lot more than just typical Oscar bait... and thankfully, it was. This is one of those beautiful films that manages to capture the strength of love and the importance of family, as well as reminding us that the less we have, the more we appreciate.\n\n'Room' tells the story of a devoted mother's relationship with her five-year-old son, Jack, who has been living in an enclosed 'room' ever since he was born. This is essentially the boy's whole world for the first five years of his life, which immediately establishes the mother as a strong and loving character with the determination to bring up her son properly, providing him with happiness and creativity despite their harsh living conditions. Abrahamson often incorporates tight framing and close-up shots here in order to signify how restricted these characters are in a physical sense, yet how open they are emotionally - making for some genuinely heartfelt interactions. This is where the film succeeds, seeing a realistic relationship between a loving mother and her young son is truly heart-warming, especially if you take their limited surroundings into consideration. Even when the tone switches and tension is built up, realism is still maintained, the characters feel just as engaging, and the overall atmosphere is handled pretty well throughout.\n\nUnfortunately, despite how well these interactions work, the focus always leans towards the character of Jack and his perspective of the world, with segments featuring narration from the little boy himself as he adjusts and learns about the real world for the first time. This basically provides us with the typical portrayal of children in films like this - innocent, naive and somewhat cute... and although there isn't anything wrong with the execution of this, it's nowhere near as captivating as the actual relationship between the mother and the son. After a while, the film starts to slightly lose focus in general, by including some drama which felt somewhat forced and unnecessary. However, these are just minor flaws in the grand scheme of things.\n\nIn terms of cinematography, the film seems to switch between Dogme 95 style filming (handheld/steadicam) and standard static shots, which feels quite inconsistent in terms of style, but works pretty well regarding the atmosphere being conveyed. When it comes to acting, everyone pulled off a magnificent job; Brie Larson winning an Oscar for this role was well-deserved, and although I'm not really a fan of child actors (they can either be great or just really cringe-worthy), I thought Jacob Tremblay was pretty fantastic in his role. All in all, this is a heart-warming story with some phenomenal performances and beautiful sequences that will undoubtedly tug at your heartstrings, which is why I'm giving this film a very strong 8,4/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although less commercially driven, \"Room\" is to 2015 as \"Gone Girl\" was to 2014: An acclaimed film based on an acclaimed book adapted for the screen by the author that takes the viewer into deep, psychologically troubling places. Obviously, \"Gone Girl\" is a mystery thriller with a creepy darkness to it, while \"Room\" is more of a trauma study, but both stories also center on fictional characters at the center of a huge media story.\n\nJack (Jacob Tremblay) lives in 'Room' with his Ma (Brie Larson). 'Room' is all Jack has ever known, but after his fifth birthday, his mom decides to try explaining to him the truth \u2014 there is a world outside of 'Room' and they need to get out.\n\nWriter Emma Donoghue gives us this story through Jack's eyes as much as possible, and director Lenny Abrahamson (\"Frank\") does an excellent job flowing back and forth between Jack's idealistic view of 'Room' and the dark, terrifying real-world circumstances of it, and he continues this balance of perspectives in the film's very different post-'Room' second half.\n\nThat's where Larson comes in in a very complicated role, because there's a tangible separation between the viewer and Ma, the adult who has endured this trauma. In most cases, she would be the easier character to relate to, but this is Jack's story. Larson has to communicate an absolute roller coaster of emotions without the film focusing a ton of attention on her. She succeeds in being easy to relate to despite our lack of knowledge and insight into her character, outside of the fact that she's undergone an unfathomable trauma.\n\nTremblay doesn't give one of those child performances for the ages, but his job as Jack is to evoke the child within all of us because he's a child narrator/main character in a story for adults. He acts with incredible authenticity, creating a connection with the audience so effortlessly.\n\nCreating a connection that puts you in the shoes of the characters is far and away what \"Room\" does best. From the performances to the two-act story structure, Abrahamson works hard to envelop you, to provide a sense of claustrophobia, and then rip it all away, leaving you with a mixture of mental and emotional poignancy. Suddenly you start looking at characters and situations with a refreshed emotional perspective.\n\nThis effect compensates a bit for the lack of an especially compelling narrative in the second act (although one sequence in the film is absolutely heart-stopping). Eventually, plot sort of gives way to study and observation as we are left to sift through the emotional aftermath and watch these characters cope.\n\n\"Room\" is in the very least a showcase of several emerging talents in front of and behind the camera, all of whom have big careers ahead of them. There's a lot of great talent making great choices in this film, and though lots of other independent films are equally worthy of acclaim, it's nice to see something like \"Room\" get some major recognition.\n\n~Steven C\n\nThanks for reading!

For me, the best part of the movie was the last 15 minutes - they were the most realistic. And the final narration by the young lad was well written - but a five year old wouldn't be that eloquent. The first half of the story based in the room didn't really work well in my estimation.\n\nDespite that, all the major players did a fine job, although I wouldn't say Oscar worthy. I wouldn't recommend people to go the movie theater to see this one - you can wait till it comes round on streaming or a movie channel - or Red Box."

        "review_detailed_main": "Saddest movie you will see this year. And I'm not talking tear-and- tissue sad, I'm talking bury-a-hole-and-crawl-into-it sad. Beyond words, but let's give it a try.\n\nRoom?\n\nJoy Newsome (Brie Larson) was kidnapped when she was seventeen years old and locked up in a shed, left completely at the mercy of her kidnapper. Two years later she bears a son, called Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Not being able to leave 'Room', as she calls it from then on, Joy decides to raise him in that tiny enclosed space, as if it were the only place in the world. This is the devastating story of a mother and her son; who, for five years, literally only have each other. And how they're able to continue their life after that.\n\nJack's story\n\nI can't even make a joke about this. This might very well be one of the most uncomfortable movies I have ever seen. Especially during the first half; I was constantly cringing and my heart was racing. Which is weird because there is nothing explicit to cringe at nor is there a lot of suspense to get nervous about. Everything about this film excels at telling a story but without showing it. It's something you have to see for yourself because however difficult it is to watch, it is also extremely compelling. The way Jack narrates their lives as a story, talks about items in Room as persons and how they spend their time everyday. But especially how Joy creates a world, within a room, for Jack to grow up in; out of reach for 'Old Nick', as they call him.\n\nThere is this one scene where all you see is five-year-old Jack, hidden in the wardrobe, listening to the creaking of the bed and just counting. But you know what is happening and the filmmakers even make it look like it's an everyday routine. It's Room's strongest feat, an uneasiness that creeps in and stays for the rest of the film.\n\nOf course all of this would amount to nothing without a stellar cast. Brie Larson as Joy Newsome is nothing short of excellent; in between her boundless love and dedication towards Jack, she shows a constant air of frustration, dread and desperation. The film's creators are brutally honest about this too; she's not a saint, she's a mom.\n\nThe real revelation however was Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Working with child actors is never easy and that goes double for a role like this, but this kid gets it. You don't just feel sorry for him, you feel with him. To the point that Tremblay's character almost feels familiar. Which might sound effed up, considering the situation, but everyone has their 'Room'.\n\nConclusion\n\nSeemingly effortless, Room will touch you and Room will hurt you. Director Lenny Abrahamson made a brilliant piece of cinema that is not easy to watch and even harder to forget.\n\nHow to watch? -surrounded by your loved ones, on any screen Score: 8/10\n\nFor more reviews go to www.blaudruk.org"

        "review_detailed_main": "We all know how the Academy continually gives out awards and award nominations to the wrong movies, while snubbing movies that are superior in every other way. HOWEVER, the Academy really dropped the ball here.\n\nI am a huge movie buff and will pretty much watch anything even if the premise doesn't have mass appeal. This one clearly has less mass appeal, but the critical acclaim drew me in and wasted 1 hour and 20 minutes of my life (I couldn't watch the last 40 minutes and after reading the plot summary on Wikipedia, I was relieved/upset to find out I didn't miss anything.)\n\nThe character development flat out sucks. I'm all for movies with a slightly ambiguous nature, but you gotta satisfy the viewers somehow by letting them know what's going on and having the movie make sense. Brie Larson is decent in the main role, but her character isn't really explored and there isn't enough depth to her character. Jack (don't know the actor's name) is a basic 5-year old and I've heard a better child-centric voice narration from a Disney movie.\n\nThe only reason I gave it a 5 and not something lower is because there are a few aspects of the film I liked. *SPOILER ALERT* The scene where they finally escape from the room is engaging, but after that the film drags on as the people who made this film don't have any knack for quality storytelling. *END SPOILER ALERT*\n\nDon't waste your time on this movie as it doesn't do justice to a very disturbing subject matter and only leaves you asking one question: Why did I waste 2 hours of my life? Congrats Academy for messing up again. It just really sickens me that great films like Love & Mercy, Straight Outta Compton, Sicario, and The End of the Tour get not nearly the acclaim they deserve by the Academy (Sicario and Straight Outta Compton deserve more nominations) or fail to be recognized by the Academy at all (Love & Mercy, The End of the Tour). The Academy sucks and this film re-confirmed it for me."

I cry and I feel like my whole body feels every emotion Brie Larson conveys through her portrayal of Joy. As for Jacob Tremblay for such a young actor I feel he nails his character Jack on the head perfectly. For anyone who has children you will most definitely get chills watching this film. I believe it was written so well and executed beautifully. The way the story is told and how was absolutely genius. I feel as if its a hard movie to describe to someone without giving away any aspects to the film. Room is a movie that makes you look at things a slight bit different. Makes you questions things you might not normally question. Gives you a contrary perspective on how what may be \"normal\" on the outside isn't what it seems."

        "review_title": "the world is more than one room",
        "review_detailed_main": "'Room', the 2015 film made by Lenny Abrahamson based on a script written by Lenny Abrahamson, who adapted her own novel for the screen can be considered as a sequence of two different films, each about an hour long, with the same two characters: a young mother and a little boy who turns 5 at the beginning of the film. In the first part, the two are sequestered in a cabin. The mother had been kidnapped in her late teens and the child was born in captivity. The classic story of prisoners in closed space and their struggle to escape to freedom is combined with the drama of the mother who tries to create a world for her son that will protect him from the evil that holds them captive. In part two, the two break free, but their physical release from captivity does not mean they can easily remove the captivity from their minds and souls. It's a film with many interesting parts, raising intriguing psychological issues and allowing some of the actors to deliver memorable performances.\n\nI liked the first part of the movie better. Movies that exploit claustrophobia are not my favorite genre, but the script offers an unusual reversal of perspectives. Unlike other cases (real or imagined), the mother not only does not disown her child born out of the violent relationship with her captor, but makes him the purpose of her life, trying to explain to him the world in which she lives with its terrible limits. A wonderful example of exemplary motherhood. The two of them and their captor are the only people alive in this universe. The world seen on the TV screen in the room is not real. The patch of sky seen through a window too high to touch is the only link to the world of aliens who may someday come to visit. In a moment of crossroads, the woman realizes that rescue would only be possible if the boy escaped from captivity, but for that she must explain the truth to him. At first, however, he refuses the change. The universe imagined by the mother explained that absurd world too well for the five-year-old boy. Paradoxically, in the second part of the film, it is the boy who will adapt better to the change. The theme of the child raised in a very different world who returns (here he actually comes for the first time) to civilization is approached, however, a little schematically, and what happened in the mother's family during her absence is not fully elucidated.\n\nThe lack of balance between the two parts of the film is compensated by the outstanding acting performances of the two lead actors. Even if the Academy Award for the leading female role seems like an overshoot, Brie Larson's creation as the mother is complex and nuanced, full of dignity in the first part of the film, fragility and struggle with herself in the second part. If there was a category of awards for children, it would undoubtedly have been won by Jacob Tremblay. He was eight years old when he played the five-year-old Jack (and at some points he really seems a little too mature) and has since become a child star and now a teenager star, with 45 roles in his filmography at the age of 17. Also appearing in the cast is William H. Macy, an actor that I like very much, but I confess that I did not understand his role. There is a conflict between the father and his ex-prisoner daughter that the script does not explain. Had the father had any guilt in the kidnapping of his daughter? The book and movie are inspired by a true case where the father kidnapped and held his own daughter captive, but that is not the case here, the kidnapper being a stranger. Anyway, 'Room', despite its imperfections, is an interesting film, proof that fiction inspired by real cases can produce films that mix well realism with emotion."

        "review_detailed_main": "1. Impact of Logical Inconsistencies: Throughout \"Room,\" the narrative's flow is periodically disrupted by instances where the actions and decisions of characters appear disjointed from the overall context. These logical discrepancies rupture the film's sense of realism, often distracting the viewer from the unfolding events. Consequently, these inconsistencies create a challenge for audiences trying to immerse themselves in the story.\n\n2. Diminished Focus and Engagement: The presence of these logical errors inevitably leads to an oscillating attention span, as the viewer becomes preoccupied with understanding and rationalizing the discrepancies instead of wholeheartedly connecting with the characters and their journey. This cognitive dissonance can hinder emotional engagement, undermining the film's intended impact.\n\n3. Themes and Nuance Lost: The film strives to convey profound themes concerning resilience, the human spirit, and the aftermath of traumatic experiences. However, when the storyline is disrupted by these inconsistencies, the thematic depth becomes obscured. The audience's ability to glean the intended emotional and psychological layers might consequently be compromised.\n\n4. Characters and Empathy: As viewers, we naturally seek to empathize with characters and understand their motivations. The logical gaps, however, disrupt this empathetic connection. When characters' choices and responses diverge from what seems rational or consistent with their established personalities, it becomes arduous to fully invest in their emotional journeys.\n\n5. Narrative Flow and Immersion: For a story that hinges on such powerful themes, a smooth narrative flow is crucial. The presence of logical gaps tends to interrupt this flow, forcing viewers to constantly evaluate the plausibility of the story rather than surrendering to its emotional cadence. This erosion of immersion ultimately detracts from the cinematic experience.\n\nConclusion: \"Room\" aspires to be a poignant exploration of human resilience and the aftermath of trauma, but its vulnerability to logical inconsistencies hinders its potential impact. While the film grapples with weighty themes and emotions, these gaps disrupt the narrative's coherence and impede viewers' ability to wholly engage. By addressing these logical issues, \"Room\" could have been more successful in its mission to elicit a profound and resonant cinematic experience."

WE need to remember how lucky we are\u0085 just think of that the next time you're complaining about what ever you're complaining about (same goes for me, I need to stop complaining about the weather situation..). This is not based on a true story thankfully. It's heartbreaking but so good. And the Cast is one of the best I've seen in a while. Brie and Jacob are just amazing, two really great actors, who were meant for this film. Also kind of glad that they didn't focus on showing us all these horrible experiences the mom (brie) has to go through, I mean you know that they're happening, but what we get to see is this strong mom fighting for her and her sons life and It's more from Jacobs point of view which makes it more pleasant to watch. If that makes sense\u0085 I can't elevate this film, cast and crew enough. JUST GO watch it already! Words to help describe this film: isolation, escape, heartbreaking, breathtaking, lego, family.\n\nI absolutely loved it, a lot because of Brie and Jacob (and who am I kidding- also the compelling story of course)\n\nI give it 10 out of 10"

Joy (called by her son \"Ma\") and her five-year-old son Jack live in a shed that they call \"Room\" where have a bed, a toilet, a bathtub, a television, and a kitchen...but with only one window. They are captives of a man who is called Old Nick (Jack's father) .He abducted Joy seven years ago, and normally rapes her while Jack is hidden in the wardrobe. Jack believes that only Room and what in it are \"real,\" and the rest of the world exists only in television. When Joy discovers that Old Nick lost his job, she's afraid he'll abandon the house, letting them die without food or water. She thinks about a plan to escape: Jack will pretend to be dead and get rolled up in Rug so Old Nick will bury Jack far from the house. In this case ,Jack can escape when Old Nick stops at a stop sign. Jack's innocence and sweetness, Joy's strong hope to get out of \"Room\" and continue living the life that Old Nick has stolen from her, make this movie painful to watch; especially thanks to actors' excellent skills in acting."

All he knows of the world is what he sees in front of his eyes.

Strong story, strong actors, sad mood. I loved that we as the audience were able to experience the world through the eyes of the boy: the tight room, the sad eyes of his mother, the exploration of the world around him after they escaped. Strong, but would not rewatch it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Room is the incredible story about Ma, played by Brie Larson, who at 17 years of age, gets abducted and imprisoned in a shed at her perpetrator's house. Now 7 years later, she has the 5 year old boy Jack, played by Jacob Trembley, who lives with her inside the shed. She does everything in her power to make him feel safe. The Irishman Lenny Abrahamson directed this hard and claustrophobic film. The first impression of Room is that the film is rather comfortable. Ma and Jack enjoy each others company and do things that a mother and son usually does. They bake, eat food, celebrate birthdays and watch TV together. After a while as we get more into the story, their relationship changes and becomes more and more tumultuous. Jack by the age of 5, is forced to face and take action against things that no human being ever should have to.\n\nRoom is really divided in two parts, the first one in captivity and the second one in freedom. The interesting thing that Abrahamson does with this film, is that he in an incredible way asks very daring questions to us. With a life in total captivity, is it possible to feel freedom afterwards? When the safe base a 5 year old has felt his entire life just disappears, what happens then? How does the public react when something like this gets out in the open? Some parts really reminded me of the film Gone Girl where we see in the same way, how the media exploits the suffering the family is going through, only for their own self gain. These moral and psychological questions is the foundation of Room.\n\nThe best thing about Room is these questions Abrahamson stirs up by not prevaricate, embellish or avoid delicate subjects. He shows it just like it is, no matter how brutal. The second thing that really enhances this film is the amazing acting by both Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley. Their chemistry is truly amazing and Larson even won an Oscar for her performance. If their relationship hadn't felt real, the film wouldn't at all work in the way it did. Room is perhaps one of 2015's most provocative and thought-provoking films\n\nDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

Playing mother and son, their characters and relationship are completely convincing, and while the story starts fairly quietly (perhaps to reflect Joy's and Jack's captivity), the story gains intensity as Joy realizes the need to escape, and prepares Jack to help in the attempt.\n\nThis is a story about trauma, survival, and resiliency, told very quietly and carefully. I marvel at films that find the significance in the everyday, without having to warp it for dramatic effect. \"Room\" achieves it beautifully."

Their names are Joy and Jack, and they are very codependent.\n\nWhat I did not expect from this film is that it deals with the theme of perception of reality, and how much the environment has an impact on this perception. Jack has only lived in Room his whole life and knows nothing outside of this life. To maintain his innocence, Joy has had to tell stories to build a certain perspective on reality for her son. One of the best scenes of the film is when Joy decides it is better for Jack to know the truth about the world and reality, and Jack's reaction is heartbreaking and played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay.\n\nI want to say more, but I feel like I would give too much away if I did. In a nutshell, this film deals with issues I never would have imagined to be tackled in a film with this premise. I recommend you see this film unless you find the premise disturbing, though the film is never violent or graphic.\n\n3.5/4.0"

It is very disturbing to watch, but so resounding in how their resiliency holds them through. Jack is blinded to much of the world due to his captivity, and only envisions to be reality on what he sees on television; this is brilliantly presented by screenwriter Emma Donoghue who adapted the script from her novel. The second half of \"Room\" is stored in the aspects of adjusting to the real world after Joy & Jack are able to free their captor. Director Lenny Abrahamson helms the picture with a commanding orchestration of the inner emotional layers that Joy & Jack go through their experience in captivity and adjusting; my only minor critique of \"Room\" was in the film's unrealistic ending which obviously I won't reveal because there is no room for spoilers in my reviews. Brie Larson was astounding as Joy, and this is the real Joy who will be the next Oscar winner for Best Actress. Jacob Tremblay as Jack was a revelation, and this young actor is heading straight to the real world of stardom; he is a genuine pure talent. There was also strong supporting work from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, William H. Macy as Joy's father, and Tom McCamus as the boyfriend of Joy's mom. OK, I will free you now from this review, sorry I held you captive with all those roomy puns. Just make sure you make room for \"Room\". ***** Excellent"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Room\" is based on the 2010 novel of the same name, written by Irish-Canadian author Emma Donoghue who was also responsible for the film's screenplay. It tells the story of a 5-year old boy named Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and his Ma (Brie Larson), who are living in the confines of a small enclosure after Ma was kidnapped by a man when she was 17, and has been held captive there for last 7 years. This same man was responsible for Jack's birth, so Jack knows nothing or has seen anything else in his life apart from this room he's currently holed up in. After a daring escape plan finally frees Ma and himself, both individuals must find a way live a customary lifestyle again, but things are much harder than it seems.\n\n\"Room\" works simply because of how unembellished and dreary it's narrative is and how seamlessly Larson, Tremblay and Joan Allen fit into this world of hopelessness. The acting from the two leads are stunning; you will not see a more genuine and heartbreaking Mother & Son relationship as this for a long time. Their rapport and on screen chemistry was dazzling.\n\nLarson exudes that devoted motherly persona, doing her utmost to keep her child protected at any cost and blames herself forcefully for the situation they find themselves in. She doesn't care about her own wellbeing; everything she does, all her actions and rational thinking is about how she can get her child out of this nightmare and how to bring his life back around to normality. If you loved her in Short Term 12, she takes it up another notch here with a monumental display of sadness, anger & pure unadulterated love. Amazing, Oscar worthy stuff and if she won it would very much deserved; a performance that packs an almighty wallop.\n\nTremblay couldn't have played this role any better and he can easily join the ranks of the greatest child performances I've ever seen. It's a difficult part to play, but like Larson he gives his character so much depth and complexity and carries the same amount of care and affection for his 'Ma' that she has for him. Being such a young age, he doesn't quite understand what's going on, so he takes whatever his Ma says as gospel. He only knows 'Room'. He only knows what he see's on the TV in Room. He only knows the sky is blue. He doesn't know there's a huge universe out there waiting for him, that there are more people like him and Ma, that the dogs and cats and trees he see's on TV are real. The growth we see Tremblay's character experience and the way he conveys it is utterly transfixing; it's hard to believe he's just 9-years old. A big, big future ahead for this hugely talented kid.\n\nAnd credit must also go to Joan Allen, whom I've admired for a while now but hasn't had a role like this in years. It's such a delicate and thoughtful performance, perfectly nuanced but enough there to feel her woes. It reminded me of Dern in last year's 'Wild', and I was so happy when Dern got a nomination because I loved her in that. I feel the same way about Allen.\n\nThe direction is very much on point and the gorgeous score has been criminally under-appreciated. It's not in your face but it doesn't need to be, as composer Stephen Rennicks elects to keep a smooth, perfectly apt melody whilst only increasing the strings slightly for the more intense moments.\n\n\"Room\" is a film that will stay with you for days. It's subject matter is dark, leaving very little leeway for humour or any sort of respite from a grim situation. What we're presented to us is a highly grounded tale of human nature, the ugly side of it, but also the true beauty and strength of a Mother-Child bond."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here comes another award-winning supposed to be slayer. And guess what? It is the polar opposite of the same description. There's nothing embezzled about this movie that will shine. Brie Larson plays the seven year long rape victim mother \"Ma\" of a boy who's just turned five and who is very happy in achieving this feat. Jacob Tremblay plays the role of 'Jack' the kid. Ma has raised her precocious son on her own. She has tricked Jack into believing that that 'room' is the beginning and end of this world and that there's nothing outside but space. She has in fact made a bed, school, bathroom and what not in that cramped little space that her captor Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers, has provided her with. There's a television set also on which everything is perceived as unreal and false by Jack for the lack of exposure to the outside world. In an attempt to make it more plausible for us to believe, and probably for Jack too, that they can survive and get out of there someday, there's a skylight at the top of the room through which sunlight enters in the room during the day. All in vain of course. There is basically no story. You see them living inside a room first and then living outside the room after when they manage to escape in an episode that could not have been more childish where Ma instructs Jack to lie still after rolling him into a rug so that she can pretend his death and mourn over it when Old Nick comes home at night to have his daily quota of sex with her. The plan works and Jack escapes finally, until he is caught by Old Nick and surprisingly, is left behind safe by him after one fat guy watches him get manhandled by Old Nick. You almost feel like screaming,\"Why O Why?\" Nick never comes back in the movie should be a serious enough indication about the kind of logic that was applied in the writing of this film. Nor does Ma ever get involved with him again. The real drama happens afterwards when the mother son duo have to live in Ma's parents house, who apparently have separated. Ma can't stand that house even since she isn't at good terms with her parents. Especially her father, whom she believes has been deliberately ignoring her son since they both stepped into the room. Ma also tries to commit suicide in a genuine attempt to apologize to Jack in a fanciful manner for ruining his childhood and treating him the way she did. The moment you think there's an interesting development being made the scene ends. And this happens enough times that you give up on the film altogether. As if the it wasn't enough tragic that both Ma and Jack visit that 'room' again towards the end of the film. That's when you realize your last couple of hours could have been more productive washing your car or making toast."

It's a masterpiece. I've never seen a film dealt with in such a realistic way. This film was an emotional roller-coaster, I was in tears many times throughout this movie. This film has the best acting of the year.\n\nBrie Larson gives the best female performance in years. Who surprised me the most was Jacob Tremblay, who gives easily one of the greatest child performances I've ever seen. Joan Allen is great as well, and I expect all of them to get Oscar nominations. In no way was I expecting to be as engaged as I was in this film, because I was absolutely mesmerized. Lenny Abrahamson's directing is incredible. He allows you to really understand these characters, and you feel all the emotion and passion poured on-screen.\n\nThis film is heartbreaking, but heartwarming at the same time. I guarantee anyone who sees this will cry. It's incredible. I hope it wins Best Picture, it deserves it. This is the best film so far this year, 9.8/10."

It was truly heartbreaking seeing her broken but she still tries to remain courageous and holds on to her hope for her son.\n\nBrie Larson definitely needs to be recognized as a fantastic actress. All the actors need enough credit, and the film itself is just too precious. I'm still shaken.\n\nI would recommend this film to anyone who wishes to see something heartbreakingly precious.

        "review_title": "Moving drama that earns its sentiment. Larson gives one of the best performances of the year.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Room couldn't be further from Lenny Abrahamson's last film Frank, a bizarre music-orientated comedy. Gone are the idiosyncrasies that made Frank wild and, for many including myself, compelling, instead we have a moving drama that earns its sentiment. The different approach is felt immediately as Abrahamson traps us with his two principle characters, Ma and Jack, in tight and sometimes oddly framed closeups. It's a somewhat clumsy execution to show the claustrophobia and intimacy Abrahamson wants to achieve as he uses Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's faces as blank canvases, but the effect is thoroughly felt, and the film's following 30 minutes remain its best. The photography decides to take a step back, but it continues to catch that raw emotion.\n\nThe concept of a mother having raised her son in confinement then finally breaking free has many avenues to explore. Having not read Emma Donoghue's book, of whom also wrote the screenplay, I mostly expected a small scale -getting out of the eponymous room then reuniting and resolving itself there. Instead, the film goes further than I expected, getting Ma \u2013 also known as Joy, which is becoming a familiar character's name this year \u2013 and Jack back to her teenage home with her own mother. Then, in a way, it doesn't go far enough. But it's interesting to watch it play in its happy medium. It does rely on some key contrivances to get there, such as the kidnapper's wonky perception and ultimately not fighting hard enough when he could have, but that doesn't take away from the gripping escape sequence as the orchestra swells and squeezes tears from you whether you like it or not.\n\nRoom becomes a rehabilitation story as well as a discovery story, as Joy struggles to re-adapt to home life and Jack is seeing the world he only suspected but never imagined. The detail and convincing touches in Tremblay's performance are what make it special, such as the fact that Jack has never had to deal with stairs. The film is told mostly through his perspective, but it's not held as a consistent theme though that helps it be less on the nose. The first time Jack sees outside is not the first time we see outside. But it's still cathartic as we watch him finally see real trees and real telephone poles. While many can assume that actors as young as Tremblay, who was 8 when he shot Room, are coached through their roles then we can also assume he had expert teachers. He may not carry the gravity of the film throughout, but he nails the moments that count.\n\nBrie Larson had not only shown potential but delivered the goods with 2013's Short Term 12. It's a similar environment here with devoted maternal instincts but this time it's pushed to the brink of her skills as an actress. She's drenched in this exasperation that speaks to years of exhaustion. In the tone of her primal performance, she paints a full rich portrait of Joy's whole life from her carefree teen years to her brutal capture by Old Nick when she was 17, to every little story and lesson she's told Jack. Joy's constantly revising the way she raises Jack and while there's bumps in the road, it's a complete picture of motherhood. She balances resilience and vulnerability, hope and dejection with a fine tooth comb. Most times she commands the screen and offers one of the year's best performances. It's a film about the harsh realities of growing up, operating for both of the main characters, and it's a very sensitive and emotionally potent portrayal.\n\nJoan Allen, as Joy's mother, is heartfelt and shows unconditional love in a wonderfully nuanced way, whereas William H. Macy, Joy's father, is regretfully underused but doing the 'in over his head' thing Macy does best. From one domestic space to another, it's easy to wish it would spread its wings instead of remaining so confined. It's clear that recovery is difficult but there was a lot more ground Room could have covered. It loses a lot of steam after the escape, but at the very least it never loses my investment in the characters. It's not working on a defined timeline, or with hardly a goal in mind, so it leaves itself a little elusive. I was either ready to jump 10 years to see how they're doing or I accepted that it would simply end at a good enough point. Story problems aside, it's focusing on emotion, and while it may step into melodrama, it's always potent. It's hard to pinpoint Abrahamson's voice as a filmmaker exactly, and he might be a little overzealous with how he adapts his style so far, but he's certainly got the right edge.\n\n8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery.\n\nThe difference between this film and a B-grade thriller or revenge film is in the level of performance achieved by the two leads, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. They are the beginning middle and end of everything good about this film. (And luckily, they are strong enough to cancel out William H. Macy, who is horribly miscast in this movie.)\n\nThere is no doubt that Brie Larson will win the Oscar for Best Actress, and no doubt that she deserves it. After her picking up a Golden Globe and a SAG Award, it would be very strange to applaud anyone else. She is strong, weak, sad, elated, protective and terrified. This is just about the fullest range of emotions that a person can have, especially in under two hours on screen.\n\nMany have noted that Jacob Tremblay is equally good. Some say he is even better than Larson (and that is quite possible). Yet he did not get a nomination. This is definitely unfortunate. Whether he is on par with Leonardo DiCaprio's strength this year is hard to say, but it seems that Tremblay easily was more intense, more memorable than Matt Damon. With all due respect to Matt Damon.\n\nNot having read the book, I can make no commented on the adapted screenplay. I think the script we end up with is excellent, but if the award is for the adaptation, that might be more difficult to call.\n\nThis leaves Best Director and Best Picture. I find it very unlikely that Lenny Abrahamson will win. He definitely deserves to be in this category, and he has risen relatively quickly. 2014's \"Frank\" was a quirky little film that deserved more attention, and \"Room\" is going to launch him into the A-list. His next film is rumored to be a Civil War story, and although that has been done to death (what hasn't?), many eyes will now be on it.\n\nAnd Best Picture? That would be quite the upset. Some people have really gotten behind the film. Richard Roeper, for example, thinks \"Room\" is one of the best films of the decade. He would love to see \"Room\" go home with the little golden man. But it would be an uphill fight. Most likely it will end up taking third or fourth place (and we are not privy to the votes)."

The child actor Jacob Tremblay, who plays Jack, is very good in this, one of the best child actors I have ever seen.

This movie is a must- see for so many reasons: good directing, great score, amazing acting. I mean, Jacob Tremblay can act. There is no question he is the main character of the film, the reason why this story is being told.\n\nAnd of course, where there is a yin there is a yang. The reason why it's so easy to be sucked into Room right from the get-go is Brie Larson aka Joy. While I was watching this, I guess I was waiting for her to take over the action but she never quite did. Instead what happened was that she and Jack shared this beautiful synergy, which signified what this movie was all about: the bond between mother and son. Some points in the second act (of the story) were dull, but the relationship between these two made the first 45- 50 minutes of the film grade A.\n\nIn my opinion, Room is definitely worth the watch. The facts aren't all that pleasant, but just hearing \"The Mighty Rio Grande\" during the bridge between the first and second act, is enough to give you goosebumps. Wasn't surprised by the acting, but more so by the creativity, and that's always the toughest component to find in movies today."

In addition, due to not really getting what situation these characters were in, made it really underwhelming when they made their rather fortunate escape; there was no feeling of awe at this, seemingly, new and strange environment (like in Oldboy, The Hurt Locker,and The Descent), and it's clear with the slow-mo, and shots of Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) face that was what they were attempting.\n\nAside from what I'd wish they'd done, there were also some questionable and unfitting music choices throughout, and two scenes: during and immediately following the escape. The two scenes came off as awkward, unrealistic, and contrived; and the acting and characters in these scenes were both bad and annoying.\n\nBesides the already mentioned, the acting in this film was good, with Brie Larson being the standout. And though I thought Jacob Tremblay was good, for a kid, I didn't think his performance was amazing or award worthy, like I had heard previous to watching Room. Just because his performance was better than most child performances doesn't mean it's great.\n\nI appreciated the way they decided to take the story, and I liked the way Brie's character's struggles were handled, and to be honest, that's it.\n\nWith all this pessimism, it may be hard to believe that I didn't hate this film, but I didn't; I just thought it was meh. Nothing special, and I won't be seeing it again, though it is watchable."

What makes this movie so special and worthy of being nominated at the Oscars is the performances by Larson and Tremblay. I've never seen such great acting by a nine year old year kid before. Brie Larson also did a fantastic job, an amazing performance that in my opinion she will win the best actress. This movie is also directed beautifully which is all thanks to Lenny Abrahamson. The only negative that wasn't very a negative for me but might be for some people is that it is a very slow and heavy movie but the great storytelling just makes you want to see what happens next. Overall Room is a fantastic story of a mother and her child in a bad situation. The performances were amazing by everyone. Definitely deserves to be in the Oscars race."

        "review_detailed_main": "First things first, I do my absolute best not to ever write a \"spoiler\" review. I'm going to honor that pledge with this review, but I have to say that this is a hard movie to do justice to without spoiling it. But I think I can, so read on.\n\nI decided to go see a random movie this afternoon after seeing the 2016 Oscar nominees were released. This movie is nominated for Best Picture, and it was the one of the three nominees playing at the local indie-flick theater in town that was about to start when I arrived at the theater, so I chose to see it.\n\nThe most important thing you can know about \"Room\" is that it's worth seeing at least once. It's a pretty simple, low budget movie, so no special effects or anything like that, so if you'd prefer to wait for the digital release you can. Regardless of when you view it, though, my suggestion is to try to go into this movie without knowing virtually anything about it. Seeing it cold, without having read any reviews or heard a thing about it, will greatly augment the experience.\n\nI say that because that's how I went about seeing this movie, and not knowing what it was about really made it quite powerful for me. So while it's fine to wait to see it at home, don't let anyone tell you about it between now and when it hits digital release.\n\nNow, here's the one, tiny spoiler--nothing huge here, but just one slight tidbit that I have to reveal in order to write much of a review at all: This movie has a significant plot twist to it. That's all I'm saying, but the point here is that in going into this movie cold and not knowing a thing about it, I thought I was watching a certain story play out on the screen, and then the plot twist hit........and WOW. Man, oh man. I did NOT see that coming.\n\nThat said, I'll finish here by saying a few words about the quality of the film. The acting is great. The cinematography is great. And for a low budget movie, it does what it sets out to do very effectively.\n\nThe only thing that I might be slightly critical of is that as the plot develops this movie gets a bit odd--not in the content of what the story is about (although that is odd in and of itself), but rather that after that plot twist happens it seems like everybody in the film becomes a very irrational actor. For me, this made the film suffer a bit, as I kept looking at the decisions that people made as the plot moved on and I thought, \"That's not very believable.\" And yet, the more I think about it, the fact is that the irrational decisions and far fetched mindset that so many of the characters have in this movie may actually make it more believable, since people tend to be irrational creatures.\n\nThat having been said, I'd give the early portion of this film a 10, and the rest of it a 7. It gets worse as it moves on, but at no point does it ever become a bad movie. The other downside is that it's not a film that would be very re-watchable--it's probably not one that you're going to want own on Blu Ray so you can see it over and over again. But it's definitely worth seeing once. All in all I'd call it an 8.\n\nSo, 8/10 stars for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Movies have the ability to transport you to many places. Places that are familiar, places that are strange and different or places you would not visit otherwise. It can take you to \"A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far, Far Away\", or it can take you to visit the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" or, sometimes - if you are very lucky - it will take you to ROOM.\n\nDirected by Lenny Abrahamson, ROOM tells the story of \"Ma\" (Brie Larson) who, as the movie begins, has been held hostage for 7 years in a windowless 10x10 enclosure. She has dubbed this enclosure \"ROOM\" for the benefit of her 5 year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who is held imprisoned with her. The first half of the movie takes place entirely in this enclosure where Ma has helped create a world for Jack. It is very much Ma taking care of Jack. The second half of the movie takes place \"afterward\" (I will not spoil anything here).\n\nMs. Larson, in her Oscar nominated role, is fantastic as Ma, imbuing her character with the right combination of strength and weakness of one imprisoned for so long, but you can see the love she has for her son and that she will do anything to protect him. While the first half of the movie is worthy of her Oscar nomination (and Oscar frontrunner status), it is the realistic affects to Ma (who we find out is named, ironically, Joy) during \"afterwards\" that really cement the role. We don't see a \"superwoman\" here, we see a real person dealing with a traumatic event and it's aftermath. She is ably assisted by strong turns by Joan Allen and William H. Macy as her parents, as well as Tom McCamus as \"Leo\".\n\nThe surprise for me is how strong a performance 9 year old Jacob Tremblay gave as 5 year old Jack. While Larson, rightfully so, is receiving critical acclaim, I am surprised that Tremblay isn't receiving more. Larson is the rock of the first half of the movie, but it is Tremblay who holds the 2nd half of the movie together. Jack's warm and loving soul radiates throughout the back half and keeps things together when it looks like things are falling apart.\n\nDirector Abrahamson gives a strong hand to the proceedings, having us focus on just what we need to focus on without it becoming too depressing, maudlin or sappy. He knows when to pull in and when to pull out and has you rooting for these characters from the start.\n\nThis movie is not for everyone and I am sure that more than 1 person will have a tough time making it all the way through it (I had a strong desire to go home and hug my family afterward, much to my son's chagrin). I was warmed by the strong love of mother and son and how it takes a subject that could have been a downer and has made it heartwarming and life affirming.\n\n8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
