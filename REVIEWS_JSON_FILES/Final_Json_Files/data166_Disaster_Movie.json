        "review_detailed_main": "*Disclaimer: I only watched this movie as a conditional agreement. And I see films for free. I wouldn't be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.\n\nWell, to explain the depth of this 'film', I could write my shortest review, ever. Don't see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think I'll go on for a bit.\n\nI don't know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesn't matter. They're all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, it's film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the next shot. AND, if someone gets cut by a sword, there should be blood and at least a cut (though since the Narnia films \"get away with it\", I'll give Disaster Movie a pass here).\n\nThe 'jokes' are thoughtless and mindless physical gags that obviously take after some of the most popular movies of the last year (there's some from late 2007 as well, including 2 of our 5 Best Picture nominees).\n\nYou know what the saddest thing about these stupid movies are? I don't care how much money they make, or how many cameos they have, these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors, writers, and directors that truly deserve the attention. Lionsgate, I thought you had better taste than this. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making this kind of crap. And as for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Burn in hell. You guys are contributing to the decline of western civilization. Correction...you are the CAUSE of the downfall of western civilization."

There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.\n\nI could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know there's going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, \"THIS IS SPARTA!\" and, \"IM RICK JAMES BITCH\" so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.\n\nDon't see this movie. Don't spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and then silently judge the people that are talking about this movie on Monday. Do yourself a favor."

First of all a spoof film entitled \"Disaster Movie\", should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being \"Twister\". How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldn't say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.\n\nThere is nothing clever or witty or remotely smart about the way these two write, and I can't believe that some people still pay to see these travesties. It's an insult to the audience, though if they enjoy these films I doubt that they are smart enough to realize that.\n\nRating: Unfortunately there is not a number low enough (yes this includes negatives) to rate this. This deserves to be in the top 5 worst films of all time, right there with Date Movie, Epic Faliure...I mean movie, and Meet the Spartans. I would rather be forced into a 24 hour \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" marathon than watch this slop."

These sort of movies (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) haven't been funny for some time now but \"Disaster Movie\" has reached a new low. There wasn't one real laugh anywhere in the film, and most of the alleged \"jokes\" were actually painful. (There was a considerable amount of childish, mean-spirited stuff in the form of racist, sexist, and especially homophobic, garbage present, along with ample helpings of juvenile gross-outs.) None of the actors were even bothering to put up any pretense of acting. There is nothing hip, clever, or even mildly intelligent going on here. The entire film is from beginning to end crass, vulgar, irrational, and utterly humorless in any human sense. I know that in the past these sort of trash has made enough money to keep Seltzer et al., grinding them out but \"Disaster Movie\" may just be the downfall of the franchise. The utter contempt that Seltzer and his collaborators have for their audience is finally beginning to show through clearly. If this one fails (and from what I saw in the almost empty theater there is a good chance of it), Seltzer will have to go back to the drawing board, stop making these lazy catastrophes, and finally develop a real sense of humor. This movie is an unfunny piece of puke - stay away from it."

I consider myself a lover of cinema, with an appreciation for the art of film. I love many genres, including comedy, action, and of course, zombie movies. All of this aside, I watched \"Disaster Movie\" this afternoon, and it elicited one emotion from me: Anger.\n\nI have never been so irritated in all of my adult life by a movie. I have watched these cretins put out all of this filth that masquerades as \"entertainment\", and have held my tongue until now. I will say this right now: anyone who finds these movies entertaining should be ashamed of themselves. I generally believe that people can have whatever opinion they want, but people that actually like these movies are contributing to the downfall of the art form of cinema. By encouraging LionsGate to continue making these horrendous movies, all we are doing is perpetrating a cultural crime that we may never be able to fix. I grow weary of the multitudes who flock to theaters to see this garbage, and I weep for the future of our nation if this is what passes for entertainment these days.\n\nNone of the jokes are funny. The parodies of films like \"Juno\" and \"10,000 BC\" fail to amuse, and even the lampooning of unexplainable culture phenomena like Hannah Montana and Amy Winehouse is an exercise in futility. No one has ever tried to do more with fecal matter and farm animals than this movie did, and it failed miserably.\n\nI beg all of you, as a lover of movies, not to see this film. It is an absolute atrocity, and I guarantee you will feel stupider for having watched it.\n\nPS: I work at a theater, so the only reason I even saw this movie was for job purposes. I didn't pay to see it, and neither should you."

First off, these movies are NOT fueled by dumb teenagers foolish enough to watch them. I'm 15 and even I know this is the biggest garbage ever. I don't watch these movies since Date Movie, because I learned right there that these movies suck. I went to a it with a friend and basically went to see how much it would suck. It sucked major ass. I walked out after a half-hour and hassled for my money back. When was the last time there even WAS a disaster movie? Juno, 10,000 B.C., Don't Mess With the Zohan, Indiana Jones, these are completely irrelevant, as are the hundreds of unfunny jokes ripped off the comedies they spoof (which is stupid as it is to spoof a comedy) and made them even less funny.\n\nBecause of this movie, I will probably never watch MadTV again because it ruined my opinion of many of them. They give pathetic, poorly performed excuses for \"acting\", and showed how horrendously unfunny they can be. (It's worse than when Tina Fey left SNL).\n\nIf you want comedy, don't watch this, spoofing is an art, a talent few posses, and these two jack-weeds don't posses it AT ALL. If you want to see good comedy, go to the store and buy Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane!, Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, Scary Movie 3, and Superhero movie, because those movies are actually hilarious. Some less than others, but SM3 and SHM are far better than 10 Disaster Movies.\n\nSo anyone who says that dumb adolescent teens fuel this garbage, think again because this stuff is garbage and I don't watch garbage. (this was an exception because people like my friend fuel this garbage :P.) This films will give you AIDS, makes you lose your hair, make you go blind, become flacid, makes you get a purple sock, this movie will destroy you and your sense of humor. Excuse the graphic descriptions, that's what it does to you, on the inside. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. IF YOU DON'T WATCH THIS, THOSE DUMBASSES WON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND THIS GARBAGE. THINK OF YOUR FUTURES! WHAT IF 80 MORE OF THESE FILMS ARE MADE WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE AROUND. THINK OF YOUR CHILDREN, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer.\n\nI'm generally a defender of the mainstream, but these two....these two....\n\nThey embody all that's wrong with Hollywood, hell, with modern film in general.\n\nI hate when people defend them by saying they are satirizing films, they aren't satirizing films THEY ARE REFERENCING films, they are not a mockery of crappy Hollywood excess, they are an EXAMPLE of it. It's like if Michael Bay said his movies were meant to be a satire of excessive CGI and explosions. To do a parody or satire, you must PROVIDE or Impersonate examples of your topic and MOCK them over specific flaws and contradictions, you don't COPY them and change things by adding hip-hop dance sequences or having characters die randomly. It's clear they haven't even watched the films that are 'parodied' here, in fact, several of the films referenced were still being shot and in some cases only starting shooting, thus making effective parodies of those films impossible, and imagine for a moment if 'Hancock' or 'The Dark Knight' were never made and they still included references to those films, would you still consider that 'hip' and 'relevant'?.\n\nAnd even IF, pray tell, these films were funny, they are still off-topic. 99% of all the 'jokes' have nothing to do with Disaster Movies and those that do are so minor they are negligible. FACT: You cannot parody something effectively if you don't even mention it. Cut out the off-topic scenes from 'Disaster Movie' for example, and you'll only be left with 3, maybe 5 at the most, minutes of film, mostly credits. I don't care if it's the funniest film in the world, if it doesn't in some way deliver what it promises, I'm still not even gonna give it one star. If the titles were meant to be symbolic or something(like how 'Dancing with Wolves' isn't literally about dancing with wolves and Chris Ware's 'Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth' comic is about an adult with autism), it wouldn't matter, but in this case, they specifically say what they are going to do, and then disappoint. And sure a lot of comedies have off-topic jokes, but NOT ONES THAT TAKE UP 98.9% OF THE WHOLE FILM! At least 'Bio-Dome' actually took place in a Bio-Dome!\n\nSo I apologize if you get off on being disappointed, sorry, but I'm not. I prefer to laugh when watching a comedy, or at least, have fun.\n\nAnd even worse, when they DO make actual parodies of something, they only do lame, obvious, predictable jokes even a small child could do just as effectively, if not more so. Oh, so Hannah Montanna's a merchandising whore, WOW I didn't know that!!! It's like some kid who tries to seem smart at the dinner table when his parent's are discussing politics by making political jokes, but who knows nothing about how politics work, so he just say's 'I'm a politician' and makes fart noises with his mouth. Is that cutting-edge and insightful satire? NO. But these idiots seem to think it is, because it's basically what they do, only with 'actors' doing it for them. My review for 'Caltiki' is a better example of satire. And don't call me a snob, because I'm a guy who loves stupid comedy, 'Jingle all the Way' and 'The Stupids' are some of my favorite guilty pleasures, hell, I started a thread about my favorite bad films a few months ago before some troll derailed it because I dared question the audacity of 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000' and was recently involved in a flame war with some loser who thinks 'South Park' is a sign of the coming Apocalypse.\n\nSo don't blame other people's films, these are crap all on their own.\n\nAnd if they intend their films to be that way, that just makes it even worse, so they intend to make off-topic, unfunny, parody-devoid, boring, unpleasant films? That just confirms and justifies anything people say and do to them. Even assassination attempts. And if they really do consider their films to be real parodies, then they are one-trick ponies, and since plenty of comedians get grilled for doing a revolving door of the same few tricks,(like the Angry Video Game Nerd swearing too much and beating up guest stars, or Dane Cook being juvenile and unoriginal, although yeah, he is) then these two are the one trick-iest one trick ponies who ever lived, and their only trick is being off-topic.\n\nThese films aren't even entertaining in a so bad it's good way, in fact, they are the antithesis of entertainment. I usually never listen to people who say they fell asleep watching a film, as I used to think that that was impossible and although I've done so, it was usually for a number of reasons such as being tired, drunk or forcibly on my own free will to escape a bad film. Well, it's true, these film are so boring they actually will put you to sleep like a lazy student in a cartoon. In fact, if someone could have filmed me 'watching' this garbage, I'm sure there would have been Z's floating over my head.\n\nDitch this crap, please.\n\nOh, and for all of you out there who are going to castigate me for paying to see this, I'll let you know I didn't pay a single cent to watch this festering canker sore of a film.\n\n~ The previous review will suffice for your Freidberg-Seltzer film of choice~"

Honestly i cant say i have ever seen a movie as bad as this in my entire life. This movie makes gigli look like an OK movie. There isn't one funny moment in the entire movie it is basically all crappy acting mixed with crappy comedy. The only way you could possibly find this funny is if you are high or have an IQ lower then 30. Kim Kardashian and Carmen ELectra's acting is so atrocious i actually kind of felt sick while watching it. I mean you would be way better off watching KIm's sex tape cause at least its more entertaining then this movie. I highly advise everyone to not see this movie ever and try to get these to directors to never make another god awful movie again. Its kind of sad 2 grown men find this funny. PATHETIC"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. I'll tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.\n\nRemember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well I've been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money craving whores. And their latest movie proves this even more so.\n\nThe movie fails so easily its mind blowing. I mean nothing was funny in the trailer, and people usually put the best stuff in them (like idiots sometimes).\n\nI knew it was going to be bad, but I made a bet with my \"friends\" and that wasn't a good idea at all. I have to write movie reviews in a paper and tell everyone whats good and whats bad, same for my friends. We flipped on who has to review it...Why me? Well I'm warning you at least. It shouldn't even be called a movie, nothing about it is artistic or original. The jokes..I'm sorry, the references are made throughout at pretty much random, like the Hannah Montana or the Juno gig (they were actually close to spoofing it, but failed by referencing instead of joking and twisting it).\n\nOh and please, the random wrestling scene? I don't know about you other guys, but I have high respect for women, and I have a high respect for film-making. What I do know is you shouldn't have something in a movie that doesn't add up to the story or anything. Nudity is not really needed (Titanic was the closest exception, but still you would've gotten the idea if you only saw her bare legs.) Now I hate it when a girl says all guys are the same, perverts and brainless (and if you disagree with what I said about the nudity in a film, you might be one of them unless you actually believe it has a point), and sadly this film just makes that stereotype a little bigger. Thats if anyone watches it, which hahahaha!!! By the way, when I said movies should have scenes and only scenes that add up to the main plot, that was the ticket right there to say that this movie fails. Yup, just like that. Perhaps I'm grading too hard for these guys. I mean its a brainless movie...Nope, they deserve it. Besides thats the best part about reviewing a bad movie, you get to rip it inside out. Thats if you know how to grade a movie correctly.\n\nBut lastly (well I've got about 4 scores worth of bad movies I need to write about, but whatever) the main idea about spoofing was brand new when Airplane! came out. Same with Naked Gun. And whenever something random came into play, the story was still progressing. For example, the arrow in Airplane! shooting out of nowhere: random, yes, but the story was still movie and no one was distracted except the audience. Perfect. Naked Gun, not only was it spoofing cop films and others, but it also had its own jokes. Same with Airplane! Anyways this movie was made for money, not to tell people a story. Simple as that, and never flip a dang coin to determine something that could be life threatening.\n\nI give it a 1 out of a 10. Just do yourself a favor and watch good movies, or mediocre for that matter."

I thought Disaster Movie crude, lazy and looming towards offensive, (what they said about Amy Winehouse was bang out of order) and some of the repeated gags wore well thin before the first attempt was finished. The script was laughable, the writers display no comedic talent and there is a complete lack of laughs, and I am sorry I found the characters very annoying, Giselle especially. The acting was terrible, in all my life, I have never seen such terrible acting, and believe me, I have seen a lot of films with terrible acting. Matt Lanter and Vanessa Minillo were not only given next to nothing to work with, likewise with Tony Cox, but their performances went nowhere. Everyone else was bad too, especially Carmen Electra, whose career I am surprised isn't over yet, in every film she's in, she shows a complete lack of acting ability. The film looked as though it had been shot on a cheap studio set, and even the soundtrack was awful. Plus the title was completely irrelevant, very rarely did it spoof a disaster movie, all it did was try and be funny and failed miserably. Not even the characters spoofed here like Batman, the Chipmumks(a gross ditortion in character and more disturbing than cute and funny) and Hellboy could save this contemptible piece of excrement(I am trying to refrain from swearing, honestly I was seriously considering turning the DVD player off 20 minutes into the movie). My dad and brother told me it was very stupid, but unlike them, I am 17 by the way, I didn't find it entertaining in the least bit. If you want a good spoof try the silly but otherwise hilarious Loaded Weapon 1! Avoid this thing at all costs! I rest my case, 0/10. Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was on TV once so I decided to watch it since I wouldn't have to pay any money for it.\n\nThe main character Will (played by Matt Lanter) has a dream where he meets a stone age Amy Winehouse (I think it's supposed to be a joke) who tells him that the world is going to end the day this movie premiered in the cinema (Coincidence?) and to stop it they must find a crystal skull. Matt later wakes up to celebrate his super-sweet sixteenth birthday (despite him being in his twenties) in a scene where we get one unfunny joke and celebrity impersonation after another. Then disaster strikes (it seems kinda redundant though since this movie already is one), hurricanes, earthquakes, meteorites and other classic disaster movie ingredients hit planet earth one after another. Will, followed by his friends: Juney (Crista Flanagan), Calvin (Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson), and Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go out into the city and tries to find his girlfriend and a safe place and later realizes that he has to find the crystal skull to set things right.\n\nThe problem with this movie is, just like other movies by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, that it doesn't stay on the theme but goes all over the place and try to spoof almost every popular movie that was made that year. And I use the term \"spoof\" lightly. Once again \"Seltzerberger\" show that they only grasp the most superficial concept of what humor is and never really bother to dig deeper and see what it is that makes things funny. Sometimes doing things outside the theme can work but not if it takes up a majority of the movie. And (for me) this movie is worse than Epic Movie. Yes you read right, Worse than Epic Movie. That movie at least had a story. Sure it was borrowed and \"crapified\" but at least it was a story. In this movie, everything that happens during the second act, when they try to find a safe place/figure out where they should go, just feels like a filler where the gang stumble into one reference after another. \"Seltzerberger's\" over-reliance on potty humor, movie/TV references, random musical numbers, deliberately obvious stunt-doubles and crappy special effects does not save them this time.\n\nSeltzer and Friedberg, your movie sucks horribly. If I may paraphrase a line from \"Billy Madison\" I'd like to say: I award you only one star, and may God have mercy on your souls.\n\nOnce again, if you want to see a GOOD movie made in the style that this train wreck was trying (and failing) to emulate, watch \"Hotshots\" \"Airplane!\", \"The naked gun\" movies, \"Top Secret\" instead."

In fact, this film is almost entirely made up of 'parody' versions of clips from other films that were only taken from the trailers from said movies- the vast majority of which aren't disaster movies in the first place. How this is supposed to pass for a comedy film when it has no plot, virtually no parody and fewer jokes than the most dirgeful funeral I have attended is beyond me. Perhaps that is the joke? If so, it's not funny.\n\nWhilst the rest of the genre made by (some of) the same production team such as Date Movie and Superhero Movie at least made parodical reference and jokes based upon films from the genre the relevant film was named after, Disaster Movie instead is just a description of what the end product turned out to be. We can but hope that this film puts nails in the coffin of the directors careers so they can go and be more productive in the film industry sweeping floors or emptying bins- footage of which would be more entertaining than this drivel.\n\nMark my words- no matter how bored you are, how cheap this becomes on disk or how free it may be on the internet- do not waste your time watching it. You will only regret the loss of those precious minutes of your life, which could have been spent more satisfyingly and less painfully by watching paint dry whilst being beaten about the head with a mallet.\n\nForced watching of this film should be added to the bans under the Geneva Convention as torture.

There were no character developments, there were no disaster movies spoofs(the only disaster things happening in the movie were meteors falling which were only 2 by the way). To tell you all the truth, I only chuckled once or twice(at the Juno parts). The rest of the jokes were either dumb, immature, or just recycled garbage from past movies.\n\nSo to tell you all right now I have to say one thing about this movie: Don't see it, it's no improvement from previous spoof mistakes.\n\nRating: 1 out of 10"

They have brought us the \"stupid\" comedies like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, pretty much all those movies have had the same hate, I can understand why. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are like the kids in high school who just cruised by, just failing every class possible, being happy with the C's and D's, then they somehow get into Princeton because their parents had money or something, it's the exact same thing with movies. The way that I just happen to look at these movies is that they are like a MAD TV spoof, just mindless entertainment. I hated Date Movie, didn't mind Epic Movie, liked Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie is a notch lower than Meet the Spartans. We have recycled jokes from the guy's previous movies, jokes that drag on and on to the point where you'll tear your hair out, and is of course, made badly.\n\nWill has had a dream that he feels like the end of the world is coming. All of a sudden the city is attacked Cloverfield style, he and his friends run around trying to find shelter and figure out what is going on while bumping into one celebrity after another. But even Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk, and Hancock can not save this world. Will and his friends realize that they have to save the world on their own and fight evil chipmunks, aliens, and flying cows.\n\nDisaster Movie, actually does have a couple laughs, I will admit that, I nearly died laughing during the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody, it was so badly funny, I just couldn't help but laugh. There are just some fun moments, I think it's ridicules that some people can not admit that. That's the reason for my title is because I saw a lot of comments from users that didn't even involve them seeing the movie, they were just complaining... this isn't the IMDb that I know, it's silly that people are just putting on comments that have nothing to do with their opinion on why they hate the movie before they even see it. Back onto the movie, my main thing that I'm upset with, this movie didn't need a script, it seems as if Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer just made it up as they went along. For some reason we have movies that were literally just released last month like Wanted and Hancock, not to mention The Dark Knight. I think they just coursed their way through this, while the movie has some funny moments, my HONEST opinion, if you want to see this I suggest the rental, this is straight to DVD quality.\n\n1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The writing of this movie is truly inventive. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have figured out how to make movies with no plots, based on movies they have only seen the trailers to, and these movies have such low budgets, that they still make money. Even with the low budget, they have an all star cast, full of bad Madtv actors, Carmen Electra and even the legendary Tony Cox. The acting, writing and direction all sparkle like the latrines of a diarrhea filled bathroom. This movie might be on par with Schindler's List for the amount of laughs, or there lack of. Honestly, though, this movie is one of the most god awful things ever made. Even their last all time low Meet the Spartans was topped in terms of horrible writing and direction, and the current rating of a 1.3 shows that Mr. Friedberg, Mr. Seltzer and their other writing partner Satan can't get much worse.\n\nDisaster Movie...what a title for this, considering not one Disaster Movie is spoofed. Every movie here is one that came out within the last year, many which came out after this piece of garbage was written, and not one of them was a disaster movie. I guess they did a parody of Twister with the cow falling, but being the geniuses these two gems of writers are, they probably haven't seen Twister and just thought it would be funny to have a cow crush Iron Man. I was practically wetting my pants with some of this material. The Hulk's pants fall off, then he's hit by a cow. Duh, haha, duh, that's some good stuff. I think the target audience of this movie must be two year old mentally unstable children, and even they would find the humor a bit too dumb and immature.\n\nOnto the plot of this winner. Will (Matt Lanter) has a dream that he's in 10,001 B.C. and he fights the Wolf from American Galdiators and meets Amy Winehouse who burps for like ten minutes on him, then gives him the Crystal Skull. He wakes up to find his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) is leaving him for Flava Flave and little man Jojo. He throws a super duper sweet sixteen, despite that he is 25, and then a High School Musical number goes on, and then Calvin (played by the wonderful G. Thang) tries to curve a bullet, then Carmen Electra gets in a battle with other beauty Kimberly Kardashian, then Junie sings, and then later Javier Bardem, Prince Caspian, Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf and a police officer are all played by Ike Barinholtz, and thousands of sub-plots and movie spoofs of every recent movie comes in.\n\nI must admit, I laughed more here than in Meet the Spartans. Meet the Spartans produced about .5 chuckles, where this in total produced maybe 1 chuckle out of stupidity. The laughs were obviously infrequent, considering there was only 1 in this 75 minute collage of badly reproduced movies. The acting is actually not too bad in comparison to Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie, but the overall enjoyment level of none was reduced to less than none. It's sad movies like this could be made (let alone be called movies). This was the most awful putrid flick to ever appear on the big screen, and as long as it makes money, each year we will be treated to even worse movies from these swell writers and directors.\n\nOverall, this was not the best movie around, in fact, it was the worst. Avoid this at all costs. If it was a choice between this movie and death, it would be a tough choice.\n\nMy rating: BOMB out of ****. 75 mins. PG-13 for stupid humor and poopoo mouth."

They pick and choose which movies to parody thoroughly, and which are simply two-second cameos (an example would be \"Iron Man\", the title character of which is flattened into a tin can---literally---only a few seconds after his arrival). Their care and caution certainly pays off in a mostly hilarious film that satisfies those tired of the same summer blockbuster garbage or overrated indie art-house junk. Perhaps people do not like the Selter-Friedburg movies because they eschew subtlety altogether and \"tell\" rather than \"show\" why they are parodying a particular movie or celebrity. Still, it was fun to see art-house darling \"Juno\" literally torn to shreds (I did not see \"Juno\", but Seltzer/Friedburg let me know what the character of the original was like by mocking her dialogue) by demonic Muppet chipmunks. Finally, Seltzer and Friedburg do good by killing off the sadistic villain from that overrated indie gore-fest \"No Country For Old Men\". And what's not to like about a gratuitous girl fight between two very beautiful women, Kim Kardashian and Carmen Electra?\n\nIn short: the directors were judicious in what they chose to parody, the actors (especially the versatile Nicole Parker) did very well (Kim Kardashian was not too terrible to watch as a first-timer), and the carnivorous, devilish, cheap-looking chipmunk puppets kept me gasping for air with laughter. It's far from the worst movie ever, and those courageous enough to brave the critics' venom will find quite a treat."

At the beginning of this year in January, they did \"Meet the Spartans\", which opened at #1 and spoofed the entire script of \"300\". I saw that film and thought that it was going to be the worst movie of the year.\n\nAfter seeing this one, I can say \"Disaster Movie\" is quite possibly the worst movie ever. I mean, it really is the worst movie ever made and released. You can put it straight to DVD or Blu-ray, and it still wouldn't be funny. You can air it as a made-for-TV movie, and it still wouldn't be funny. You can make it into a TV show pilot, and it still wouldn't get picked up. You can even get \"MAD TV\" canceled by including this as one of their skits.\n\nWhat throws the whole movie is that the jokes are continuous every 4 seconds and never have any humor. Every time you think they will forget something, they end up spoofing it. They actually try to spoof every movie made this year. And they even try to include every TV character and celebrity in their jokes. It just doesn't amuse, and it just doesn't quit. They really have no idea of when to quit.\n\nBut the real reason why the jokes aren't funny is that it's inaccurate, overused, and butchered poorly. They spoof \"High School Musical\" with the main characters, and they poorly spoof Gabriella as a cheerleader, which she never was. They spoof \"Kung Fu Panda\", an animated movie, using a robot panda that looks like a panda in the real world. The performance they did with \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" will give you so many nightmares, you would rather the 2007 version over this movie. The idea to use a male actor to play Carrie Bradshaw in the \"Sex & The City\" spoof is too desperate, too obvious, and worst of all, so wrong. And the other jokes used have been used already in their other movies, used already in other spoof movies, and are too old to even try and would have been used at the appropriate time.\n\nThis movie doesn't even spoof disaster films in general, unless if you can find any real \"Cloverfield\" spoofs. Some of the spoofs aren't actually in the movie and rather used as promotional ads. All they try to do is give many films and A-list Hollywood stars the roasting they \"deserve\". In reality, they destroy the \"parody film\" genre again and with more damage that a lot of people would rather stop making fun of them in movies like this. Normally, you can actually expect a film parody to be declared the worst movie ever by many people. But I guarantee that there is not and will not ever be a movie as worse as this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Anyone going into this film would automatically assume it would suck. The other films in the ______ Movie franchise have been garbage. Ladies and gentlemen, Disaster Movie is different.\n\nThe film is so funny and spot on with the spoofs that I almost died from laughter. All the actors turn in near perfect parodies of their characters. I actually thought I was watching Juno and her baby fight Sarah Jessica Parker from Sex And The City. The guy who played Hancock could be a twin for Will Smith, that is how good he is. He channel the Hancock character so well that I thought I was watching the Hancock sequel.\n\nThe film is so witty and on the spot with it's comedy, it feels natural. So natural that there probably was no script. With a film like this, the joke write themselves. Throw whatever story you want in because it's the comedy here that works. On second thought, the story works too. It's leap and bounds over films that have been Oscar nominated. The story centre's around these people and a crystal skull and some disaster that happens. Everything about it works.\n\nThe fight scenes are phenomenal. G. Thang plays a character called Calvin, he has a fight scene with a real life panda. Or at least I thought it was a real life panda, the animatronics and special effects in this film will rival Avatar, and it came out a year before it!!! Take that James Cameron. The fight between the two is so well choreographed that it makes Jackie Chan and his stunts look like child's play.\n\nThe film has so many unexpected events. Who knew that a meteorite would come crashing down on Kim Kardashian. I sure didn't. Speaking of Kim, she is more than just another pretty face. She was channeling something else here, I think she must have been in character for months before and after this film, because it is just too phenomenal. Daniel Day Lewis should be offering her his Oscar, that's how good she is.\n\nIke Barinholtz, of MADtv fame, pulls an Eddie Murphy and a Mike Myers, by playing multiple roles. His range is out of this world. Who else could be able to pull off Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf, a police officer and Javier Bardem look a like, and Prince Caspian. I can only think of one man...and that is Ike Barniholtz.\n\nI can't stop recommending this film. It's what the movies and film and cinema is all about. I wish I could watch it everyday for the rest of my life. Which is why I'm giving this the absolute best rating I can possibly give a film like this."

For a spoof film to have no satirical content and just have footage of superheroes flying into walls and various other stupidity. And what the hell is up with the Juno and sex in the city bit? That is without a doubt the weirdest bit in movie history do you really think the woman who wrote Juno is going to see her characters baby kick a woman in the face and go, oh I got burned. Also what's with the bikini girls running away from meteors? That's just kind of sexist.\n\nThe plot is ridiculously thin it's just people avoiding meteors.

I have no idea who any of these actors are (I refuse to acknowledge Kim Kardashian as an actress after all the awful things SHE'S put out) but pretty much any hope they've ever had of a career was more or less destroyed by this movie. I'm still baffled that Tim Curry managed to survive Scary Movie 2.\n\nThe plot... There is no plot. There is no story. There is no CONFLICT. It's just a group of stupid kids going around ripping off every single movie made in recent years (at the time of its release) while tornadoes and other disasters strike the area.\n\nI wish a tornado had struck this movie during production...\n\nAnd remember how previous Seltzer and Friedberg movies had \"parodied\" genre films (if you're using the definition of someone who doesn't know what parody is)that they were named after? Of course not, seeing as like me you've tried to pretend these movies never existed up to this point, but humor me on this. The title itself is a complete lie, holding no ties to the genre from which it takes its name other than being a complete disaster in and of itself.\n\nConsider this my review for ALL Seltzer and Friedberg movies: they're all a huge pile of cinematic fodder that should be cremated, buried and forgotten and their creators kicked out of Planet Earth."

This proved me wrong\n\nUtter tripe"

This however, borders on the lines of disgracefulness.\n\nMatt Lanter prancing around for the entire duration with woeful lines and abysmal acting may appeal to the less intellectual women who need to keep there eyes occupied for approximately an hour and a half. However, everyone else will be left feeling mugged, either for the fact they have wasted their precious lives on this drivel, or - even worse - they have spent good money on this drivel.\n\nI think my verdict is loud and clear!"

It's an easy way to make money, they have fun filming, and I'm sure they love to read about how they did.\n\nI know films are for viewers entertainment, but to be honest, I thought that this was definitely an improvement since Meet the Spartans (Which I hated with a passion). Disaster Movie was a fun movie, and I had fun going to see it for the one and only time that I ever will. So if you're one of the people complaining about how these films keep coming out, then just stop watching them ,and forget about it.

Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be fired after making 4 bad movies in one career.

All four movies they made: Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, and this are all unfunny. Kids and teenagers are seeing this because of the commercials advertising this movie. I recommend you not going to see it and the agony booth recap for Epic Movie is funnier than this.

I found this movie disjointed and it just basically struggled. I would be interested to know if anyone found it remotely funny. I gave it a 1, but it should be minus 10. I first saw the unbelievably hot Vanessa Minnillo in the TV show \"True Beauty\" and thought that she was pretty good in that. It is hard to believe that she went from the host of a TV reality show giving a good performance and then blew her credibility out the window by actually agreeing to participate in this garbage. I knew that this movie was going to blow by the four minute mark but I persisted with it hoping that it would get better or I would get a chuckle every now and then - but no - FAIL!!!

I sat squirming in my seat for 45 minutes of this film, and i consider myself i failure for not walking out sooner. The references to other (far better) films are so painful that you want to stab the film. Literally. Many (in fact come to think about perhaps all) of the \"Jokes\" are merely the appearance of another film's character, which are badly impersonated and contain no satire on the character at all, just a fart joke or something equally pathetic.\n\nAre Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer perhaps worthy of being hated even more than Uwe Boll?

The movie is full of Mad TV rejects and dropouts that the writers/directors have given sub-par jokes/gags to. The bottom line is this movie is an insult to your intelligence, and an insult to the movies they \"spoof\". I think that Failburg and Seltzerwater (I personally like their name change, thanks to another writer on here) need to go back and watch some real spoof movies like Space Balls, or Monty Python: Search for the Holy Grail, even Robin Hood: Men In Tights or Naked Gun. I will tell you this, I walked out of the movie after about 30 minutes. I got tired of seeing movies that were clearly better than any of the movies by these two jokers will ever be get dragged through the dirt with stupid, ill-written, badly performed, mindless comedy. It's clear that the writers and directors of this movie have severe ADD and have an IQ of about 30, which is what you'll need to actually enjoy this movie.

Schindler's List, while a serious and tragic film, had some funny parts. For example, the scene where Oscar Schindler is looking for a secretary. Each secretary is more attractive and a worse typist than the last, and Oscar (a notorious womanizer) keeps leaning in more and more. Then it cuts to a homely woman typing really fast and Oscar leaning as far away as possible. So he hires all of them. That is funny.\n\nIf you had to list a movie on par with Disaster Movie in terms of laughs per movie, I would compare it to Salo: or The 120 Days of Sodom. However, Salo, disturbing as it is, is art with social messages. This Epically Disastrous Spartan Date franchise has no redemptive properties whatsoever."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be ashamed of themselves. Completely and utterly.\n\nI'm an extremely easy guy to please, especially when it comes to movies. I'm the one guy in the room who will admit to having enjoyed \"Pluto Nash\" and \"The Mummy 3.\" I'm the guy who will try to find something in every film to like. I enjoy movies, and am very rarely disappointed in them.\n\nExcept for films like this, which are complete and utter idiotic failures by every stretch of the imagination. The team of Friedberg and Seltzer, whom are responsible for this abomination, should be ashamed. They have fundamentally failed understanding or displaying even the most basic ideas of filmmaking and comedy. They have failed with this film in a way which I have never before witnessed. This movie has literally made me angry in the few times I tried to sit through it, it was so insulting.\n\nHow can they release such complete and utter trash like this? I actually cannot comprehend how they could have so little respect for the audience that this filth would be released.\n\nOK, fine, I'll write an actual review. But this film ain't pretty.\n\nThis film has no plot. Literally no plot. It revolves around a group of people fleeing various disasters, while encountering a random array of pop-culture figures (including Batman, Amy Whinehouse, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, Princess Giselle from \"Enchanted\", Iron Man, Hellboy, Flava Flav, Juno from \"Juno\", etc.) who show up without any hint of irony or humor, introduce themselves to the camera, then awkwardly leave after a failed attempt or two at humor. Eventually they encounter a dwarf that is supposed to be Indiana Jones (played by Tony Cox) who tells them that in order to stop the disasters, they have to return a Crystal Skull to an altar. That's it. That's the plot.\n\nThe acting is atrocious all around. The main actors are completely unlikable and their characters are made into incredible jerks. (We're supposed to root for our hero to get back his girlfriend even though she's some sort of serial cheater, and the main character is the single most bland, undeveloped person you could ever encounter.) The celebrity look alikes don't resemble the celebrities they are \"parodying\" in the least and make no attempt to sound or act like them. (Nicole Parker is the only one to come vaguely close as the parody of Princess Giselle from \"Enchanted\", but it still fails and is ruined by a random joke that destroys the character completely)\n\nYou may notice I put \"parodying\" in quotes above. This is because, by definition, this film fails to serve as parody even though it's meant to be. Parody is by definition meant to comment upon or mock established original works through humor and satire. This film doesn't do that, the characters merely show up without making any sort of comment on the original works, and are too unfunny to mock them, hence, this fails at becoming parody, hence, it isn't parody, and Seltzer/Friedberg failed at making what they set out to.\n\nThe production is among the worst I've seen. The direction is stale and uninspired to the point of frustration for the viewer. The special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen. I've seen YouTube clips made by 12-year-olds with high production values than this. Costume and set design is painfully bad. The editing is abysmal and destroys a lot of the jokes, the animatronics are just crap. This is one of the worst productions I've ever seen.\n\nAnd the humor makes no sense. Every joke in this movie falls flat as a pancake. Jokes have no set-up, no humor, no irony and no payoff. It's just random quips and nonsensical pop-culture references that date the film horribly.\n\nI really just an thrown a loop as to how Seltzer/Friendberg can live with themselves knowing they make films like this. This is by far their worst film, but all of their other films are nearly this bad as well. It's honestly upsetting. They have no respect for audiences, no respect for their actors, and no creativity.\n\nThis is without a doubt the worst film of 2008. It's without a doubt the worst film of the 2000-20009 decade. And it is possibly the worst film since the birth of cinema. This makes films like \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" and \"Space Mutiny\" look like high art. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, you should be ashamed. 1 out of 10."

Well, it's more of a reference point for pop culture of 2007/2008.\n\nThe (laughing uncontrollably) \"story\" focuses on a group of worthless, one dimensional heroes who band together to save the world from a mysterious apocalypse that has something to do with Batman, Indiana Jones, The Hulk, Sex and the City, Speed Racer and Alvin & the Chipmunks. We also get a whole LOT of tasteless jokes concerning boobs, near-naked people, sh**, and blood. What does ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH DISASTER MOVIES????!!!!!!!!!!!!! On top of all that, I find the humor directed towards women to be highly offensive and tasteless. What's funny about constantly referring to women as bitches? The cast is really hit and miss. Carmen Electra (the poor man's Leslie Nielsen) is very beautiful, but she has demonstrated a complete lack of acting talent. Nicole Parker is mildly amusing as Enchanted Princess but a little of it goes a long, looong, way. The rest of this miserable bunch is more or less the same.\n\nSo, is it all bad? Hell yes! But Tony Cox is amusing in a parody of Indiana Jones and the film is entertaining in a camp sort of way but other than that, this film is quite simply bad. So in the words of Siskel & Ebert thumbs down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down."

I enjoy all the pop culture references and how accurate they were to what they were portraying. The part with Dr. Phil was excellent, and I enjoyed it especially when he got shot. It's hilarious; I cannot emphasize that enough. Take your friends, your family, and even your dog to see this movie. It will provide great memories for many generations to come.

With the taste of what I believed to be a great, hilarious movie still on the tip of my tongue, I decided to give this movie a chance and to my own surprise... I was mildly entertained.\n\nNo, this movie isn't great, it was never going to be, but there are some very entertaining and hilarious moments in it, which kept me in my seat wanting more. The actors weren't great; we'll its pretty much the cast of MadTV but actress Nicole Parker pulled off her role well and stole the show for me as the Enchanted Princess.\n\nFor me this movie wasn't great but it was okay \u0096 I guess it all really depends on what mood you're in \u0096 If it's silly and careless, then you will have a giggle \u0096 If it is serious and apathetic, you will hate it. For hesitant viewers wondering whether or not to pay a few bucks to go see this in the theatre, I say \"Don't bother\" Wait for it to come to DVD, haggle it for a 50 cents and then watch it."

I mean, there sorta kinda are four main characters, but they're basically just mannequins who stand there while unfunny things happen around them. The order of the scenes honestly doesn't matter at all, this is almost like a sketch movie but without the punchlines. I'm not a big fan of writing classes (read my reviews for further proof), but what ever happened to the classic story structure where protagonists have to reach some kind of goal while fighting some kind of adversity? Have I just gotten too old-fashioned for the movies, is this the kind of experimental filmmaking that will become a standard for further generations? Well, as of this writing this movie's got a whopping 1.9 rating, so I think I'm safe. Got to admit though, I did laugh once during the otherwise terrible \"Sex and The City\"-spoof.

All of them were horrendous, but moderately successful in the box office. For the Labor Day weekend, they released their latest gem, Disaster Movie, in which they whipped up in a month. Please note that this was a spoof film that went through the entire production, without ever seeing the movie, only the trailers.\n\nThe plot is very simple. Over the course of one evening, a group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events. A large problem with this is that there is no time for character development, and the viewer wouldn't care anyway due to the lack of stars in the movie. These events could be tornadoes, rabid chipmunks or just a random fistfight.\n\nI found it very difficult to believe that this movie was actually a true spoof on disaster movies and it is most likely to be spoofing movies from this summer. This movie doesn't even work as the traditional spoof movie does where it uses only one film, this movie much less interesting spoofs of movies that will be forgotten about in a few years, making this movie no longer relevant. They makers think they can get away with having some unoriginal character come on and off thirty seconds later. These include what if Batman was an idiot, or if Iron Man was crushed by a cow, or if the Hulk gets crushed by a cow. The material clearly isn't funny but it's trying to be which is the most important factor for this movie to fail miserably. Why have the same two actors play all of the parts, they're not fooling anyone.\n\nThis movie is truly awful and unwatchable, which is not something I can often say about the movies I see. There should be no excuse for a comedy to have more hip hop dance (4) sequences than laughs. I do not recommend this movie because it is an enormous waste of everyone's time, except if you're writing up a review of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Once while walking in the street I accidentally walked head first into a post. That was more fun than watching Disaster Movie. Clearly not satisfied with Epic Movie and Meet The Spartans, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (Alarm bells) take us even further down the cinematic hell hole with Disaster Movie: A vile, putrid, excruciatingly unfunny, painfully awful comedy catastrophe which is a contender for one of the very worst movies ever created. In the film a bunch of repulsive 20 somethings try to save someone trapped at a museum going through a laughably un-tense apocalypse. Normally in reviews I talk about positives but there are absolutely none. It's racist, sexist, homophobic and utterly disgusting with some of the most putrid jokes I've ever seen. Watching the film is like having your head shoved down a stinking toilet for 90 minutes. This is the kind of film which will enrage both film fans and aspiring directors or screenwriters. Why are Friedberg and Seltzer allowed to make movies when they clearly can't direct or write their way out of a tissue packet?\n\nThe acting is atrocious; all of the actors are terrible with Kim Kardashian who can't breathe convincingly being the worst. The direction... there isn't any. The film has less visual appeal than a puddle of sick and there is no art in it whatsoever. The script is one of the worst ever written. One entire set piece consists of cows crushing the Marvel superheroes... that's it while another is the coin toss scene from No Country For Old Men being replayed word for word. The fact like films like NCFOM or Indiana Jones or Enchanted, all good films, could actually be referenced in a film like this is absolutely appalling. Disaster Movie is a perfect example of how low cinema can go, and deserves to be regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. It doesn't have any merit whatsoever and is simply Friedberg and Seltzer, who are now my least favourite directors even though I've seen just 2 of their movies, forcing their juvenile, lazy, ugly and pathetic humour down our throats in the most boring, lame and unbearable way imaginable. File this under use for your cat's litter tray. Then maybe it'll finally have a purpose.\n\n0/10"

Because if you are I suggest you go and do something more enjoyable, like eating glass or ripping out your own eyeballs.\n\nSoon as I saw the names Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer in the opening credits a chill was sent down my spine...I knew those responsible for the appalling 'Meet the Spartans' were behind this so-called film, and once again Friedberg & Seltzer haven't failed to meet expectations, and have spewed out another blindly awful comedy.\n\nThe main problem is the jokes just aren't funny. The script is very badly written, and the film very badly directed. If it was directed that is, because it just seems that a load of scenes have been thrown together to create a clumsy, incoherent mess. Rather than concentrating on producing decent material, it seems Friedberg and his little friend Seltzer only care about throwing in as many satirical celebrity figures as possible. None of them funny.\n\nNever have I watched a film that's been so bad it's made me angry. The fact is, if a comedy ever has the names: Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer in it, stay well away, because it will be guaranteed to be another Disaster Movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, I'm not at all considered a movie critic of any sort. My expertise on movies derives from the sole fact that I've seen so many, and usually keep up on most current flicks. I also don't write reviews like this often.\n\nHowever, sometimes I see a movie that is so incredibly awful, that I can no longer hold my tongue. This is a perfect example of such a creation. There are so many negatives to focus on, there's no way I'll get through them all before I suffer a massive brain aneurysm, as I nearly did watching this pathetic excuse of a motion picture.\n\nIf you see Carmen Electra in ANY movie these days, you can bet it's going to be total crap (I wasn't even a fan of the Scary Movie series, so my opinion may be biased to some of you). She had a part in \"Meet the Spartans\" as well, which is easily tied with this monstrosity as \"Worst Movie of 2008\", possibly even the decade. Kim Cardashian is in this movie! Enough said. Vanessa Minnillo? Yeah, she's pretty. Just continue with that. The abundance of tight female abs, bras, boobs and overall sex appeal wasn't at all, in any way shape or form enough to make this movie even a small fraction more tolerable.\n\nThe cameos were lame. The impersonations were half-assed and done by actors/actresses that don't at all resemble the person they were hired to imitate.\n\nThis movie also seems to revolve around characters getting squashed by random objects falling from the sky. That's not funny in most scenarios anyway. Imagine that same occurrence being thrown at you several times throughout a movie. Each time, prefaced and followed by some lackluster line delivered by a poor actor/actress.\n\nThere's ONE positive I can think of, and that's the Juno character, whose name is Juney, played by Crista Flanagan. I found that character to be funny AT TIMES, but that's because I'm highly sarcastic myself and find such humor amusing.\n\nThe general spoofs throughout are uninspired, clich\u00e9, and poorly executed.\n\nThere were several musical parts in the movie as well. I don't enjoy such things in movies most would consider good. To add them to a movie as atrocious as this, and make them as pathetic as the rest of the movie, is flat out torture for all viewers.\n\nI'm nearing the fabled aneurysm I spoke of earlier, so I'll stop, as I did with this movie one hour into it. No, I didn't finish it, and if any of you have an ounce of dignity, you'll do the same, or not watch it at all.\n\nI don't feel I need to provide you with any other evidence to contribute to your decision to not watch this. What I've said should deter anybody from watching this.\n\nIt is %*&^ing awful."

Most of the movie consists of 1. throwing in as many references from other movies as possible, in context to absolutely nothing and 2. abysmal rap numbers every 5-10 minutes, that just made me want to bash my head in with a hammer. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this piece of crap."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The human race has one really effective weapon, and that is laughter.\"\n\n-Mark Twain\n\nI am not sure when it became OK to keep making movies that virtually no one goes to see, but in the case of the recent plethora of spoof films I for one am glad that they continue.\n\nNow I know a lot of people out there cannot even fathom why people would enjoy such stupidity, but that is just it, you don't need to understand, sometimes people should just let go and be stupid.\n\nStupid is the perfect word to describe \"Disaster Movie\" actually no matter how many times you say the word stupid, it would never be enough to justify just how stupid it is. But for me I absolutely love these stupid spoof movies.\n\nThe \"story\", and I use this word very lightly, gives us Will, who is right in the middle of his Super Duper Sweeet Sixteen (even though he is actually 25) when the world starts coming under attack, from mostly meteorites, and tornado's, and earthquakes. Loosley following the \"Cloverfeild\" plot, Will must reach his girlfriend who is trapped in the Museum where she works.\n\nBut does he have to do this alone? Of course not, there are plenty of stupid characters and even stupider obstacles that he must overcome.\n\nBy far the best spoof on a character here is Juno, played by Crista Flannigan, who has done this before on Mad TV I think, she had me rolling on the floor more than anyone. Second to her is Nicole Parker, who is hilarious as Amy Winehouse, Jessica Simpson, but most of all the princess from Enchanted. Who is not actually a princess but a drugged out homeless chick, F-ing hilarious.\n\nOf course no movie is safe, everything from the past year gets made fun off, from Indiana Jones, all the way to Step Up. Most are funny some are really stupid.\n\nThe one bad thing that I have to say, is that some of the Spoofs lasted way longer than they needed to, it should be spoof, spoof, spoof, story advance. Only it is Spooooooooof, Spoooooof, story advance. And how many characters does Ike Barenholts need to play, seriously its like they didn't have the budget for more actors. But he was pretty funny.\n\nAll in all this was really good, definitely better than last years \"Meet the Spartans\" not as good as \"Scary Movie\" so I would rank it up there with \"Epic Movie\" which I thought was also great. If you like stupid, and you are not old enough to see \"College\" then you should really check this out."

        "review_detailed_main": "Someone needs to tell the producers, the authors, the director, and everyone else involved in this film that mere imitation is not parody. To make a film satirizing whatever pop-culture is current, it isn't enough just to string together a bunch of skits imitating those pop-culture icons. Each parody must not only imitate, but caricature the icon, whether it be a person, a particular movie, a hot toy, or whatever. It must be able to point out the absurdity of popularism while still being, in and of itself, funny as well. I can go around with a giant clock on a chain around my neck and use Blackjack gum to make myself look as if I have bad teeth, but if I don't also have something both original AND funny to say about Flava Flav, then I am merely an imitator, not a satirist.\n\nThese filmmakers may have hit it big with prior efforts, but this one was clearly phoned in. What is sad is that the bulk of the movie is so sadly, embarrassingly bad, that when the one or two genuinely funny moments occur (one character \"bends\" a bullet a little too much and it hooks around 360 degrees, hitting the person he was trying to avoid anyway) the audience is so stunned they forget to laugh, as if asking themselves if they really did see something genuinely funny or was so much of their intelligence already sucked away by this toilet of a movie that they are imagining humor where it doesn't really exist? It is wicked hard to get a genuinely original and entertaining film made in Hollywood these days, bad form by these filmmakers to take money that could well have gone into a much better project and squandering it on this four reels of rubbish!"

I wish I could give it a vote less than 1. How bad was it? Okay, my spouse and I watch a lot of movies; at least five a week borrowed from the library. (If we had rented this one, I'd be screaming my head off for a refund!) We watch on big screen in a double recliner. To watch \"Disaster Movie\" on a chilly evening, we were snuggled up under a woolen throw, and our cat was on my lap. She has never before offered comment on a movie, except to maybe get up an leave during particularly noisy ones. During \"Disaster Movie,\" about halfway through, she sat up and upchucked in my lap.

The film has NO narrative, NO visual style and NO plot, save that of trying to cram as many playground 'jokes' and pop-culture references as possible, often so cheap and poorly done they have to be signposted. The parodying style they are searching for is redundant cos they don't know what they're parodying, and as for the disaster movies sent-up I counted one, maybe two in a film referencing things like Juno, Sex And The City and Alvin and the Chipmunks(???).

If you saw this movie through to the end, you must be: mentally handicapped, hiding from the police in an empty theater, homeless not looking to be hassled by any member of the public, suffering from a massive head injury or perhaps you were actually in the movie or worked on it. If the latter is the case, I wouldn't tell anyone about it.\n\nIf you are a producer of this movie, I would like to thank you. It takes horrible pieces of trash like this so people have something to compare an unwatchable waste of time to a decent film. I applaud your bravery in writing a check to help educate us all. Now we have something truly bad to compare every other movie to.\n\nI would like to congratulate you on being the best of the worst. I bet Mike Myers would like to thank you too. Now \"Love Guru\" won't be the worst movie since \"Gili\" and \"Ishtar.\"\n\nBravo on being number one. At the top of the worst movies of all time list :-)"

Where shall I begin? I think it's the best to start with the trailer: I hate trailers of comedies because you usually see the best jokes before watching the movie. But this time, even the trailer wasn't funny. Then i saw the movie and the only time I was laughing was when i actually saw someone who laughed about the movie... I can't even recommend this movie if you are a trash-fan. Because there is no movie to compare it with, I chose something else. If you enjoy staring into space, then you MIGHT find this movie funny. While writing this comment, this movie is at the top of the Bottom 100. And this is the only place to be for this movie."

We gotta plethora of films and characters being parodied here: Amy Winehouse, Juno, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Enchanted, High School Musical, Sex and The City and an avalanche of others. My personal favorite was the Juno one! It impregnated me to tears from laughing! Other mimics were minimally funny while others did get my chuckles to materialize. \"Disaster Movie\" will not be a total cinematic natural disaster but it will not be your fall comedic savior either. *** Average"

There was not even one funny scene in the whole 1 and a half hours. I think the movie might have been directed by blind, deaf and retarded monkeys! The first scene had potential, it started by saying 10,001 B.C. and that can be so funny. I wonder if the editors meant to say 9,999 BC of if they really meant 10,001? Do not ever watch this movie!"

Matt Lanter stars as Will, who has a dream in which sabertooth Amy Winehouse tells a caveman (who just finished playing Gladiators) that the world will end in 2008, then burps in his face a couple dozen times....uh...anyway, the dream comes true, so Will, some teenagers and a few movie characters have to fight for survival against the apocalypse.\n\nWhy the hell are these spoof movies still being made? They were good up until the extraordinarily unfunny Date Movie came out and they've been dreadful ever since. The first two Scary Movies were great and hilarious but recent spoofs such as Meet The Spartans and Superhero Movie are quite simply awful. And now here's Disaster Movie from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the writers/directors of Meet The Spartans. They obviously realise that their films aren't exactly critically acclaimed but they seem to have some strange thought that we, the public, enjoy their films. I wonder if they'd still think that if they saw that on IMDb, 85.3% of 12,687 voters rated this film 1/10. Hm....maybe we hate their films and don't want them to be made!\n\nDespite my little rant there, I'm going to admit that I did laugh a few times throughout Disaster Movie. Most of the jokes are terrible and made me want to stop watching but some are genuinely funny. In the scene where the chipmunks from Alvin And The Chipmunks appear, I cringed and thought the film couldn't get worse but when they started head banging and singing a rock song I couldn't help but laugh.\n\nSome scenes in Disaster Movie do tend to drone on. For example, the High School Musical spoof sequence during the party is unnecessarily long and tedious. Also, the part where Hannah Montana is stuck under an asteroid is funny at first but the joke wares on and on to the point where I was thinking \"GET ON WITH THE FILM!\"\n\nOne thing that I noticed about the film is that the writers seem to be desperate to cram in as much movie spoofs as possible in the hope that they can gain a laugh. However, the amount spoofed is strangely annoying and frustrating. And the very loose plot pretty much disappears and is pushed aside for more film references.\n\nIt may be funny at some points but Disaster Movie lives up to its title. I give it 2/10."

Apparently wire hanger abortions, punching pregnant women in the stomach, fetal alcohol syndrome, and the act of defeating your enemies by shooting them with breast milk are hilarious to these guys.\n\nThere is a parody of High School Musical so excruciating to watch you'll beg to watch the original with Zac Efron again.\n\nThe CGI isn't even film student quality. Seriously. I saw better CGI on my high school TV station. The pop culture gags feel dead on arrival.\n\nThese jerks clearly have no understanding of the stuff they're spoofing.\n\nTo them, all of us are philistines who are incapable of appreciating humor greater than a fart joke.\n\nAs a lover of all things cinema, Disaster Movie is depressing to watch. Friedberg and Seltzer cannot write their way out of a bag, yet they somehow keep getting work. Taking into account how many people in showbiz are struggling to make ends meet, that's disgusting. The fact that hacks like Friedberg and Seltzer are still working makes me want to bring back the blacklist.\n\nI would much rather bathe in acid than ever watch anything by these two royal fools ever again.\n\n**Originally from my film blog**"

They have created a whole new breed of disgustingly mindless and low-brow entertainment unlike anything ever seen before. It's not a bad movie, because bad movies have stupid plots, bad characters, and bad acting; their movies have none of that. No plot, characterization, or acting exist in these black holes of all things mind-numbing.\n\nMeet the Spartans, Epic Movie, and this their crowning achievement of stupidity consist of nothing but stream-of-consciousness lowest-common-denominator jokes strung together in random order. Nothing is spoofed or lampooned; just mentioned and just in case you don't know what their referencing, the characters will shout out the name of whoever is being referenced that second (\"Hey, Iron Man!\").\n\nWithin this disgusting framework Seltzer and Friedberg manage to top themselves in Disaster Movie with the all new \"trailer spoof.\" Characters are included from movies that came out just months or even weeks before the release of Disaster Movie; meaning they couldn't have seen these movies before including them, and you can tell. They won't even mention anything from the movies these characters appeared in, they will just have them appear for one second and then get sucked away by a tornado or something.\n\nThe fact that these so called Spoof Movies continue to be made is an abomination. Either Seltzer and Friedberg have a ton of money to waste or there are enough people seeing these in the theater to keep them going. Both are frightening prospects, especially considering another of their collaborations is coming out soon. Hopefully movies like this will go the way of the dinosaur because it appears that the bar for mainstream entertainment is getting lower and lower."

So if they could ever edit out the crap and replace it with some better stuff down the road then this movie could someday be redeemed.\n\nIt is a shame really, since this movie could have been a LOT better if it was properly edited by the director.

I get the feeling that the makers got high on something and just threw whatever came to mind into the script, figuring the audience would be too dumb to understand. These people should be banned from ever making another film and kept away from all movie cameras. I managed to sit through a total of 15 minutes and felt like I should wash my eyes and brain out with bleach to get rid of the memory. Terrible doesn't begin to describe it."

What followed was reference after reference of things that were out a week before this film was made (because we all know no one can remember anything from over a month ago).

We were victimized into watching this abomination by my fianc\u00e9's 11 year old son and his buddy. If any good came out of it, it was that they were so p*ssed off at how stupid this movie was that perhaps they will listen the next time they insist on seeing such a useless piece of garbage.\n\nBesides the fact that the \"parodies\" were not funny, they were sloppily piece-mealed together. It was painfully obvious that the idiots who hatched this idea had a checklist of people or movies they thought were good targets, so they just randomly tossed together an endless series of unfunny, unrelated cultural references. As I said, it was so bad it was almost surreal.\n\nI am hesitant to say this or any other movie is the worst movie ever made - but to put it in perspective, think of the worst porn movie you have ever seen - without the naked people - that is the caliber of writing and acting you have here. If you are fortunate enough to have NOT seen this movie, by all means STAY AWAY!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Curse my curiosity of all things cinematic. I really was not expecting this to be a good film, and there was no way I was going to go and actually pay money for this after enduring the mind numbing snooze-fests that were Meet The Spartans and Epic Movie, so I just watched a pirated copy of this film on the internet to simply see how bad these films can possibly get.\n\nThe answer is pretty god damn bad indeed. Even in films I don't really enjoy I still try to look for positives, especially when reviewing, to attempt to give a balanced and fair account. Keeping this in mind, you will have to excuse me if this review comes out a bit rant-like but there are no good points to speak of and the rest of this post will consist of me slating this film in as many ways as I can think of at the minute. Honest to god I cannot think of one thing about this film I thought was well done or enjoyed.\n\nFirst off the plot. I even hesitate to call it a plot as I feel it would be an affront to all other plots in every other film that exists. Apparently some guy called Will has a dream that the world is going to end because of a crystal skull for some reason, then his girlfriend leaves him, the world begins to end but of course he is still in love with her so he goes to rescue her and stop the world from being destroyed. I will pause here and just leave a line before I continue for you to all grimace in disgust at this awful clich\u00e9d concept for a story.\n\nDone? Good, I shall go on. None of the massive gaping plot holes are explained such as why things come to life in a museum, why the world is ending because a skull is not on a table or why I sat through the entirety of this disjointed mess of a film. In a lot of comedy films though, the story is not meant to be incredibly absorbing, and merely serves as a mechanism to move the audience from one contextual joke to another. Disaster Movie seems to attempt this, but because none of the jokes are funny, it falls flat on its face with a nice loud crunch.\n\nI am frankly insulted to be the target demographic of this film, being a teenage white male, as the humour is...well it just isn't humour. Throughout the whole hour and half of this I smirked (not even laughed) a massive total of once. It is the same tired, drawn out old jokes from the last few outings of the Dumb and Dumber of the directing world, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. As far as I can tell there are essentially two jokes in this film. Somebody gets hit a lot but is OK for some reason, and the princess character is a whore. That's it. The fact that these two retarded hacks seem to think this is actually funny defies all plausible logic. Either that or they both have the mental age of 3 and wet themselves with excitement whenever they play peekaboo with their carers.\n\nThe idea behind this film is supposed to be that it parodies recent films, making fun of them. Disaster Movie mustn't have a very good sense of balance because even in this simple task, where the characters and potential material is pretty much laid out for them by the original film makers, it yet again falls onto its already battered and bloodied face.\n\nLets get this straight, there is a very distinct difference between parodying something and merely making mention of it or having a celebrity or character walk on the screen for no apparent reason to deliver a pointless flat and totally unrelated \"joke\". Guess which one Disaster Movie does predominantly? If you guessed parodying you are seriously not getting the tone of this review are you? Yep I think good ol' Jason and Aaron may have had a bet or wager of some kind with a person who worked on the previous film that was something along the lines of \"Lololol I bet we cans get moar celebrity peoples into this film than Meat The Spartons!\". This lead to the barrage of completely unnecessary and unfunny pop culture references that plagued my monitor for 90 minutes. None of them made sense! Alvin and the chipmunks appeared in a building singing deth metal and then proceeded to kill Juno. And that was one of the more coherent scenes of this film.\n\nI could go on ranting about the acting that is so wooden you could make a coffee table out of it or the shockingly awful and cheap looking special effects but I don't think I have enough venom left to spit at this turd sandwich of a movie to do justice to just how bad they are. If you didn't know anything about this film I took a bullet for you guys on this one, you owe me! This film is terrible avoid it like the bubonic plague.\n\nOh and please for the love of God do not go to see it! Stop giving these jack offs money and they might get the idea that everybody hates them and their films."

It doesn't go far enough (ie R rating with nudity, language, etc) to be funny in an adult way (like the classic Kentucky Fried Movie).\n\nThis may be the first movie that Carmen Electra can honestly say that she is the best actress in a movie. Of course, she's in it less than 5 minutes and pretty much just stands there, not showing off her best assets.\n\nThe ranking as the all time worst movie on IMDb is well deserved."

Nicole Parker is by far my favorite actor in this movie her quirky personality as the high princess and her impersonations were the movie for me. Matt Lanter to has got a good comedy scream like when he turned the girl around whom he mistook for his ex at his Super Duper Sweet Sixteen party i had to rewind a dozen times and i laugh harder each time.

Add in very bad special effects, and a few actors pulled from Hollywood's unemployment line, and you got a truckload of suck. The only way it could be any worse is if it starred Paris Hilton, Sisqo, and Richard Simmons.\n\nBut what really got me was the HORRIBLE Juno parody. As a fan of Ellen Page who just adored the film Juno (which is my favorite film, thank you), I was flat out offended by how they dump all over that great film. A film as great and original as Juno deserves better than a strung out 30 year old in a pregnancy suit doing a bad Juno MacGuff impersonation while kicking a drag queen with a baby leg that magically pops out of her stomach. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! The people who made this should be permanently barred from making movies. If you are heading to theaters to see a comedy, please see Tropic Thunder instead. In fact, the makers of this film need to be tied up and forced to watch Tropic Thunder to learn how to properly work spoofs and pop culture parodies/references into a movie, and make a genuinely funny spoof film.\n\nSo please spend your money on a Tropic Thunder ticket instead.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Disaster Movie\" doesn't really have much of a plot but the film circles around the idea of the world coming to an end. It all starts off with the main character Will (Matt Lanter) who has a dream that he has traveled back to 10,001 B.C. and gets told by Amy Winehouse (yes I am serious) that the world is in fact going to end. Hilarity supposedly ensues\u0085\n\nEvery time I have seen a preview for a spoof movie over the past few years, I just cringed. The reason I cringe is because the movies are normally made by two of the 6 writers of Scary Movie. These two guys are known to the world as Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Some say that these two guys are children of Satan put on this earth to torture people with bad spoof movies and after seeing \"Disaster Movie\" I am almost ready to agree.\n\nThe biggest problem with \"Disaster Movie\" is that it tries to parody too many movies in one film. The reason Friedberg and Seltzer suck as directors is because they don't understand what it takes to make a good spoof movie. If you look back on spoof movies, most of the classics have a core story line with a beginning, middle and an end, as well a primary genre they spoof. Look at \"Airplane!\", \"Naked Gun\", \"Blazing Saddles\", \"Young Frankenstein\", \"Hot Shots\", and \"Austin Powers\" for perfect examples.\n\n\"Disaster Movie\" along with all the other films Friedberg and Seltzer have directed does not use this simple formula. They spoof everything and anything from any genre in the hope that someone will chuckle. Think I am joking? \"Disaster Movie\" spoofs \"10,000 B.C.\", \"Juno\". Sex and the City\", \"Step Up 1 & 2\", \"Enchanted\", \"Wanted\", \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\", \"Kung Fu Panda\", \"The Happening\", \"Superbad\", \"Indiana Jones\", \"Batman\", \"Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\", \"Hellboy\", \"Iron Man\", \"Get Smart\", \"The Love Guru\", \"No Country for Old Men\", \"High School Musical\", \"American Gladiators\", \"Beowulf\", \"Jumper\" and \"Hancock\" all in less than 85 minutes. This is why this film doesn't work plus they try to spoof pop culture references like Amy Winehouse and Jessica Simpson to name a few.\n\nOne would think that because they spoof so many things you would get a whole bunch of laughs even with no storyline. The sad truth behind this is that I laughed twice and I smiled twice in the whole 85 minutes. Most of the jokes fall so flat or are so \"out there\" that anyone who watches this is dumbfounded by 98% of all the jokes in the film. I think if Friedberg and Seltzer were writers on SNL, they would be great at making short little spoof skits however when it comes to making a feature length film these guys have no right at all to be sitting in a directors chair.\n\nIn Conclusion, avoid this film at all costs. While it isn't as god awful as \"Date Movie\" or \"Meet the Spartans\" it is still a disaster in every aspect of the word. The storyline is moronic, 98% of the jokes fall flat, and the acting is less than average. Hopefully considering this film has officially flopped at the box office, Hollywood will take the hint and realize that people today are sick and tired of seeing crap like this. I have said this before and I will say it again, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be tied to a chair and beaten while being video taped. This is the only way at this point for them to apologize for all 4 feature films they have released. They have no business whatsoever directing or writing a film. I appreciate the fact they love movies but please leave movie making to those who have some talent.\n\nMovieManMenzel's final rating for \"Disaster Movie\" is a 2/10."

Is there a point to these films other than short term profit? Will these be made into long term classics? Who will remember certain films or celebrities in 10 years time when watching this? The movie opens in 10,001 BC, really poor choice, and prehistoric Amy Winehouse sets the tone of what the film will be like, cheap digs at celebrities and other films.\n\nHellboy, Batman, Ironman, The Hulk, Enchanted, Hancock, Juno, Beowulf, Indiana Jones and Sex and the City among others are the main films to be spoofed, while Winehouse, Miley Cyrus and Jessica Simpson are also slated, not to mention a really stupid skit on Justin Timberlake.\n\nStupid, inaccurate, boring, predictable, the only positive thing to say is this film seems to know that its goal is to entertain, which it does so by being so unfunny that you have to occasionally laugh at how poor it truly is.\n\nI personally felt robbed of \u00a37 after I left, not to mention embarrassed at actually sitting through the whole film. We pay honest money to go out and have a good time, and even if a film is not to our taste, then there will be some consolation to our night, but Disaster Movie made me want to stop watching films all together.\n\nThis niche will continue to grow which is very sad in the industry.

Don't come near me if you actually LIKED the film, I might snatch your eyes out and forbid you from watching movies ever again.\n\n\"Disaster Movie\" gives us a birds eye view of what's happening to Hollywood these days - harebrained sluts and ho-bags are taking over the movie industry, producing these cheap, recycled, swallowed-and-then-vomited movies which insults the intelligence of 45% of the human race.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is, if you actually find the movie well-written and downright hilarious, there must be something wrong with you. \"Disaster Movie\" doesn't have a plot, no comprehensible characters, no tangible conclusion... it's as shapeless as gas. It doesn't have a destination, it loiters on triviality, and the so-called \"Disaster\" goes nowhere.\n\nComedy Value There's only ONE scene which actually made me crack a smile. The Carrie Bradshaw and Juno MacGuff encounter. What bothers me the most is the screenplay writers/directors Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg violently raping Diablo Cody's award-winning screenplay, copying every catchphrase that it has, like committing an act of plagiarism, thereby giving another reason as to why should the two of them be expelled from Hollywood.\n\nThe movie is chock-full of clich\u00e9s. Who'd laugh at Iron Man, Hellboy and the Incredible Hulk getting crushed by a falling cow? Who'd laugh at Hancock hitting his head on a lightpost? Who'd laugh at that stupid Women of Wrestling (WoW) skit near the beginning? (Well for those who actually found these scenes funny and risible, you better check if your brain is still functioning.)\n\nStory \"Disaster Movie\" doesn't have a story. Seems like all the two blockheads have done is to collect as much movie characters as they can and alter their image by transforming them into obscene, cussing retards. Then, they line them up, and one by one, they get a share of their screen time. There's your story.\n\nDISASTER MOVIE IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST STUPID MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Do not watch this film, for the sake of humanity. This film will ruin your day by feeding you huge doses of sheer stupidity. It's like every time you laugh while watching this film, your IQ is reduced by 2. Every applause that you'd give to this film persuades more stupid parodies to come and make men lose their sense of humor. If you actually enjoyed this, you're as air-headed as the two screenwriters.\n\nPLEASE, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM AT ALL. YOU WILL TOTALLY REGRET IT. I've watched it from start to finish, and my intellect just lost its virginity."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had no intention of ever watching this movie. But I had time to kill before a meeting and this was being shown for a mere P15 at the mall, and was short enough for the time I had.\n\n\"Disaster Movie\" was an aimless mishmash of stupid references to various recent movies. They did not only reference disaster movies. Of disaster movie references, I only recognized \"Cloverfield\", \"Twister\" and maybe \"The Happening.\" The references for the major gags included \"Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull\", \"Juno\", \"High School Musical\", \"No Country for Old Men\", \"Enchanted\", \"Beowulf\" and even \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\", which are certainly NOT disaster movies. It also had lame scenes with Batman, Iron Man, the Hulk, Prince Caspian, Kung Fu Panda, etc. It even has unflattering references to specific celebrities like Amy Winehouse, Miley Cyrus, Jessica Simpson, Sarah Jessica Parker and an unfortunate scene with Michael Jackson.\n\nIn short, it is disastrous mixed-bag gag show with a lot of flat, dirty or disgusting jokes. I haven't seen the previous Friedberg/Seltzer incarnations like \"Date Movie\" or \"Epic Movie\", and have no more plans to. The actors are just plain annoying and unfunny most of the time. It was only at the end that I realized that the lead actress was actually Fil-Am celebrity Vanessa Minnillo in her first major movie role. Yikes!"

It had nothing funny in it and I cant believe that for example Carmen Electra actually agreed to be in this movie, it just proofs how money hungry she is.\n\nI also cant believe that they actually released this movie!! I mean come on there has to be some sort of pre-showing right!?!? Makes me wonder if those people watching it were dead or something.\n\nI hope and pray that they stop making movies like this!!\n\n(excuse me if my review isn't correct here and there, Im from Holland so my English isn't 100%)\n\nThanks for reading and believe me stay away from this movie!"

A couple of parodies are okay, but they just keep on coming and even if you think that a parodie is going to stop, so they could continue with 'the story' of the movie...think again. Some parodies are hugely overdone and way too much. And that's not all. What bothers me, is that a lot of the parodies and spoofs are from quite new movies, which are hard to get and left you wondering what the movie was called again that they are spoofing. To spoof instant classics like Star Wars and Indiana Jones is okay, because everyone gets that...but to spoof Zohan and Jimmy Kimmel show (just to name two)...that's just not done.\n\nAnd the list continues....there are about 60 spoofs and connections with other movies...which are just 50 too many. (I think I could stand 10 spoofs, but not more!).\n\nVerdict: This 'disaster-on-screen' is not worth watching and especially not worth your money if you want to rent it. 2 out of 10. Yes, I gave it a 2 because of the cool metal/hardrock song that's in the movie. Don't watch the movie for that part, it should be on YouTube somewhere. Saves you about an hour of your life."

Move over, Citizen Kane; there's a new sheriff in town.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about the groundbreaking script. It's so innovative, so ahead of its time, that it throws away the notion of coherence altogether. Who needs a logical plot when you can cram as many pop culture references and toilet humor into 90 minutes? It's like the writers played Mad Libs with a bunch of random movie titles and said, \"Yep, that's our plot.\"\n\nThe character development in this film is simply unparalleled. I've never seen characters so one-dimensional, and it's genuinely refreshing. It's like the actors decided to embrace their lack of depth and just roll with it. Who cares about emotional arcs when you can have characters who exist solely for cheap laughs and cringe-worthy parodies?\n\nThe special effects, oh my, let's not even get started on the groundbreaking CGI that rivals the best of the '90s. Forget about Avatar; The Disaster Movie gives you visuals that will make you question the very fabric of reality. The green screen work is so avant-garde that you'll think you're watching a live performance at your local community theater.\n\nAnd the jokes. Oh, the jokes. They're so brilliantly unfunny that they loop around and become comedic gold. Who needs wit and clever writing when you can have the comedic finesse of a third-grader armed with a whoopee cushion and a rubber chicken?\n\nIn conclusion, The Disaster Movie is a triumph of bad taste, an opus of cinematic catastrophe that will leave you questioning your very understanding of what constitutes a good film. Move over, Academy Awards; this is the true definition of a masterpiece. Bravo, Disaster Movie, bravo.\n\nI wanted to rate it 12/10 but sadly I don't have the option."

If you've ever been to a low-budget amateur cabaret at your local school you've experienced far better acting than ANY performance in this movie. The actors do theirs to make this movie worse than any movie you would ever watch (possibly for the rest of your life). But they are not fully to blame, the directing of the movie, along with the manuscript makes it a nearly impossible task for any actor to preform well. (I thought i'd also mention that the storyline and plot rivals the acting, in being the worst aspect to this movie!)\n\nI deeply regret watching this movie - so i decided to warn mankind. No living soul deserves to be dragged through this horrendous movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has a reputation of being one of the worst movies ever made. It always sat in the Bottom 100 (and today is #1!!!), it has thousands of negative reviews and it has been aired rarely on TV. But as you might have noticed, I am quite a glutton for punishment that would even watch the most wretched movies of all time, and it was reason enough few months ago for finally watching it. Now I can go to the review.\n\nThe movie begins with a scene parodying 10,000 AC where a caveman is squashed by a mammoth and then dragged on a pile of Mammoth fecal matter. Then he is attacked by a guy from AMERICAN GLADIATORS and an Amy Winehouse clone with fangs. Then he awakens and he has strange encounters with a dwarf and various celebrity clones. And basically, this is the rest of the movie. Countless parodys after another after another after another... and none of them made me even snicker!\n\nMost of the scenes were so random that you might wonder if the director gave directions or they just signed on a piece of paper some ideas and they used them in the way they wanted. Many of the jokes fell flat, and it was obvious that nobody wasn't even trying. Not even the various characters parodied in it (like Batman, Iron Man, Hellboy, Po the panda) couldn't save this disaster of a movie (at least the title is right). I have personally seen many movies with bad acting, and I can say that the acting here was too much to stomach even for me! I really can't think at this moment of a comedy that didn't make me laugh through the beginning to the end (apart from CAT IN THE HAT and BABY GENIUSES) but I have to put this at the top of the list.\n\nI really agree with 99% of the reviews here that this is only an esecrable excuse for making cheap laughs. It's crass, revolting, dumb (and I felt a bit stupider after it was finally over!), unfunny, horribly acted, horribly written, horribly directed and badly made that it looked like it was recut and pasted various times. If you want to watch a comedy that makes fun of other movies, avoid at all costs this one!!! I would rather gouge my eyes with my fingernails than re-watch this atrocity AGAIN!"

However, the audience were too smart to not see this monstrosity because they know that the twin clowns were treated them like they're brain dead (Date Movie and Meet The Spartans are good examples of this), and that's why it tanked at the box office but I don't blame the audience for that, at all.\n\nAnd what I meant by 'Frankenstein monster', I meant that there's not a single reference or a gag that really work, or it just that it was made by a bunch of monkeys. The references are lazy, insulting, stupid and tiresome, the production value looks like it has a fungus growing on it, the visuals look incredibly cheap, the acting is beyond terrible, and the 'writing' is abysmal.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm going to start off my review saying that I don't normally give movies 1 star. I'm not one of those people that goes around giving a 1 to any movie that I even sort of disliked. Nay, to get a 1 on my scale, a movie has to be truly awful. And this... this is.\n\nSitting through the movie is literally painful. Each cheap scatological joke and celebrity reference is like a stab to the chest, and by 10 minutes in, that's about 82,000 stabs to the chest. The movie eats away at you, until you're actually considering killing yourself to stop the pain that you're in. Every minute, it just gets worse and worse, until you're ready to smash your head through the TV you're watching it on.\n\nBut, I was saved. After what felt like eight hours of mind-bogglingly bad \"jokes\", my DVD player shut down, saying it was \"unable to read disc\". Now, normally, I would be angry, restart the DVD player, and watch from the scene it shut down on. But, this... this had to be a sign. The DVD player had to be saving me the agony of the last few minutes of this awful thing that they pass off as a film. After a few minutes of thanking my DVD player, I decided it was my mission to get on any site I could and warn people to get as far as possible away from any copy of \"Disaster Movie\" you see.\n\nSeriously. In the hour or so I sat through, there was not one joke. No, there were only cheap knockoffs of celebrities and movie characters, agonizingly long dance scenes and burp jokes, and \"kicked in the nuts\" scenes.\n\nAnd it's not just the \"humor\" that's bad about this movie. Every aspect of the movie is so despicably awful, I would expect better film-making from an amnesiac turtle that had climbed on top of a video camera and accidentally turned it on. I don't expect Oscar-winning performances in these things, but oh my god. I've sat through movies like \"Suburban Sasquatch\" (watch some clips) and even the acting in that seems better in comparison. The actors being passed off as characters and celebrities are god-awful and do not share a remote resemblance to the people they're pretending to be. Seriously, I would have no idea who they were if the directors didn't point it out to me at least three times during the joke. \"Hey look, it's Wolf from American Gladiators\". Alright, it's Wolf. \"Yes, that's right, I'm Wolf from American Gladiators\". Alright... we get it. But, then they repeat the fact that it's Wolf from American Gladiators over and over and over until you're just about ready to scream at the screen, \"WE GET IT, GET ON WITH IT!\" I could go on and on about how bad this movie was. I could go on and on about how many times they shove the same joke down your throat time and time again (saying Juno talks strange every time she says a sentence is NOT funny). I could complain about the special effects. Or the costumes. Or the fact that they still think Michael Jackson jokes are funny. Or the fact that they actually take jokes word-for-word from other movies and pass them off as their own. Or I could complain about the sad state of comedy, and how angry it makes me that hordes of high teenagers think this is funny. But I won't.\n\nBecause I figure they put so little work into this piece of trash, I should put even less work into writing my review. I BEG of you, do not buy, rent or come near \"Disaster Movie\". Because if it makes more money, they'll make more of them. And soon, after \"Twilight Movie\" and \"Movie Movie\", BAM our society will look like it did in \"Idiocracy\". Do you want to cause the end of civilization as we know it? No? Well, then don't give Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg a cent of your hard-earned money. DON'T SEE DISASTER MOVIE.\n\nAnd to people that say \"well, you didn't see the whole movie, you can't review it\", you obviously haven't seen it. They were \"parodying\" movies that HAD NOT EVEN COME OUT YET. So, if they can watch trailers of upcoming movies, retread the jokes and call it a movie, I can watch most of the movie, rant about it, and call it a review. I'm done. This movie makes me mad."

A movie so funny it makes The Shining look like Some Like it Hot. Not good.\n\nMany times I had to hide my face in my sweater cause it was so embarrassing to watch. All scenes with \"Juno\" (A very good movie by the way), the fight involving Carmen Electra, the High School Musical-scene, Hannah Montana, the main character couple and the chipmunks made me scream \"make it stop!\" inside. In fact, the only thing bearable to watch was some of the scenes with the enchanted princess. Nicole Parker was the least awful in the cast. Speaking of Nicole Parker, the Mad-TV cast should be able to get better roles than this (heck, ANYONE should get better roles than this!). I've seen spoofs in their show where they are absolutely hilarious! People who can be absolutely hilarious shouldn't be in Disaster Movie.

Later Naked Gun sequels and the first scary movie still had a sense of what comedy is. But someone who's dressed like Amy Winehouse standing there farting for well over a minute isn't funny, it's boring and a really poor attempt at humor.\n\nJust remember, if you take the time, or god forbid spend money to see this movie, I warned you."

And face it, Carmen Electra and Kim Kardashian are only in it for their body in which they do the best way they can, cleavage!\n\nAfter all, his can only be watched after necking some brewskies or at a party with a lot of friends but to take it seriously therefore it's a disaster.\n\nGore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 1/5 Comedy 1/5"

It's also recommended for people with low blood pressure, u'll be amazed how high ur blood pressure is after viewing this. anorexic people , or over 40 with high blood pressure, u should avoid it at all costs"

These 87 minutes were completely squandered as the film manages to continuously sap the viewer's will to live, degrading them to a shivering wreck by the time it drags itself to the much anticipated final credits.\n\nThis movie plunges so deep down in to the ranks of awful films that it is unwatchable even to for the seasoned ironic moviegoer. I cannot even recommend this to anyone or anything as this blight on the human race degrades the fabric of the viewer's very being, making it unsuitable for children, animals and most vegetation.\n\nDisaster Movie is a slimy lump of snot that has been birthed in the depths of hell and dragged itself out to the land of the living to corrupt the moral fiber of humanity and leave a trail of quivering horror in its wake."

I even knew that this movie was going to be bad. I didn't think it would be this bad. I remember watching Epic Movie when I was twelve and even then I knew that was garbage. This was way worse than Epic Movie, that's hard to say. This movie is by far the worst out of all their spoof movies. Every time they parody something, it's just so unfunny that I was actually cringing. Here's probably the worst part of the movie. All of their other spoof movies seemed like they had a main parody. Epic Movie had the Chronicles of Narnia, Meet the Spartans had 300, this movie has nothing. That's probably the best definition of this movie, it's nothing, absolutely nothing. Out of all the movies that came out from 2007-2008, they really couldn't think of one disaster movie to have the movie be a main parody of? I Am Legend and Cloverfield came out during the same time these other movies parodied came out. It would've some sort of sense if they made fun of either of those movies. But no, they just parody movies that were either extremely popular (The Dark Knight, Iron Man, Indiana Jones 4), well-known movies (Superbad, Juno, No Country for Old Men), or movies they believed would be big hits (10,000 BC, Prince Caspian, Speed Racer). Not a single disaster movie is parodied in a movie ironically called Disaster movie. The acting, forget about it. The writing, forget about it. Originally there were a few things that were actually cool in the movie the first time I saw them. They were the cat fight between Kim Kardashian and Carmen Electra, and the song towards the end of the movie. Now that I think of that, they sucked just as much as this movie. I'm done with any spoof movie that comes out at this point. Go watch classic spoofs like Airplane. I'd even say watch the Scary Movie movies if you want to watch a spoof movie. Even they're not even good, you'll probably get more laughs out of any Scary Movie movie than in this hour and a half of laugh-free pain and agony."

Even movies that didn't live up to the hype, I found something enjoyable in them. But, In watching this latest movie that these two came out with, I had to think, \"Do they even care?\" why would you two try and at least write a funny joke? Parodies are hard to do. But, when done right, Like Scary Movie, Airplane, Top gun, (add your favorite here) you can not only laugh yourself into a coma, you can also see the hard work that went into them. Hard work that Jason and Arron know nothing about. They think, as long as young people go see them, Then they'll keep making them. So, here is what I would like to say to you Jason and Arron -- If you really did have anything to do with scary movie like you make everyone think you did, then you would step up and accept this challenge. If by some insane chance, that any studio would ever allow you to make another movie, Do what others have done with \"Scary Movie\" go out and get good writers who will bust their asses to make a movie that you can be proud of. Take all the money you've made off of these Unfunny things that you call movies and pay good writers to help you.\n\nI challenge you to do this. I know you love movies. You have to.

In my opinion, this is better than meet the spartans & epic movie. I hope to see more Nicole comedy movies! ^^"

        "review_title": "Truly, pathetically, bizarrely awful. But we can learn from it.",
        "review_detailed_main": "OK, let's get it out of the way early: this movie is truly bad. Granted, I didn't think it was as bad as 'Epic Movie,' but that may just be because I had not seen the equal of 'Epic Movie' in a long time ('Chairman of the Board' springs to mind). But don't think I am praising it: 'Epic Movie' was a pile of dog excrement. 'Disaster Movie' is tinsel in the dog excrement: shinier, a little more attractive, but in the end, pretty much just as disgusting.\n\nFor those who don't know, the plot of this tripe is, essentially, several fairly attractive young people try to make it through a Friedberg/Seltzer movie with their careers intact. Unfortunately, no one's does, which is a bit of a shame: Carmen Electra, for her crazy past, certainly deserves a lot better, and the only real bright spot of the film, the deadpan work by Ike Barinholtz of Mad TV fame (who had the only semi-decent line in 'Meet the Spartans') is underpinned by a boatload of utter nonsense. Attempts to further the plot are foiled by an endless stream of pop culture references that are not only unfunny, but have nothing to do with anything that happens on screen. And just in case you aren't laughing at a joke (believe me, it will be through no fault of your own), the filmmakers make absolutely certain you know exactly what they are referencing and why you should find it funny.\n\nBut all is not lost. Thankfully, even the worst movies can teach us a thing or two about what works and what doesn't. Since this movie has shown that some people clearly haven't learned them (and budding filmmakers, take note), let's print a few here:\n\n1. IN COMEDY, TIMING IS EVERYTHING. Somehow, cosmically, every joke has its one point where it switches from 'ho-hum' to 'gutbuster.' Some jokes take longer, some shorter. But playing a 1 second joke for 5 minutes does not work. For reference, see much of this movie.\n\n2. EDITING IS CRUCIAL. Similar to #1 in idea, but different in execution. One of the questions the movie asks is, 'Why not use five gags to make one joke?' The reason: four of the gags are not funny, and by the time the fifth rolls around, the joke falls flat on its face. I really think some of the gags in the movie could work if some editing was done. Unfortunately, this would most likely reduce the running time considerably...say, to about 27 minutes or so.\n\n3. DON'T INSULT THE AUDIENCE. Toilet humor is perfectly fine for a movie, especially a parody film. I can laugh at pretty much anything. But as I mentioned above, I don't laugh when I'm told by the movie why this scene is supposed to be funny, and that I should laugh specifically because it told me I should. I liked 'Superhero Movie,' because as incredibly stupid and silly as it was, it never once told me to laugh at something; it let me decide. 'Disaster Movie' never gives you the option. Every joke is carefully (and sometimes, quite thoroughly) explained, to the point where I wanted to shout out, \"All right! I get it, but I don't like it!\"\n\n4. SEQUELS AND SPIN-OFFS ARE WRITTEN THROUGH DOLLARS. Any dollar spent at the local theater, rental store, or on-line distributor is a vote for that film. If you don't like something, for Pete's sake, don't spend your hard-earned money on it. And tell your friends not to see it. It would appear after 'Disaster,' the audience is finally starting to speak where it counts the most.\n\nNo movie is completely without fans. If you liked 'Disaster Movie,' then you liked it. But please, keep it to yourself. I've painfully sat through the last three Seltzer/Friedberg movies so others wouldn't have to. Do not make my sacrifice in vain."

I expected to find a movie with \"Meet the Spartans\" humor, but the only attempts at humor weren't with witty dialogue but rather with too many unfunny references. I generally love this sort of movie, even though the jokes can sometimes be immature, but the jokes in this movie were so childish that even a three-year old would scoff at the minor chuckles of his two and one year old counterparts. That said, this movie shows that the standards in spoof movies have sunken so low, that we probably won't see another major theater release of one for years to come."

It's more like an hour long ad, than a movie. And some parody scenes are quite good example/interpretations of pop-life based events for the last-and-past years.

        "review_detailed_main": "As a small time movie producer adviser, most movies that was made were made in a hurry. That means the story was written on the fly. Xanadu was one disaster where the writing occurred only after the movie was produced. Then there is political war where the head of the production team or director calls all the shots and the argument about production deadlines. Sure there are deadlines, if you got a good script. Things kind of get out of hand when it becomes a dictatorship during movie production. The only way to prevent this is they have to first get a good title, which they did. Second a good premise to the movie (a believable one). Third a good plot outline, which they did to an extent. Next step is the storyboard which they skipped. Then there's the most important make or break editing, which they skipped almost entirely. A lot of scenes of the movie which is roughly 1 hour and 28 minutes if we just eliminated those scenes that didn't relate to the story line a lot goes down the trash. Therefore why you won't like the movie has a lot to do with the fact that almost the entire movie had nothing to do with the disaster. The disaster only took less then 5 minutes of the entire movie's one hour and a half. Scenes relating to disaster or near that took about 20 minutes. The rest of the bulk are scenes you wouldn't want to watch anyway. These are the scenes that should have been removed because it had nothing to do with the movie: 1,000,000 B.C. scene, Woman vampire singing with the caveman, Chipmunks singing Christmas Music, Pregnant Teenager scenes can be eliminated entirely, the guru in a marriage ceremony completely remove, a long 15 minute teen party can be removed completely - had absolutely nothing to do with disasters, Hannah Montana scene, Woman Wrestlers, Tennis Shoe Telepone, Enchanted princess. Now what's missing is the Disaster movie Genre that has not even been shown: Day After Tomorrow, Al Gore (Global Warming), 2012, Nostradamus, Merlin the Magician, Mother Shipton, History Channel, Poseidon, War of the Worlds, Armageddon, Sinking of Japan, for example were not parodied at all. The basic theme of the movie is the core that keeps the entire genre in one piece isn't even in there or can't be seen, which should follow more closely, for example Day After Tomorrow, and from there we throw in Twisters, Tsunamis, and other genre together. and perhaps the movie's ending should be something akin to there's no end of the world, so the schedule is move up to another date,as in Jehovah's witness. Basically the production house has forgotten a few principles, one major one is unavoidable: the movie before any production should be limited to a small play before a live audiences, as in High school or other appropriate place to get people's response before going any further. It won't cost much. So why has Disney made so many home runs? Simple: it required them a year to write a good story before production even starts. The one major mistake is that they simply allow scenes totally unrelated to the title of the movie. The second mistake is they fail to parody disasters. Sure they may have parody some movie characters, but it was unrelated to the disaster movie genre. So before making a movie, they simply need to compile the list of DISASTER MOVIES that needed to be parodied. But the main focus of a success is actually the organization. If the story process is not democratically decide, it's going to fail because the market is basically decided democratically. The more the people like the better the box office. Schedules of writing should not be part of the production process, otherwise the deadlines simply kill the story. And there's plenty of writers we can find over the net to make a good story anyway. So why put writing team as part of the production schedule? You don't need to. Just get a small competition and then use those materials."

It had no story at all throughout the movie. The acting was alright but nothing special. This movie does make fun of pretty much any movie you can possibly think of that came out this year or late last year. The movie was pretty entertaining though. If you want to go see this movie though wait for a cheap show. It was not worth paying to go see this movie. Overall not that good of a comedy movie. There are better spoof movies.

Here, they aim at modern 'disaster' movies such as Cloverfield, and other none disaster related films like Juno, The Chronicles of Narnia, No Country for Old Men and superhero films (which was already done earlier in the year!) like Iron Man, Hellboy 2 and The Dark Knight. While it doesn't do a particularly better job of it than that film, at least the send ups here of these films are a bit more recent and relevant and not just on Spiderman all the time. Some care seems to have gone into the Hellboy and IM costumes, so it's weird how sloppy and awful the Batman costume is. Likewise, a lot of the actors playing the roles look nothing like who they're supposed to be playing, so it's hard to crack a smile at their material. The makers, in all fairness, have been very thorough and have been sure to send everything they can think up, so it's even more of a big blow that hardly any of it is funny at all, least of all an unpleasant scene involving chewing glass. I was tempted to walk out at least once, but I did chuckle once or twice so maybe you will too. **"

And that was pretty much it.\n\nYou know a movie is bad when Vanessa Minillo and Kim Kardashian should actually be ashamed of being in it. Kim K. has been in porn with more depth than this. The pictures of Vanessa Minillo and Lindsay Lohan holding knives to each other's throats is infinitely more interesting than this stupid movie. Maybe it would have helped if I were a teenager, but sadly enough I still got almost every reference they were going for. And none of it was funny. At least we can all rest easy that these two directors currently have no projects listed as being in production. This film appeared to have lost money while their others actually turned a profit. Perhaps they can fool the general public no longer. Here's a thought.... next time something like this comes out that you folks know will be bad, DO NOT PAY TO GO SEE IT!

        "review_title": "Good news, its better than Meet the Spartans. Bad news its still a pile of garbage",
        "review_detailed_main": "Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans and Superhero Movie, three movies with two things in common. They were all made by somebody with something or other to do with Scary Movie, you know those reasonably amusing spoofs that were good fun before they exhausted the franchised long ago. And the fact that all three of them are steaming piles of garbage with out a giggle, a smirk or even a roll of the eye obviously funny between them. To be fair Superhero Movie wasn't horrendous, it was just bland and uninspired, however Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans are the two worst movies I have ever seen. Spartans particularly being so bad that I really did almost walk out. The first trailers for Disaster Movie looked worse than Spartans, in fact when I first saw the trailer I was horrified. Then it got released, destroyed by the critics and I assumed I would never have to watch it. Alas my friends forced me to see it, and now I sit before you about to say something I never thought I would say. Disaster Movie is not the worst movie ever made! In fact in terms of quality its at least three times as good as Spartans. A shame to say a lump of dog poop is three times better than Spartans, so we aren't exactly talking quality. Disaster Movie is better than Spartans because its spoofs at times can be reasonably smirksome, nothing will make you laugh, but there are a few clever quotes here and there. Still it really is a bad movie, the jokes most of them time are just obvious references, most introductions of a spoof begin with the line \"look its (insert celebrity name here)\", and then we get to watch that celebrity either get hit, fall over or get poo wiped on there face, in some circumstances all three at once. The jokes are hardly inspired either, the Sex and the City joke just being a disaster (no pun intended), and why bother doing the exact same foot scene from Zohan when it was a lot funnier in Zohan? Thankfully the Alvin sequence sort of redeems it a bit, and a bit spoofing Jumper and Prince Caspian ending in a great line, \"it's the guy who ruined Star Wars.\"\n\nSo onto the acting. Spartans was a horrible movie to watch, and one of the major reasons for this was that not a single damned actor deserves to live after that movie. When Carmen Elektra comes out as the best actress in the movie you realise there is something horribly wrong. Disaster Movie to be fare works a tiny bit better because the actors don't make you want to slit your wrists repeatedly. They're by no means good, most of the main cast seemingly having wandered off the streets just to do random spoof lines. Matt Lanter, as I suppose the lead, is vaguely charismatic, although I unfortunately spent half the movie trying to figure out where I had seen him in before, he's in Heroes for those who care. He seems like he could deliver a pun if given the right material anyway. Crista Flanagan is probably the best, doing a half decent Juno impression and featuring the best scene in the movie where she gets to say overly smart things for random sake. Carman Elektra makes her rudimentary appearance, yes she still looks nice, no she still can't act, and no her brief Wanted spoof is not funny. The rest of the cast don't really matter. The woman playing the princess from Enchanted works occasionally, and then doesn't at other times.\n\nSo what is funny about the movie? Well you can count what is funny on one hand. The Alvin sketch is funny for a brief time, its way too overdone and very annoying come the end. The Juno talking bit is relatively funny. The line about Star Wars made me smirk a bit too smugly for my own good. The final song, god only knows why, was relatively smirksome, and to be honest that's really it. So what really isn't funny at all? The Michael Jackson sketch, god only knows why we're still doing Michael Jackson sketches now, any scene with a random pop celebrity, whether it be Amy Winehouse or Hannah Montana, any scene with a superhero getting hit, any scene with anybody getting hit, any scene featuring poo, any scene featuring high school musical dances. So in general the rest of the movie. Thankfully the movie is better made than the others. The score at times not being half bad, and the sets being half decent.\n\nAnyway now to stop justifying the movies existence. Its rubbish, for the love of god do not go and watch it. I'm just being polite because its better than I expected. But do something more fun with your time, like poking yourself in the eye repeatedly."

Answer: Because they make money.\n\n\"Disaster Movie\" made it's 25 million dollar budget back in 3 weeks, on release in the States. I am assuming that it also went straight into the Top 10. From then on it was into pure profit. \"Disaster Movie\" will certainly make even more money overseas. On those terms alone \"Disaster Movie\" alone is a successful movie.\n\nI paid money to see this dreck. (Well, kind of. I have a pass that, for a monthly fee, allows me to see unlimited movies at a particular cinema chain.) You may have paid money to see \"Disaster Movie\" as well, and so you should. No pirate DVD's here, thank you very much. We are responsible for potentially more rubbish like \"Disaster Movie\" being inflicted on the world. I apologize deeply and humbly. I hope you do to.\n\n\"Disaster Movie\" is almost totally awful. (Almost totally awful? OK. I admit that for a microsecond a slight smile played across my lips at one of the \"Juno\" jokes, but that could just have easily been a small belch.) \"Disaster Movie\" is a terrible movie. A piece of cinematic poo. A textbook case of how not to make a comedy in the Noughties.\n\nMagnificently unfunny. Obvious, witless, stupid, crass, vile and so very, very bad. Not bad in a good way. Bad in a bad way. There was definitely a whiff of death coming from that screening. People left the cinema dazed and in shock. I saw a man who looked like he had eaten his own tongue in horror at what he had just seen. When I got home after seeing \"Disaster Movie\", I rushed into the shower to wash off the smell. My Girlfriend noticed it. She said to me, \"Have you just seen 'Disaster Movie'?\"\n\nAmazingly \"Disaster Movie\" is worse than \"Meet The Spartans\" and worse than \"Superhero Movie\". At least the latter had Pamela Anderson in a Fantastic Four outfit.\n\nI would say that sometimes it is worthwhile seeing a real stinker of a movie, because that can help you appreciate the gems even more. I cannot say that seeing this movie would serve even that purpose.\n\nIf you have to see \"Disaster Movie\", wait for it to appear, for free, on the television. Trust me. It's not worth the effort."

(We also know that spoofing is not the same as satirizing, but that's a discussion for another day.) Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, who write and direct these films as a duo, do not know this. In their minds, all it takes to spoof \"The Incredible Hulk\" is for the character to show up and then be crushed by a falling cow.\n\nGet it?! It's a character you recognize from a different movie, but here he is in THIS movie! And then he gets hurt! The title notwithstanding, disaster movies are not the object of \"Disaster Movie's\" satire (such as it is). You're thinking \"The Towering Inferno,\" \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" or \"The Day After Tomorrow\"; they're thinking \"Sex and the City,\" \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan,\" and \"Juno\" -- any movie that came out within the last year, in other words. The film's basic structure parallels \"Cloverfield\" (which sort of qualifies), and there's a reference to \"Twister\" -- from 12 years ago -- and the only joke is that a tornado keeps throwing cows around. But other than that, \"Disaster Movie\" is really nothing more than an ill-conceived, unfunny series of weak, talent-show-at-summer-camp-level skits.\n\nJust Disastrous."

Most of the humor is less than juvenile, if that is possible. About the only saving grace, is the product placement was kept down to a descent level and it had good continuity.

        "review_detailed_main": "I guess the title already tells you everything you need to know about the movie. It is without a doubt a total disaster. I still find it quite amazing that writer directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer still managed to get funds to have their films made, after equally disastrous unfunny comedies such as Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans (OK, I shall unabashedly say that I enjoyed Date Movie), because while it's spoof after spoof, it certainly isn't cheap trying to replicate certain stuff, even if done laced with loads of cheese, or swede-d.\n\nShould there be a story linking everything little crazy thing together, then it would be Cloverfield, where a group of friends Will (Matt Lanter, whose left year I found strangely out of alignment with his right?), Calvin (G. Thang), Juney (Crista Flanagan), Lisa (Kimberly Kardashian) and the Enchanted Princess (Nicole Parker) journey to save Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) before getting themselves out of the city to escape some unknown and best forgotten natural calamity, where the threat of mankind is raining cows.\n\nThe only merit I would give the filmmakers is how they went ballistic and stretched their imagination to milk every possible opportunity to script in some other movie, be it borrowing characters or premise. You'd probably lose count at the something-new-at-every-minute strategy, and frankly speaking, they're at best some skits which for the life of me, are totally unfunny. Nada, zilch, nothing to laugh about. I guess even kids will find the juvenile humour here a total turn off.\n\nWhich is not strange, considering that even jokes were borrowed, and relied too heavily on the usual toilet humour, which is already so tired. While there are comedies which can be original, the pedigree of Friedberg and Seltzer, coming as scriptwriters for Scary Movie(s), would by now reinforce that they make poor stories and jokes from their lack of innovation. Being able to string together countless of movies is one thing, but making a genuine and workable comedy is another. Not having an established cast to star in your movie might stem from a modest budget to work with, but I'm likely to think that everyone approached, save for the relative no-names here, would not want to touch this even with a ten foot pole, just in case it really stinks and stain their filmography.\n\nI think it's even time for me to put a foot down and say No to Friedberg and Seltzer. The powers that be should really dry up the credit line that fuel their productions, and given some belt-tightening in the economy, hopefully this should be soon."

There is literally nothing here to review. The story doesn't exist, there is literally no story at all, it's nowhere to be seen. The characters were yet again stupid for humour and yet again they failed to make anyone laugh. The writers have written nothing but an unfunny sketch show that lasts for a dire hour and a half. The jokes and 'funny' scenes weren't anywhere near funny. The acting was awful and the characters were just pop and movie references and wasn't shy about it either. The only character that almost got a smile from me was Juno or \"Juney\" as she is called in this atrocious movie. Basically, I'm just repeating what I've said for the other three movies they've made.\n\nDisaster Movie is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. I felt like I was having my eyes poked repetitively while being set on fire and that was only in the first five minutes. Friedburg and Seltzer have no clue how to write anything or how to make any kind of movie. I think they have a contest between themselves to see whether they can make a movie crappier than the last, I think this time they've really done it because it officially can't get any worse.\n\nRead more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

But even that couldn't save this bullsh*t excuse of a film. So all and all, I have to make this ten lines (Stupid rules). And I have to do so by adding things to this review that does not (and will not) make any sense to the general thing."

The movie is FUN...it's STUPID COMEDY...just because every movie isn't Ben Hur or The Godfather doesn't make it total junk. If someone is going to read the reviews of this movie, then odds are they know what this movie is about. And they don't need to hear what a bunch of square eggs say about it, either. It would be tantamount to asking a bunch of 18-year-olds writing a review on the silent film \"The Birth of a Nation\". In my opinion, any review giving a movie less than 5 stars must've been written by someone not appreciating what the movie is all about (and should be discarded). In other words, people who shouldn't have watched the movie in the first place. Maybe every movie theater should ALWAYS have Driving Miss Daisy available to these people just in case they may be \"forced\" to watch something different. That being said, I loved Date Movie, Superhero Movie, and a whole list of other stupid comedy movies and I don't think this movie was that bad...though not that great, either. If you liked Meet the Spartans, you'll like this one. It is pretty fast-paced and there are some funny parts you'll remember. I really would give this movie a 6 or 7, but I'm upping it to an 8 because I don't think a 1.3 rating is fair AT ALL.\n\nHope this helps someone."

According to my friend, the trailer was \"piss-your-pants hilarious!\" He's the reason I went to see this. No one else would be stupid enough to go with him and I didn't want him to go by himself because I expected the cinema to be empty. It pretty much was. The only other people there was a family of about 5 (who, I might add, walked out not even halfway through) and a couple of teenagers who somehow managed to survive it all. I salute their bravery.\n\nI think this may be the first time I saw a \"comedy\" (and I use that term very lightly) in a cinema and no one laughed. Not a single giggle. Not even from the teenagers, who were surprisingly quiet. As for me, I just sat there completely stone-faced asking myself why I had used my free cinema pass on this. The answer? Because 1) there was no way in hell that I was paying \u00a37.50 on this (pardon the pun) disaster and 2) because I didn't want, nay, couldn't let my friend face this alone. And what was the result? 90 minutes of the lamest jokes ever made. I don't think even my friend liked it, which was quite the surprise since he loved Date Movie, Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans. Now, exactly what does that tell you? Besides the fact that my friend likes stupid comedies, of course.\n\nChances are, you have no intentions of seeing this. Good, because this movie is low even for spoof standards. If you go see it at the cinema, you waste your time and money. If you watch it for free online, you waste your time. Basically, you waste something valuable if you watch this movie. IQ points, for example. Much like the producers of this movie."

Movies appeal differently to each overseas market, but violent, risqu\u00e9, or nonsense humor does well in many of them. Movies that come in between 8 and 9 on the IMDb scale usually don't do well here. They are perceived as too subtle (boring), are character driven (characters don't tear up the screen), have a message to tell (don't lecture me) or have a strong cultural theme (REAL American life is not interesting), don't do well. Blockbusters with mega stars do well everywhere. But movies like Disaster movie go straight to DVD and overseas markets. Shameful but true."

They just reference stuff without trying to spoof them and throw pop culture references into the jokes without being funny, tasteless vulgar jokes that are very forehead slapping and groan inducing and beyond awful acting.\n\nThis movie looks like it was filmed in a cardboard box, it's that bad! avoid this crap at all cost."

You will find yourself thinking - \"How much longer does this movie have? Where is my order from Amazon? Did I have an appointment today?\" and you quickly occupy yourself doing other, much more interesting activities such as writing reviews on IMDb while the movie fills the background with useless noise. How on earth a producer was willing to fund this movie will make one wonder how such good movies can come out of Hollywood with \"wet rags\" such as Disaster Movie receiving such publicity before a short and stunted appearance in movie theaters Then again if you have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING better to do with an hour and a half of your life, look no further. I would recommend folding laundry instead. While the appearances of familiar faces from other similar comedies such as Epic Movie will create an atmosphere of familiarity, you not feel at all as though you were part of the action, and be fully aware that you are wasting time sitting on your couch watching the worst movie (with little doubt) of 2008."

The script is biting - crisp and fresh - full of ideas executed to perfection by the stellar cast.\n\nAnother point to be noted and hailed, is the use of props and costume. Never before have such realistic caricatures been so well created - a mix of great costume design and wonderful acting.\n\nIn making Disaster Movie, Friedberg and Seltzer have redefined the boundaries of hilarious comedy, setting the bar so high, that no comedy produced in the next ten years could possibly match it. This wonder of cinema is a masterpiece, and guarantees a feature length thrill ride of jaw-dropping action, masterful pathos and bathos, and possibly the most iconic comedy script of the last fifty years.\n\n...or it's the worst thing ever made, including the H-bomb, and you must never see this yawning dog turd ever."

I'd rather watch political news for the last few months than see this movie once. Damn, i'd rather watch blank white screen for 2 hours than this piece of what doesn't even qualify as \"kitsch\" and have more fun. I can think of only one scene that could have been real fun. The one with the \"No Country For Old Man\" iconic guy with a tank in his hand, coming up to the movie director making a cameo in the movie, and sticking that gas valve to his forehead, and pulling the trigger. That scene would have made the production #1 of the worst movies ever, as it still (mysteriously) has trouble getting to that spot.\n\nSeriously, I'm writing down names of the directors, and swearing to avoid any of their future productions. I don't think they should be allowed near screenwriters or video cameras anymore, warranted by a court-issued restraining order."

Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, you two are idiots. The jokes are not clever. The plot is rubbish. Stringing together characters of other films from 2007-2008 is possibly the worst idea I have ever seen. Some of the scenes are a shameless-no shameful copy of the films that they supposed to parody. Parody? This is too ironic- like my review."

Whoever thinks this was a great movie was probably blind because this movie was a total disaster. There is a lot of.gross-out jokes and toilet humor in this movie, and they ruin a lot of good movies (including my favorite movie of all time The Dark Knight, which is a FAR superior movie than this crap), the acting is so awful, every single character is unlikable, the plot is unoriginal, the story is horrible, the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody is horrendous, the music is abysmal, and the special effects are poor.\n\nDisaster Movie is the worst movie I have ever seen.\n\nIt's worse than...\n\nThe Last Airbender Dragonball Evolution Battlefield Earth Ratatoing The Little Panda Fighter The Little Cars in the Great Race What's Up: Balloon to the Rescue!\n\nSon of the Mask Catwoman Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House Space Chimps 1 & 2 Doogal Bratz (2007) Mean Girls 2 Batman and Robin Mortal Kombat: Annihilation Fred: The Movie The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue Speed 2: Cruise Control Super Mario Bros.

It's absolutely abysmal. I'd recommend better movies than this like The Dark Knight, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the original Star Wars trilogy, Beauty and the Beast, The Godfather, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, The Lion King, The Matrix, The Shawshank Redemption, Spirited Away, and many other movies that are far superior than this crap.\n\nRating: 1/10."

Pretty much everyone intelligent enough to have an IMDb account knows why they're bad if they've ever seen any of the trailers. DISATSER MOVIE is, like all of them, useless. I didn't laugh. But it's still noticeably better than MEET THE SPARTANS. Despite the horrible costumes and puppets, it's not as horribly cheap looking and flimsy. It does have an embarrassingly empty \"comic dance off sequence\", but at least unlike SPARTANS it doesn't take up about 25% of the screen time. The JUNO spoof has a little bite to it, and Crista Flanagan's impression is pretty good. Nicole Parker brings some energy to the ENCHANTED spoof. It's not quite as jaw-dropping in its condescension to the audience as SPARTANS, which had the genuinely unbelievable moment where Friedberg and Seltzer thought they needed a narrator to explain that a scene where Carmen Electra wore a SPIDER-MAN suit was a SPIDER-MAN parody. Where SPARTANS had several gross-out gags that were too nauseating to be even vaguely amusing, DISASTER MOVIE has only one.\n\nIs it really worth noting that DISASTER MOVIE is an improvement when it's still painfully unfunny? Well if you had a student who failed all his classes and was also excessively disruptive, and he went to merely failing his classes, you'd have to say one or two nice things on parent's night.\n\nThe best thing you can say about DISASTER MOVIE is that it's exhaustive check-list \"parodying\" of almost every major summer 2008 release might make it a somewhat effective nostalgia trip in another decade or so."

However in a strange sort of way I found it surprisingly enjoyable, I actually found Epic Movie to be a fair bit worse. It's rather endearing to me watching terrible films, this was an intriguing experience.\n\nSo bad it's good? Well, kind of, but maybe not for the right reasons. More like so atrocious it becomes entertaining because of that.\n\nThe acting is poor no bones about it, it does seem that they're trying to be over the top but it doesn't even come off that way. Date Movie had a poor script like this one but some decent acting, resulting in a far better film. The film does not parody disaster movies and their tropes, it almost exclusively parodies popular releases at the time such as Juno (the actor playing 'Juney' actually did an okay job at imitating Juno.) The only thing resembling a disaster movie was the fact that sometimes the camera shakes around uncontrollably which is mean to resemble an earthquake. Well, it doesn't.\n\nIt has pretty much no story, it's just a case of the directors trying to cram in as many pop culture references as possible in the same film. Basically, a young man is told by an Amy Winehouse impersonator that an earthquake's gonna happen and they're all gonna die!\n\nThen that's it as far as the story goes. He also has a girlfriend who he finds in bed with Flava Flav (how was he relevant in 2008?) at the start of the film. He goes back to try and save her and succeeds. It's hardly a beautiful, tear-inducing romance, it's fair to say.\n\nIf breaking the world record on most amount of pop culture references in one film was what they were trying to achieve then they did it because this film has an outrageous amount of them and is almost the movie's only form of humour, alongside fart jokes. I confess I laughed maybe a surprising amount of times throughout, hence the 3 stars. However, most of these laughs were not because of the quality of the jokes, but more their complete lack of quality. How did this get greenlit? I guess that's why it's so interesting. The enchanted princess was quite funny with some her lines though. The things that do resemble jokes usually go on for so long that they just aren't even jokes anymore.\n\nThe song at the end was actually quite catchy and memorable. The special effects are just horrible, did this really have a 20 million dollar budget? Costumes look alright though.\n\nHorrendous film but I found it fun to watch because of that. Not because of it being good or even watchable. Maybe if you watched it with a few buddies drunk at a party you could have some fun. Or not. Yeah, probably not."

There is NOTHING to provide with entertainment and even if it is classified as a 'comedy' the humor is so lame and is seriously going to be one of those movies where you'll just shut it off in the middle. The writers were obviously influenced by drugs and everybody else had the intention to create the worst movie ever, I'm sure. Listen to the tagline, I'm sure this was their intention except to try to make a comedy that will maybe provide a few laughs for little kids; but everything else will just ruin your life. I'm serious, no wonder this movie is placed on the bottom 100; because it totally deserves it. Movies like this are why our economy is so bad... Truthfully.

Disaster Movie is just a random movie which does not make sense as the directors just find any movie to spoof. I don't really see any effort made by the directors, they just want money since their previous movies made quick money. So they thought, 'Why not make another stupid movie and earn some more money fast.'\n\nThe story: There are disasters coming to destroy the city. Four young and wacky people want to save the city from being destroyed. From there, the most random things come about like Iron man, Hellboy and etc. Basically, if you had seen Epic Movie or Meet the spartan, you would have already seen this movie. This is like the previous movies, Epic Movie and Meet the spartan. The only good thing about the movie is set, the costumes. I am surprised that the directors could find people that look alike of the movies characters.\n\nOverall: If you totally hate spoof movies, this will not please you. Those who watch Epic Movie and Meet the spartan, this will probably bore you. Those who miss recent spoof movies, catch this. Why is there no other recent movies that is at least like Superhero movie. I am waiting."

The writers tried to include as many films as possible to make fun of. I thought the whole high school musical scene with that ridiculous song was funny.

Epic movie, I'm not even kidding here worst movie ever made. I skipped Date Movie and Meet the Spartans just because I could tell by the previews they would be on the Epic movie level of worst movies. But out of sheer boredom I decide to watch Disaster Movie. It starts off rough, I hate 10000 BC and Amy Winehouse. They spoof pretty much everything from Juno to Alvin and the Chipmunks to Iron Man to Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda. There are certainly some questionable scenes that are flat out not funny or just horribly done but whatever I wasn't expecting much going in. But I give it a 10 because everyone else gives it a 1. If you watch Epic Movie and this back to back you will see this deserves a much higher rating, it's also better than the ones I listed up there after Scary Movie 2. I like the singing portions with the kids from high school also because it's funny. It's definitely better than the crap they have been pumping out the last 3-4 years."

The movie didn't even spoof any \"Disaster movies.\" What hulk, hellboy or even iron man have to do with this movie?\n\nIll be honest, the Chipmunk scene and Juno's character did spark a grin. But if not for this, i wouldn't have rated this movie 1 star.\n\nDo not go see this movie."

Most of the jokes weren't funny and there was so much stupidity. This is by far the worst parody I've seen.\n\nThe things they included are completely stupid, many of the movies they spoofed aren't disasters (EX: incredible hulk, Indiana jones, iron man, superbad, etc). The humor was awful and didn't work well. It had too much crude and sexual humor, not cool and funny .The beginning was wack and the ending was even worse, it seemed like they just had nothing left at the end so they just added some random crap...the acting was bad and the plot sucked big time If you value your money and time, you wouldn't watch this garbage.\n\nNow i see why this movie in #1 on the bottom 100 list.\n\nAs a rewatch on 10/05/22' and a little over 14 years since its theatrical release and the initial watch, opinions for the most part remain the same. However this time watched the unrated version (having not realized it was the unrated version prior to watching). The slight changes are simply F-bombs added (notably the end song). Forgotten how many musical acts were in this, almost like it's part musical. The film remains unfunny and all the gags and references fall flat. Similar to Epic Movie, one of the only positives are the actors portraying the celebrities/actors they are impersonating (the Will Smith/Hancock impersonator was quite accurate). The set designs for the scenes of the spoofs looked solid. Otherwise this film is just terrible and contains no laughs."

So I was dreading DISASTER MOVIE but am surprised to admit that it actually had some solid laughs. The film is essentially a free form blender of pop culture references in scene after scene with a threadbare plot to connect them. However, the interesting thing about the satire here is how dark and cynical it is. The film rightly points out the cynicism and hypocrisy of teen entertainment (ex. the shallow consumerism and robotic nature of HANNAH MONTANA, the mindless songs and false chasteness of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, the overwritten, annoying banter of JUNO, et al.). Even family films are deservedly skewered (the heroine of ENCHANTED turned into a drugged out, homeless hooker, KUNG FU PANDA literally a guy in a costume brawling it out and best of all, the savage ALVIN & THE CHIPMUNKS sequence that turns them into CRITTERS style, metal loving evil puppets). And how true it is that the summer blockbusters consist of one comic book film after another being churned into the marketplace for our consumption (the film correctly portrays the \"superheroes\" in this fashion, with a cow splattering each of them one by one). Add to that a musical number that ties all of these references together in a seamless fashion. Friedberg and Seltzer still have an amateurish quality to their film-making and several sequences are allowed to drag on a bit to kill time. But overall this is definitely worth a look and maybe you'll be surprised."

It is not any better than stepping on a Lego ten times in a row, or being flayed alive, or being tormented by having boiling oil poured all over your skin. Do you understand what I am saying?

It's that bad.\n\nJuney, who is supposed to be this quirky pregnant teen, talks like an idiot. She is supposed to exaggerate the style of speech which is common among Gen-Z's, but it's not funny and it's stupid as heck. It's. Not. Funny. At. All.\n\nDo yourself a favor: Do not watch this. Watch something good, like Vertigo, Casablanca, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or if you would prefer a comedy movie, then you should watch something like 'Some Like It Hot', 'Arsenic and Old Lace', or Doctor Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'. Those are some good comedy movies. Not this trash. If you want a good reason to stab yourself in the eye with a fork, then watch this. Otherwise, don't."

I was adequately entertained, though it wasn't exactly a particularly outstanding comedy experience.\n\nThe acting performances in \"Disaster Movie\" were fairly adequate, and there were a couple of familiar faces on the cast list, with the likes of Tony Cox, Tad Hilgenbrink, Carmen Electra and Kim Kardashian.\n\nWatchable for what it was, \"Disaster Movie\" is a kind of spoof that you watch once, then hardly return to it a second time, as there just wasn't sufficient contents to the storyline to support more than a single viewing.\n\nMy rating of \"Disaster Movie\" lands on a five out of ten stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nothing in Disaster Movie works. The actors don't even try, the jokes are the worst I have ever heard, the effects are painful to watch, the parodies are horrible, everything fails. The jokes are extremely unfunny, random at times, often don't feel like they have punch lines, and they go forever. In a film that is less than an hour and a half the jokes should not all be a minute long. When a joke is told the film feels like you just hit pause. The film stops, tells the very long and terrible joke, and when it is over and the film moves on it just stops again for another bad joke just seconds later. The parodies are unfunny, random at times, and make me feel horrible. All the jokes in the film are either physical (unfunny) or parody (very unfunny). A parody is meant to make someone laugh about something they've seen. This makes parodies the wrong way. Instead of making fun and at the same time honoring the thing being parodied Disaster Movie does neither of those two things. It doesn't honor anything. It doesn't make fun of much. The parodies are just there. The parodies most of the time are just the character from another movie saying that they are that character and then the character gets hurt. This is due to the parodies being made from trailers of the movies. Friedberg and Seltzer give a bad name to parodies when there is a lot of good parodies. Now to due this and other films under the same two directors the parody genre should retire. In the end Disaster Movie is a true disaster.\n\n0 stars out of 4\n\nAlso an MJ molesting joke in 2008. At the time MJ jokes hadn't been considered funny for years. The was just failure to realize a change in humor."

I didn't care for the script writing in terms of the way she exits the movie (no spoiler here). Likewise, the writers could have given her more to work with in her Hannah Montana bit.\n\nIke Barinholtz as Beowolf is not to be missed. I never new this guy had such talent until seeing him play about a dozen side-splitting characters in this film.\n\nVanessa Mannillo and Matt Lanter are such great eye candy for you and your girlfriend to watch during any lulls in the movie that you can't give this less than 8 stars out of 10. A hilarious no-brainer comedy that's just what the doctor ordered for a few laughs after a long day's work."

Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIf you can open up your mind to the above principals of comedy films, you can truly see this film as I saw it.\n\nThis film was absolutely hilarious. Sure, the gags were often dirty, sure they were politically incorrect, sure certain people would be offended by it. But honestly, it's just a cheap comedy meant to cause people to laugh until they have heart attacks. It's what the directors intended, and in my opinion they succeeded in it very well.\n\nSo, if you can possibly lower your IQ by a few points for an hour and half, I'm sure you'll find this movie very enjoyable."

One good thing about it was Nicole Parker, I feel that she made the movie watchable. The whole story (If there was one) Was confusing and stupid. They would go on to, lets say, Juno's water braking, then, she is OK again. I know it's not meant to be taken to heart and all but it was was still not much of a movie, most of the characters got annoying and you wish they would just go off screen already! They copy movies that weren't really on DVD yet (when filming some of the movies weren't out yet). Another annoying part was when some of the characters kept repeating the line, Mcloving or whatever he says got old really fast.\n\nOn a plus side, I did like this better than the last two mistakes they did, Epic Movie was unbearable and I feel that should be lower than this. Juno and The princess are really the only ones that I liked.\n\nGo see this if you really have nothing better to do and just want to switch off and watch a pointless movie.\n\n(out of 10)\n\nActing ***** Story ** Funny rating **** Overall *****\n\nI give it extra for the fact that I liked it better than Epic and Meet, but I won't be buying this anytime soon."

Disaster Movie is really bad and it lacks plot, but it has few funny scenes that in my books earns it 3 points. Most of the time you just watch it amazed how someone found an investor for a piece of crap like this, but the few funny parts ease the pain.\n\nI don't recommend that you watch this, but if you feel that you must, don't even think about buying it. Even renting this movie is a bit too generous, since you'd have to give your hard earned money to the movie-people who pulled this embarrassment together.

It seems that these \"film makers\" haven't learned their lesson after the first \"movie\". This \"film\", once again, has a lazy pointless story, terrible acting, cheesy special effects, dull sets/locations, and finally a cliched generic boring soundtrack to tie this diarrhea stain together. The story, or lack thereof, is just a cliched plethora of subplots with a cliched boring narrative and cliched snore fest that goes absolutely nowhere, again. Now, I do like the parody genre when it's executed properly. But, this \"film\" is anything but well executed! This \"movie\" has some of the worst direction that I have ever seen. Keep in mind, this \"movie\" has two directors. Yet, they still somehow screwed it up, again! How is that possible?! \"Cannonball Run\" franchise, eat your heart out! When I was putting my list of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen, I was debating whether to go with this one, or \"Epic Movie\". By a slight margin, this one was a little better. That's not saying much! The only moment I enjoyed was the Chipmunks getting crushed at the end. I hate \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\"! As far as the acting goes, it is just as dreadful, as the first \"film\"! Most of the so-called \"performances\" are so bad, that it leads you to question: \"what were you thinking?!\" Or another question, \"what kind of direction were the actors and actresses given?\" As for the special effects, the majority of them look cheesy and generic. Therefore, the special effects have not aged well. The sets/locations look dull and boring, and most of the interior scenes were obviously filmed in a studio. Finally, the musical score is boring, predictable and forced. No part of the score is memorable at all. \"Disaster Movie\" (which it is), certainly lives up to it's title. It is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it actually was a contender for my top 10 worst movies list, but didn't quite reach the mark. Still, there is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this \"film\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. The only positive thing I can gather from watching this \"movie\", like most other bad movies I've seen, is that I'll never have to watch it again. Stay away from \"Disaster Movie\", trust me, it is the epitome of a disaster!"

Yes, folks, just as she does when needed on MADtv, Nicole Parker saves this movie from the status of atrocity to mediocrity. She should do films more often. She is just as funny on the big screen as on the small. Anyway, I cannot in good faith recommend this movie, but it's not without its moments. So, let this review guide you as you wish."

The main storyline/spoof is based on Cloverfield. Other movies thrown into spoof mode are Indiana Jones, Iron Man, Batman, Juno, Alvin and the Chipmunks, and Hannah Montana. Almost none of these films are disaster movies, just to let you know.\n\nThere are some strong points and weak, disastrous points. The 10,000 BC and Amy Winehouse jokes sucked. The Alvin and the Chipmunks and Indiana Jones scenes are funny. I also agree with most people that the Hannah Montana scenes were annoying.\n\nThere are some great actors in here.

You don't really have to pay attention to this movie, and as such, I was entertained.\n\nThere were several laugh-out-loud moments here, but unfortunately this movie (like all others in this vein) suffers from over-repetition of jokes, some go on for too long and some that are not really funny.\n\nWhile \"Disaster Movie\" isn't a comedic masterpiece, it's not nearly as bad a film as people make it out to be. I'd say it's okay. So if you don't like silliness, stay away. I had some fun, and that's what I was expecting."

This movie is like one big laugh, you can barely catch your breath before the next thing crack you up, you would have to be extremely dull if you do not find this movie the slightest big funny. This twisted form of humor is just so great, and the way things happen in the movie is truly epic, you constantly get surprised of the makers ways of introducing stuff, you just sit back laugh and wonder how the hell did they come up with stuff like that.\n\nVERDICT: Hilarious hilarious hilarious movie that I would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for complex and twisted humor.\n\n10/10 and a contender for the greatest movie ever made."

I suppose the one thing this movie could be useful for would be for someone looking back on the year 2008 and trying to figure out what had come out within the last year and a half or so.

The visuals are completely unfinished and some of the designs scare me. The costumes are a joke. The characters should not exist in a disaster movie like this. The acting would have to be some of the worst for a movie. And everything feels out of place. Seeing Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer made other parody movies that prove how much of the directors they turn out to be. If you ask me, this is the only movie from them I will ever watch. I'm not looking anymore of these pieces of garbage. Please, in any circumstances, do me a favor and never, I mean never watch this film. Your sanity is much more important than losing it by risking 80 minutes of cringe. If there is the one thing we can all agree on is yes, it really is that bad. It may not be an official trilogy, but I'm pretty sure this is the worst trilogy to exist. The title is the only good thing because this has came out a disaster."

It's just pop-culture reference after pop-culture reference. No piece of media is safe. It's a terrible time capsule of the late 2000s.\n\nPeople literally die out of nowhere just for laughs.

The movie just ended by the way. So I guess my review is done. I don't wanna give this movie anymore attention. It doesn't deserve this much attention. Good bye.\n\nTL;DR - Movie bad. Like, BAD bad. Good bye."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to admit that I am not the target audience for Disaster Movie. I have not watched any other of the franchise before and probably don't know the movies it is spoofing well enough to enjoy its \"jokes\". The only reason I was watching it is that as of the day of writing, this occupies toe top (or bottom?) spot on the IMDB bottom 100 list. According to that ranking it beats stuff like \"Manos The Hand of Fate\", \"Birdemic\" and \"Saving Christmas\", so as a bad movie lover I had to see it. And right off the bat: yeah, the badness oozes right from the first minute of this one. There is incoherent storytelling, bad acting, unfunny and tasteless jokes galore and enough confusing stuff to make your head spin. And yet, this is not the worst movie there is and the reason is Nicole Parker. Even when she first appears as the gasoline gulping Amie Winehouse lookalike the scene becomes enjoyable in a weird way. And when she later reenters the scene as the enchanted princess - although her lines are as crappy or even crappier than those of the rest of the cast - she is neither embarrassed nor pompous, but she seems to be fully aware and she seems to enjoy playing this crap as much as a bad movie lover enjoys watching it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the movie is still a confusing mess filled with tasteless jokes but because of this exceptional performance it is not nearly the worst film I have seen."

I mean Really How Can Anyone Even Like This. If I was Director I would Show these Guys How A real Director Makes This Film. However In My Less Then Negative Terms Id Say That Adding A celebrity Into a Film Is Better Then Using The Same Character In A movie.

Raised by a blues guitarist father, in 1985 Corgan formed his own band, but it never caught on. He founded a new alternative rock band, Smashing Pumpkins, in 1989 where he was the lead vocalists and guitarist. A year later the band signed a recording contract, and in 1991 they released their debut album Gish. The band experienced success through the 1990s with albums such as Siamese Dream (1993) and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995), the latter of which went platinum nine times in the U.S. Smashing Pumpkins broke up in 2000, but reunited in 2006.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMusician William Patrick Corgan, Jr., better known as Billy Corgan, was born on March 17, 1967, in Elk Grove, Illinois. Corgan was raised primarily by his father, blues guitarist Bill Corgan, Sr., and his stepmother. The young Corgan played music in high school and formed his first band, The Marked, in 1985. Even after relocating to Florida, the band never hit its stride, and a few years later Corgan found himself back in Chicago, working in a record store and scheming his next musical venture.\n\nForming Smashing Pumpkins\n\nWith guitarist James Iha, bassist D'Arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, Corgan founded Smashing Pumpkins in 1989. The band??s psychedelic alternative rock ??and Corgan??s ripping guitar solos and lead vocals ??soon gained a loyal following in the Chicago club scene. Smashing Pumpkins signed with Caroline Records in 1990, and their debut album, Gish, was released the following year.\n\nDisbanding and Reunion\n\nIn 2000, following a struggle with Chamberlin??s heroin addiction, the Pumpkins parted ways, after which Corgan and Chamberlin founded the short-lived band Zwan. After its demise, Corgan released his solo debut, TheFutureEmbrace, in June 2005. Smashing Pumpkins reunited in 2006, with Ginger Reyes on bass and Jeff Schroeder on guitar replacing Wretzky and Iha. The band played its first reunited show in May 2007 and released Zeitgeist later that summer."

I think I can do it better than this, even without a high budget camera!\"This film's plot is as delicate and absent as a fart in the wind, seriously talking about that would be more worthwhile and less of a waste of time than this awful creation.

The movie industry is absolute trash and even the society around these movies and what they actually believe in or stimulated by is also complete trash. These movies make fun of those movies but they do it in such a terrible terrible way that it should put into perspective how bad the original movies they are making fun of are. I wouldn't buy these movies and I sure as hell wouldn't go see it in theaters, but I give them a thumbs up for making trash portray how much trash is in the movie industry today. Keep up the cynical, facetious, and over the top anti-humor. I commend you, and I only recommend watching this in bits or if you are bored to absolute death."
