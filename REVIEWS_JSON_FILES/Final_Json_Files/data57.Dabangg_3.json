Could have marginally done better with the plot, but the script didn't make much sense. Won't see Dabangg 4 coming after such performance. It is completely Salman Centric and it doesn't really have anything except for his charm. With the poor script, it vanishes too."

Nowadays, people err their judgments due to the positive or negative hype, can't have their own personal liking and disliking. If something is in trends it must be spectacular, If something is not it must be crap, that is the scenario for Dabanng 3.\n\nDabanng 3 is a film, which works on the element of Masala genre, and Salman Khan, which is in its own brand, a cinema. His films don't work on the laws of filmmaking, he is the \"BHAI\" Afterall, a mammoth of personality and attitude and that's what he has presented in Dabanng 3 but the film was let down by its visual effects and down south action choreography if the action director emphasized on the dramatic and simple action, It would be a gem film.\n\nThe story has loopholes, It has all the flavors of a masala genre, but didn't well made, the villain looks weak, never developed throughout the film and Sudeep acted brilliantly If he had given more screen presence and some more cruel tricks, it will be an altogether different film. Everyone knows about Chulbul, so if the Bali Singh has more roots in the story, It would be fun to watch, battling one another.\n\nMusic was another weakest link of the film, Only Munna Badnaam Hua, has some moves and tunes the songs were pathetic, probably the worst Salman Khan films album. He has a definite taste, I am quite shocked what happened to him, with his music sense.\n\nDabanng 3 could be better, but it is watchable, a masala entertainer, the action and music irritate you but Sae Manjrekar, Sudeep, Sohail Khan, and Dhakad Chand Pandey makes you watch this film till the end.\n\nA mindless entertainment, only for Salman Khan diehard followers otherwise a boring cop drama."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dabangg 3 - This installment has Salman Khan written all over it, practically. He is the producer, story (ahem) writer, screenplay writer, and of course, the hero. The result is a 150 minute film with him in every frame, more narcissistic than ever before. Actually \"main thoda confujiya gaya hoon, ki yeh kis genre ki film hai - comedy, thriller, action, ....\", but who cares, it has Salman Khan, the rest can take a walk. Actually, Dabangg 3 was meant to be a prequel to the original - the transformation of Dhaakad Singh Pandey to Chulbul Pandey and the inspiration behind it, Khushi (Saiee Manjrekar), his original love interest. Thereafter, it turns into a revenge saga of epic proportions.\n\nBut let's not go into the story as there isn't one. Dabangg 3 has so much of Salman Khan in it that even his die hard fans will pray for a break. Alas, there is no mercy here. There are numerous subplots that refuse to allow focus to the narrative and the film keeps meandering. On top of that, there isn't cohesion within the screenplay which makes it disjointed - a comic scene is quickly followed by an action sequence and then a romantic interlude featuring a song. It's downright disturbing and amateurish. Dabangg 3 is at best a polished 1970's potboiler that aims to drive home a few social messages.\n\nKichcha Sudeepa as Bali Singh, Chulbul's antagonist is the only one who delivers a credible and almost menacing performance. His output is well nuanced and he makes a good hand at acting. Saiee Manjrekar is passable, Sonakshi Sinha constantly pouts and is irritating. The interaction between Salman and Sonakshi has some senseless baby talk (meant to be sweet nothings), completely lacking chemistry. The music by Sajid Wajid is good, but there are too many songs that grate on the nerves. This time director Prabhudeva fails to deliver a taut thriller, but I personally believe that it must be because of Salman's creative dabbling.\n\n3 STARS overall, maybe with a little less of Bhai it could have earned a better rating. Avoid, if you aren't a die hard Sallu fan."

I enjoyed the first one as there was some competence visible and effort put into it. The second one lost all the strengths of its predecessor and barely had anything charming about it. However, what Salman Khan has done to the third installment is absolutely atrocious.\n\nDabangg 3 reunites us with Chulbul Pandey as we see him go up against Balli Singh, an enemy from the past that destroyed his first love.\n\nThis story isn't anything special. We've seen countless films in the past that have used this exact same storyline and now it's at point where it has become old and overused but since Salman Khan knows people will turn up to his film no matter what it's about, it was a smart move from him to write the most generic revenge story. Speaking about the writing, this screenplay is one of the worst of the year. Everything is so bland. So many of the jokes fall flat which make it excruciatingly difficult to sit through the film's 2 hour 30 minute runtime. I feel Khan should just stick to acting because writing is not his cup of tea.\n\nFrom the trailer alone I could tell how bad this film was going to be but I had a bit of hope that at least the action would be entertaining to watch. Apart from the final battle, every other action scene had nothing exciting about it. On top of that the action WASN'T EVEN SHOT WELL. There were a few times where you couldn't tell what was happening due to the poor camerawork and direction. Prabhudeva, what went wrong?! Let's not forget the unbearable editing. There is so much slow motion used which make the scenes go on forever and visual effects that are completely unnecessary. The background score was obnoxious throughout and the overabundance of songs dragged the film further.\n\nI feel the choice of having an origin story had a lot of potential. It would have been a great way to add further depth to Chulbul's character and help us learn more about the villain but sadly none of this is explored in much detail. Salman Khan does an earnest job as Chulbul Pandey even though, a couple of times, he was a bit too over the top. Sudeep also does a good job despite his severely underwritten role. He brings a good amount of intensity to his character but we learn nothing from his character. He's one of the most basic antagonists you could come up with. The female roles were also played well but had very little to do. They just served as plot points and nothing beyond that.\n\nAt this point this franchise should end. All the humour, charm and wit that was gained in the first one has been fully lost in Dabangg 3. This is one of the most boring films of the year and an absolute pain to finish. I wish Abhinav Kashyap would come back to help give this series the boost it needs."

        "review_detailed_main": "#FinalVerdict\n\nThe pre-Christmas week has at last shown up. The best is always reserved for the last and it has been a custom to have at least one biggie unfurl in the Christmas week before the curtains fall on the on-going year. Salman Khan teams up with the Hit machine - director Prabhudheva -- yet again. In addition, several enviable names, on and off-screen, lend muscle to the enterprise. The canvas is gigantic as well. It can't get bigger than Dabangg 3, honestly.\n\nPrabhudheva is synonymous with audience-friendly movies. Most critics may abhor his work, however, the paying public - the ones who matter ultimately - adores his film. His films may not offer ground-breaking stuff, nor do they get exemplary honours, yet he whips up a storm at the box-office each time he attempts a high-on-entertainment fare.\n\nThis is for fans and adversaries of Salman Khan... Fans, cheer, Salman is back furiously with Dabangg 3. This is his deadliest performance to date. Indeed, you read it right! Adversaries, sorry, you won't have the option to lash out at him or dispatch a horrendous tirade this time. Well, without mincing my words, I must avow that Dabangg 3 is aimed exclusively at the hoi polloi. It rides on Salman Khan's star power. In a film like Dabangg 3, in a role that appears to be an expansion of his character, you can't even consider any other actor portraying this role with flourish.\n\nRecollect the successful potboilers of yore. Recall how the hero would diminish 10 goons to mash in a fraction of seconds. Recall how heroism won at last, regardless of how unfriendly the conditions were. Recall those films wherein rationale assumed a lower priority since the attention was on entertainment... You relive those moments as Dabangg 3 unfolds. It may/may not make sense to you, but screenplay writers - Salman Khan, Prabhudheva and Aloke Upadhyaya - ensure that you are entertained.\n\nWith Dabangg 3, one is well prepared about what's in store. The sole factor that director Prabhudheva needs to stress over is whether Dabangg 3 would meet the towering and monumental expectations. More so, because Salman Khan is contending with himself. Salman Khan has redefined superstardom with mass entertainers. He's box-office's favourite actor and seems invincible and insurmountable at the moment! Hardcore masala films are relished with glee by the audience and Dabangg 3 takes this genre one step ahead. Sure, it's an old wine packed in a brand new bottle but the result is sheer magic. Most importantly, Dabangg 3 has Salman Khan like never before. In fact, breathing fire and venom, Chulbul Pandey aka Robinhood Pandey taps Salman's star power like no film has. Dabangg 3 stands on three pillars - Salman Khan's star power, smashing stunts and super music.\n\nIn a nutshell, Dabangg 3 delivers what it promises: Entertainment in enormous doses. Prabhudheva's latest offering speaks the language that the masses comprehend. It's one formula that can never go out of fashion if handled smartly. Actually, Chulbul Pandey has come to represent the common man and that's yet another reason why you root for him, feel overjoyed and ecstatic when he triumphs in the finale. For anyone who needs to comprehend what is the on-screen meaning of Bollywood, Dabangg 3 is absolutely textbook fare.\n\nLet's face it, Dabangg 3 has nothing ground-breaking to offer as far as the story (Salman Khan) is concerned. But what makes Dabangg 3 shine, and shine brightly, is Salman Khan's star power, which camouflages the aberrations wonderfully. The film is special for two more reasons: Anl Arasu's stunts and Sajid-Wajid's music. Talking of action scenes, Salman's introduction at the start and the fight-to-finish in the climax, when Salman's shirt tears apart and the rippling muscles and the bare-chest fight ensues, will send the masses in frenzy. To state that the action scenes are outstanding, especially the fight in the finale would be an understatement. Mark my words, the action scenes will lead to chaos at mass-dominated centres, especially at single screens. It won't be erroneous to state that the climax is worth the price of the ticket, samosa, sandwich, popcorn, nachos and cola put together.\n\nSajid-Wajid's music is of a mixed variety and gels wonderfully with the genre of the film. Munna Badnaam Hua track will send the viewers into raptures. The background score (Sandeep Shirodkar) is electrifying and in sync with the on-screen situations. Dialogue (Dilip Shukla and Aloke Upadhyaya) are excellent. The lines are written with equivalent flamboyance and will be greeted with claps and whistles. Mahesh Limaye's cinematography is top-notch and he makes every frame appear larger-than-life.\n\nBut Dabangg 3 is not without its share of flaws. The film stands on a thin storyline and the viewer can guess what's in store next. Besides, the film could've done without a song or two, thereby keeping its length in check (editor: Ritesh Soni). However, these are minor aberrations. For, the plusses easily outweigh and outnumber the minuses here.\n\nThe principal cast provides the much-needed sheen to Prabhudheva's vision. Salman Khan uses his fists, spews venom and threats, bullies the villain, flirts and romances, does the pelvic thrusts... in fact, he does everything that one expects from Chulbul Pandey. Honestly speaking, Dabangg 3 is a Salman Khan vehicle and the actor is the Big Boss here. You cannot imagine anyone else doing what he does. And every time he plays to the gallery, many in the audience (especially at single screens) are sure to fling the loose change on screen as a mark of appreciation for his on-screen antics. He defies logic and gets away with it! He is like a ferocious lion who roars with all his might. The show belongs to the actor, who scorches the screen every time he displays the manic anger. From a statutory warning against cigarette and gutka, mouthed by Khan, to his anti-dowry stance and a message on water conservation and a dig at demonetization at the very end, there is also ample messaging to be found in the movie.\n\nSonakshi Sinha's pairing with Salman looks wonderful. She is her usual chirpy and feisty self as Rajjo. She delivers the right expressions. The newcomer Saiee Manjrekar has an infectious charm and radiates confidence all through the enterprise. The character she portrays has tremendous mass appeal. Also, the desi girl image suits her impeccably. She is camera-friendly and confident to the T. Arbaaz Khan is okay. Dimple Kapadia is truly wonderful. Pramod Khanna (brother of late Vinod Khanna) is excellent. Kichcha Sudeep has a good screen presence. He is superb as the antagonist. He's venomous to the hilt! Yet another sterling act that doesn't miss a beat! He takes giant strides as an actor & gives the film the much-needed support.\n\nOn the whole, Dabangg 3 is the emblematic formula movie with distinct essentials that Indian masses yearn for. The film is for those who seek unabashed entertainment and relish masala films. Damn the indomitable critics, pseudo-intellectuals and connoisseurs of parallel cinema, this one's not for them. Dabangg 3 is for the aam junta. Entertainment guaranteed. Dabangg 3 is your ticket this festive season. Dhamaal entertainer!"

RGV ki Aag looks like a masterpiece when compared to Dabangg 3 . I can guarantee you will literally sleep during the movie or will go out 20 times for a smoke . No comedy ( not even forced comedy), extremely bad action , but still better than Tiger Zinda Hai and Bharat .any movie directed by Ali Abbas Zardad should be in waste bin . My advice : If you are Salman fan and if you like garbage like Tiger zinda hai and Bharat , then you won't be disappointed . This is far better than those 2 craps in terms of entertainment\n\nAll eyes on Good News now . Let's see how the Canadian fares this time \ud83d\ude02"

Nicely done-the work of Vfx(for body shaping and to show Salman khan young). \"Saiee\" the 2nd actress/the love lady of Chulbul's life (younger days) is cute and sweet. Makkhi is good. Khushi (Saiee) doesn't get much screen time, same with Rajjo (Sonakshi) but Rajjo is Rajjo. the Villian Sudeep (Balli) worked very well and gave his best(not like all villains before). It's a good movie but lengthy 2 hours 42 min phewww.. Verrrry long. Fighting Sequence is long(Just because of Slo-Mo) and Unnecessary Songs. A Paisa vasool(worth watch) for some and blockbuster for Salman khan fans. If you're Salman Khan's fan and paying too much then its ok, if you're not a fan then think."

Singham might not be planned but they are shaping it well.\n\nThere is nothing noteworthy about the third part of franchise. Same old love story and typical love and revenge saga, foolish action sequences and a rushed ending.\n\nThe story was so outdated and so predictable. There was no twists and turn and whatever there was so so obvious from beginning it looked like Salman had free time in his hands so they decided to do another Daabanng\n\nMusic was so average and half of the movie was lost songs that were placed at wrong intervals through out the movie. I found them to be distracting as they took my mind out of the story.\n\nThe only good part of the movie was the villain who had a lot of potential but he was portrayed as a weak villain with very poor character written but honestly if they had put mind and sweat into this movie they could have take this movie to another heights and have it face off Singham/Simmba which was interesting movie to watch last year\n\nSave your self some time and money and watch it on TV"

        "review_detailed_main": "I usually don't watch sequels without seeing the original film. However, when it is a bad movie and the original isn't so bad, I go right to the bad film in some cases. Why? Because the sequels have managed to make IMDB's ignoble Bottom 100 List...and I, for some odd reason, like to see these films. Fortunately, it's not all I like...there are many wonderful films I love. But ever since reading \"The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time\" (by Harry Medved), I find I occasionally like seeing godawful movies just for the laughs they unintentionally generate. Will \"Dabangg 3\" generated laughs...or just be a chore to finish?\n\nSalman Khan stars in the series and I've seen him in quite a few other Indian films. I must admit he is not among my favorites...mostly because the films of his I've seen tend to be gangster and action ovies....which are not among my favorites...though I have loved a few of his movies, such as \"Baabul\" and \"Baghban\". Unfortunately, he's also made movies like this one as well as \"Race 3\" and \"Tees Maar Khan\"...which are among my least favorite Indian films.\n\nLike in the other \"Dabangg\" films, Khan plays a cop...Inspector Pandey. He's a super-cop who is able to take on gangs all by himself...though the film definitely tends towards showing him doing this in a comedic and over-the-top manner...and almost cartoonish. It also uses a lot of so-called 'wire fu'...a technique popularized in Hong Kong martial arts films where folks fly through the air when fighting...because they're being pulled by wires (which are digitally removed...making the person seem to 'fly'). This COULD work...but does it? Well, judging by its overall score of 3.0, I'd say that would be no.\n\nWhat's to like? Well, like many Indian films, there is the usual singing and dancing...and it's choreographed well and the songs aren't bad.\n\nWhat's not to like? The biggest problem I noticed is Khan's character. At times, he is almost a caricature and if you don't like this strange and funny caricature, then you're in trouble as he's in every frame of the movie!! He also often stares into the camera...mugging quite a bit. Khan lovers will like this...most others will just feel it's a case of Khan overload or that this is some vanity project.\n\nOverall, too much action, one dimensional characters and, most importantly, not much fun to watch. It's not among the worst Indian films (despite being on the IMDB Bottom 100)....but it's pretty difficult to enjoy...even as a bad film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dabangg 3 review :\n\nSalman Khan is back to wish us Merry Christmas. Usually reserving an Eid release for his films, he decides to give his fans an early Eidi this time. Enjoying superstar status like no other today, Khan ticks off all the boxes in the checklist of what his fans typically desire from him.\n\nA hero wali entry- tick Slow motion action - double tick Cheesy one liners - tick tick tick One item gaana - tick Shirtless scene - tick tick. (Even his pants drop in this one). A formidable villain - tick\n\nIn short, Dabangg 3 has everything crammed in its two hour fifty minutes run time just to please the lowest common denominator which comprises Salman's loyal fan club.\n\nWhat the film doesn't have is a story, sense and sensibility. Now now, dont take me to be an elite prude or a Bhai hater! I aint. Infact, I personally liked his Dabangg 1 (2010) and few recent blockbusters like Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) and Sultan (2016). I genuinely tried hard to enjoy Dabangg 3 as well but failed.\n\nThe first half is pathetic where nothing - absolutely nothing - happens. The family shamily drama is a yawn and Chulbul Pandey's (Salman obviously) backstory with his young sweetheart Khushi (Saiee Manjrekar) is unexciting, to put it mildly. That debutant Saiee looks like Salman's beti in the romantic scenes makes matter worse. ..\n\nNext, the main villain Bali Singh (Kichcha Sudeepa) enters the frame, falls for Chulbul's girl and begins his full on rivalry with Pandeyji.\n\nOn the films only positive, Kannada Superstar Kichcha Sudeepa plays a truly effective antagonist and actually steals the thunder from Salman bhai in most of the scenes he appears in. Brilliant!\n\nSaiee Manjrekar looks pretty but gets too small a role to prove her acting chops. Sonakshi Sinha, reprising her role of Rajjo, is strictly okay. Pramod Khanna fills in for his late brother Vinod Khanna's Prajapati Pandey role. One misses the original Munni Malaika Arora's sexy thumkas in the 'Munna Badnaam hua' item number.\n\nOn the tech front, editing by Ritesh Soni is below par. Prabhu Deva's direction is even worse. More woe, the songs are not a patch on the previous two installments and they keep popping up every ten fifteen minutes to slow down the already sluggish narrative. The action finale is stretched beyond a point of endurance.\n\nFinally, Dabangg 3 seems to be a hurriedly made and haphazardly assembled product which adds no value to the franchise.\n\nSince a decade or two, Salman Khan has been repeating himself in film after film. Nevertheless, he has achieved remarkable success churning the same outdated content to his star struck fans. The question remains, For how long??!!!!\n\nRegards Sumeet Nadkarni"

The movie has no extraordinary things or new things, it just go around in the same way.\n\nThings I liked about the movie 1. Kiccha Sudeepa The factor that saves the movie from being a complete disaster is Kiccha Sudeepa's performance. He as a villan has given a perfect welcoming to himself in this Bollywood industry. His role is the only thing you wish to watch again and again. This actor can nail any role given to him.\n\n2. The connections The past two installations have been used in a perfect manner to create a unknown version of Dabangg or in other words the flashback of Dabangg.\n\nThings for not to watch this movie. 1. Songs Except 'Munna Badnaam Hua' you cannot enjoy any songs, even if you want to enjoy them.\n\n2.Cinematography Nothing new from Prabhudeva. The cinematography was better in the last two installments.\n\n3.Only Salman The movie is not much crowded but watching only salman for the whole time makes the movie unbearable.\n\n4.The story The movie doesn't give you any kind of thriller. The story is completely predictable and no twist or turn in the movie.\n\n5.Action sequels The overwhelming action sequels just urge you to go away from the theaters."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dabangg movie series has almost established itself as a cult cinema series and it always reminds us of Sallu Bhai's signature moves, whenever we think about it. The 3rd installation of the series is now finally here and this movie has been dubbed into Kannada also this time to cater to the Kannada speaking audience. This is another win for the dubbing activists as the dubbing 'ban' of other movies into Kannada cinema is steadily coming off!\n\nThe story of the film has its links to the earlier 2 parts and mainly shows Chulbul Pandey's encounter with another gangster named Balli Singh. The story also shows some events prior to that of the first film, acting as a prequel. It shows how Chulbul becomes a loveable cop A.K.A. Robinhood Pandey and how Balli Singh is connected to his past.\n\nThe script is very poorly written with a predictable and uninteresting storyline. The film feeds the viewer with a huge platter of action than what he can actually digest! There are also lot of illogical twists and turns making this one a draggy affair.\n\nThe film lacks the effective usage of dialogues and there should have been more of it to keep the viewer engaged. There are also a lot of unnecessary slow motion scenes, testing your patience and making this movie experience a tedious one to watch.\n\nSalman Khan is at his usual best, Kicchha Sudeepa gives out a good performance. Sonakshi Sinha looks beautiful as Chulbul's dear wifey! Saiee Manjrekar gives a picture perfect act. The music is the major plus point of this film and there are some catchy foot-tapping songs which will definitely entertain you!\n\nAll in all this film has a weak storyline and an overdose of action sequences. It can however serve as a decent timepass cinema outing for the family audience!"

I left right after the Munna song and Im thinking why didnt I leave early. Its pathetic. Given 2 stars just because of Salman. Otherwise my review would have been in negative. Its high time he gets back to some sensical movies like Bajrangi and Sultan. Im really afraid he seems to be digging his own grave. Eagerly waiting for Inshallah and Radhe. Hope these movies wont disappoint like his recent movies like Bharat and D3. Prabhudeva seems to be looking for exploiting punches and dialogues from D1 and D2 but falls too short. Im utterly disappointed, had big hopes from the Dabangg genre. It seems none of the characters was interested in doing this movie and everyone is just sleepwalking. Sai seems fresh and Sudeep too dramatic. I couldnt find anything appealing to sit through the entire duration of the movie, didnt even wait for Sallu to go shirtless. May God give him some sense. His ardent fans like me expect much more from him."

Here he also launched Sai Manjrekar, Pramod Khanna, Warina for item number and to make Sudeep to enter in bollywood. This is the brigher side of D3 and my 4 starts for this. But worst side is movie is so childish that even a child will laugh on stupid direction. Who is the Prabhudeva ( I know, you know and all knows) who directs such stupid and foolish way? And story writer is Salman. Wow! There is no need of story writer and director to make mega boring movie. Even a kid of 10-12 would direct better. Total failure movie. I barely sat in the hall till end. Salman should stop to work with such stupid directors like Prabhudeva or Remo ( Race 3) and should do some meaningful movie. Nothing interesting in movie. No thrill, no tension and no logic here only glorified drama. To say truly I enjoyed Warina's item number only in whole movie. She looks fresh rather than Nora Fatehi. Rest movie is wastage."

I would rather watch this movie which was mildly entertaining than what has been coming out of Bollywood recently full of 90s remix songs and remakes. I look forward to Salman bhais next film."

To top it off it is directed by prabhudeva.\n\nEven making a bad film is an art.

Songs could be limited ,it was irritating to watch that much songs. Secong half of the movie had many songs, atleast 2 of them completely meaningless. If you are a fan of salman's action and dabang series you should watch the movie as overall it was an entertainment."

I repeat. There are agencies that are paid to write negative reviews about salman's movies because he is the biggest star and people want to see his downfall. The movie is SUPERB 4/5 rating.

And SK gave big hits whenever there were good scripts and directors. Kabir Khan and Ali Abbas Zafar are very talented and delivered quality movies. Now I watched Dabangg 3, directed by Prabhu Deva, story and screenplay by Salman Khan, and I have to say the following :\ndirection was very very poor\ndialogues were terrible\n\n\nI watched Veer, Jai ho and i must say those movies were masterpieces compared to this. They had some good scenes, some good songs, some nice twists. But Dabangg3... I've never seen a movie so bad in my whole life. Everything about it is just terrible. I wish i could give it zero stars. No offence but this movie is just insulting for the viewers and i don't understand how it's got a rating of 3.5 on imdb."

Just there are few dialouges which are awesome and some acting of Salman Khan is up to the mark.\n\nI know this franchise is very popular. If you watch it expecting like a comedy drama with overwhelming fighting then it's not a bad movie. If you want to judge the movie and want to find logics then you will be dissapointed. It's a family movie so no 18+ scene but some dialouges are cheaky. I cannot suggest this one also cannot tell you to not waste your precious 2 hours. Choice is yours.\n\nPersonal Rating - 2.5/10 (Yeah you all know that I am...)"

He was the backbone of the film and really kept me glued to the screen. But this time Salman was clueless. He overacted, had bad dialogue delivery throughout the film and the acting was horrible.\n\nSalman always receive negativity in terms of acting but I am one of the few people who genuinely loves his acting. He is a natural entertainer but in this movie he failed totally as an actor..\n\nYou are spending so much movie on this type of heavy budgeted movie and still making dud ones?\n\nSecond half of Dabangg 3 was still somewhat watchable but the first half was really really horrible.\n\nSaiee Manjrekar was good and sonakshi sinha was okay. Sudeep was really good in this movie. Music was a big let down.\n\nThe only saving grace for me in this film was that I watched this on Amazon Prime, not in theatre. :)"

The dance scenes only sadly succeed in revealing Salman's loss of mobility - that they try to make up for with camerawork and itching steps. After watching this movie , several cringes later - one can only hope that Salman realizes he is past his prime playing the lead romantic or action hero."

Im sorry , not only parts but the whole movie is garbage even its songs ,dance scenes. One more what salman thinks of himself is he really a superman who can do everything in movie, a screenplay writer ,singer , producer, actor. uff he really made me sick.

        "review_detailed_main": "I mean if you went to this movie you already knew what a typical Salman Khan action movie would be like, esp. Dabanng series. I infact found this to be best of this series, second being the worst.\n\nMost people are love to hate Salman for making same movies, but still have not watched Bajrangi Bhaijaan which is one of best movies in Bollywood in the last decade. Many of the 1-star reviews sound like some drunken pretentious idiots blabbering. These same people would not trouble watching some Hollywood flick which is just as ridiculous, and almost every action movie is ridiculous in some aspect. Its not meant to be an exercise in philosophy, just good entertainment. I am we all love Dark Knight series, but just how realistic is it to have a caped crusader. Its still a great series.\n\nComing to the movie, the first 10-20 mins are definitely cringeworthy. Even I stopped watching in the first fight scene itself. So a lot of people might have written reviews without watching the entire movie. But the movie goes on a different level after main story starts. Sudeep esp. as a villain is pure evil. He is the best of villains so far in this series. Just has a cold psychopath demeanor which plays perfect counterfoil to the over the top hero.\n\nThe action sequences are far more tamed, and the movie has just the right dose of comedy action and drama. Some people would like to hate Salman for trying to be in every scene, but the first two scenes in which he meets the villain are almost entirely on Sudeep, Salman being the secondary actor there.\n\nI however skipped the songs, and there seemed to be too many of them.\n\nSalman as usual is the superstar, he is funny and serious in just what the scene demands. Granted he does not have the best diction in a few scenes, but he isn't gunning for Oscar either.\n\nIf you want to watch some deep intellectual stuff, I dont even know what you are doing here. For those who want to watch a good action comedy, please just forward through the first 10-15 mins and then enjoy."

The film shifts its tone once Pandey ji finds out that the boss of the human trafficking gang he caught (Sudeep) is someone he had a run in with in the past. There we get a flash back of Pandey ji's younger days before he became a cop.\n\nThis is a treat for Dabangg film fans because a lot of care has been given to the scenes of the flashback. We get to see how innocent Pandey ji becomes badass Robinhood Pandey. How he picks up his style also the legendary dialogues of Chedi Singh and \"Swagat nahi karoge hamara!\" As a young Pandey, Salman Khan portrays an innocent persona that is akin to his character in Bodyguard.\n\nThe making is good. Prabhu Deva did an excellent job of maintaining the original feel of Dabangg and Dabangg 2 while elevating the look and feel. The locations are amazing. Costume is great. The music and dance is colorful, full of energy and fitting. Salman Khan showed superb energy on the dance floor. There is no complaint on the acting department, everyone did their part well. Salman khan as young Pandey did an excellent job. The new girl Saiee Manjrekar played her role well. Would have loved to see more of Sonakshi Sinha.\n\nThe best of part of Dabangg series is it's \"hatke\" dialogue and Dabangg 3 has it in truckload. From retelling the old ones to delivering new ones Dabangg 3 packs quite a few memorable dialogue. Another thing that is better than Dabangg and Dabangg 2 is the entry of Salman Khan is more effective in Dabangg 3. Almost all of his entry was mass.\n\nThe music is catchy. Action is well made, the earlier action scenes had dose of comedy and gradually the fights got serious till the explosive climax fight. I loved the climax action scenes. It had some really cool scenes. It was also bloody like Dabangg (2010). Dabangg 3 improves on the last two of the series and provides an entertaining action-comedy ride. Must watch for who liked Dabangg and Dabangg 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dabangg 3 - is an all out Salman Khan Action Packed Masala movie. After the disappointment from Race 3/Bharat - Salman has come back, in his most suited Avatar. Dabangg 3 is far better then the previous two movies and the major reason is Sudeep and director Prabhudeva. First half is a little slow but gripping in terms of Mass, as it's all about Chulbul's previous life as you can see in the trailer. First half this movie has comedy/innocent love/emotion/family sentiments/heart breaking tears and a lot more. Second half is really fast and you would not want to blink your eyes as you might miss something, it's full of action and has the present Chulbul - who is grown up with his very deep voice does absolute justice. I think this movie will 100% become Salman's 4th 300cr movie or short of 250cr at least because movie offers everything that a Masala movie has. It also offers a social message which is quiet admiring as it's a masala movie and you don't get to see these kind of messages in Masala movies often. SALLU fans are in for a treat with early Christmas gift and general audience I'd say go watch it as you will not be disappointed and will come out happier."

I hope in the future that there will be a Dabangg 4 and the story will continue about the brother of chedi Singh. And that h\u00e8 will join Singham, Simba en Akshay Kumars New character. That would be rocking! Just ons thing that was not necesarry was the amount of songs in the film. They could have cut 1 song out. I hope this movie will do good that we can get more of this action comedy movies. Bless the Dabangg trilogy!"

Kichha Sudeepa as Balli Singh is extraordinary. It seems that he was born to play the character. Sonakshi Sinha as Rajjo Pandey is good. She made her presence well despite having limited scope. Saiee Manjrekar as Khusi is very pretty. She makes her debut well. Apart from them all the other actors have given a good performance. The movie carries various social messages based on dowry, water scarcity and women safety."

So obviously the story will be from the 90s. The thing which did Matter was the screenplay & the music both of which was good enough. The movie successfully delivers what it promises. A Holiday Entertainer.. With emotions, comedy, action & good music. And as usual the quirky Chulbul Pandey who gets an origin story in this one, plays to the gallery... A Christmas massy blockbuster..!!!"
