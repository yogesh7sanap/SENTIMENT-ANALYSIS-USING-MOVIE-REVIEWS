        "review_detailed_main": "I could tell from the trailers that if you were not a committed Will Ferrell fan, or stoned out of your mind, that this movie would probably be trashed by the experts. You either find his absurd comedy funny or find it a senseless insult to your intelligence. For me, there were a couple times when I really laughed out loud (and I was sober as a judge), most of the time I simply had a smile on my face as I watched the master make a complete fool of himself - which is what Will Ferrell does. I read some of these in-depth critiques in utter amazement. I mean, really, what were you expecting to see? It is a very light hearted spoof of one of the most ridiculous TV series in history. Generally, I thought it was funny, we've been repeating some of the funnier, albeit, totally ridiculous scenes all day. I do strongly caution parents with children. When Will Ferrell says PG-13 he isn't kidding. Sexual innuendo and drug references are going to be quite uncomfortable for the prudish crowd."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Land of the Lost\" is another in a long line of old TV shows lazily packaged into summer movies, too dumbed-down for fans of the original show and nothing all that memorable for those younger viewers coming into it for the first time. There is no doubt it will join the class (\"Bewitched\"-which Will Ferrell also was in, \"Dukes of Hazard\" and \"Wild Wild West\") of films so bad that they make \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" look like the \"Ben-Hur\" of the genre. There is just zero reason to care about anything in this movie. Will Ferrell, you should have known better.\n\nFerrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall, a paleontologist disgraced by what others call his nonsensical theories about space-time vortexes. The only one who cares to believe him is Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel), a research assistant from one of those fancy British universities who encourages him to keep working on his tachyon thingie-majigger, a device that finds tachyon particles that somehow allow people to jump between worlds. They find the most amount of the stuff in a crappy little souvenir shop run by a redneck named Will (Danny McBride), and before they know it Marshall, Holly, and Will are traveling back to another dimension that's all desert. The place is complete with T-Rex, creepy-crawly bugs, a bunch of things from our world littered about like a stretch limo, Bobs Big Boy and Golden Gate Bridge, and a primate named Chaka (Jorma Taccone) who befriends them and helps them navigate their way back to their dimension.\n\nWhat needs to get lost is the screenplay by Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas. When Matt Lauer, playing himself, is the funniest thing in a movie, you know that something went horribly wrong. The laughs are childishly inane. Ferrell is forced to embarrass himself considerably, in one scene drenching himself in, and yes, even drinking dinosaur urine. Dino poop and gross insect infections also get high regard. Then you have Chaka, a supposedly lovable primate who's big comic bit is molestation. Hilarious! And this is the big-laugh stuff. The rest is hard to even remember. That this movie manages any chuckles at all is due to Ferrell and McBride's improvisation abilities. Ferrell is the arrogant goof-off and McBride the brash sidekick, but they're facing an uphill battle with this screenplay.\n\nAnd the plot\u0085wait, what plot? And what character development for that matter? It's all very basic, aimless, and easy to follow, except you'll be too bored to do so. Characters run around like idiots, dinosaurs and insects chase after them, not much happens. And when not being chased, the aimlessness doesn't stop, it just gets more persistent. A scene where Marshall, Will, and Chaka sit around in a stupor getting high off of some coconut drink (yes, this is a family movie) is unbelievably drawn out, unnecessary, and above all, pointless. Finally in the third act the Slestaks, reptilian villains bent on world domination, start to put their plan into effect but even then it's too little, too late to care. The special effects are cheesy. I'm assuming that was the plan cause the show was the exact same way but what you can see at home for free and what your willing to pay for are two different things. A dinosaur against an obvious green screen isn't much fun and little green reptilian men in obvious costumes and masks that barely move, other than to open and close their mouths, are hard to take seriously.\n\n\"Land of the Lost\" is just lost, misguided in every way, starting with even deciding to make the movie in the first place. It deserves to be shunned and left to be the summer's first big box-office bomb. Ferrell, McBride, and Matt Lauer are the only things that keep it from being horribly unwatchable but not from being one of the very worst of the summer and the year thus far."

        "review_detailed_main": "First, I'm not sure what the complaining about the ratings is all about. Most critics would have given this a 1 or 2 to read the professional reviews. I think a 5 or 6 is quite reasonable, unless you love Will Ferrell.\n\nI tried, I really tried to watch the original Land of the Lost when it was on, but it was obviously for kids about 6-12 (boys and girls) that being fairly older than that (late teens to early 20's), I just couldn't get into it. I mean, a park ranger and his two kids? A poor man's Lost in Space.\n\nI turned it on several times (I really remember all the creatures, but the stars faces are lost to me!) The problem I have with this is that I think the writers/producers/directors were torn between what audience to appeal to - fans of the original Land of the Lost who would be in their 40's - 50's, or young boys 12-16.\n\nSo, they made a movie that really didn't appeal to either. Just fans of Will. Fine. I get the zaniness of the movie. Three lovable losers. Pratfall after pratfall. But, the dino urine turned me off. I get it, you didn't have to hit me over the head twice more (the second dose, the, uh, yeah!).\n\nBut I suppose what really turned me off was reading that two of the original stars were given cameos and then cut. Sorry, that tells me the writers/producers/directors didn't really love the original (how could they, they must have been about 3 - or less! - when it originally aired!). Part of the appeal of nostalgia is tossing out little appreciations to the original fans - like cameos. Because they axed them, to me, it meant they also axed the original audience.\n\nI get the humor, sarcasm, satire, but it didn't do much. 5 is much better than 1, but it's only a so-so comedy."

I can't believe millions of dollars was spent making this piece of garbage...the jokes are not funny,the acting is reaching for something in every scene and they just move on like nothing happened...Like we the audience are so brain dead that we wouldn't know any better. Don't bring your kids to this unless its your wish to lower their I.Q.! The only people who should see this are people in a coma!

She seemed to be out of place, if that could be possible in such a \"modge podge\" of the ridiculous. The plot was so random, and it really had nothing to do with the original series; things like sleestacks, dinosaurs, and banjo music were just kind of thrown in with no rhyme or reason. I had really looked forward to this movie since I'd liked the 70\"s Saturday morning series as a kid. I thought Will Ferrell would make it funny - I loved him in Elf - but that wasn't the case.

        "review_detailed_main": "Will Ferrell is a comic genius that's a Fact & this fantastic fantasy Comedy is his absolute best film in my opinion. This campy-fun modern take on the old 60's t.v series is pure escapism fun, it's silly & ridiculous & it's supposed to be!!! This is a big budget Will Ferrell comedy so i don't care if the boring critics Didn't like it or get it? Because i loved it, the beautiful lush production design is fantastic & takes you right back to those old school t.v series or old adventure films of the past, the comedy is silly but mostly very funny & the whole movie is just alot of FUN & reminded me of the type of film the legendary Dan Aykroyd might of made back in the 90's!!! Just like Dan Aykroyd's big budget sci-fi adventure comedy \"Coneheads\" from 1993 this fantasy film felt like that did. I could even imagine if this \"Land of the Lost\" came out during the 90's then it would've have Awesome action figures & that would've been so cool. There's a fun campy 90's charm to this movie that i dug.\n\nBasically it's about Dr.Rick Marshall (Ferrell), along with his assistant Holly Cantrell, a straight faced & very funny Anna Friel, & an accidental guy called Will Stanton the very funny Danny McBride who gets sucked into a portal with them & end up getting transported back in time to a place of Dangerous Dinosaurs, lizard people & weird primates & a fantastical world of adventure. This is just such a big fun time, a big budget summer blockbuster popcorn flick & i love it. Some comic scenes are hilarious & the creatures fx are Amazing with a big mix of old practical & new c.g.i & the gorgeous design of the jungle & desert are incredible to look at, there's so much effort put into the creation of this amazing fantasy world that it's a joy to follow our three heroes on this adventure to save the universe & get back home.\n\nA great fun Comedy adventure"

Did you know a guy in high school who tried soooooo hard to be cool but failed at every turn? If so you know the Ferell character. He's not cool, he's not smart, he not funny, heck he's not even sympathetic, he's just there, taking up space in this movie and once again proving that he's a talent-less hack who managed to get in on Saturday Night Live as it was in the downward spiral and is cashing is at every turn. My advice, if you must go see this film, don't see it sober."

        "review_title": "Goofy but fun",
        "review_detailed_main": "I really enjoyed this movie; I think it might be the best Ferrell movie I've seen in a while. Yes it's goofy and silly, but I think a lot of the negative reviewers here are people who were fans of the original and are judging thru the haze of nostalgia. The original was every bit as goofy and ridiculous, it's just that this movie has the good sense to acknowledge it. And yes, it may not be appropriate for very young viewers as there is some sexual innuendo and cursing, but it does have a PG-13 rating so I don't know why you would be dragging young children to it anyways...\n\n'Land of the Lost' starts with a quirky and oddly arrogant scientist, played by Ferrell, claiming to Matt Lauer on 'Today' that we can solve our energy problems by tapping into inter-dimensional blah blah blah. Of course, no one believes him but a beautiful student from England (Friel) who convinces him to build his whatsit to open the portal to other dimensions. And of course they soon find themselves trapped in what appears to be a large dumping ground for inter-dimensional portals along with a yokel (McBride). From there it's just a journey across this strange land to find their way back home.\n\nI realize I'm glossing over a lot of details here but you really don't need to know them. The whole point is to get a kick out of the satire and broad physical shtick as they encounter the bizarre inhabitants of this world and react to them. If you don't get too hung up on the logic of it all and just roll with the jokes, I think it's quite good. And Ferrell, who I have often disliked in previous works because of his tendency to gnaw on the scenery, was reserved enough to deliver a good number of very funny scenes.\n\nIn short, don't go to this expecting a children's film, a summer action flick, or something akin to the original. And, as with almost all Ferrell movies, don't go if you don't like physical humor. But do go if you are looking for a pleasant hour or two of goofy gags and simple fun."

John Boylan's voice is perfect as the 50's style domineering alien.\n\nDirection is excellent, they keep it to the same 1950's formula almost throughout, It is well timed with great scenes and good photography, my only complaint about that is that they included a couple of music clips that came from the late 1960's, however they did seem to fit the scenes, and the film score was very good.\n\nMy favorite scenes are the after when Will Ferrell states that T-Rex has a brain the size of a Walnut and later the Intelligent T-Rex drops a giant Walnut outside the cave entrance where they are staying, where the bug sucks blood out of Will Ferrell when he is trying to play the banjo, and when they drink the juice out of a fruit which turns out to be a narcotic and 'All Along The Watchtower' by The Jimi Hendrix Experience kicks in (A song usually associated with drug taking), and at the end in the interview with Matt Lauer where Will Ferrell puts him down as a payback for an earlier interview where Matt Lauer puts down Will Ferrell.\n\nLighten up reviewers this is one of the best Sci-Fi comedies going."

        "review_detailed_main": "Syd and Marty Kroft cash in one of their most popular franchises and almost strike gold. From the Saturday Morning age of the 70s comes the story of Marshall, Will and Holly on a routine expedition ...... well you know the rest. The classic story of a scientist from today trapped in a world of yesterday, teaming with cave men and dinosaurs. Now, with all upgrades (reboots, re-imaginings, remakes, whatever suits you), this one needed to be loyal to the original, but appealing to today's audience and those types of movie-goers who need everything to look absolutely real. Throw in some excellent comedy led by Will Ferrell, remove the family oriented group and jack up the special effects. There is also a hint of pop-culture and a strong urge to use more adult-oriented comedy, which is fine, as long as you don't over-do-it.\n\nThe new Marshall is in the invented and totally made up career known as Quantum-Paleontology, Holly is a student from Cambridge, who has followed Marshall's career and Will is a redneck loser who runs a tourist-trap cave. The first half of this movie was great. The comedic timing of Will Ferrell and the dialogue made me split my sides. The creative way that the group got to the Land of the Lost, paying homage to the classic theme song, introducing the characters that actually made the original TV show (Cha-Ka, Grumpy and the scary Sleestak), are introduced and handled quite well.\n\nI think the reason I enjoyed the comedy and the way they handled the story, is the fact, that when you watch the original show, the acting is so atrocious, that you already think it is a comedy, so why not stay in that line, but update it to 2009. The movie moves along quite well, but due to a small string of ridiculous scenes, it begins to run out of gas as we approach the ending. I was worried that the film might go in a direction that many types of films like this do, but I was thrilled to see it all worked out. It was an enjoyable outing until the last fifteen minutes. There actually is logic to the story and the scenes, but the line is crossed too far sometimes, with too much silliness. It then kills an excellent grade and drops it to this.\n\n7.5 (C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB"

Implausible, awful, terrible acting, terribly written -- you're lucky you can find a single half-a-laugh in this boring nonsensical piece of garbage. There is not an ounce of creativity here. I'm not sure what Will Farrel was thinking - he's generally funny and picks some well written scripts. This was simply unbearable. What's most disappointing is that if you are an old fan of the show (like myself) this just takes what was somewhat of a real live adventure (and the whole idea of escaping the land of the lost) and turns it in to a silly goofy series of the worst sight gags I have ever seen. How easy is it to throw Slee Staks and dinosaurs over garbage? This film is proof that it's pretty easy indeed. Maybe this is some new Hollywoood formula - a giant CGI dinosaur and nothing else. I am tempted to list the ridiculous additions to the original show. Instead, I'll just say they were subtractions and not additions. Not to mention the fact that every set looked like the inside of a bad Disney ride. Don't waste your money - I wouldn't even recommend this for free. One final warning - if you take your kids you'll have to get past the dozen or so raunchy necessary sexual jokes - none of which are funny at all."

From reading the comments it seems like it is mostly due to parents bringing their kids to see a movie including an actor from movies such as Old School and Anchorman and getting mad when they see crude humor. If you like Will Ferrell you will like most jokes in this movie, it is very funny and in my opinion close to The Hangover. This movie is not supposed to be taken seriously and as long as you don't try to compare it to the original show and go along with it you will laugh. Go in with an open mind and don't listen to the critics this movie is for sure worth checking out."

Overall the oddities they come across in the movie are very entertaining, and with the exception of some lame jokes and cheesy scenes, overall you'll find this movie quite entertaining. It's a bit more adult humor than I was expecting, so the adults were really enjoying it while the kids had no idea what was going on."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having never seen an episode of Land of the Lost, it is hard to judge the film as anything other than the next entry into the hall of zany Will Ferrell comedies. He plays Dr. Rick Marshall, a scientist laughed off the Today show for his theories regarding alternate dimensions and periods of time flux. A few years later, a budding doctorate student named Holly (Anna Friel) convinces him to continue his research into the idea, and going on a hunch inside a grimy water trail lead by the obnoxious Will (Danny McBride). Sure enough, the group end up in a totally different time where dinosaurs roam amongst ape/human hybrids and creatures referred to as Sleestaks.\n\nIt sounds needlessly complicated, and unfortunately for Land of the Lost, it comes off as trying to hard in many areas. On one hand, it wants to throw a bunch of scientific terms and ideas at the audience to try and claim it has some semblance of being smart, but then takes it all back by inserting a whole plethora of jokes involving poop, breasts, drugs and homosexuality. Apparently, somewhere along the line of production, the cast and crew missed the memo about how unfunny and unoriginal these jokes are in 2009. Sure, some of them are fairly amusing (and a few are laugh-out-loud hilarious), but many of the jokes are used throughout the movie over and over again, in the same ways. Apparently they missed the memo about beating a dead horse at the same time.\n\nThere is a lot of obvious camp sprinkled throughout the film, but that does not give it an excuse for feeling so stale and undercooked. Many of the jokes not involving anything mentioned above are totally hit or miss; there is no middle ground to be found at all. And of course, the film is a grand showcase for Ferrell to play another clueless idiot, thrown into a totally unrealistic situation. While his shtick has not worn as thin as the work of comedians like Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller (albeit, the latter two seem to be on a career rebound as of late), it is starting to lose its appeal rather quickly. And while McBride holds his own for the most part, Friel and a nearly unrecognizable Jorma Taccone (of Lonely Island and Saturday Night Live fame) are forced to endure through Ferrell acting through one ridiculous idea after the other. I found myself so divided over the jokes that I actually became baffled at why so many audience members in the preview crowd thought the film was such a riot.\n\nMcBride is actually the saving grace for the film. He nails almost every line and reaction perfectly, continuing to cement his status as the obnoxious and pompous jackass supporting character. He never resorts to the foolish heights Ferrell puts himself through (even during a silly drug-fueled sequence that drags itself out for far too long), and seems very content at playing the absurd straight co-star. While his attitude is a bit overwhelming at certain intervals, he just has too much charisma not to be liked on screen. He believes in his character, and he makes it shine from beginning to end.\n\nBut while the opening bit and many of the jokes are a mess, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of adventure that takes place throughout the film. It feels like an extended chase film at certain points (especially because of the Tyrannosaurus Rex constantly gunning for Ferrell), but it manages to slow itself down to really allow the audience to take in the ideas it is trying to explore and get across. There are some highly extravagant and clever ideas on display here, and when the film wants to, it really allows the camera (and the audience) to appreciate and take all the interesting things in. But since it blows through the majority of its running time (when it is not stalling on certain sequences), these slow-down moments come very few and far between.\n\nThe special effects are also quite marvelous to look at. Although the entire film looks like it needed a lot less green screened effects, there is still plenty of obvious effort put into the creatures that show up during the film. The showpiece of a Tyrannosaurus Rex is incredibly detailed, and downright terrifying in some instances. It is not the game changer like the T-Rex in Jurassic Park was sixteen years ago, but it still looks relatively magnificent. The makeup effects to bring the ape/human hybrids and Sleestaks to life are just as good, if not better. What I did not like was how fake many of the effects look. I imagine this was done specifically to align it with the show, but some are so glaringly bad that the filmmakers should have put in more work in the post production to make them look a little more realistic. After being horrifically disappointed in the graphics in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, I was not expecting another film to appear so soon that looked like it needed more effects work. I was wrong in that assumption, but at least the effort was put in here to make them look great nonetheless.\n\nI was not expecting a lot out of Land of the Lost, but parts did surprise me. I did laugh quite a few times, and while they work to mixed effect, the special effects and makeup are amazingly well done. But there is still plenty wrong with the film, whether it be the messy opening, the off-the-wall pacing of the film, the bad jokes or Ferrell himself. It wants to be a better movie, but it does not seem to know how to do it. Relying on McBride as a crutch can only work so much.\n\n5/10."

Wait, maybe this movie was serious because it sure wasn't funny. Come with low expectations and you won't be disappointed. There are some special effects pulled from old movies that are no longer special. The backdrop that the actors wander through is a wasteland of time and space and so like the story line, empty and pointless. The idea of an outsider scientist coming up with a real breakthrough and falling into an unexplored world could go dozens of different ways. Hollywood is letting us down with these bland scripts. It's letting the actors down too. Will Ferrell has potential which has never been realized in any movie so far. I'd like to see him doing what he did as a SNL star, just be funny. I saw the preview of this movie and said I was going to give it a chance. Now I wish I'd saved my money for something else."

What it turned out to be was a big disappointment. The potential for comic magic was there with Ferrel and Danny McBride, but it never clicked. What we ended up watching was a movie that lead me to conjure up adjectives like, \"low budget\" and \"B-Movie.\" We've all seen movies where the comic lines never reached fruition. This movie was a textbook example of this. You can even see where it would have been funny with a little different dynamics. Sadly, it would make my Top 10 worst movies of the 2000s. My 8 year-old did enjoy though!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Following the discovery of ancient artifacts and crystals harnessing a unique energy, paleontologist Dr. Rick Marshall (Will Ferrell) and his newly appointed assistant Holly (Anna Friel) travel to the remote desert where they were discovered. Teaming up with Will (Danny McBride), who runs a roadside attraction on the land where the crystal was found, the trio gets sucked into another dimension. There, they are met by an array of items from years past; dinosaurs, slow-moving lizard men called Sleestaks, and their new friend Chaka (Jorma Taccone). Now they are in a race against time to get back home or end up lost forever.\n\nIn an adaptation of a popular television series, the writing team tries to put a modern twist on it. The world-building and production design are one of the high points of the film. Creating a baron landscape with touches of the past, present, and future, the design keeps the eye wandering. Although Chaka and the Sleestaks designs are from the original series, the make-up department did a phenomenal job of recreating the iconic characters.\n\nThis film has a lot of slapstick comedy elements. With Ferrel and McBride being great at comedic timing and improvising depending on the situation, the majority of what ends up on screen probably isn't in the script. Anna Friel plays the assistant turned love interest with leadership and a sense of urgency the other characters lack. Even the CGI T-Rex, Grumpy, becomes a great addition to the team.\n\nThis film was made when a lot of advancements in computer-generated production were happening and in areas it shows. While some areas appear seamless, others have you wanting that same look. It is most evident in green screen moments, which, unfortunately, there are a lot of them. Also, as likable as Chaka is, there are times when his character is a bit much and could be toned down.\n\nThe biggest downfall of this film is the source material. Since the series depicts and is geared towards families, many may go into this film with the same idea. However, this is not a family film. This film plays well as a slapstick comedy with high-end effects. While not being the blockbuster it was intended to be, Land of the Lost is a fantastic action adventure that should be enjoyed for what it is."

It also could have been a bit funnier at times. But overall it definitely put me in a good mood, especially because I'm a huge Will Ferrell and Danny McBride fan. I love how Wll Ferrell can deliver such ridiculous lines of dialogue with a straight face.\n\nDespite being a major Hollywood film, I felt like this film had heart to it and didn't really feel hollow. I know I had already touched on this before but I just don't think all the hate on this movie is justified. It's coherent from beginning to end, all the lines are delivered well and it's very goofy. Not to mention the cgi isn't half bad as well.\n\nOverall it's definitely a fun movie with a few small flaws.

And Chaka seemed to spend an awful lot of his time groping Holly! I could try to describe the plot, but frankly it's too bizarre and defies my sad ability to describe it. Suffice to say it's about three people (two of which are total idiots) stuck in some bizarre land where time/space are all jumbled and they have to somehow make things right and get back home. In the process, you see lots of dinosaurs and strange creatures that make this film like taking a hit of LSD.\n\nI need to point out that I never saw the TV show \"Land of the Lost\" as I was a bit too old to watch it--and I hated Sid & Marty Krofft's shows (though they DID produce this movie). And, when I heard that this movie was coming out, I wasn't thrilled as I didn't want to see a silly kids show on the big screen. However, the film makers instead chose to parody their show--making fun of it by making several of the credits just too dumb to believe--sort of like sticking Ricky Bobby and Kyle Naughton, Jr. in a position to save the universe! Often the really dumb jokes, dialog and situations made me laugh but the film was uneven as well. There were also quite a few scenes that fell very flat or were just rather gross and super-low brow (such as the urine scene). For Will Ferrell fans, this would all be very familiar territory but for others it will probably be rather stupid and nonsensical. Low-brow and dumb throughout..but for me, in a good way.\n\nOverall a very stupid movie...that STILL made me laugh.\n\nBy the way, Danny McBride sure seemed to be doing a great imitation of John C. Reilly. His character was a lot like the ones Reilly played in the Will Ferrell movies \"Talladega Nights\" and \"Step-Brothers\"--really, really dumb and quite funny. I wonder if this part was originally intended for Reilly--it was that close.\n\nDig that Matt Lauer! He's so darn cool!"

Without a plot and trying to force the comedy down our throats, this newly reinvented LAND OF THE LOST is a complete disaster. Yes, even with the much improved CGI effects.\n\nThe film tries to pull in fans of the original by sucking the cast into a time vortex, similar to how Marshall, Will and Holly were in the original. But instead of being scientifically interesting (if outdated and impossible), this time we get some serious low-brow comedy that misses almost every mark.\n\nThose of you out there who also are not fans of Will Ferrell (TALLADEGA NIGHTS) will want to avoid this film like the plague. He's in full-on childish mode, getting more groans than laughs (trying to make out with a proto-human while high on a hallucinogenic? Yes. Those kind of antics!). And he's in the lead role as Dr. Rick Marshall, so he's on screen in just about every shot.\n\nHis supporting cast are just as lame as he, unfortunately. Anna Friel stars as Holly, and her interactions and supposed romantic attraction to Ferrell's Marshall character are probably what'll give most of you a good laugh. It's so unrealistic you'll wish that she'd disappear down another vortex.\n\nThe more unfortunate cast member, Danny McBride (TROPIC THUNDER) as Will Stanton, the owner of an extremely destitute theme park ride, plays the fool more often than Ferrell's character, and not in a good way (is there one?). Which is too bad, really, as I like McBride in Tropic Thunder and SUPERBAD.\n\nThere's not much here to enjoy (in case you didn't notice my review rating). More groans than laughs. More childish than adult fun. You might want to run away from this one as if a T-Rex were after YOU."

Then the worst thing happened for me; Will Ferrell started pretending like he is funny.\n\nThis movie was lame and more stupid than the 90's remake of The Land Of The Lost Series. Cha'ka was plumb awful, totally stupid. And meeting Holly the way he did with his hand on her...ummm... breast... was just dumb. The dinosaur and its effects were good, and the sleestacks just looked plumb terrifying. They would make a darn good horror movie. I really liked the way they were made to look like. If they ever make a standalone movie about the Land Of The Lost that's totally based on the Original 70's kids' show, I would die to see that. Of if they ever made a standalone horror flick with the movie's sleestack as long as Enik isn't playing the part of a seemingly gay alturian, then I would definitely love to see that.\n\nThe whole script of this movie was just horrible. I mean, come on, a time machine made out of a boom box that plays gay music? Teridactile eggs that can only hatch and be calmed when that same gay music, along with Cha'ka, who isn't supposed to speak any English at all, suddenly bursting out in an English language solo? Then the Teridactiles suddenly looking at Will Ferril and Cha'ka with googly eyes while they sung?! I mean OMG. I tell you the Only actor in this movie that did a very good job is the guy that plays Will.. I thought he played his part as far as according to the bogus script, to a T. He really did a very good job. With all of this said, ,I am going to rate the actors and dinosaur on a scale of 0 to 10, lowest to highest. Here goes: Will Ferrill/ Rick Marshall-2, Holly-1, Cha'ka=-0, Will-9, Enik-1, The Zarn-0, sleestacks-7, Grumpy the Dinosaur-10+++, and Matt Lauer-10.\n\nAnd there you have it. The dialogue/ script for this movie is a barely 1 rating (wait let me change that to a 01/2 rating. After the movie, I was so disappointed and let down; it literally made me mad, and I hope that Sid and Marty Krofft aren't as excited about this hokey, boring, dumb remake of their 70's hit show as hey have appeared to be.\n\nI have some recorded 70's land Of The Lost shows at home that I recorded them from when Sci-Fi ran the LOTL marathon a few weeks back. Needless to say that when I got home, I had to redeem myself and repent of myself from watching the new LOTL movie. I repented and redeemed myself from watching a few of the recorded LOTL shows that I have at home. After I watched a few of them, I realized that it wasn't my fault and, like a lot of people, I was sucked into watching this movie by having some faith that it actually might be good. But it wasn't. After I watched some LOTL taped shows, I felt better. And that's my review and take on this new stupid, dumbest movie remake I have ever seen. Thanks!"

But I didn't like him on Saturday Night Live but I thought I give him a chance but man does he stink as an actor, a comedian. I am sorry but I have to be honest and that is just my opinion."

As i was expecting to see a family, comedy film i was pleasantly surprised that it was not just your ordinary clich\u00e9d family movie but something aimed for a slightly older audience. This maybe why it was so poorly received.\n\nLooking at trailers and TV spots, this movie did really look like just another pointless summer blockbuster, which may have appealed to all you people looking for something family friendly. But for me i was so thrilled to be watching something that is just plain FUN! That's all it is! just fun, fun, fun!\n\nYou people that have posted nothing but negative comments about this title don't know a great movie if it slapped you in the face. so relax a little, sit back again and realise that your watching another fantastic movie from will ferrell, and lets face it: when has will ferrell released a movie for families? (excluding ELF)\n\nJust stop your complaining and enjoy a non-stop, exciting, unpredictable movie that has everything you could ask for. and even more---- what do you really expect from a movie based on a TV show created by someone who practically lived off acid? Three words to sum up this movie: trippy, adventurous and fun!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Released in 2009 and directed by Brad Silberling, \"Land of the Lost\" stars Will Ferrell as a dubious paleontologist who is obsessed with experimenting with time warps. Inspired by a doctoral candidate student (Anna Friel), they try out his time-travel contraption in the desert and are flung to another realm where dinosaurs, half-ape men and reptilian people called Sleestaks reside. Danny McBride plays a tourist attraction owner who goes along for the wild ride; Jorma Taccone appears as Chaka.\n\nThe movie was partially produced & written by Sid & Marty Krofft, the creators of the Land of the Lost TV series that ran from 1974-1977 on Saturday mornings, but also aired daily in syndication in the early 80s. Obviously with Ferrell as the star, the film version is more of a comedy than the original show, but this direction was approved by the Krofft brothers. It's reminiscent of 2008's \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" but with an even more goofy vibe. I give that one the edge.\n\nThe primitive world that the protagonists encounter is imaginative, but it's thoroughly CGI cartoony, which I suppose is fitting given the nature of the TV series. In any case, while this is a throwaway fantasy comedy, I regularly laughed throughout and therefore it accomplished its purpose, it entertained me. Speaking of laughing, the humor runs the gamut of stoo-pid, silly, bathroom and crude.\n\nThe tyrannosaurus looks great and is even terrifying; he interestingly becomes a character of sorts. Anna Friel is likable and fits well, but she looks decidedly anorexic. If you prefer women with the non-curves of 12 year-old boys you'll likely appreciate her more than me. IMO the role called for someone like Carrie Keagan, Kelli Garner or Dominique Swain.\n\nThe movie run 102 minutes and was shot at Universal Studios, California, with outside sequences done in Southern California (Dumont Dunes, La Brea Tar Pits, Lancaster & Trona).\n\nGRADE: B-"

Maybe I'm too undereducated to get it's jokes, but I don't remember many. My bride has fallen asleep after 10 minutes, and I watched the movie in complete silence and agony, and wondered why am I doing this anyway. Will Ferrel is too weak to lift this lame picture off the ground. He can be somewhat good if he is well directed, but it's not the case here. I'm usually not expecting much from a comedy, and if one of them gives me five good laughs over 90 minutes, then I feel satisfied, but this movie failed to achieve even this small task.\n\nAfter all, I'm still happy about seeing this picture, 'cause my definition of \"bad movie\" became wider.\n\nThere are some quality comedies out there nowadays, so don't waste precious moments on this, only if you've got time to burn.\n\nIt's getting 2 stars from me, not more, and all two for the somewhat funny T-Rex...\n\n(Sorry for my English...)"

Even Chaka's character does not come off right.\n\nThe only part that worked reasonably well was a sci-fi staple, delivered in the predictable \"Enich\" character plot-twist. But, not nearly enough to save the movie. The attempt at creating tension and release with the T-rex \"Grumpy\" character also fails woefully.\n\nIn all, not a lot to like.

And the rare times when our row wasn't laughing, laughter was popping up like popcorn all over the audience. I won't say the critics are wrong on this one, but I will point out that if they knew what was a surefire hit and commercially successful, they wouldn't have to take jobs as critics. JMO, Rebecca"

To my surprise, we laughed quite a lot at the sweet goofiness of this movie. I agree that they could have cut out the useless mature sights and words that left the kids out because it would have appealed to them. We particularly loved the scenes between Farrell and the obviously more intelligent Dino. Danny McBride was sweetly silly too. The female actress was okay as eye candy for the guys. All the criticism on this site is for people who place stock on what others have to say. Happy to say, we avoided these critics. By the way, if you hated the movie so much, why spend so much of your time to write such long-winded diatribes??? Seems to me these are people who need to feel a sense of importance that they don't have. Oh well, the movie goer should always make up their own minds. We did, and I'm happy to say it turned out well. We really laughed!! And my sister is not one to laugh easily. I just wish they wouldn't show so much of the sight gags in the commercials for the movie. But don't let that keep you away. There's more context for the funny parts in the movie."

There, they come up against various monsters like ape men, dinosaurs, lizard men and a T-rex with a grudge.\n\nYes, it's completely daft and stupid. But it's also quite amusing.

Why would anyone turn it into a movie that had to be chopped down in order to avoid an R rating is beyond my comprehension. There are way too many sexually explicit jokes and Will Ferrell mouths \"F*&% you!\" to Chaka. The producers are morons who totally missed their target audience which should have been children. Everything is wrong with this movie, from casting Will Ferrell to hiring the obviously juvenile screen writer who is talentless.\n\nWhen I was a child I loved the original show, cheesy as it was. Then when the remake came out in 1990 I watched that with my daughter and enjoyed the updated special effects. But this movie is a totally disappointing effort by all involved. Obviously very little thought and effort went into making this dino dung heap. This movie is not for children, but it should have been. Who in Hollywood green lights this crap?"

But this adaptation of the schlocky television show from ages past is a twisted marriage of R rated rudeness, PG visuals and a plodding and often excruciating screenplay.\n\nAside from the effects which are by all standards just fine, the only thing I can recommend about Land of the Lost is Danny McBride playing scientist Dr Rick Marshall's (Ferrel) tour guide (that being his profession before they were transported through space and time) but even his bizarre style of humour is quashed by the atrocious writing and his lack of screen time.\n\nDisgraced years before for supporting the theory of time travel, Rick Marshall has finally perfected a device that he believes can clear his name. Urged on by a female fan named Holly (Anna Friel) they travel to a serious of caverns in the desert where Rick believes his device will work. It is here they meet with McBride's character and they are subsequently sucked through a vortex to the land of the lost where they meet countless bizarre creatures including a ornery dinosaur, a primate named Cha-Ka and a strange race called the Sleestacks. But how to survive this strange world and return to the present?\n\nI have been witness to a great number of films which push the boundaries of a PG rating that often enrage parents of younger children who find certain humour inappropriate. But the transitions from goofy family fare to raunch in Land of the Lost are among the most jarring I have experienced as the profaneness and rudeness of certain jokes even managed to jerk me out of my stupor to do a double take. These segments are framed by potty humour and poo gags and connected by the characters journey which is nothing more than a series of lame encounters and near escapes which never progress the plot anywhere or are even amusing for that matter. What we are left with is a movie that feels twice its actual length and becomes so utterly obnoxious by the climax that you beg for more nights at the museum.\n\nPerhaps the most ironic thing about Land of the Lost is that it likely would have been better if the studio had purposely made the budget minute and make a full fledged goofy B movie instead of making a B movie into a blockbuster. There is also an odd divide between a film like this and for example Miss March. Both are awful, but are awful in different ways; Miss March is atrocious and Land of the Lost is misfire. In not being utterly incompetent it creates a twisted void that is not deserving of outward contempt but is almost worse as a result. It's likely unclear of what I am trying to convey so I will be blunt and simply tell you not to go see this movie. Unless you want a nap.\n\nRead all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "The director and writers of this crap either didn't understand the source material, or they didn't care about it. More likely both.\n\nThe original Land of the Lost TV series was not a comedy, it was a serious dramatic show for children, and the most ambitious Sid & Marty Krofft series ever made. If adults laugh at it, it's only because they are looking back at a mid-70's TV show for kids and didn't care much for SF to start with.\n\nThis \"adaptation\" plucked names and basic situations out of the TV series and turned it into a slapstick goofball comedy with a few more adult jokes than what I would feel comfortable bringing my 5 year old to (who is a big fan of the TV series on DVD).\n\nIt was a Will Ferrell comedy, and not even a good one. If you're expecting, at the very least, something as cute and clever as Elf, skip it. Even the Land of the Lost scenery itself looked boring. Half the time it looked like the Mojave Desert with props sticking out of the sand. The den of the Sleestak looked okay, but Enik looked ridiculous. The only well done character in the entire film is \"Grumpy\" the T-Rex. Kudos to his modelers.\n\nOne must ask: who were the writers / director trying to impress? Fans of the original series? Changing it into a ridiculous comedy seems the wrong strategy to do that. Nothing about this movie felt nostalgic. It felt more like they were making fun of the TV series, treating it like a big joke, snickering at its fans and looking down on them.\n\nA smart reboot of Land of the Lost would have involved bringing David Gerrold in as a producer / writer. He created the original TV series and many of the great SF ideas came from him. (Only the first 2 seasons count, the 3rd and last season was not with Gerrold, and effectively the show degenerated quickly.)\n\nWhether you are a fan of, or even familiar with, the original Land of the Lost, you can forget this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most successful comedies possess three magic ingredients. First, there is the obvious, novelty or jokes revealing why the Hero is not a real hero. Second; there is spacial setting or, the time element background which lends it's dangerous hilarity. Lastly, there is the main element and that is Slap-Stick. In this film, called \" Land of the Lost \" we have two out of three. Will Ferrell, the graduate comedian from Saturday Night live, plays paleontologist Dr. Rick Marshall who not only is ridiculed by T.V. host Matt Lauer for his outlandish ideas, but then journeys though a time warp with the help of a device called a Tachyon Amplifier. Ending up in a Phrhistoric land where time is part of a multi-dimension universe, he accompanies his two friends Holly Cantrell (Anne Friel), Will Stanton (Danny McBride) and thereafter meets a Troglodyte name Chaka. The film is courageously and visually funny, but there is a definite lack of comedic cohesion and resorts to Ferrell carrying most of the load. As a result, there is grudging sympathy for the story and for the cast who despite their best efforts, failed to find the secret ingredient which should bond the offering to the anticipative audience. Humorous on my levels, the movie lacks and unfortunately remains a half baked idea. **"

I didn't clutch the seat with intense excitement from it's perilous action sequences and I didn't walk out feeling satisfied. I laughed because the film was pretty horrible. Nothing really flowed together and the storyline is utter stupidity. The acting was decent, but some of the dialog was kind of goofy. Not in a charming way. Many times throughout the film I sat there with a confused stare. The movie was going nowhere. The villains are VERY dull. In fact, everything is dull. Nothing seems to have the drive, passion, or energy to make it work. Nothing is taken seriously. I realize it's a comedy, so why should it be taken seriously? BUT it was as if the writers were okay with making a mediocre comedy flick with absolutely nothing to write home about. Will Ferrell tries his best, but even that didn't save the film. The film is aimed towards children, but it is NOT a film for children. There is coarse language, sexual references, and drug content. Will Ferrell even mouths the f bomb once. This will get most parents very angry because as it is advertised as a fun family film, it is far from it. This is one of its main flaws. Younger people would like it for it's entertaining crude humor and childish stupidity, BUT it's not a film for younger people. That's how it fails. It's too dumb for anyone old enough too see it and too explicit for anyone young enough that would find it entertaining. I'll admit there were one or two times I did laugh out of entertainment, but the rest of time, I laughed at how nonsensical, stupid, and pointless the film was. I was interested from the beginning, but as the movie progressed it just turned into one big giant failure. Land of the Lost ends with a dumb storyline, lacking creativity/energy, and some humiliatingly non funny jokes. Skip it. 4/10"

Also this person stated his kids found it boring, is this a kids film?? not really. One more thing there are quite a few saying this film was not very intelligent...have you watched crank 2?? if you expected to watch a film with an intelligent plot and intricate story lines watch death note this may satisfy thirst but then again it probably won't.

All kinds of living things inhabit this world, dinosaurs, aliens called Sleestax and various strange flora and fauna. At one point the father fell out of the Land Of The Lost and an uncle searching for his brother, niece, and nephew fell in. The Marshalls were still there as the series ended.\n\nInstead of the wholesome Marshall family, what we get is crazy Will Ferrall as the scientist who has no family and seeing what he's about is probably never going to have one. Instead of children we have a graduate anthropology student in Anna Friel and would be groupie and instead of hunky teenage son we get a crazy survivalist type who owns a place with an underwater cave.\n\nAnyway, Ferrall has invented some time travel device that plays show tunes (I kid you not) and the device gets lost during its operation. The rest of the film is the group stuck in the Land Of The Lost and searching for the time machine to get back and encountering some of the creatures that we remember from the TV series if not quite how we remember them.\n\nA whole lot of stupid and rather gross gags get pulled off without the requisite laughs that should go with them.

I'd imagine this is what Tropic Thunder meant to tell us no filmmaker types. Most movies suck. Especially big budget studio movies starring Will Ferrel. This stinker is so bad that you can't wait for it to end while at the same time you can't wait to see what kind of moronic scene will come next. Will Ferrel is a goofball and has done some funny films but this is just insane. What was he thinking? I'm sure he was paid 20 million dollar and thinking about how many toys he could buy with that money. Maybe a yacht or another mansion or a few beautiful women to keep him entertained between movies. No doubt the guy is a talent, but he must be careful about which movies he decides to do. He is rich, so why does he need to do a piece of doo doo like this? It boggles the mind. I suggest people see it only to laugh at its ridiculiousess."

I think the good surprise came from the fact that I had absolutely no expectation on the movie whatsoever. It thus came as virgin territory to me and filled me with good humor. Sure, it's not always very clever, nor subtle, but overall, I loved the mix of second-degree jokes, anachronism, surreal situations. Plus, FX's are actually pretty darn good! And acting kind of OK. At no time does the movie play itself seriously, nor does it pretend to. It's a ride designed to entertain and amuse. Let's take it for what it is. True, (over-)prudish people, or people with high (scientific or movie) expectations, or ones with kids might feel slightly offended by a few scenes. But overall, it's really worth the ride."

All the rules are malleable and conventional plot development depends little on reasonable probabilities.\n\nThere are two things that make this film tolerable. One is the inclusion of a monkey-boy character named Chaka (Jorma Taccone) who adds a needed silly humor. The other is a boatload of solid special effects.\n\nAs with other Will Ferrell films, expect juvenile humor. But this film lacks the joy of his best work. I can't recommend it."

That is fine because I love adventures movies and I would classify this as one.\n\nThis is about a scientist who has been ripped apart by everyone because of his theories. He gets a chance to prove he is right when he stumbles upon his world is a remote cave only with a female supporter and a shop keeper as companions.\n\nThe acting isn't all that bad. Will Ferrell and Danny McBride had good chemistry with each other. Anna Friel is also pretty good as her character. I also liked Jorma Taccone's Chaka. He was a very bright spot in this film.\n\nOverall, this is a decent if not good film. I'm probably rating this film a little higher than it deserves to combat all the extreme negativity. Also, I like to point out that my favorite scenes involves the ones with Matt Lauer and Will Ferrell. I rate this film 8/10."

It is not a film for adults. It is not a film for teens either, since those in the theater were complaining how lame this was. One has to worry when a dozen people has left the theater half way through.\n\nCGI was merely adequate; that was the only acceptable component. If you watched the preview, you already got all the entertainment this movie has to offer. The acting was in the low end of average. The plot was simply and plainly poor. It just does not engage the audience. If this was a comedy, why wasn't people laughing? Granted, this movie will be profitable. But for pure circumstantial reasons. In the small city in which I live, this was one of only two new releases of the week. That is it. How is it possible that Hollywood imposes on us such a low-quality product?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Brad Silberling's Land of the Lost remake lacks both a heart and a brain, with jokes that fall flat almost as soon as they're uttered, acting that seems ridiculous and out of place, and a schizophrenic personality that veers from 50s monster movie to broad comedy to sci-fi to Edward D. Wood, Jr.\n\nThe story is that crackpot scientist Rick Marshall (Will Ferrell) has invented an apparatus that will allow him to travel to parallel dimensions. When he and a comely Cambridge lass named Holly (Anna Friel) test the device, they're sucked into a vortex (along with a survivalist tour guide, played by Danny McBride of Tropic Thunder) that deposits them into the titular land, which is populated by motels, gas stations, knick knacks, dinosaurs, ape people, and lizard people.\n\nThe trio can't get back to their own time and place without locating the now-missing device, and they run into an ally in Cha-Ka (Jorma Taccone of Saturday Night Live) as well as the nefarious Sleestaks, lizard-like creatures with multiple sets of teeth and nasty dispositions.\n\nIt's tough to know where to begin with this one. The TV series was admittedly awful; it's interesting now only in the so-bad-it's-good sense, but the movie does not fully embrace the hoakiness of the series, which might have worked. (That is, if this was a knowing self-parody along the lines of The Brady Bunch Movie.) But neither is it an all-out comedic take on the serious-minded sci-fi show, which also might have worked, given the comic pedigree of Will Ferrell. So by not committing fully to either venue of entertainment, the movie fails twice.\n\nThe laughs aren't just scattered, they're almost completely absent. Ferrell, who has excellent comic timing and can be genuinely funny (see him on Funny or Die) is really bad here, as if he himself doesn't fully believe in the movie. As a result, Ferrell's performance looks awkward and completely controlled. This is a man who can play slapstick (Old School) and serious (Stranger than Fiction), and here he's sort of caught in the middle. He's not helped by McBride, who was so good in Tropic Thunder, mostly because the writers (Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas) weren't sure if his Will should be intelligent or just some doofus. That sort of inconsistency is to expected in movies in which there are many writers, but not only two.\n\nRounding out the trio is Friel, who's improbably gorgeous - why is she interested in Will Ferrell? Yes, of course they're a potential romance - and an obvious ripoff of Rachel Weisz in the Mummy movies. She's prettier than Rick Marshall, she's smarter than Rick Marshall, and naturally here she's deferential to the wisdom of Rick Marshall as well, unlike Weisz's strong Evvie. It's clear she's in this picture as cheesecake; witness the early scene in which she rips off her pants (leaving herself in short shorts) in order to, I don't even remember. See what I mean? Or the numerous times when characters grope her.\n\nLand of the Lost isn't silly fun, escapist entertainment that's just meant to be, not mean anything. It's sort of like Journey to the Center of the Earth if it were made without an adventuring lad like Brendan Fraser. Will Ferrell, funny as he is, has no business being in this movie at all."

This $100 million production ranks right down there with the equally expensive and just as misguided remake of THE GREEN HORNET, which starred Ferrell clone Seth Rogen. You know you're reaching an all-time low when Ferrell speaks ill of a retreating T-Rex and the creature stops, listens, turns around and charges them. I guess we are to believe the dinosaur (a bad CGI dinosaur, I might add) understands English. Ah well,it is a different dimension, so I guess anything goes. The charm of the low-budget TV series - actually it was two TV series with different sets of characters -- is completely lost here. Maybe Ferrell, who is thoroughly obnoxious here, should stick to BEWITCHED sequels. This isn't even worth watching on \"free\" TV."

The movie is based on the 1974 TV series of the same name, which I've never seen, so I can't say which is the one that's stupid. But I'm probably being overly harsh. It was a children's show so this was probably geared towards children as well. Maybe.\n\nBut it's Will Ferrell (I loved his mosquito scene), and the director also made a great job of having Matt Lauer's hilarious cameo scenes bookend the start and end of the movie, which let the movie open and conclude with a bang, even if the middle was kinda soggy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reviled by critics and passed over by audiences, to all appearances Will Ferrell's latest had arrived dead on arrival. So when I saw the film, playing to an audience of about twelve, two of whom walked out, I could only express my surprise. From the kitschy production design to the bizarre prehistoric gags, I had a lot of fun with \"Land of the Lost.\"\n\nFerrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall, a disgraced \"Quantum Paleontologist\" who's let his life's work, the Tachyon amplifier, a device capable of moving its holder cross-dimensionally through time, fall by the wayside. It takes the encouragement from Cambridge laughing-stock Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel), a student of Marshall's work, to convince him to finish and test the device.\n\nAnd so they find themselves at trashy highway tourist trap the \"Devil's Canyon Mystery Cave,\" run by redneck Will Stanton (Danny McBride). Picking up major Tachyon hits in the rundown homemade river ride, the amplifier triggers the greatest earthquake ever known, ripping a portal into the titular land of the lost.\n\nAfter partnering with outcast ape-man Cha-Ka (Jorma Taccone), the trio's mischievous guide, it's a seldom-interrupted chase film, a comedy of hostility, an exercise in silly costumes and slapstick panache. The constituent sequences are admittedly not all gems, but the film's aesthetic is too charming to let the occasional flat bit of banter or poorly executed joke ruin the fun. The movie doesn't stall so much as it occasionally idles, and absolutely succeeds in creating an atmosphere of constant oppression for the protagonists. A pin-drop seems enough for the heroes find themselves on the wrong side of all manner of Jurassic baddies, from T-Rex to Pterodactyls to giant mosquitoes to the lumbering lizard-men known only as Sleestaks.\n\nIt's an acquired taste to be sure, but the simple, vibrant set pieces, the Muppet-like creature design, and the cartoony CGI should be immediately appealing to fans of fifties B-pictures, the classic Universal monster films, and anyone interested in a less-than-serious take on the fantastic. Even if you're not a fan of Ferrell, he's done far worse work, and I'll happily take a bizarre experiment like \"Land of the Lost\" over another generic, diminishingly amusing sports comedy.\n\nAll that remains is the film's curious unpopularity, and while I can't reconcile the critical response, its commercial rejection recalls Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's now infamous flop, \"Grindhouse.\" It's tough to advertise homage, and where both films affectionately embrace the campy classics on which they're based, those unfamiliar with the source material just see bad effects and gimmicky plot lines.\n\n\"Land of the Lost\" isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but has unfairly become the target of critics and internet cynics alike whom I can only assume don't understand the inherent comedic appeal of a man in a rubber suit. I'd watch the film again in a heartbeat over eye-rollingly bland summer action fare like \"Wolverine\" or (God help me) \"Terminator Salvation.\" It's a breezy, inconsequential adventure film that has a lot of fun with its premise and takes itself as lightly as it should.\n\nEnter with level expectations, and you might just enjoy getting lost."

He also has two travel companions, Holly (Anna Friel) who studied Dr Marshall's work and idolises him and a reluctant redneck named Will (Danny McBride) who ends up on their journey by accident.\n\n\"Land of the Lost\" is full of adventure and there are many interesting and diverse characters throughout the story such as a primate called \"Chaka\" who joins the three on their journey, strange reptilian creatures and a T-rex who gets insulted by Dr Marshall's comment about a T-rex's brain being small and chases Marshall throughout the film!\n\nWhich brings me to another point, the special effects. They are actually really good especially for this type of film. The T-rex, although CGI actually looks really descent and is more a realistic size rather than the over-grown \"Jurassic Park\" versions!\n\nAll up, \"Land of the Lost\" is a fun-filled adventure comedy that doesn't require the use of the viewers brain but still manages not to insult their intelligence either.\n\nGreat to bust 90 minutes of boredom!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Land of the Lost is a farcical action-comedy based on the 1970s TV show produced by Sid and Marty Kroft. I enjoyed it but I can understand why most would not. It demands more than a casual familiarity with the original show, and no, if you've only seen the (hilarious) intro or an episode or two, that's probably not going to cut it. As such, the corny setups, goofy costumes and ridiculous characters would easily be mistaken for poor production values and a hodgepodge of a script. Yet an obvious question is, how many people really know or even remember the original enough to see this through the lens it intended? It's a high bar to clear for what's ultimately a popcorn movie.\n\nThe end result is something that fans of the original will \"get\" immediately and everyone else will be left scratching their heads, unimpressed, bored or all of the above. Why do the sleestak costumes look updated and modern, but their toes jiggle like rubber when they walk? Why do they move slower than a sloth? Are they even threatening at all? Is the film making fun of how non-threatening they are? If you saw the original, you'd know the answers. If you didn't, I can't blame you for thinking it's all just nonsense.\n\nEveryone delivers solid performances and there's some genuine laugh out loud moments. Whether you fit in that tiny sliver of overlap in the venn diagram that is apparently this film's audience will largely determine whether this hits the right nerve or is a complete miss."

They lose the machine and have to find it in order to return home.\n\nThat's the premise, but this film is truly, truly awful. There are NO laughs, NO smiles. It seems that every character has lines spoken to Ferrell telling him how wonderful he is, and the whole thing is one huge ego trip.\n\nUnder no circumstances should ANYONE pay to see this film. It's not even worth a DVD rental.\n\nTo be honest, it's not even worth the time to download it from the internet! Yes, it really is that bad."

That's the reason I went to go see this movie.\n\nHonestly, its more about going with it than expecting a full on narrative. If that's not your thing then I don't think you will like it.\n\nThe only thing I have to say is that if you were expecting it to be a carbon copy of the TV show you will be disappointed. They did glean some of the key elements and made it fun. Sort of similar in a way to the reimagined Star Trek.\n\nPersonally, I'd watch it again in a heart beat."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched Land of the Lost and thought it was a hysterical movie. I mean come on, any movie with Will Ferrel and Danny Mcbride is a must see movie. If you like sci-fi, journeys back in time, remakes of those old TV shows many of us grew up with, Will Ferrell and, oh yes, Dinosaurs, you should break even with \"Land Of The Lost\". Will Ferrell is as always, typical Will Ferrell. By now, cinema-goers know what that means. What saves \"Land Of The Lost\" from being a total flop is the terrific SFX, a cute rascally little creature (the Pakuni missing link) named Chacka and a fiercesome Dinosaur who steals the show every time it appears on screen.\n\nBut it was not all that; Land of the Lost had a disappointing opening Friday, bringing in right at $6.8 million on the Friday, with a projected $20 million for that weekend. That might not sound all that bad, but the movie cost Universal studios somewhere in the around $100 million to make and they wanted a $30 million opening weekend to escape fears of having a financial bomb on their hands. Interspersed amongst the humor and drama that makes up \"Land Of The Lost\" are: spectacular encounters with prehistoric creatures; blood sucking bugs, relics which have found there way into the time warp and, a bunch of 'sus' Aliens from another galaxy. Worth having a look at, especially if you have kids."

Jorma Taccone (\"Chaka\") almost steals the show - some achievement. UK DVD Release - it's a shame they felt they had to chuck in a few \"F\" obscenities, which sadly make it unsuitable for the younger children (who would have largely been unaware of a lot of the other slightly risky material.

Will Farrell is known for comedies and i love his movies, this movie got me laughing so hard that i could feel the crowd wanting to shut me up. i mean this movie was made to make people laugh and in my opinion mission accomplished. i didn't walk into the cinema to see an Oscar -probably- nominated movie, i went to see a movie that can end the night in a good way. and it did. Will and Danny make an excellent team on scream as their lines and jokes kept making me laugh harder and harder, i walked out of the cinema with a big smile and kept on talking with my friends over the funny parts in the movie, sure it's kinda silly with a bad story but hey as i said if i wanted story and good script and whatever i'd waited until the end of the year with those big movies running for Oscars. bottom line, if you want a good laugh this is the film for you."

I was especially disappointed when the female lad started strongly with a take no misogynist crap attitude that lasted only one line; after which she let herself get felt up and otherwise sexualized and hardly turned a hair. i'm not a will Farrell fan so I had low expectations to begin with and this still failed to come close."

There's a lot of crudeness in it, it's not as crude as JACKASS but is still not really suitable for anyone under age 12, plus a mouthed instance of the F word. Second, the redneck dude was not funny. You know how in action movies there's usually an annoying sidekick, butt buddy to the hero? Well Danny McBride was Will Ferrell's butt buddy in this movie, and I just didn't find him the least bit funny. Otherwise, the movie was pretty good.

After growing rather attached to will Ferrel films i think this is one of his funniest, if you like silly comedy this is a film for you plus i totally disagree with people who say it's for children. cos its not. When i first saw the DVD case i thought oh god it's just going to be cheap and poor but surprisingly it reminded me a lot of anchorman, there is a lot of intertexuallity and good use of camera. The story line in quite poor because it is so blatant what was going to happen in the end and the monster in it were obviously by the looks of them not a great deal of effort went into them. But all in all if you are 13 and beyond you should enjoy this comedy, it's light hearted and afterwards you feel good\n\nhope this helps"

        "review_detailed_main": "Originally a children's television show from 1974 to 1976, theoretically too, this is a mirrored concept of the Lost in Space episodes where space is swapped for gravity, it is in principle, the same. We see the older version of the Marshall family's adventures, with the past Marshall gang consisting of palaeontologist father Rick and son and daughter Will and Holly, fighting to get back home. We now see this contemporary version which sees three different protagonists such as Dr. Rick Marshall (Will Ferrell), English ex Cambridge student Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel) and hillbilly Will Stanton (Danny McBride) also fighting to survive the deadly environment of the Lost. Time warp fanatic Rick Marshall takes Stan and Holly to a new world of danger, dinosaurs and big bug-eyed lizard people while trying to find their way back home and, too, save the universe and in doing so saving his reputation.\n\nBrad Silberling (Director of Casper - 1995 and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events - 2004) has given Mr. Ferrell his usual farcical persona, this dumb but bright, this brave but cowardly, this man but childlike Dr. Marshall is typical Ferrell. While not a script-laden plot, the comic charm we see here is delivered with easy, light and memorable laugh-out-moments, with a great back-up crew as Ms. Friel and Danny McBride delivering their own unique repartee and the dinosaur with brains, brawn and personality it all adds up to a very funny film indeed.\n\nAnna Friel's (Rogue Trader - 1999) role is also extremely refreshing, proving that she too can cut the mustard with perfection of comic timing and personality. It's not a bad role to add to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, this crossover role may inject more light into her career, after her television episodes Pushing Daisies (2007 - 09) and Ms. Friel's other film roles too, this should boost her forward. With a good script and strong Direction, without doubt, can only transcend her to better and greater heights.\n\nFantasy - adventure films such as The Land That Time Forgot (1975), At the Earth's Core (1976) and Mysterious Island (1961) are at the centre of the narrative here: scientific advancement, adventure, danger and exotic beasts. With the puerile tone, some interesting dinosaur CGI The Land of the Lost really is a breath of fresh air that that can be inhaled by all ages.\n\nFun is the key word here and the interaction between Ferrell and the T-Rex is stupendously funny, but it is this connection that fills the screen with a good comedy duo that this film will be best remembered. Feeding of each other, like Scrat and his Acorn, it all adds to the flavour of the flair that is Will Ferrell. The Land of the Lost comes across as daft but fun, silly but witty and amusing but never dull, with its three-piece cast this is no stooge of a movie but a triple whammy of a laugh-out-hilarity film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those movies marketed with the children market firmly set in its sights, and my money is that parents will be appalled to have given their little ones a family outing to the cinemas only to realize it's a nightmare the first few minutes into the movie. It's a one of a kind slap to any film ratings board (here included) given the number of innuendos, f-bombs and hallucinogen use in the film, that parents would likely be flabbergasted by a PG-rating. The two kids sitting in front of me were laughing for a while, before being awfully quiet, disoriented by some really adult moments.\n\nWhile I have not seen the original 70s television series of the same name, I guess it's supposedly very much tamer than its big screen interpretation, though of course having Will Ferrell in a starring role would mean that one might be expecting a riotous time. Unfortunately not, and it's a film without a plot, throwing about random scenes now and then either just for laughs, or to display some digital effects for the sake of. While there be some attempts of dreaming up a plot with aliens in distress, saving the universe, the repair of one's reputation and the likes, the randomness of events more than destroys any semblance of a logical plot.\n\nNot that science fiction needs to anyway, but like an early remark in the film goes, it's very much non-science (read: nonsense), with Ferrell's Dr Rick Marshall designing a time-warp device for lateral time travel, meaning not forward or backwards, but laterally through parallel universes. You see, it saves meticulous design and planning, since it provides a lot of leeway to throw everything including the kitchen sink together sans realism or logic, just to provide some messy platform for Rick Marshall to either exhibit his intellect, but more so to showcase his buffoony.\n\nAiding him in his trip willingly is a graduate student from Cambridge who studied his work, Holly (Anna Friel), and an unwitting extra in kooky theme park ride administrator Will, played by Danny McBride who's in it just to become the punching bag of laughs, physical comedy and sparring partner of vulgarity with Ferrell. Expect plenty of the usual toilet humour too, complete with dung that brought on more dread than mirth. And you know there's a new low when one actor (Jorma Taccone) has to be dressed up and act the horny monkey throughout the film, speaking an indecipherable tongue that only Holly can understand. And isn't it too clich\u00e9 and pass\u00e9 already to be using yet another T-Rex as a villain?\n\nWill Farrell has been unimpressive of late, with a string of dubious, unfunny films such as Step-Brothers, Semi-Pro and Blades of Glory. OK so the last two still managed to get by with a handful of hilarious scenes, but the last funny film for me starring Ferrell would be Talladega Nights. I suppose he's doing himself no favours if his films continue to rake in poor box office and reviews, and perhaps a blast from the past in Anchorman 2 just might be his saving grace. We shall see.\n\nOne wonders how the filmmakers managed to get away with a film like this one, since it's all over the place, and definitely as lost as its title already prophesied. It may look like Planet of the Apes meet Stargate, but the result is neither funny, nor did it bother with crafting exciting set action pieces, and definitely a misadventure. You have been warned, and to make your money's worth when you managed to sit through this, sit through the end credits for a stinger mid way of the roll."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was much better than I had expected, probably due to the ultra low expectations I had going in. Even so, I generally think the movie isn't as bad as it's made out to be.\n\nIt was poorly marketed and the target audience isn't exactly clear. From the surface it looks like a family/ kids movie and it is based on that type of TV show but it's humour is targeted at a much older audience. Therefore it's too inappropriate for kids and too colourful and silly looking for most adults.\n\nAlso the plot isn't all that cohesive and it feels almost like a sketch comedy based film with one zany situation after the next.\n\nIt's very special effects heavy which is usually a con for most films but I found it suiting and strangely not too distracting.\n\nOne other notable feature is that Ferrell breaks from his usual ultra macho, cocky idiot character that he plays in almost every movie he's ever made. He's not that different but even the subtle dulling down of his usual attributes was refreshing.\n\nDespite it's flaws I found it quite enjoyable and very funny. I haven't seen the original show but I feel like the movie is supposed to be a parody rather than a homage or an honest recreation... and I think this is lost on most."

The story was so silly it also made me sick. The only good thing was the special effects. But you can't hold a whole movie together on special effects. You have to have a good story, good acting, doesn't have to be brilliant acting, but at least some sort of effort has to be made by the actors to entertain. I wasted my money on this film and I am not happy. I even asked the theater for my money back and they gave me a free pass for another movie. And I wasn't the only one suckered into this. Others were asking for their money back too and I saw at least six people walk out of the theater during the show. Shame on you for making this movie when you could have spent all that money on charities or on making several, cheaper, but much better movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't have a lot of friends in high school. I was invisible at school. At home my father was a depressed drunk in a downward spiral to suicide, while my mother was a mean ball-breaking feminist who always seemed to have an appointment somewhere else.\n\nThe last year of my life that made any sense was 7th Grade. That was the year LAND OF THE LOST was on TV. For some reason the idea of being in another world, where all kinds of creatures fit together and no one ever got laughed at or made fun of really made a difference to me. The weirder the show got, the more I liked it. It was my home at a time when I really didn't have anyplace to go.\n\nNow you might think that seeing this special show made into a lame comedy with dirty jokes would really make me angry. But as someone who loved the original show more than life itself, I think they got it. They got what this show meant to hard-core, stone-cold bottom of the barrel pre-teen losers like me. They got how it feels when the whole world is laughing at you. When no one has your back and the only place you can go is a land that exists outside of space and time.\n\nWill Ferrell brought all of that to life. He kept it real, and he was funny doing it. This was not a case of Adam Sandler raping Burt Reynolds for cheap laughs in THE LONGEST YARD. This was a case of someone finding the heart of the material and making a movie you can laugh at even while crying for joy.\n\nI know this movie wasn't a big hit. The day I went to the theater there were only five or six guys in the audience. Mostly they were older, middle aged, guys like me. Some were bald, some grossly overweight. One fellow seemed to have tentacles like a giant squid. For one reason or another, all of us had lost hope very young. We were the unwanted. No good memories of proms or dates. Nothing better in the years that followed. Nothing to hope for. No wife, no kids, no real future.\n\nLAND OF THE LOST was our show . . . our special place. There was no reason to think this wouldn't be another humiliation. Another betrayal.\n\nBut we watched . . . and we were made whole.\n\nAnd for just a while, we were men again."

        "review_title": "The Road To \"Land of the Lost\" is Paved with Good Intentions",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Land of the Lost\" is a movie with a plot similar in ways to the eponymous 1970's TV show on which it is supposedly based. Yes, both the TV show and the movie share the same title, were produced by Sid and Marty Kroft, and involve people traveling back in time to the prehistoric ages. However, on the 1970's TV show (and the early 90's remake which no one else appears to remember but me), the storyline involved a father and his two kids literally stumbling upon a time warp. In this movie, Will Ferrell plays a cocky scientist who deliberately looks for a time warp with the help of adult assistants.\n\nMy problem with the movie is not the difference between it and the TV show, but more the fact that this movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a comedy or a science fiction movie. The comedy in the film wasn't strong or witty enough most of the time, and the science fiction elements brought about way too many plot holes and vaguely-explained occurrences.\n\nSince this is a Will Ferrell vehicle, I expected this to be a comedy as did most other people, I presume. Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall, a scientist who, like many characters Ferrell has played before (Ron Burgundy, Ricky Bobby, Chazz Michael Michaels), is good at what he does for a living, but whose self-centeredness and delusion warp any credibility the character may otherwise deserve. Dr. Marshall understandably upsets the scientific community by announcing he has discovered time warps. A disastrous \"Today Show\" interview with skeptical Matt Lauer, one of the only funny parts in the movie, reduces Dr. Marshall to giving presentations to uninterested junior high kids. It's only when Holly, an adoring, unassuming graduate student from England (Anna Friel, of TV's \"Pushing Daisies\"), expresses her belief in him that he reconsiders his theory.\n\nTheir research brings them to a run-down souvenir shop operated by Will Stanton (Danny McBride). With their showtune-playing contraption, all three unsuspecting travellers get warped into what appears to be a prehistoric age. This deserted land they find is inhabited by Neanderthals,dinosaurs (including a T-Rex, as anyone who has seen the ads knows), and scary aliens from another dimension altogether.\n\nWhat makes this film confusing as a science fiction film is the fact that the land the heroes find themselves stuck in is never explained. Did they go back in time (like on the TV show), or to another dimension? The latter appears to be true, since Neanderthals didn't live at the same time as dinosaurs. Also, it's apparent that other people and things from modern day (such as an ice cream truck, a limousine, and a motel with a swimming pool) made their way to this dimension, but no explanation was made as to how they got there or why. The subplot involving the aliens, one of which speaks perfect English, reminded me of the Morlocks from H.G. Wells' \"The Time Machine\" (both the book and the movies). However, their presence, and the twist in plot, was too confusing for me and was no doubt for other moviegoers as well. It's not so much that their presence was a complicated part of the story, but more of a half-baked one. It's almost as if the filmmakers needed a villain, and the T-Rex wasn't big enough.\n\nSpeaking of the T-Rex, I remember being 10 years old and going to the movies to see \"Jurassic Park\" for the first time. I recall how amazing it was to see realistic-looking dinosaurs that were part computer generated and part animatronic. Those kinds of special effects were revolutionary at the time. I thought about this previous wonderment as I saw the T-Rex in this movie and felt unimpressed, despite the fact that the 100% CGI dinosaur looked flawless. I guess I just felt let down because the T-Rex as a villain has been done before in the 16 years since \"Jurassic Park\" was released. It may also be because the chase scenes with Will Ferrell seemed flat and uninspired, both as a science fiction and comedy plot point.\n\nAs for how funny this film was, it was no doubt Will Ferrell and company tried and not in vain either. It's easy to see when a comedian becomes so full of himself in a movie after a history of exceptionally funny ones. Mike Myers's \"The Love Guru\" felt incredibly narcissistic, as did Jim Carrey's performance in \"Yes Man\". Here, although Ferrell's character felt like a retread of earlier, better performances, he appeared to try his best. The problems lay in that there was so much action going on that any funny line got lost in the shuffle. Other moments, such as the Neanderthal's hand on Holly's breast or Ferrell watering himself down with dinosaur urine, felt too predictable and weak given the circumstances.\n\nAlthough the special effects were very good, they weren't groundbreaking, and were ruined by unexplained plot holes and confusing subplots. Besides that point, the comedy, which most people probably wanted to see in this movie in the first place, produced a few light chuckles, but that's about it. Of course, I'll give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt in the sense that this film appeared very hard to make, and probably was. However, this movie felt half baked, and should have been given more time to settle. The scenes with Will Ferrell and Matt Lauer still make a good YouTube video, but the rest is difficult to recommend."

This is what Ferrell movies are all about: Will acts stupid, a bunch of immature jokes ensue, plot-holes or plot-stretches are overlooked for the gags, pretty straight forward. On these grounds, the film delivers. Now, as soon as you meet the bad guy, of course you can tell he's evil, and of course there are impossibilities, but put it in perspective: it's a childish sci-fi comedy, and it's a Will Ferrell film. Of course that's the route it went. This expected, I went in, laughed, and enjoyed what I saw. Danny McBride, as always, is hilarious in delivery, and my only real criticism is some of the jokes with Ferrell just dragged on. Not many, but some. Brevity is wit. Hence, 7/10, on the grounds that it is what it meant to be, is good at being that, and is funny on those terms, but at times desperate. If you like stupid Will Ferrell jokes or stupid jokes in general (Adult Swim comes to mind) you will enjoy this for what it is."

I'm a self proclaimed film-snob but can usually find some point of interest in any movie. This is one of the few movies I have ever watched that has NO redeeming qualities. The plot and special effects were akin to a TV movie circa 1970 (oh wait, that's what this was based on!) speckled with modern-day raunchy humor. I'm not raising an objection to dirty humor but it did become tiresome after the third masturbation gag. Will Ferrell has been in steady decline and I can only hope this is the rock bottom and the guy can get back on his feet. Or at least spare us from watching this tripe."

(PG-13)\n\nDirector Silberling, from a script by Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas, has loosely updated the cheesy but fondly-remembered Sid & Marty Krofft television show, but instead of making it a family film aimed at children, it's turned into a Will Ferrell vehicle aimed at older audiences fond of scatology and puerility (bad idea). Paleontologist Ferrell, hanger-on/love interest Friel, and McBride (just...McBride) go through a time warp, end up in a lost world full of dinosaurs, monkey-men, and so on. Not really a parody version of the source material (or if it is, just an exceptionally unfunny one), but certainly not an authentic tribute either, with unexciting adventures, lazy gags, undeveloped characters, uninspired performances, and atrociously misfired special effects (worse than being merely bad CGI, but not bad enough to qualify as comically awful CGI). Add it all up: one heckuva colossal dud. Even the Ferrell faithful stayed away from this one, and although the Kroffts are listed as producers, it's difficult to imagine they influenced or approved of much of what ended up on screen. Leonard Nimoy has a voice cameo, but it ain't worth it.\n\n23/100"

I love his style of verbal and silly comedy.\n\nLand of the Lost is not a great film. It's filled with plot holes, even though the plot is almost non-existent. But, the plot does not seem to be the most important aspect of this film. The plot is merely an excuse for setting up the necessary context for various jokes and situations where some beautiful cgi surroundings are called for. And it worked for me.\n\nIt allowed me to completely turn of my brain and I just went along for the ride. Almost like with Crank, except with a lot of comedy instead of action.\n\nThe movie looks good and the Will Ferrell-comedy almost always worked. So, if you like Will Ferrell - watch it. If you desperately need some kind of depth in movies - don't.\n\nIt's not a very good movie, but it's a fun ride. It's a perfect movie for the hangover!"

One minute it's a adventure yarn with JP dinosaurs, the next it's full of rubbery lizard men like something out of a 70s Doctor Who, the next it's a slapstick comedy, then it's a romantic comedy... at some points it seems to be aimed at kids, the next someone is using the F-word. It's a complete mess of a film. Ferrell is always worth watching and he provides a few laugh out loud moments but it's about time they found a good vehicle for his obvious comedic talent. The casting of Friel was woeful, her character had zero chemistry with Ferrell and she was completely unconvincing as a paleontologist. Also, a minor irritant was the makers lack of research into her British character - at one point she explains how she had studied monkeys at Manchester zoo. Manchester doesn't even have a zoo, the Lancashire zoo is in Cheshire. The film is aesthetically pleasing but is ultimately unfulfilling and unrewarding."

It goes on way too long, while I'm just sitting there thinking, \"I get it! He pours urine on himself! It's hilarious! Now get on with the movie already!\" If that's not your kind of comedy, you're unlikely to enjoy this film.\n\nThe cinematography is good and the dinosaurs look pretty great, but that doesn't make up for the script. Will Ferrell and Anna Friel are pretty much the same as they are in everything else they've been in (as in, he's incredibly annoying, and she's lovely and charming and deserves to be in a much better movie than this); there's not much to say about Danny McBride as he doesn't get as much to do.\n\nThis is simply a brainless movie with very little effort put into it, and it's not really worth your time."

It does NOT deserve the bad reviews it has received, it may have some stupid parts to it, but the point is, it's comedy people! This is not a movie shooting for Academy Award Nominations, don't treat it like one! If I were to range this on a Comedic scale, I'd give it a 9.0/10.0.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Will Ferrell never disappoints\" was a previous notion of mine that proved to be false. Land of the Lost, directed by Brad Silberling accomplished the feat of being the first Will Ferrell film I have watched without having sore abs afterward from laughing. This so called \"comedy\" starring Ferrell as archaeologist Dr. Rick Marshall, lacked the laughs and special effects to hold any degree of my interest.\n\nThe only times I chuckled during the film were at the crude, sexual remarks occasionally slipped into a scene, usually directed toward Marshall's assistant Holly (Anna Friel). As the two of them and Will (Danny McBride) are time warped into another world run by animated creatures they are faced with strange, unexpected obstacles. This unknown world consistently faces the trio with challenges as they search for Marshall's tachyon amplifier and a portal back to the real world.\n\nThe noticeably computerized dinosaurs, aliens, and other creatures left a permanently confused wrinkle on my forehead. Several scenes had me questioning if they were meant to look overly fake as a joke. The actors were not blended with the backgrounds, but rather looked like they had been placed in front of the screen with no further editing. In multiple cases, backgrounds and actors failed to preserve the same resolution. Continuously half- blurry and half-high definition scenes distracted away from what was happening on the screen.\n\nUntil nearly halfway through the film, the plot had no direction. Marshall and his sidekicks roamed aimlessly until an alien from a black hole in yet another unknown world asked Dr. Marshall to retrieve his amplifier from the jungle. Finally, they had a mission. Nothing happened to further advance the plot besides random, unpredictable events, such as an ice cream truck landing in the middle of the desert or hundreds of aliens appearing from the forest. It's as if, while writing the script the writers arrived at a dead end and chose an object from a hat to fall from the sky to liven things up.\n\nTo add to the nonsensical plot, there was often times mysterious music playing louder than the actors were speaking. In most scenes there was nothing suspenseful about to happen, and it had me questioning if the spooky music was merely on repeat. The constant \"dun dun dun dun\" was unnecessary and on the verge of annoying. Rather than adding effect, it created confusion as a result of not being able to hear the dialogue.                                   Overall, I was very unimpressed with the quality of this film. The original idea may have had potential with well known actors playing conflicting characters, but somewhere in the making, the ideas went south. Maybe a science fiction lover who thinks Will Ferrell simply strutting around in an archaeologist outfit is humorous would enjoy this movie more than I did. I'm not even sure a science fiction fanatic would have endured this sloppily edited film."

It had a lot of dead spots but I want to bring one thing to the table here: Most of Ferell's laughs (in the past) come from his own improvised facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. In this movie, specifically the middle 1/3rd- you can tell Ferell has a cold. You can tell in his voice he is sick. So during these critical scenes that relied on him and his reactions and comedic improv, he was flat. Maybe he didn't feel well, or was tired- so he seems to just \"run his lines\", and tried to \"force it\" for the most part. I noticed the beginning, and the end he was much funnier and expressive and fun to watch. Obviously movies are shot out of order, and in this one- you can almost tell what was done first, second and third. The 3 characters seemed to be tanned at some points, regular in others, sun burnt in some, and even pale in some. You can tell by Ferrell's freckly face, by Holly's burnt cheeks and shoulders, and by McBride's arms. A lot of scenes were shot in the blazing sun (san dunes) so obviously spending 12 hours out there really tore them up- even if they did have sunblock.\n\nAlso, the special effects are the most realistic I've seen. Especially the little baby dinosaurs. Wow- they jump around, kick up dirt- and move at the pace you would believe them to. I really believe this movie deserves a real award in that area...\n\nAs for the writing- that's where it lost it. A lot of spots that fell flat, you could almost imagine or \"write\" your own joke and insert it there, and wish they had done it to make it better.\n\nandrew in Las cruces blhannahco@yahoo.com"

Leave Holly as a little girl; and leave Will as her brother, too. The new Will is a bumbling oaf who has converted a trailer junkyard to a penny-ante amusement park attraction. The operation has nobody visiting, and when you see it, you'll know why. I think this whole desert place was supposed to be funny, but even Cha-Ka isn't laughing.\n\nRick turns on his time machine device aboard the water ride there, which takes them \"sideways through time?\" and they are in the Land of the Lost. Home to Sleestack, Grumpy the T-Rex, that little Cha-Ka guy, and others There's some running around, some skull-duggery involving the Sleestacks, and a lame fight with Grumpy. I wish he ate Rick and spat him out. The slapstick approach to spotlight Farrell just doesn't work--a fond portrayel for nostalgia fans approach would have been so much better.\n\nOne of Will Farrell's worst, and he really needs to turn the tide on these duds soon.

I wanted to see the movie because I liked the concept, and I didn't want to continue watching the show. Plus, I like Will Ferrell.\n\nThe movie starts strong with a hilarious bit between Will Ferrell and Matt Lauer, and from then on it was hit or miss. Ferrell and co-star Danny McBride's chemistry is dead-on hilarious. Most of the jokes in the movie won me over, but others miss the mark completely, like the ones that deal with either Chaka or poop.\n\nI was so happy when I found out that they weren't gonna use CGI for the Sleestaks. And speaking of CGI, the animation in this movie is really good. Despite some moments where the actors fail to interact with CG creatures realistically, the CG fits in with the environments, and they're also incredibly detailed.\n\nMy major issue with the movie is that it doesn't know what type of comedy it is. There are moments where the \"jokes\" are clearly aimed at children, as they deal with bodily functions. Then, there's the edgy PG-13 humor, like a pointless scene of Ferrell, McBride, and Chaka drinking a narcotic drink and getting high.\n\nIt's funny at times, but it isn't anything to rush out and see.

I just really didn't care about them at all. Will's character was barely introduced before the big time altering event. Chaka was not cute in the slightest way (more like homely) - I am not sure how that comment made it to the final cut (yes it was that bad). The best bit in the movie was the walnut.

        "review_detailed_main": "Land of the Lost adventure comedy with Will Ferrell. Land of the Lost doesn't claim anything, it's a perfectly easy movie to watch for once. The journey itself in historical eras is mediocre, the visual series is not the strongest point of the film. Jokes are not particularly unique, and rather primitive. For the budget of such a film, special effects are made very mediocre, in some more budget films they look much better. Overall, The Lost World can be praised for its family-friendly viewing experience and \"toilet\" humour. Will Ferrell played great in the film, he is perfectly given such roles. And this is probably the most stupid film about tachyons and time travel."

He builds a cheesy time machine device and gets a girl whom what's a cheesy romance she has been following up on Dr Marshall. Comparing the two versions is not the same type of film. He did pretty well for a remake but the plot is very mushy. It has an introduction and conclusion with characters development and techno science doesn't even need to make sense."

Also, it is clear that everyone in the movie is putting their all into it. The Sleestaks are clearly guys in rubber suits, but they're very good rubber suits, and they only fit loosely on their actors in one very specific circumstance. The computer-animated dinosaurs clearly aren't really there in the scene, but they're pretty well done. And the animation that they did for the closing credits was far better than it had any need to be. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm hungry for some chorizo tacos."

Some are slightly amusing, but they are never bad enough to be actually funny.\n\nFerrell is fine overall, but the material is too lame for him to make much out of it. He has a few decent scenes/lines/gags. The other guy is visually and aurally unpleasant and has no business having a major role in a movie. Strictly a character actor. The prehistoric man character is terrible for the same reasons.\n\nThe inclusion of Matt Lauer is the best part of the movie.

There they had death defying adventures with their unwilling tagalong Will (Danny McBride) as they tried to recover the tachyon amplifier to get back home.

No one in the movie theater laughed at this or really most of the jokes in the movie. One of the problems also with this movie is that the series was a family one. So some people may believe that this is a family movie too. Which it is not.

It actually made it to syndication, and where it achieved some notoriety, it never made it to \"cult status\" so to speak. So why on Earth make a comedy out of it?\n\nI'm not a big \"Land of the Lost\" fanboy, ergo I'm not all that offended by a comedy made of it, but just on kind of a basic principle of taste, why turn a children's adventure show into a raunch comedy that isn't all that funny in the first place?\n\nThose of you who've read my previous reviews you know my opinion on Wil Ferrel's comedy (or lack of it), which makes one wonder why he or his agents thought making this movie was a good idea.\n\nLand of the Lost was just another Kroft Saturday morning show, although it was probably their more sensible show, and as an avid watcher when I was a boy, it didn't deeply resonate with me, though I did like it. I never got deeply into the show, so I didn't buy any of the schlock that the so-called producers were peddling (and quite frankly, I don't remember all that much \"Land of the Lost\" merchandise).\n\nAnd I think that's true for most kids who watched this show. So why on Earth was this film made in the first place? Someone thought there was enough of an audience that would pay to see an alleged \"send-up\" of a children's show. Someone, somewhere, thought it was a good idea. Huh.\n\nA better film would have been to pay homage to the original TV series, and perhaps aim it at kids as opposed to creating some embarrassingly unfunny film, starring an actor who isn't that funny in the first place.\n\nRegrettably this was not the case, and what we have left is a very high budget film with a lot of gloss and not much else. I think maybe I laughed once, but perhaps guardedly so.\n\nFortunately I didn't help flip the bill nor work on this very poor film. If you're going to make a comedy, then at least have a reason for doing so, and put some smarts into the thing. I mean \"Land of the Lost\" is a product of the 1970s, but \"The Goodbye Girl\" this thing ain't. Which is even more baffling since \"The Goodbye Girl\" was aimed at the same adult age bracket, but had more drama and funnier moments than anything Wil Ferrel and his team could conjure.\n\n\"Land of the Lost\" may have been shot on the cheap like a lot of Kroft productions, but that doesn't automatically make it a subject for humor. Sure, we can probably poke fun as it as adults, but \"Land of the Lost\" was made for children who liked dinosaurs.\n\nHow come a movie for kids who like dinosaurs couldn't be made?\n\nOne wonders."

When they first see him, it's like he's in ancient Egypt, then they fall through a hole in the sand and land on bones and see the t-rex in a few minutes.\n\nWith a script like this, this movie just should not have been made.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: will cause brain cell damage"

Land of the Lost turned up on HBO so I sat and watched... I'd already checked the summary here; the stars weren't too low so I stuck it out. Big mistake. One of the worst big budget movies I've seen in a very long time. The estimate of $100,000,000 for this pile of manure must surely be a mistake. Where did the money go? $30 million for Will? $20 million for Anna, 10c for the other guy? That still leaves (after my very over inflated suggestions (I reckon Anna really us about a tenth of the above) where did the other 50million get spent? There's no significant cast other than the main three characters? The effects are nothing unusual for this day and age, and some of it reminded me of Mork & Mindy days they were so basic. The script was so awful, they clearly weren't paying much for that. Musical score? Nope, mostly out of copyright show tunes. Someone, please explain to me: Where did the money go?"

This movie rocks!\n\nFerrell is Dr. Rick Marshall, a paleontologist with a controversial belief that humans can travel back in time. He gets laughed out of his career. Then, a fan of his, fellow scientist Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel), who left Cambridge University to present him with evidence of time travelers, finds him in relative obscurity lecturing kids at the La Brea Tar Pits.\n\nAn artifact leads them to a portal at a roadside Desert tourist trap run by a survivalist showman named Will Stanton (Danny McBride). Using Marshall's Home made Tachyon Device, the trio are plunged into an alternate past with dinosaurs and prehistoric primates like Chaka (Jorma Taccone). There are also the infamous sleestaks.\n\nHow could you not love this movie?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I generally like Will Ferrell, and he is enjoyable through much of this mesh of inane dialog, poor acting, lousy script, and incredibly lame version of a dubious television show to say the least. Ferrell is not at fault here at all. The people who wrote the script are for taking yet another 70's show and re-working it to the point of virtually no recognition for the viewer that might have had some chance of seeing in it what were nostalgic memories. The whole premise of the old show is basically cast aside for a story of some scientist who believe in time travel or some crap like that and gets together with a scientist/student who believes in him and some guy running a cave tour. That is the basic cast as we then get into the Land of the Lost via a machine with the music of A Chorus Line playing continually. I wish that the writers of today thought a little more of the composite intellect of their viewers - perhaps they are. The story, at least for me, is so way out there, so silly, and so predictable that I found myself somewhat bored throughout the film. There are some really funny moments with Ferrell, but they are too few and far between - and most of the best were in the trailers and commercials. I wish I had something else to say that the film was revolutionary in some slight way or that it made me think maybe once, but other than a few good laughs this is derivative and condescending for the most part. Just the whole bit about full blown motels and ice cream trucks, etc... - a low for the writers of this film."

Without it, the movie feels like what it is -- a collection of randomly assorted scenes of people running around chasing or being chased by not overly impressive special effects.\n\nWill Ferrell has some funny moments, but he is only as good as the movie around him, and he can't carry this film. Surprisingly, Danny McBride, playing a redneck who gets sucked into the netherworld with Ferrell's scientist character, comes closest to keeping our interest fully engaged. He's got a strong comic presence that can make even lacklustre material funny. Anna Friel plays the requisite eye candy, and there's some moderate fun to be had in the art direction.\n\nBut moderate fun is about as much as this movie ever achieves, and it never achieves even that for very long stretches at a time. \"Land of the Lost\" is destined for the Movie Land of the Forgotten.\n\nGrade: C"

If Ferrell wasn't in this movie I'd have given it 7 starts, for the fun factor and the other actors. I gave it a chance because I DID like Elf and Stranger than Fiction. And I've seen all of Ferrel's movies (I'm a glutton for punishment!) The only thing that leaves you astray in the previews is the family factor. There's a blatant F-U by Ferrell stated concisely to another character, and a joke about getting a woman \"wet\" (excited), and lots of boob grabbing (clothed). Language is peppered with things you don't want your kids repeating.\n\nI won't cover inconsistencies or mistakes in science or the campiness factor, as I feel all of those were considered unimportant, or were intentional in this movie. It's a kids movie with adult themes.\n\nVery little jumps out as being needed for the big screen. If you're not curious enough to see it in a theater, see it on DVD.

I like most Will Ferrel movies, but the only funny scenes in the whole movie were the opening and closing scenes, where he is being interviewed by Matt Laur. If they had done a whole movie with bits like that, it would have been funny! Will played his usual self in those short scenes. The rest of the movie seemed like they were just putting in the time to shoot each scene. I can't believe people rated this thing as high as 8, 9, or 10? (sometimes I think people associated with a movie flood this site with 10s for their movie) But of course, there were people who thought Napolean Dynamite was funny, so I guess to each his own.

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember going to the movie theatre a couple times in May 2009, and think the trailers I saw included one for \"Year One\" and one for \"Land of the Lost\", both comedies which came into theatres the following month. I recognized one comedian in each film, with Jack Black in \"Year One\" and Will Ferrell in \"Land of the Lost\". I finally saw the former last month and thought it was pretty lame, and now I've seen the latter, which I would say is definitely better than the other, but still not very good. It is based on the TV series of the same from the 1970s, which I'm not familiar with, but I watched this movie because of Ferrell's starring role. I know many people can't stand him as a comedian, but I often find him funny, just not so much in certain films, like this one.\n\nDr. Rick Marshall is a paleontologist who has been a major target of ridicule since expressing his time warp theories three years ago and now teaches children at the George C. Page Museum, but one person who admires him for his theories is a graduate student named Holly Cantrell, who says he was an inspiration to her. She shows him her findings and convinces him to finish his invention, the tachyon amplifier. The two of them then go to the cave where Holly found her fossil, and are taken on a tour with the cave gift shop owner, Will Stanton as their guide. During the boat ride through the cave, the tachyon amplifier is activated, and the three people aboard the raft are transported to another dimension, where timelines come together! They have lost the amplifier, and soon meet an ape man named Cha-Ka, of the Pakuni tribe, who becomes their guide as they venture through this dangerous Land of the Lost!\n\nWe first see Will Ferrell's character, Dr. Rick Marshall, in an interview with Matt Lauer on \"Today\" to talk about his theories, which causes a fight, first verbal then physical, between the talk show's guest and host. I have to admit, I thought this part was pretty funny. After this, there are some fairly amusing parts early in the film, but it's certainly not hilarious, and as Rick, Holly, Will, and Cha-Ka travel through the land, it's generally very straight-faced. I occasionally smiled or laughed lightly, but usually kept a straight face and found the story a little dull. I didn't find any of the gags revolting, but most of them failed to amuse me, unlike that interview sequence. I've seen Ferrell in a bunch of films, but was unfamiliar with the other three main cast members: Anna Friel (Holly), Danny McBride (Will), and Jorma Taccone (Cha-Ka). None of them really impressed me with their performances. Now, this movie does have some upsides. It's often a visual treat with the cinematography and CGI special effects, and the story may get slightly more exciting towards the end, but these aren't enough to save it.\n\nI've seen 1994's \"The Flintstones\", 1998's \"Lost in Space\", and 1999's \"Wild Wild West\". What these three films have in common is they are all lacklustre movies from the '90s based on TV shows from the '60s. I first saw episodes of the groundbreaking \"Flintstones\" cartoon series at a very early age, but still haven't seen any episodes of the other two shows. However, that certainly doesn't mean I wouldn't like them. This 2009 version of \"Land of the Lost\" reminds me of those other three films because it's a movie from the 2000s based on a TV show from the '70s. Also, like the three '90s releases I've mentioned, it's not very good. Like I said, I'm not familiar the show (it was made the decade before I was born), but I think whether you've seen any of the series or not, and whether you like it or not if you have seen it, there's probably no shame in skipping this film adaptation. (That's also what I said about the \"Lost in Space\" and \"Wild Wild West\" films, though this \"Land of the Lost\" adaptation is probably slightly better than those.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I checked the \"lost & found\" cinema section for a well-rounded comedic movie this summer and for the obvious reasons \"Land of the Lost\" was not in there. Which obvious reasons? Well, how much \"time travel\" time do you have? Director Brad Silberling's movie adaptation of Sid & Marty Kroft cult-famed 70's kid show \"Land of the Lost\" was a miserable experiment. Will Ferrell stars as obsessed scientist Dr. Rick Marshall who has a Marshall plan to travel in time to visit a land where as he calls it \"past, present, and future\" are all intertwined. I sure hope Marshall would have given me this land before I saw this movie. Because in the \"past\", I would have chosen not to see \"Land of the Lost\", and in the \"present\" would have been disgruntled at the silliness it offered, and in the \"future\" would have cried warning to all my friends & acquaintances to avoid it. Back in time to the so-called plot: Eventually, Marshall is sucked up into to some space vortex alongside Holly Cantrell, a research assistant, and Will Stanton, a redneck survivalist. At this Land of the Lost, they befriend a primate named Chaka, who starts singing primate hit songs such as \"I'm Every Primate\" and \"I Feel For You Being Stuck Here\". Oops wrong Chaka! That was Chaka Khan! Chaka Khan! Chaka Khan! Chaka Khan! Sorry! Got sucked into the Wrath of Khan! Anyway, the freaky foursome confront T-Rex dinosaurs, space creatures, bubonic-type insects, and more freaky-deaky stuff. They have to find the instrument that landed them in this time warp in order to\u0085\u0085. Sorry, did not follow the plot too much after that because by that time I was in the \"land of the lost interest\" from the film's ridiculousness. Silberling and writer Chris Henchy must have been in their own \"land of the lost originality\" while developing the movie. The film had no engaging structure and its outlandish scenes with the creatures were not amusing whatsoever, and profoundly \"over the top\". Henchy especially should have hired a writer henchman to aid him in the script, because what Henchy delivered to the \"Land of the Lost\" was in no man's creative land. Anna Friel as Holly Cantrell was appealing but not for this type of role; I would of had this looker appear instead in \"Land of the Lust\". Danny McBride as Will Stanton does yet another take on his formulaic redneck character, which by now has gotten to be a real monotonous pain in the redneck, I mean neck. The only mini-savior of \"Land of the Lost\" was the scene-stealer Chaka. This primitive was prime time with his uproarious gestures, and kudos goes out to Jorma Taccone for his Chaka portrayal. But the rest of \"Land of the Lost\" should be lost in your memory's past, present, and future! ** Needs Improvement"

I felt like I made the right call.\n\nDr. Rick Marshall(Will Ferrell,riffing the way only he can)has some,let's just say,fringe studies and field expertise. He's interested in time travel but his theories and writings have made him a laughingstock of the scientific community(as demonstrated in a fitfully funny early film confrontation/interview with Matt Lauer as himself)and lands him in a high school teaching job that he hates. Things seem to have screeched to a halt on his studies until a plucky--for no apparent reason other than to further the story--graduate student in a similar field named Holly(Anna Friel,very comely as always,but out of step in much of this story).With her help,plus the help of a product placement sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of fast food products and the unwitting aid of a deliriously crass park manager(Danny McBride,again stealing scenes!),Marshall with Holly and the ranger in tow are plunged into a sort of complex alternative universe where dinosaurs and quasi-pre-historic cave people cavort in desert plains,caves and abandoned 20th-century structures. Go figure!\n\nBrad Silberman,whose previous projects have ranged from Casper to Moonlight Mile,helms this film which seems to be little more than a Will Ferrell post-SNL showcase(minus an ingenious character such as Ron Burgundy or Ricky Bobby). As such,it's very funny,as Ferrell's commitment to character(much like on-time co-star Sasha Baron Cohen)is skillful and determined to the point of being off-putting. But the film as a whole seems to be half of an idea:make a movie based on a cult classic TV show of yore(Sid and Marty Kroft's \"Land of the Lost\") but then pretty much dump much of the original material or spirit in favor of a kind of gonzo physical comedy experience,laced with cheesy special effects. It may be trite but it has to be repeated:this movie really only works for you if you dig Ferrell and,to a lesser degree,the kind of relaxed,redneck humor and bravado of McBride. Otherwise a spare cast and a thin plot will leave many movie goers wanting(which,at this writing,it has,being a large box office disappointment for Universal). I believe when I first saw the trailers I believed this would be one of my first summer shows to catch. A slough of bad reviews,some better alternatives that showed up at the time and a tightness of budget changed that,and after seeing this,I cannot say I felt worse for that. An okay film that really isn't worth a rush to see."

His co-stars Anna Friel and Danny McBride are also much better than the junk that is this movie. It also felt like they were trying to force their lines as well. The dialogue in this was really campy and the special effects were incredibly cheesy.\n\nThis movie is easily a horrible TV adaptation. It could have been so much better.

But I do love bad movies and since this wasn't rated very highly by the critics I figured I'd give it a shot when it happened to pass on some streaming site. And honestly I wish I hadn't. This is just an excuse for Will to do his thing which is scream loudly, act like a man child, fall over repeatedly and at some point get stoned. I swear he does this in every single movie he's in.\n\nThe story itself is unremarkable. Basic jist is three people wind up going to an alien world / other dimension where dinosaurs, cave people and giant whatevers exist. There also seems to be some kind of connection between that world and ours because you occasionally see glimpses of things that have fallen from our world to this one.\n\nIt really boils down to this.

        "review_detailed_main": "I really wanted to give this movie a 9 to counter the unjustly low score it has on IMDb, but if I rate it honestly, it's a solid 8--no more, no less.\n\nFirst off, Will Ferrell is great. His sense of humor seems to connect with most people, and even though, like most comedians, he plays very similar characters in all of his movies, it's still always enjoyable to see him on screen. And he's made some great movies: Anchorman, Old School, and Talladega Nights are hard movies to top, but few comedians can crank out so many hits in so short a time.\n\nLand of the Lost may not be quite the gut-buster that a few past Will Ferrell movies have been, but it's still an exceptionally well-written and entertaining film. I'd put it on the same level as Step Brothers, though it's more accessible and makes use of more sight gags than offbeat humor and awkward situations.\n\nThe chemistry between the cast is terrific, and Danny McBride's whitetrash goofball antics really compliments Ferrell's pretentious yet clueless scientist character. And even though the movie has its fair share of quotable one-liners, a lot of the film's less overt humor isn't dialog-derived but rather situational. They're scenes that remind you of your own experiences in similar social situations presented with subtle humor that you just can't help but chuckle at. There are many of these familiar and extremely relatable moments interspersed throughout the film that keep you grinning between the tear-inducing sight gags and side-achingly funny dialog. And it's this mixture of comedic elements that keeps the pace of the movie just right and makes the film and its characters so endearing.\n\nThis isn't a comedy that relies on the character's extreme awkwardness or that's filled with cringe-inducing embarrassing moments. The humor is accessible and characteristic of Ferrell's films but still remains fresh and dynamic. And it's because of all of this that I really can't imagine why so many people dislike the movie. Still, I think if you enjoyed films like Talladega Nights or Year One (another underrated film), you'll enjoy this well above average comedy."

Will Ferrel & Danny McBride are Great Actors! I Will Def Buy It On DVD! I Will See It Again! and Again! Love it & Will Always Love It! GO SEE IT! I Don't Know What Ese To Say. AMAZING! GREAT! Gosh, Best Movie Ever. Chaka hates Rick, which is funny. It's A Great Movie! Lots Of Bad Words, Which Is The Main Reason It's Rated PG-13. I Haven't Seen The Original Series, But I've Seen Clips On YouTube, and This Movie, WAS WAY BETTER! GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!"

I have seen my share of terrible comedies lately but I have to say that I really did enjoy this movie and i thought it was put together well enough so that the comedy of it would keep the viewer entertained throughout. The story and the dialog may have not been written as well as it could of been although the movie was made for Will Farrel and Danny McBride and the comedy of it was ridiculously hilarious. If you don't enjoy this movie then you should probably think back on any moments you may have found funny. Overall, before you watch this movie don't be expecting agreat movie, but instead be expecting a fun movie that should keep you entertained."

They know it through intuition rather than through rationing.\n\nHow was I able to *understand* this movie? I have watched it several times. More times than I can count. Each time I watched it I discovered more and more novel layers of genius (not least comedy genius). My latest revelation, after having watched the (perhaps) 15th time, it that the story of this movie is real. Perhaps not in its smallest detail, but the main storyline happened. It is no joke.\n\nFor those also trying to understand this movie, watching it several times can definitely be of help. But it is important to watch it with an open mind. I've heard that watching it while on certain drugs might also help the viewer to know this movie, although I would not encourage that."

Like how can Holly speak Chaka's language so well? But this is easy to ignore. This is after all a silly comedy, the kind Will Ferrell does. And one gets to enjoy it if one is also into this kind of humor.\n\nAnd I must say I was not expecting all the things that were about to come. I loved the whole quarrel between Dr. Marshall and the dinosaur. As well as all the stuff that he was teaching them about the dino. And Chaka was also a great addition to the story. Lots of laughter and action. Nothing serious about the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love the idea being this Land of the Lost comedy, and oh my god is the execution on set design, costuming, visual landscape, and CG/practical effect blending excellent. It all looks great, brimming with character and fun design choices.\n\nThe comedy alternates wildly between very genuinely funny, and floppy, all dependent on Ferrell, Friel, and McBride's improv delivery. I really enjoyed the banter for the most part - it just feels organic and fun, and moves at a quick enough pace that you're not rolling your eyes when a joke doesn't land. It IS that quippy style of comedy, though, so you basically need to go into LotL expecting the characters to be clowning around nonstop for the duration of the adventure. It's just improv actors having fun in a comedic role with a very self-aware plot - I'm very happy they went all the way, and built the comedy around the actors.\n\nAction is generally very fun and well-presented, with the camera-work keeping everything in-frame and clear without getting chaotic. Again, I cannot say enough good about the way this movie looks and plays out.\n\nNo real complaints beyond a few recurring jokes that don't really land - the showtunes gag in particular didn't do much for me, and I get slightly annoyed by how (for the first half of the movie) Friel's character's just there to have McBride make crass jokes at and Chaka to grope. She does really come into her own during the second half, though, so eh, not that big a deal.\n\nA good, fun movie."

There was no real message in the film, there was no moral to the story. There were gross scenes, funny scenes, stupid scenes, impossible scenes and outright hilarious scenes. The movie is like all of Ferrell's movies, but that's good. I don't remember the name of his male costar but he's awesome.

Apparently it's supposed to be a remake of the TV show, but I could care less, because I obviously laughed at almost every scene.\n\nThey used the budget well and managed to make some above average special effects. There were obviously some nods to other movies like Star Trek, The Matrix, and many others. I might pick this up for blu-ray if it has bd-live and a good amount of special features. 8/10 for great references to other films and laugh out loud, humor."

Effects are up to standard, there is a story to it that is well-executed and it's entertaining and keeping your attention. It also provides nice hints and jabs to previous blockbuster movies that feel natural and are honestly acted out - kudos for that! Just because a flic is a comedy doesn't mean it's necessarily a kids movie; and this movie underlines that once more: there are a lot of adult jokes and insinuations, that kids wouldn't get at all.\n\nMore can't really be said without getting into spoiling the movie - so I'll just leave this review with the recommendation: watch it if you like comedy with a good dose of sci-fi!"

This might be off-putting to some viewers who expect a more conventional narrative, but for others, it's precisely what makes the film so enjoyable. \"Land of the Lost\" is not afraid to be silly, to push the boundaries of believability, and to invite the audience to simply have fun.\n\n\"Land of the Lost\" isn't just a movie I enjoy-it's a film that changed my perspective and, in its own quirky way, enriched my life."

Joe was horrible: dumb plot, crappy actors, dull dialogs and really dull humor, special effects for everything (even car chases were completely faked)...Hollywood ruined yet another childhood hero for so many of us.\n\nUnlike G.I. Joe, with Land of the Lost, you knew exactly what to expect. I mean come on, Ferrell traveling through time to some parallel universe to save the climate crisis? Did you expect something like a mix between Al Gore's \"inconvenient truth\" and terminator? People who rated this movie so low should stop pretending they are smart, they're just making fools of themselves. This movie is idiotic and it doesn't pretend to be smart at all. If you can enjoy it, then your IQ must be pretty high. Else...well lets say you should ask yourself some questions about your own intelligence...\n\nIts just like those who go see a movie without looking it up on the internet before and then feel literally \"insulted\" because they didn't expect it to have, I don't know, sexual and crude humor...*DUH!*, if I had to take my kids to a movie, i'd look for what is appropriate before going to the movies...you can't say you didn't know, not in todays world.\n\nConcerning the movie itself. Well, it has its flaws, obviously, but the only thing you need to do is take it for what it is: a Will Ferrell movie. I enjoyed it, really, I did, because I wasn't expecting it to tackle my intelligence. It was dumb and ridiculous, yet fun and entertaining. I must be honest, I thought it was going to suck before I watched it because of the ratings, allowing me to lower my expectations and in the end feel glad I saw it. And that comes from someone who usually never watches a movie when IMDb ratings are bellow 6...\n\nIn many ways, Land of the Lost is in the same vein as Army of Darkness (7.6/10, wow, people really didn't have sticks in their places where the sun don't shine back in 1993). Just grab yourself a pack of pop-corn, sit back and enjoy the ride, that's all there is to it."

I think it is one of Will Ferrell's best movies, so if you are a fan of him other films, you should check it out.\n\nNot only is it funny, but it is very entertaining with the wild sci-fi plot, the crazy adventure, the over-the-top sets and the fast pace that never gets boring.\n\nIt is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again, and find new things to laugh at each time. Obviously it's not to be taken too seriously and the plot is full of holes, but who cares! That's a big part of what makes it so funny.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun movie that will entertain and be a creative blend of sci-fi, fantasy, and comedy, this is not to be missed!"

This film is meant to entertain and relax and it does if you watch it without prejudices. Also, it has the elements of parody to different genres, so it should be absurd.\n\nWill Ferrell may not be some great comedian, but he really did a good job with this character. A simple-minded scientist, who sometimes has no respect for the others, a little bit narcissistic know-it-all pain in the ass. All the other characters were placed good also. All of them mixed up give us a twisted gang that is out of place and time.\n\nT-Rex is also an important protagonist of the film, and is scarily entertaining. His CGI is really good and because of that he is a part of some original jokes and without it this film would be a big time disaster. I really like dinosaurs, I loved them since I was a kid, so I was thrilled when I saw this one in the trailer. All in all, he is not a real dinosaur here, he is a comedian... something different for a change, and all of you who want to see a real dinosaurs and maybe some gore, go and watch some of the Spielberg's masterpieces, those are some scientific-based reptiles. This one here is, like I said, to entertain.\n\nBasically, if you want to relax, get some laughs and enjoy for 101 min, this is the movie for you. Leave all the common sense and criticism aside and simply enjoy. This is how this film should be watched."

The CGI and sound-design are top-notch.\n\nWill Ferrell's over-the-top performance tends (as usual) to overshadow the subtleties of the Silberling's terrific direction, but as Sci-Fi comedies go, this is among the best ever.\n\nI don't understand all the \"haters\"... I suppose there could be a peculiar mind-set that equates unnecessarily and excessively harsh criticism with intelligence and discernment.

This really won't bring the older fans back into the theaters, but it should be enough to bring in a new generation of movie goers. It's a comedy for crying out loud, its meant to make you laugh, and if the only reason you want to see it is because you need a good laugh, you won't be disappointed. People expecting an action packed Indiana Jones like movie, well, this isn't exactly for you, or for the older fans of the TV series. The idea is simple, watch the movie, laugh it out, go home wait a few months, bye the DVD, and watch it again. By th way, this isn't as kid friendly as the TV series was, don't go bringing kids under 5 in the theater."

Jorma Taccone is great as Chaka, when I first saw this character I thought I would get annoyed but he really knew how too play it, and the friendship he builds with the other characters mainly McBride is hilarious. I even watched the deleted scenes right after the movie because I could not get enough. I only wish I would have seen this in 3D but its great on DVD at home. Another thing that was cool were all the Sci-Fi homages. And the special effects are pretty good. If you need a good laugh and a good fun Sci-Fi adventure movie then this is for you."

No, this is not a kids movie, but it follows the same situation where somebody spoofs a zombie movie and mocks the hero because zombies walk slowly, and everybody criticizes the movie because now they don't feel like their heroes are so super after running away from slow walking zombies.\n\nIt said 'Will Ferrell' in the cover, what did you expected. It is a comedy; it was never presented any other way. There are lots of bad reviews because the series made you feel intellectual when you watched it as a kid but now you feel ridiculed. Yes, that's what normally happens when you see something that is a spoof of something else. Also, if you feel ridiculed when you took your kids to see how awesome was the series you watched as a kid, and instead you show them potty humor, you may have thought about it before taking your kids to a movie that was rated PG13\n\nActually, It is a good think they made this movie, as it's been long since a comedy like this was made, from the times of 'Naked Gun', 'Hot Shots' or even 'Top Secret' (and maybe Mystery Men). Nobody knows how to make good comedies anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, is incredible that thru the movie all actors do their part with a straight face; is like they were born to play these characters.. and all wrapped in a beautiful photography. All desert scenes are just picture perfect, and could perfectly be taken as a still and be framed. The CGI, despite some comments, was really nice and convincing; and puppet effects were also adequate in a cheesy way that makes the movie be aware of itself. Is like they were breaking the fourth wall all the time, without actually doing it once.\n\nIs a great movie for what it is, and sorry it did not made you feel like you wanted to be the main character. Suck it up."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really enjoyed the OG series from 1974. The reboot series from 1991 was okay and this movie I just LOVED. It was so funny and entertaining. The only bad thing about it, is that a sequel yet not have come. There are so many funny and hilarious scenes in this movie. Like the one when they are being chased by the T-Rex and in the middle of running for their life, Ferrell tells him they have to stop for a photo as proof, and not only does he stop, he actually strikes a pose while doing it with the chasing man-eating T-Rex in the background coming closer and closer. Oh, man, I just smile from ear-to-ear just thinking about it now. That is just one of many incredibly funny scenes that this movie provides. There also many references to the OG series, like when Ferrell sings the intro music to the series. Some memorable quotes: \"We're gonna cook ... and eat ... Chaka\" \"-I never trust a guy wearing a tunic. -You live by that rule? -It never steered me wrong.\" To mention a couple. I truly hope that a sequel will eventually come. It deserves a sequel. And I recommend this movie to everyone that enjoys a good laugh. And if you also like dinosaurs and secret worlds, then you will like it even more."
