It has that early 2000's edge and cheesiness. The director's cut really fixes a lot of the movies problems but not all of it. There are a couple dumb scenes that take you out of the movie and the cgi is pretty dated. However most of the cast does a pretty good job with the roles they are given and the movie does a quick and simple job at telling the origin story. Some of the visuals and art designs are also pretty great and the action sequences still hold up. Overall, only watch the director's cut and don't take it to seriously."

I dearly love how he does several stunts and tricks.\n\nIt is exciting to watch him do insane stunts like jumping right off buildings and then regaining his balance.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I heard about a directors cut to this movie I never imagined it would be so much better than the original release. Why must movie studios always feel they know better than the director. This film would have been much more successful had they left it alone, but by insisting on so many cuts and changes they shot themselves in the foot. All because they wanted a family friendly spider-man type film instead of the much more dark and violent world of daredevil. Every scene added to the film makes you wonder why they cut it in the first place. It isn't just about adding scenes though they have taken a couple out too. I can't imagine anyone who would miss the fireside love scene. I urge everyone who saw the theatrical cut to watch the directors cut. It isn't a perfect film but it's a more complete and enjoyable one. Also watch the documentary on the directors cut DVD and see one of the producers trying to defend the original release and then actually saying he thinks it is the better cut. I think he must be more blind than Matt Murdock!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Daredevil is a hero movie. Unfortunately, the hero happens to be James Acheson. I looked his name up on the credits and he is the costume designer. When the makers of the film paid him to make a very camp Daredevil suit he did as they asked. Everyone else involved should be ashamed of this sorry mess of a film. I could go on, and I will.\n\nIn your average blockbuster you'll see action, follow a storyline, perhaps witness a little love interest. This will build up to a grand finale, a showdown. And would just a small amount of good acting be too much to ask? Apparently so, because on all counts this movie fails.\n\nWhen a comic-book action movie contains only a handful of minutes of said action, you know there's a problem. That isn't even the bad news regarding action in this film. As if by accident Daredevil battles Bullseye for a second time. At this point the CGI characters (yes, i think Colin and Ben were in a bar drinking when this scene was made) move in. Did I mention that they move in like drunken idiots, unconvincingly lurching up and down, all over the screen. Didn't the CGI guys see The Matrix (original or :Reloaded), or Blade?\n\nAs for the storyline, don't get me started. Because I won't know where to. Was there a story? I saw this film an hour ago and I can't tell you what happened apart from people fighting, crying, kissing and dying. the scriptwriters should never be allowed out of the unemployment line again.\n\nA big deal was made of Jennifer Garner taking on the part of Elektra. I think she read the script and thought she was playing Carmen Electra, because that's how much of an acting range she shows in this film (and I'm a big fan of Carmen.) Garner and Ben had no chemistry at all. A stink bomb has more chemistry, and would have done the job (i.e stunk to high heaven) better than this film for a lot less money. Ben has no excuse, as I'm fairly sure J-Lo made him sit down and watch all her movies. Did he watch Out Of Sight? (Imagine J-Lo being better than you at acting...)\n\nAnd on the subject of acting the usually dependable Colin Farrell manages to play a very unconvincing Irishman, which is no mean feat for an actual Irishman. Yet another illustration of just how poor this film is.\n\nYou've still managed to make it to the end of the movie instead of a) destroying your TV, or b) plain old falling asleep? I won't spoil the ending but you are rewarded (and I use the word 'rewarded' loosely) by a total lack of a spectacular showdown. Instead Daredevil gets really angry to all the naughty men who've stayed up past their bedtimes. You can almost hear Daredevil say \"Hey, don't make me come up there!\" as he wanders into the night one last time (hopefully, anyway.)\n\nThis film gets 0 out of 10, with perhaps an extra 1 for costume design."

        "review_detailed_main": "Blinded by bio-hazardous waste as a child, Matt Murdock finds that his other senses have developed to the point where they afford him almost supernatural physical abilities. Years later, Murdock (Ben Affleck), now a pro-bono lawyer, takes on the guise of night-time vigilante Daredevil, using his powers to ensure that justice is always served. In doing so, he finds himself pitted against crime boss Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), his hired hit-man Bullseye (Colin Farrell, who hams it up wonderfully in every scene), and kick-ass babe Elektra (Jennifer Garner), who mistakenly holds Daredevil responsible for the death of her father.\n\nThe recent casting of Ben Affleck as Batman has been the cause of much controversy amongst comic book fans, but judging by Daredevil, the star's previous foray into comicdom, I'm not all that concerned, this fun movie proving the actor to be more than capable in the role of superhero. Affleck acquits himself surprisingly well as both the laudable lawyer and his leather-clad alter-ego, providing the character with the necessary depth and the required physicality.\n\nIf this longer version still proves less than perfect, it is not down to Affleck, but once again due to the script and the directorial style (I guess some things just can't be fixed). With an extra thirty minutes, The Director's Cut fleshes out the characters and makes more sense of the narrative, but at the expense of the pacing; in addition, the poorly lit visuals makes some of the action hard to follow (I understand that the look and feel is intended to emulate the style of Frank Miller's comic book artwork, which makes great use of heavy shadow, but director Mark Steven Johnson takes things a step too far).\n\nOver the last decade, Marvel have gradually honed their product to meet maximum audience approval, boosting their budgets and throwing the best special effects available onto the screen, but as one of the earliest postmillenial attempts to bring their characters to the big screen (yes\u0085 Daredevil is already well over a decade old) this is still a serviceable effort, with only the occasional iffy CGI shot belying its age."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, this was a more complete version of the DVD which came out earlier. In this edition, about a half-hour of new material was added to the disc (and what was shown at the theaters.) All reviews I read said it elevated this film from \"fair at best\" to \"good.\" I agree. It made the movie much, much better.\n\nYeah, it's more far-fetched than the other superhero movies because here, the hero is a blind guy who, because of his blindness, has extraordinary hearing powers along with the rest of the usual Batman/Spiderman-type athletic skills.\n\nAs in most of the Batman films, this is a dark film. I think it would have been better had it lightened up a bit with a few jokes and a more wholesome female lead. Jennifer Garner is another one of these latter-day skinny chicks who is made to be tough-looking, tough-talking and tough-fighting. In other words: ridiculous. However, I will say she comes across a little more likable on the extended version. One more negative: the fight scenes go on a tad too long and are outlandish.\n\nOn the positive side, this may be the best-sounding DVD I own, at least up to ones I had heard up until this came out in January of 2005. Since the hero (Ben Affleck) has super hearing, this is emphasized in this movie and so you, if you have a 5.1 surround system, hear sounds from all speakers at almost times. It's awesome!\n\nAffleck, meanwhile, is likable as the superhero and I liked the message he gives at the end about shunning revenge. Wow, you don't hear that much in movies. Kudos, too, to villains' Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. They are fun to watch, especially Farrell.\n\nSo, if this superhero film interests you, make sure you get the \"Director's Cut\" edition. It's far better than the original, and, I believe, the same price."

        "review_detailed_main": "This surprisingly dark and moody superhero yarn is a great and unexpected surprise \u2013 probably the most genuinely entertaining comic-book film to come out of Hollywood in the early surge of such movies. It certainly walks all over the likes of HULK and SPIDER-MAN. The fun aspect of the movie comes from a pleasingly witty script, which serves up crisp dialogue throughout; some surprising plot developments (coming from somebody who never reads any comics); memorable acting performances and a freshness which is more than worthwhile. The backstory of the main character is run through pleasingly fast, in about fifteen minutes (compared to HULK's forty-five). I don't want to spoil any of the plot, other than to say that this film takes a more adult, mature approach to the material \u2013 both in the depth of emotion of the characters, in the handling of death, and in the rather violent action sequences.\n\nSaid action \u2013 invariably incorporating martial arts, which is of course currently in vogue in Hollywood \u2013 is highly entertaining and the film as a whole is packed with special effects, which add to the impact rather than being really noticeable. The entire cast put in good performances, from Ben Affleck's subdued turn as the lead to the solid support of Jon Favreau, Joe Pantoliano and Leland Orser. Yet the most noticeable characters are Jennifer Garner as the truly electrifying Elektra, Michael Clarke Duncan as the impossibly imposing Kingpin, and best of all, Colin Farrell as mad henchman Bullseye. Farrell bags the best role in the film and really makes a meal of it, bringing humour to his psycho-schtick and enlivening the proceedings no end. The combination of the above factors serve to highlight DAREDEVIL as one of the triumphs of the Hollywood year!"

Ben Affleck's performance as the Daredevil Matt Murdock is believable, but he does get too dramatic in scenes where it really isn't required. As much as people don't want to believe it, this movie works with the pretty boys Affleck and Colin Farrell as the secondary villain, a sharpshooting hit-man named Bullseye. They really hate each other (laughs). Jennifer Garner as the very sexy heiress Elektra Nachios saves this movie from being a 5/10 instead of an 8/10. She is such a likable character and does an excellent job of playing the powerful yet vulnerable Elektra. She is great at being a woman who wants to be with her man, yet has her priorities. The main villain is the very evil Kingpin, headed by a great Michael Clarke Duncan. Duncan shows his brute force near the end of the movie. All throughout, these 4 A and B list actors are flanked by a great supporting cast including Joe Pantoliano as an investigative reporter who later becomes of aid to the Daredevil, Leland Orser as the Kingpin's right hand man Wesley, and Jon Favreau as Murdock's best friend and colleague. Favreau is mostly comic relief, but the first two characters played by Pantoliano and Orser are serious characters. All in all this is a good movie, not great, good. The cast does a much better job than most people believed they would, and Jennifer Garner owns the film. It's a shame no sequel has been announced, because it would be a great film as well. The darkness of this movie can be felt all throughout, with the great villainous work of Duncan and Farrell, and the mood of Affleck and Garner. 7/10"

It made for an epic fail that only came half-way to what it needed to be.\n\nAnd then there is the street aspect of Daredevil. He isn't the Avengers, he takes on problems in Hell's Kitchen, he operates close to the community and you sort of only got a taste of it.\n\nThey tried to show that street-wise hero, but ended up making things still a little larger than life. A little too much in that regard. The Kingpin, and Duncan was perfect for the role, seemed like a villain a little too big for Daredevil, a little too removed from the mafia thug that he actually is.\n\nAs a result, the movie sort of fails, but only just. A little push further in the right direction would have taken it from a failure to a success.\n\nIt can still be enjoyed, for what it is, but feels hallow."

Daredevil is not what I call a perfect movie, I still did find the love story soppy and becoming dangerously close to flagging down the film and the soundtrack is rather dated and heavy for my liking. On the other hand, I loved the stylish visuals, the fresh, funny dialogue, that I could make much more sense of the story and could be more entertained by it and the characterisation of the titular character with him being vulnerable and flawed I found him very interesting. The other characters are not as well developed, but are enthusiastically performed. Colin Farrell especially is lots of fun, Jennifer Garner is decent and Michael Clarke Duncan is great as is Joe Pantoliano. The editing is good if occasionally rushed, and the action sequences are clear if not always very subtle. Overall, a good movie that fared much better on re-watch. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite the low ratings this movie has gotten from the masses, I honestly can say that this is probably the best Marvel movie to come out in the recent barrage of comic based movies to hit the big screen. I'm guessing the reason for the lack of high ratings is that most people were looking for a super hero along the lines of Spiderman who saves people and is always doing \"the right thing\". Well this obviously isn't the case here, as one can clearly see from how Daredevil does away with the baddies. I personally think that the concept of an avenging lawyer who serves up street justice to those that manipulate the system is a great concept. I also think that everybody did a great job of playing their characters as they should be played, yes\u0085 I know, even Ben. The only person I thought did a mediocre job was Colin, who only helped to make the already stupid looking Bullseye look even dumber then the character deserves. As you can no doubt guess from reading this, I'm a huge fan of the series. What you probably wouldn't guess is that choosing Michael Clarke Duncan to play the Kingpin is by far the best \"improvisational\" casting choice I've ever seen. For those of you who don't know, the Kingpin is \"supposed\" to be a big white guy\u0085 we're talking sumo style big. While Michael isn't quite that big, his size and look are by far better then anybody else they could have ever gotten to play this role. So, in conclusion, if you like your hero's on the darker side, a la Batman, then this should be a good choice for you. The effects and story line are great; I can only hope that the only \"acceptable\" attendance at the theaters won't stop them from making a sequel to this movie\u0085 I know, don't hate me\u0085 but with Ben playing Daredevil again as well\u0085 don't worry, I hate myself too!!! And P.S. Elektra isn't a sequel\u0085 it's a separate plot line all together, although they try to link the two at some point in the movie, but that's another comment for another movie."

Seeing Netflix spot on show with Charlie Cox does nothing to improve this terrible movie, were the creators clearly have no idea who Daredevil is. They got the part that he is blind, at least. The rest is utter crap. Ben Affleck is terrible, and I guess Jennifer Garner got the Elektra part for being his girlfriend. You would think the chemistry between a real couple would show on screen, but alas, the stupid \"flirting\" in the playpark shows both actors hardly can act. I was frankly upset seeing this in cinema. My own, favorite superhero with inner demons, reduced to a cardboard character. And the music is rubbish, full of nu metal. I know Evanecence got a #1 out of \"Bring Me Back To Life\", but you don't have to be a genious to understand the makers tried to riff of the much better soundtrack of The Crow. Man I'm glad Netflix did ol'DareDevil a real character again."

I believe Ben Affleck lends more depth and plausibility to Daredevil than Christian Bale did to his monosyllabic Batman. Collin Farrell delivers an intriguing and funny superhero movie villain (a rare treat, that was later brought to perfection by his friend Heath). Michael Clarke Duncan and Jennifer Garner are, each in their own way, beautiful to behold, and perform well in their archetypal roles. Overall, if you enjoy superhero movies and skipped this one, see it - just make sure to get the Director's Cut."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Devil card, never leave the church without it\". Honest to God, was fully expecting that line, that's the level of cringe we're dealing with here. Prior to this wonderful superhero blockbuster, I had no knowledge of Daredevil aside from his sonar ability. No, I've not seen the Netflix series, and no I hadn't read the comics. I simply just don't care enough. And after watching this, I really really don't care anymore. My refusal to summarise the plot in one sentence is justified, reason being is that the narrative is overstuffed with segregated sub-plots that it feels respectable to tackle them individually. So, here we go!\n\nUnequivocally the basis of Sin Cit..., I mean, Daredevil is revolving around a blind wealthy lawyer who takes it upon himself to become a masked vigilante at night and nunchuck civilians to death (*cough* Batman *cough*). It's a tight, cheaply woven PVC gimp suit that provides no protection or added traits whatsoever, and due to the helmet covering up his eyes, Affleck's butt chin is more noticeable than the shoddy CGI. Thank the lord his eyes were covered up though, because Affleck's blind acting was more \"derpy\" than me trying to work out basic mathematics whilst heavily influenced by gin (hint: I look like Affleck).\n\nSo Matt Murdock, the eponymous character, yearns to annihilate the crime lord Kingpin for committing a crime that had influenced Matt's fight against criminals. Y'know, \"justice is blind\" and all that obvious rubbish that makes you want to heave. Ingenious casting of Clarke Duncan, I must say, just a shame Johnson never flippin' utilised him at all. Same can be said about the assassin Bullseye, with Farrell having a target etched onto his forehead in case we forgot who he was playing, who \"never misses\". The cruel irony is, that he missed atleast fifty seven times. Should've been called the \"Inaccurate Irishman\". Anyway, he's in it for no apparent reason, but Farrell did good with his cocaine fuelled acting.\n\nBut we're not done yet. Oh no. Half of the film focused on a blossoming romance between Matt and Elektra \"Nachos\", because she wanted guacamole instead of salsa dip if you catch my cold. Yet despite Matt thinking \"hey, I am nacho boyfriend\", his resistance proved futile. And so, as soon as they meet, they battle it out whilst precariously balancing on some seesaws in front of some kids in public. Oh, super basic choreography by the way, was slower than my nan (she can't walk sooo...). But before any of this excitement ensues, Johnson tackles the origin story of Daredevil in the most uninspired fashion by simply doing nothing with it. All of this is just the narrative, I haven't even touched upon the court ruling with Coolio that apparently is exclusively available in the Director's Cut. So much stuff, yet no actual substance. Amazing, really.\n\nThe action set pieces are plagued with Dutch angles, flashing lighting that will induce epileptics into seizure mode and grungy aesthetics to capitalise on Miller's style. The soundtrack though, oh God the soundtrack! Who knew that playing Evanescence's 'My Immortal' at a funeral would evoke my nostalgic emo phase. And then 'Bring Me To Life' during a training montage? I can't. It's too much.\n\nAs an album, Daredevil rocks. As a film, it's both blind and deaf. That's narratively blind and emotionally tone deaf. The film wouldn't end and all I wanted was a bowl of nachos whilst I fall asleep watching this snooze-fest."

        "review_detailed_main": "Daredevil (2003) Director's Cut is very underrated American Action superhero flick. I did saw the theatrical cut in in 2004/2005 and I loved it. I don't care if this film is terrible, for me it is good I love it. I think Ben Affleck did a perfect job at acting as Matt Murdock/Daredevil! This is always been my favorite superhero flick out there and it still is. Jennifer Garner as Elektra did a terrific job as the female hero and she was pretty good. Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin did all great on their performances on their characters. I love this film and I don't care how underrated it is I love it.\n\nI am defending this film and I don't think is awful , bad or terrible it is great. It is kind of Entertaining and it is still a good film. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Okay, it isn't a classic like are The Dark Knight Trilogy or other Marvel highly rated films. It is still a good, both of the versions are good but I just prefer the Director's Cut because the film explains much more than the theatrical cut douse and ends with a cliffhanger. Daredevil features another hero without super strength, just the ability to use what he has to maximum potential, making him a more accessible hero to the masses.\n\nBen Affleck (Pearl Harbor) portrays Matt Murdock, a man blinded since childhood after accidental exposure to hazardous materials. By day, Murdock is an honest attorney from Hell's Kitchen, New York. By night, he is Daredevil, a superhero relying on an incredibly attuned sense of hearing (a \"radar sense,\" as he calls it) to fight criminals. Following the death of his father, Matt vows revenge on The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, The Scorpion King), who teams with the villainous Bullseye (Collin Farrell, Phone Booth) in a move against Daredevil, Matt must not only fight two super-criminals, but deal with a burgeoning relationship with the mysterious -- and deadly -- Elektra (Jennifer Garner, Juno).\n\nThe director's cut is way better than the theatrical version. There is more storyline to this version, more action, more humor! In this version there is an added storyline which makes the movie way easier to understand, it ties together loose strings in the movie. This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like about this version is that they take out the confession scene in the beginning of the movie. I recommend it to any superhero fan out their. It is rated R. Mostly for more action/violence. Without question, THIS is the one that should have been released in theaters, not the other version. Underrated of the marvel comic movies For Daredevil, justice is blind, and for the guilty, there's hell to pay!\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Garner ignite dangerous sparks and nonstop thrills in this dazzling action-adventure about the newest breed of superhero. By day, blind attorney Matt Murdock (Affleck) toils for justice in Hell's Kitchen. By night, he's Daredevil, The Man Without Fear - a powerful, masked vigilante stalking the dark streets with an uncanny \"radar sense\" that allows him to \"see\" with superhuman capabilities. But when the love of his life, fiery Elektra Natchios (Garner), is targeted by New York City's ruthless Kingpin of crime (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his deadly assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrell), Daredevil may be about to meet his match Daredevil is a 2003 American superhero film written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the film stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who fights for justice in the courtroom and out of the courtroom as the masked vigilante Daredevil. Jennifer Garner plays his love interest Elektra Natchios; Colin Farrell plays the merciless assassin Bullseye; David Keith plays Jack \"The Devil\" Murdock, a washed up fighter who is Matt's father; and Michael Clarke Duncan plays Wilson Fisk, also known as the crime lord Kingpin.\n\nWhy I love this film? Because Ben Affleck is one of my favorite actors and I just love what he does in this film. There's the right balance of action romance. There has been criticism about Ben Affleck acting. In his defense , Ben and Jennifer do have chemistry that works and goes somewhere.You can see he is taken with her. Even Ben and Jon Favreau friendship works for their characters Matt/Daredevil and Foggy. They are genuinely funny. I love this film. The rating I am giving is 7 because the film wasn't that good, but it wasn't that bad either.\n\n7/10 Score: B Studio: Marvel Enterprises, New Regency Pictures, Horseshoe Bay Productions Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, J.K.

Collin Ferrell is actually B-A-D as the bad guy Bullseye. He's just plain terrible!!! And his special ability is...he can throw things really fast?! L-A-M-E!!! Jennifer Garner's Electra is not much more than a token love interest. Apparently, she is a superhero...but do they ever tell the audience that in the film? Nope. She's just this normal girl who apparently can leap 150 feet from building-to-building. There's literally no explanation for why she can do this. The plot is thin and sometimes incoherent while a lot of the dialogue is hokey. The action tries to rip off THE MATRIX at every turn with it's own take on bullet-time. Some of the special effects are bad as can be while Ben Affleck is at his Ben Affleckiest throughout the film's entirity.\n\nIn fact, the only good things I can say about the film are #1) a quick cameo by Stan Lee early on and #2) a rain-soaked scene between Garner and Affleck where he explains how and why he loves the rain. You'll understand that too when you see the film (even though YOU SHOULDN'T!!!) It's quite a beautiful little moment.\n\nOther than that DAREDEVIL is a travesty to the superhero movie. Guess I'm looking forward to X-MEN 2 more than I thought I would.Sorry, True Believers. Instead of DD...it's more like D-U-D."

By not depending on special effects and relying on something as basic as the plot, we have something exceptional in entertainment cinema. The cast is well chosen and even the black Kingpin is not out of tune. Ben Affleck, despite having been Batman, is in this character where he is most comfortable and his romantic interest (Elektra) is well characterized. To the extent that one wants to find a good story well told, this film is an excellent option. It is one of the best Marvel movies of the time when making garbage was frowned upon."

The theatrical cut is worth seeing maybe once if you just want a so bad it's good kind of movie, but doesn't have much else foing for it. The director's cut, while still not exactly good, does have a more competent story and is noticeably better as a result. Depending on your taste and your tolerances for the cartoonish aspects of the film, I'd say the director's cut may almost be worthy of a rewatch. But just one. Almost. Maybe. Check it out and see what you think. It gets more hate than it deserves. If you go in with an open mind and no expectations you may find you enjoy it for what it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "This review is for the Director's cut DVD of Daredevil. In all honesty, i liked the theatrical version of this movie. But now that i have seen the true version of this movie, the director's cut, i don't have any desire to watch the theatrical cut ever again. The director's cut is an improvement in every way. Everything makes sense now, and the characters are more fleshed out, which is a very good thing.\n\nThe DC is 30 minutes longer than the original cut, of which the new footage ranges from a whole new big subplot, and little things, that actually have more impact and and make the movie more understandable and better than you might imagine. The action scenes are way better also. The DC makes the movie into what it should've been in the first place before the studio screwed with it. I can't believe how much the studio hacked this movie up for theater..it is quite ridiculous. But now with the movie restored to it's original vision, i can fully enjoy it without the thought of something missing from it. In comparison, the only thing that the original DVD release has over this new DC DVD is it has a second bonus features/behind the scenes disc.\n\nThe DC DVD is one disc, and has a few movie trailers, a making-of featurette, and an all new audio commentary. Despite it's shortcomings in form of a second disc compared to it's counterpart, i'd choose the DC over the theatrical version any day. The DC is simply so much better. Forget what you know about the theatrical cut of the movie, and give this new DC version a chance..it is superior to the other version in every way. So give it a try, and i think you might be pleasantly surprised. Even those of you who hate the original cut.\n\nMy vote, in comparison: Theatrical version- 5.5 Director's cut version- 9.5\n\nIn closing, i'd like to thank the Director, the film editors, and everyone else who made this wonderful Director's cut DVD possible. I love the new version, and it's nice to see the Director's vision restored to this movie after nearly 1 1/2 years. Two thumbs up! R.I.P. Daredevil theatrical version!!"

HOWEVER, the characters of bullseye and kingpin, who are the two villains of the movie feel rushed and I just wished we could have got more of them, especially because Micheal Clarke Duncan's portrayal of kingpin is SO good. Collin Farrel's bullseye is extremely silly and probably the goofiest character in the movie.\n\nOne thing this movie does get right however, is the 18+ age rating, the movie is not quite on the Deadpool level of gory but I think its certainly enough for Daredevil\n\nSummary: it could have been a great movie but it is dragged down by upbeat pop music and bad choreography. If you want daredevil I recommend the netflix series staring Charlie Cox. Also Daredevil feels like batman instead of Daredevil. Overall it's a fun watch and I would check it out."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film, and again I use that term loosely, opens explaining how Mat Murdock, aka The Daredevil, lived as a boy. His father, having been a prize fighter in his day, has fallen from his prestige and turned to being a mafia bully (no, it's not Rocky Balboa.) During a bully session of his own, young Mat has been told that his father is nothing but a leg breaker and he just doesn't want to believe it. When Mat just happens to be wandering home and stumbles onto his father during one of the aforementioned leg breaking sessions, he gets angry and runs away. Skateboarding through an industrial park, Mat almost gets impaled by a forklift that barely misses him only to tear open a toxic waste drum and coats Mat with the contents. Blinded by the waste, young Mat looses his sight, only to develop heightening his other 4 senses.\n\nThis, by the way, is where the movie goes wrong.\n\nYou know what, apparently loosing your eyesight allows you to jump hundreds of feet from building to building. And also allows you to spin around from a fan in a nightclub. Please. Not to mention the fact that we never see the development of `The Daredevil.' The movie does show 4 or 5 different stages of Mat's life as he grows, but never showing us why he decides to become a crime fighter. I hated Spiderman, but one thing I did like about it was how they showed us how, and why, he developed into the webbed one. They showed the development of his suit, funny scene it was too. But The Daredevil just....is. We last see Mat learning to slide down poles and do `magical, superhero things,' but we never see him develop his suit. We only discover later that his father's fighting name was The Devil, and he wore red trunks, explaining the Daredevil name and suit color. And what's with the way he sleeps. I had to reach deep down and think about it, only to assume he sleeps in a water filled sound poof tub to help drown out the outside sounds his hearing picks up, I assume I'm right about that one.\n\nBy the way, what's with Ben Affleck's hair? I guess a blind guy wouldn't have the best hair cut, but he does have friends you know. You'd think one of them would buy him a brush or something.\n\nPlease someone tell me what's so hot about Jennifer Garner!?! Am I missing something? Everyone's just so excited because the art director decided to put little \u0091ol B-cup Jennifer into a push up bra to make her breasts look bigger. Of course Alias herself looked decent in her fighting scenes, but lacks any real acting skills. Not even the awesome power of Michael Clarke Duncan could save this one. He was good but not great, and couldn't save this sinking ship.\n\nNow Colin Farrel, on the other hand. He is cool! The roll of Bullseye was great for him. I really think this guy is going places in film, hopefully as 007.\n\nI would have liked to see more of the creation of The Daredevil himself, as well as more of Bullseye. Also, this movie could have spent a little more time in the editing booth. There are many a scene where the cables holding the actors, and spinning the actors can be seen, as well as a few instances where dialog was heard, but no actors mouths are moving.\n\nSo ends another review of a lackluster movie. In a year producing such great films as T3, the Matrix sequels, and of course the final installment of The Lord of the Rings, Daredevil will truly be forgotten, and hopefully die on the operating table to keep from spawning sequels."

As a matter of fact, the dialogue is outright painful, especially when delivered by Ben Affleck who is obviously miscast in the role of the Man Without Fear. Not even the otherwise talented Colin Farrell gets a pass with this script. What is most surprising with \"Daredevil\" however is how dull it is. The least you can expect from a superhero movie is some entertaining action, but in this film it's equally absent to those with visual perception as for those without."

I've seen more holes in swiss cheese: the plot is so bad.\n\nThe heavy metal sound track and the obvious product placements either detract or just simply annoy.\n\nAlso, the comic book characters were human, with all the skills and weaknesses that go with it. In the film, they're practically superhuman.\n\nThis is a bad film and i'm not holding my breath for the inevitable sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, i was never a reader of the comics, and didn't know much about daredevil before venturing into the cinemas to see the original when it was released. At the time, there wasn't much action out and i like most of Ben Affleck's movies, so though i would give it a go. Although i liked the theatrical release ( but didn't love it) i still bought it when it came to DVD...and to be honest, when i watched it the 2nd time on DVD, i didn't think as much of it, as when i left the cinema.\n\nSo when i heard the directors cut was out, and people who hated the first release, but liked the 2nd one, i thought wow, i didn't mind the first, perhaps i will really like the new version. and guess what? I did ! Its absolutely fantastic. After the characters were fleshed out more, the storyline was more involved and filled in the plots- you actually cared about what happened and got more into the feel of being apart of what was going on in hell's kitchen.\n\nIf you watch the \"featurette\" : giving the devil his dues, you will understand that Mark Johnson the director, absolutely loves this material, loved the comic, and was disappointed himself with the theatrical release. He understood why the critics & fans alike didn't support it, and really wanted to fix the problems with this DVD. When will Hollywood studios & executives learn, a 100 minute movie, does not mean a better movie - and when will they learn that audiences DO want more than just action - we can think, you morons! And can hold our attention for more than 100 minutes. Here's a simple plan for your money making schemes - and this goes to Gary Foster ( producer who still says the theatrical version of daredevil is better) If you make a GOOD MOVIE, that gets good reviews, and that fans & critics enjoy, then more people will see it, more people will see it a 2nd time, more people will recommend it to friends, and that means a bigger audience, a repeat audience and bigger dollars for your pockets ! So while the first was a quick paced movie that made quick bucks, a longer - more thought-out MOVIE, would have garnered longer life at the box office.\n\nin a word - RECOMMENDED !"

        "review_detailed_main": "This well-cast movie packs a lot of story into one film. I remember growing up that Daredevil was always different than other comics after all what other hero was sightless? Also, the artwork of Gene Colon was much more like the artwork of the Dark Knight versions of Batman that come out in the mid-80's. The movie had the same feel. It was a heck of a lot better than the Val Kilmer/George Clooney Batman films but nowhere near the Spiderman movie.\n\nAs in the comic, Matt Murdock grew up in Hell's Kitchen in lower Manhattan. His father was a fighter that went against a mob boss and decided not to throw a fight. He winds up murdered as a result. Matt is involved in a street accident where some radioactive waste gets in his eyes, removing his sight highly enhancing his other senses.\n\nMatt graduates law school and becomes a Legal-aid lawyer for the people of the neighborhood with his pal Foggy Nelson. The neighborhood crime is being controlled by a powerful mob boss nicknamed, The Kingpin. Matt, using his enhanced abilities trains himself to become a masked vigilante named Daredevil who tries to thwart the Kingpin's activities (the Kingpin was behind Matt's father's murder).\n\nWith his business seriously wounded, Kingpin employs a hired assassin called Bullseye. Bullseye can make a weapon out of any object by throwing it with pinpoint accuracy at his intended victim.\n\nMatt meanwhile meets a Greek heiress named Electra. The two begin dating. During a business squabble the Kingpin has Bullseye kill Electra's father, causing her to become a vigilante herself set on getting revenge.\n\nThere is one corny scene where Matt and Electra mix it up in a battle in a children's playground. It looked like the director wanted to just throw in a scene from The Matrix.\n\nI don't want to give too much more of the film away, but if you had followed the storyline in the comics you probably know how the film will turn out. I know I highly enjoyed this film. Colin Farrell is phenomenal as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner looks hot as Electra. The actor who plays Kingpin has been in a lot of movies lately and he had to gain weight to play a convincing Kingpin, which he does well. The movie will probably not appear to smaller children because of the blood and violence but anyone that liked The Matrix films should really like this one! It is one of the films that is better to own than rent because you can watch it over and over."

The logical fallacies of this movie exceeded Double Jeopardy, and that is saying something. Poor Jennifer Garner is a better action actress than to have to be imported into blockbuster (which is different from straight to Blockbuster, which this should have been) simply to provide some kind of sex appeal. I will admit that my friends and I laughed harder during Daredevil than in any movie we have seen in recent memory."

        "review_title": "A quite underrated Marvel Comics adaptation",
        "review_detailed_main": "Following the success of X-Men and Spider-Man, Daredevil was treated like the \"black sheep\" of the celluloid versions of Stan Lee's comic-books. Much of that criticism was unfair (Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider are less accomplished, in my opinion), and Mark Steven Johnson's treatment of Marvel's blind hero is more than worthy of a re-evaluation.\n\nThe character himself is already quite unique in the comic-book universe: unlike others, Matt Murdock was brought up in a pretty violent neighborhood, living alone with his dad, an unemployed boxer. Subsequently, he lost his sight permanently after being exposed to toxic substances, although those same substances enhanced his other four senses at the same time, giving him a sort of \"radar\". In pure superhero tradition, the first twenty minutes of the movie show the protagonist getting acquainted with his new abilities, which he will need to use well once his old man gets killed for refusing to cooperate with gangsters.\n\nAt this point, we're introduced to the real story, focusing on the double life of Murdock (Ben Affleck): lawyer by day (giving a whole new meaning to the phrase \"justice is blind\"), vigilante by night. Between these two activities, he finds time to chat and make jokes with his partner, Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson (Jon Favreau), and also to get \"friendly\" with the intriguing, and lethal, Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), whose father is an associate of Wilson Fisk, aka the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), the unofficial crime lord of the city. Also worth mentioning is Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano), the only reporter around who thinks there's some truth to the urban legends surrounding a certain \"Daredevil\". Oh, and let's not forget Bullseye (Colin Farrell), Kingpin's henchman, known for never missing his target.\n\nMost of these characters were used prominently in Frank Miller's Daredevil cycle (some of his most memorable images are recreated shot-for-shot, \u00e0 la Sin City), and the movie deserves praise for retaining the dark mood of the comic-book, instead of attempting a lighter approach (anyone who has seen Joel Schumacher's Batman films knows how that usually ends), which could have ruined the characters. In fact, the main protest from critics and viewers was regarding a bunch of scenes whose tone didn't fit into the picture. Now, I didn't have any major problems with a Matt/Elektra love scene, which was quite well executed (although it does look like a Spider-Man rip-off), whereas the infamous confession booth sequence did bother me as it felt out of place given the character involved. Anyway, those two scenes were removed in the Director's Cut; the most ridiculous bit, however, wasn't: I'm talking about an overblown scene featuring the two protagonists, a playground and lots of kicking. That sequence just doesn't work for two reasons: a) it makes the hero look puerile, and that's the last characteristic you associate with Daredevil; b) why would a blind man do a Matrix impression in front of a group of kids? How's that for protecting your secret identity, huh?\n\nGenerally, though, the film works admirably, thanks to Johnson's respect for the source material and the layered, believable performances: Affleck, a long-time fan of the comic-book, convinces both as the blind attorney (well, except for the playground scene) and his alter ego; Garner manages to make Elektra's transformation from innocent girl to assassin fairly (considering the context) realistic; as for the supporting players, Favreau nails Foggy's comedic energy at once, while Farrell and, especially, the towering Duncan inhabit their characters with so much ease audiences shouldn't care about the fact that they look different in the comics.\n\nSure, this isn't Spider-Man or X-Men, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Daredevil may not be to everyone's taste (it is, after all, based on one of Marvel's more adult comic-books), but it remains an interesting, totally watchable blockbuster."

        "review_title": "A \"marvelous\" comic book film... and the Director's Cut makes it even better",
        "review_detailed_main": "After the utter failure of the fourth Batman film, at the hands of the effective, if not awfully talented, director Joel Schumacher, Hollywood took a break from the sub-genre of superhero movies. The last two films of that franchise had been too silly and \"comical\" for the fans, and... well, yeah, too silly for everyone else, as well. When Bryan Singer made X-Men in 2000, all of us fans rejoiced... a new chance for our favorite characters to be treated to the time they deserve on the silver screen. Two years later, Sam Raimi released Spider-Man... personally, I did not care for that movie(as my scathing review of said film reveals immediately), and this film was subsequently widely overlooked. People claimed this to be a rip-off and an inferior film. I disagree. There may be similarities, but I found this to be the better film. This didn't feel glossy or flashy... this felt serious, real. This is a superhero who gets hurt, who doesn't always win. I haven't read too many of the Daredevil comic books, but from what I can tell, this film is fairly accurate. Sure, they changed back-story... but some artistic license is necessary to make it work(and yes, I realize that I complain about this very aspect of Spiderman in that review); Catwoman has, after all, yet to be depicted as a cat burglar. The key elements are present herein, as best as I can tell. The choice of villains is rather good, I think, as well as the other characters. The special effects are great(with a couple of evident exceptions), with almost perfectly smooth CGI that blends well with the live action elements. The action is nicely choreographed, filmed and edited, and the film is definitely intense when it needs to be. There is style to it(sometimes a little too much), and the editing is rather good throughout. The writing varies, but much of it is clever and just about all of it works. The casting is mostly spot-on; Garner has the femininity coupled with the ability to pull off cool action moves believably(the latter presumably partially gathered during her time on Alias), Duncan has the stature and the presence(as for him being black... how many white actors has a matching physique *and* those acting capabilities?), Farell comes off as the psychopath that he should, and Pantoliano has the determination to be Urich. Affleck may not have been the best choice for the title role... he simply does not seem to be a terribly credible action star, as my fianc\u00e9e also pointed out after having watched Paycheck. However, he does fit quite well as Matt Murdock. Favreau is a good Foggy, if different from the comics(still providing comic relief... pun intended, courtesy of my fianc\u00e9e), and he plays off Affleck pretty well. Garner and Affleck have playful chemistry together on-screen. The acting ranges, but is mostly very good. The pacing is nearly perfect, especially in the DC. In fact, just about everything about the film is improved upon in it, and I urge anyone who enjoys the theatrical to get it(though do note that it is rated R... for anyone bothered by the added language, sexuality(what little there is) and violence)... and anyone who thought it could have been better after watching the original version to give it another chance. Coolio, added in this, also does well, and has funny moments(just as Favreau, Affleck and Garner). The tone is darker than other superhero/comic book films(The Punisher being the exception to that rule), and it fits. All in all, a comic book/superhero flick of very high(though not perfect) quality. The DVD holds a featurette about the changes, which isn't bad at all, and a commentary track with Avi Arad and Mark Steven Johnson, that is definitely worth listening to, informational and entertaining(be aware that it's relatively... unrestrained in the use of cussing, for at least a handful or so of occasions). I recommend this to any fan of superheroes, movies about them and/or the source material. 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I've just finished watching the Netflix mini-series \"Marvel's Daredevil\" and would like to take the time to compare it with the 2003 feature length movie. The first thing I noticed is that the focus of these two efforts are considerably different in their artistic intentions. The movie, in my opinion, is essentially centered around the portrayal of the costumed hero and his motives and powers. As a result the drama and character back story are conveyed in a by the numbers fashion. With only two hours of run time I totally understand why. Most effective is the depiction of the blind hero on his midnight forays into the heart of Hell's Kitchen. The way he takes in the \"sights\" of the city via it's menagerie of sounds. He knows it's landscape and where it's criminal element resides. We are treated to one of the most insightful depictions of an extra-sensory ability ever placed on screen when Daredevil's radar sense is brought to life in the bar brawl and subsequent subway scene. It is here that the movie sets itself apart from the series with big budget effects, costumes and choreography. I like this movie. Michael Clarke Duncan is perfectly cast as the Kingpin even though he has relatively little to do but look suave and imposing for most of the movie. The final battle scene between he and Daredevil is explosive. The weakest aspect of this movie by far is the character of Bullseye an his portrayal by Colin Firth. He is annoyingly clich\u00e9' in his character's mannerism. Jennifer Garner is passable as Elektra although she is not as vicious as in the comics. There are times that this movie suffers from being too lighthearted and others that are melodramatic. Conversely, I did enjoy the nuanced performance of Ben Affleck and the actor that played Foggy Nelson. The series, on the other hand, is focused much more directly on the personal side of our hero and his alter ego and what makes him tick. His day to day interactions with people in general and their tendency to disappoint or exceed expected stereotypes. The organized criminal aspect of Hell's Kitchen is vividly brought to life here with nearly whole episodes devoted to the Syndicate and it's machinations. The Kingpin is nearly given as much Screen time as Daredevil himself and it nearly feels that his story is of equal importance to the creators of the show. It works. You will have a new respect for the events that push these two adversaries and their cohorts toward the series' climactic finale. Even the supporting characters are given tremendous depth here. I like this series. I can appreciate aspects of both the series and the movie. I recommend them both as they deliver different sides to the same story. Sort of like the gospels and their written accounts by respective authors about a common event. Some details corroborate others while others introduce omitted perspectives and observations. To get the total experience consume both efforts."

Ben Affleck has now perfected his most pathetic acting in his history of bad acting. I'm a straight girl, and even I recognize the only redeeming factor in this film is looking at Jennifer Garner. Just watch Alias. This is the worst comic book movie I have ever seen or heard of. Just the memory of Ben trying to convince himself as well as the audience \"I'm not the bad guy\" makes me shudder. If you throw your 7 bucks down a sewer it will be better spent. 0 stars, 0/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This might date this review a bit, but let me begin by saying that I am watching this film well before \"Batman vs. Superman\" is being released, and I don't know what all of the Ben Affleck hate is about. I know there's a new \"Daredevil\" show out on Netflix as well and it's sure to gather a lot of people dismissing that \"old movie\" as trash, but hey, just wait a moment. I've just finished the director's cut (which ads a full 30 minutes to the running time), and it does have some flaws but otherwise this is a solid 2000's superhero movie. I like it a lot and putting it in the same category as \"Ghost Rider\" or \"Fantastic Four\" is a grave mistake. I can't remember what the theatrical cut was like, but this version runs about 2hrs and 15 minutes so there are some significant changes.\n\nWhen Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) was a boy, he was blinded by a chemical spill. It wasn't a total loss though because his remaining senses where enhanced to superhuman level. As an adult, he uses his sonar-like hearing to walk around as if he could really see, but he pretends to be just a regular blind guy. It's the perfect disguise for his superhero alter ego, Daredevil. When Matt and his legal partner \"Foggy\" (Jon Favreau, who like Chris Evans also went on to star in some of the best Marvel films) take on a case, it all seems to point towards the ever-elusive, legendary, Kingpin of Crime (Michael Clarke Duncan). Daredevil works his way up the ladder, encountering the crackshot assassin Bullseye (Collin Farrell) and a lovely lady named Elektra (Jennifer Garner).\n\nWhat I like about this movie is that it spends ample time showing you that Matt Murdock is a tortured man, the kind of guy you can believe would wear a costume and spend his nights beating the living snot out of criminals. He's emotionally distant, has a lot of guilt about what he does, second guesses himself and is very angry on the inside. He's a lawyer that encounters the worst people imaginable every day and he's fed up with seeing the ones who have the right connections or enough muscle to intimidate witnesses worm their way out of an appropriate sentence. What I liked even more was that you can also see that there are moments where he is a nice guy and he isn't always moping around complaining about that one person he couldn't save. He tells jokes, he flirts with women and has friends. You get to see him as a regular guy that takes advantage of his powers but also feels the burden of them. One of my favorite scenes happens just as he's about to call it a night after getting into a vicious fight with a dozen thugs. He is about to lie down when he hears the screams of a woman being murdered. He perks up a bit, then looks discouraged. He knows there's nothing he can do, and if he went out in the exhausted state that he is, he would only get himself killed. It's a difficult thing to do, but he must go to bed and try to let it slide, for now. That scene, with the clever detail that the man sleeps in a sense deprivation tank in order to get some peace and quiet really impressed me. That single moment speaks volumes about the character and that's a sign that this is a legitimately good movie, one that's been unjustly dismissed.\n\nWhen it comes to the supporting characters there's a lot to like. First up our main villain, Bullseye. What I like about this guy is that they make him delightfully evil. He's a sociopath that kills people in increasingly difficult ways... because it's a way for him to get his jollies. He doesn't use guns. Those are for your run-of-the-mill assassins. This guy's weapons of choice will make you look at pencils, toothpicks and office supplies in a totally different way. I also enjoyed the fact that he's given a real character. He's full of himself and very proud of his skills, to a fault. He also appears to suffer from some sort of OCD because he's always being overly theatrical and boastful, but in a way that's believable (unlike say, Two-Face from \"Batman Forever\"). I liked seeing Jennifer Garner as Elektra. There's real chemistry between her and Murdock and she's not just some damsel in distress that needs to be rescued during the climax. She's got a lot of different facets to her personality. The last guy I want to talk about is Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin. I know traditionally he's a really fat white guy but I actually like him better here than anywhere else. This Wilson Fisk is a powerful presence. He's scary, but not in an obvious way that would have every single person in New York screaming \"that's the bad guy! Right there!\" Only two things really bother about this movie. There isn't enough action because there are so many moments where the characters and their relationships are explored and like most of the 2000's superhero films, many scenes contain dated CGI that makes you wish they were using practical effects, or just had more realistic battles that could actually have been done with the actors. The other is that the film is just a tad too long. I can forgive both because it really is an entertaining film filled with interesting characters and complex relationships, but it's worth noting.\n\nIf you think that \"Daredevil\" is a bad movie, you just need to revisit it by watching the Director's Cut. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the drama and how well developed all of the characters are. It captures the spirit of the dark Marvel comic books that made this guy a favorite in the first place. (On Blu-ray, March 26, 2015)"

Cox is so vulnerable yet gifted and becomes a fully developed human - not a toy hero doll. I don't think Affleck should do superheroes. If anyone is reading this review, go watch the daredevil Netflix series which is truly phenomenal. Deep, emotional as well as physical (incredible stunt work), and superb acting."

Ben Affleck (\"Matt Murdock\") is the eponymous super-hero who is blinded by an accident with some toxic waste but as a result, has acute hearing and sensitivity to movement. He spends his days as a lawyer, his nights \u00e0-la \"Spiderman\" as a bit of a vigilante trying keep the streets of New York's infamous \"Hell's Kitchen\" clear of criminals. Lately, his sights have become firmly set on the \"Kingpin\" (Colin Farrell) - the biggest baddie of them all, but a man whom the courts cannot incarcerate. His masked mission now becomes to bring this man to justice. This is a quickly paced, and colourful extravaganza - plenty of action, the visual effects are good and a premiss just a little different. The dialogue is pretty banal, Farrell is dreadful - a ham if I ever I saw one, and the action scenes are just a little bit too repetitive and dull after a while. Affleck brings little charisma to the screen and the romance with Jennifer Garner (\"Electric Nachos\" - or something similar) was gloopy and dragged the pace down all too often before an ending that, well - is just daft. It's harmless fun but I don't think I would bother watching it again."

I don't know how this movie got made.\n\nOkay, so the ideas behind the special effects were cool sometimes, but overall they were awful. Amateur, not remotely believable...if I dwell on it I'm going to barf.\n\nThe acting wasn't too bad, surprisingly. Ben Affleck has talent, but he must've left most of it at home. He played the role perfectly. Which is not a complement, seeing as the character was way too underdeveloped, even with a 15 minute flashback of his youth. Come to think of it, the kid who played young Matt Murdock was the highlight of the movie. He really did it well. I love Jennifer Garner as a person, I really do. She's a sweet young lady, but her acting skills aren't too great. She pulled off Elektra, but that's not a great feat. Colin Farrell was also a highlight for the first half, I liked his character, even if it was the bad guy. He was intriguing. But at the end the intrigue of a villain fell away and he was just the bad guy. It was nice to see him in a different type of character, seeing as most of the time his looks are all he's got going for him. With his hair gone in this movie(I won't scar the word 'film' by calling it one) his acting skills were all he had, and it was okay. Joe Pantolino was of course good, even though his character, while not as badly written as the other, was badly written. I just want to know why he would deign to perform in such an awful movie.\n\nBut the story is really what made this movie so...bad. there's just no way around it. They forgot character development, development of the romance, and in the beginning of the movie, I wasn't sure who the villain was- the rapist or Daredevil. He wasn't a superhero, he was a murderer. Tsk tsk. Murder is a worse crime than rape, stupid! And of course, he learns his lesson and doesn't kill the one person he could have a reason to kill, but doesn't care about the others with smaller crimes who he killed. Everything in the movie, even the twists, were expected. And bad. There's just no way around it.\n\nActing- 2.5 stars Cinematography- 2.5 stars Story-1 star Laura's Picky rating- 1.5 stars Laura's Human rating- 2 stars"

I found myself irritated during some of the more dramatic scenes, such as the funeral or the love scenes.

        "review_detailed_main": "'Daredevil (2003)' has been called \"Early-2000s: The Movie\" and it's hard not to agree with that. Sad characters, dark cinematography, expository narration, in medias res, childhood flashbacks, almost constant rain, an instant romance, a fireside love-scene, CG body doubles, interpersonal tragedy, mistaken identity, an unsatisfactory but frequent sex life, fast-paced action, a high-rise apartment, daddy issues, a quirky henchman, a behind-the-scenes boss, dual identities, veiled threats, on-the-nose music, a poorly explained super-power, wonky physics, \"I'm not the bad guy\", a nosy reporter, the best-friend as comic-relief, the Catholic Church, tight leather, flashing lights, the hero jumping off a tall building only to catch themselves at the last moment and various other small, nonsensical efforts at seeming 'cool' make that assessment pretty much spot on. It's mad that the Catholic Church is a clich\u00e9 of early-2000s movies but here we are. This picture is almost like a twelve-year-old was tasked with creating a superhero film in the vein of 'Spider-Man (2002)' or 'X-Men (2000)' but they decided that they wanted to make it as 'dark', 'gritty' and, generally, just 'edgy' as they could because they'd recently seen 'The Crow (1994)'. Of course, it's not like this is an especially 'mature' piece. In fact, it's far from it. It does, however, have the feel of a faux-'adult' superhero story. It was clearly trying to aim older than its most recent peers, perhaps trying to hit the gap that 'Blade (1998)' and 'Blade II (2002)' left in the market. It's done so poorly that it seems it could only appeal to kids, though. It's stuffed to the brim with all the sickly studio mandates we're sadly now all so familiar with, which results in a narrative that's about as standard as they come. It's just all so obvious. It's all pretty aimless, too. The worst thing is that it's not terrible, as strange as it sounds. Instead, it's simply a coherent but inconsequential experience that does absolutely nothing for you. It neither entertains nor enrages, keeps engaged nor sends to sleep, makes laugh nor makes cringe; it simply exists, leaving you slack-jawed in utter boredom as it unravels. There are three saving graces: Jon Favereau, Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. While they don't necessarily improve the overall flick, you do come to appreciate them, as actors, just that bit more, since they all turn in more-than-decent performances in spite of the material. In the end, Marvel have certainly come a long way. 4/10"

One thing I really enjoyed was the additional time to developing the Kingpin and making him really seem like a bad guy helped a lot. All in all whoever made the call to cut all this stuff from the movie should be fired from the studio because the theatrical release was a butchery and a farce. I felt bad having to admit that I didn't like the movie too much at first, but now I can tell people how much it kicked a$$ (didn't know if curses were allowed)."

DD is like a cross between Spidey and Batman, and it outdoes them both on many levels.\n\nFor a start, let me tell you the fight scenes are far and away the best ever seen in a superhero movie. The acrobatic choreography far outdoes that of Spider-Man. And they are exciting as well - DD doesn't wipe out hordes of bad guys without getting touched himself. He gets hurt even when he wins.\n\nAs for the bad guys, the Kingpin and Bullseye have real menace, unlike the Green Goblin and most of Batman's onscreen enemies, and Elektra is the best comicbook femme fetale since Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. Not that she's really a bad guy. Ben Affleck as the titular hero is spot on for the comicbook character, he really is perfect. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, now Affleck as DD - Marvel is filling cinemas with great action heroes.\n\nSo how does it rank? Purely as a movie, it's not The Fellowship of the Ring (let's start saying that instead of Citizen Kane now, shall we?), but it's fantastic entertainment with genuine emotion and brains behind it. As a comicbook flick, it's below the first Batman and Superman movies (isn't everything?), but it's up there with X-Men, Spider-Man and The Crow.\n\nDD kicks ass, basically.

From the main characters to even characters ij subplot. Story, Screenplay were good. Action scenes were great in the beginning of movie but, it became CGI cartoon by the end of movie..That was the only negative in this movie.\n\nA perfect comic book movie in all sense.\n\nThe visualization of Daredevil's 'sonar vision' is something that would've given me goosebumps if I had watched it way back in 2003. There are somethings that should be seen,and somethings to be done while you are still a kid. The resulting awe and chills you experience is something beyond explanation, something you won't get when you are an adult. Thanks to the poor reviews, I missed this movie.Could've been another of my childhood favourite after Spiderman and Batman.\n\nThe Director's Cut shouldve been released without any change. Maybe this is when Marvel decided not to put their hands into editing and screenplay. Something Warners Bros haven't learnt yet."

He strikes a rhythm with his role and it, combined with the entertainment of a drama that feels real, makes the movie go at a nice pace. There is a real duality to all the characters. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. It gives a picture of a backwards society that diminishes reality, where culminating incidents brought by suffered individuals show the truth. 7/10."

The development of the characters it's pathetic ,and the character played by Jennifer Garner it's dumb and uninteresting.

        "review_detailed_main": "I may sound like a total douche-bag, but how any mature adult can think of Daredevil as a good movie is beyond me. Sure, all tastes are out there. In all honesty I'm willing to understand that some specific movies that I didn't particularly think much of are loved by others. The difference is that Daredevil is in a whole different league of bad.\n\nThe main problem I have with Daredevil is the style. The cheesiness. It's like Ang Lee's Hulk, which coincidently came out the same year in 2003. These two films are to me the heirs of such cheesefests like 1997 Batman & Robin. Daredevil is an example of how not to make a superhero film, while movies like Nolan's Batman series, or Ironman, stand as opposite examples of how to go about this admittedly extremely difficult genre. Actually, I feel the Batman character is much more difficult to render on screen than Daredevil, who is more naturally cool (because less eccentric but still naturally \"dark\"), so kudos to Nolan and Burton for their achievements.\n\nAnother criticism for Daredevil is that it drags on too much. It takes 40 minutes into the film for Matt Murdock/Daredevil to meet Elektra, which is arguably the moment when the movie actually starts and stops feeling like an origin-story flashback. I'm not against long character development, but Daredevil's first 40 minutes of nothingness were not compelling to me. They were enough to draw my attention, not my interest.\n\nAnd when the movie actually starts, 40 minutes in, Matt Murdock/Daredevil flirts with Elektra by fighting her, which is probably one of the most ridiculous moments in modern cinema. Only after that are we truly introduced to the bad guys and the cheesiness of the film skyrockets. I actually had cramps in my eye sockets for rolling my eyes so much.\n\nAnyway, Daredevil belongs in the temple of failed superhero movies, with Batman & Robin, Ang Lee's Hulk, The Fantastic Four, and of course Daredevil's spin-off Elektra."

Unbelievable characters, overthetop action but so dark, you can't see a friggin' thing. And for the record, I don't hate Ben Affleck. I even think he did fairly good jobs in his prior movies. Anyway, the story was plainly bad and there were scenes that assume that you have no brain.

But when I saw that there was a better version in the director's cut, I had to see for myself. Daredevil happens to be a dark, brooding film that came out at a time when superhero movies were all light and fluffy. I liked that because it led to the rise of the dark Christopher Nolan Batman films. This film has some cool villains, a blind superhero with good intentions, and even some wit.\n\nMark Steven Johnson's film is about Matt Murdock who is a blind lawyer fighting for those who are innocent. After a horrid past, he becomes Daredevil at night to fight for the innocent. He targets the Kingpin because of some personal history.\n\nThe acting is pretty good. Ben Affleck did quite well as Matt and shows he can hold a superhero film. Jennifer Garner does very well as Elektra. Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan make an imposing nemesis duo for Daredevil. Jon Favreau adds some delightful comedy that is needed for such a dark picture.\n\nOverall, the director's cut is a great superhero film and I'm sure is way better than the original theatrical release. I enjoyed the action, the fight scenes, and just the movie itself. It led the way for bigger and better things. I rate this film 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay. Where does one begin with this one...Let's just say that by the end of the movie, the Daredevil character lacked character (and wasn't likeable, really), and I wanted my money back.\n\nI was restless in my seat for an hour and a half, hoping that Elecktra (played with too much restraint by the talented Jennifer Garner) or Bullseye (played by one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, Colin Farrell), would annihilate this lifeless, pathetic Daredevil (deemed a superhero either by the fictitious characters in the movie or by the Hollywood marketing gurus)--It's difficult to know, really.\n\nThe story is so flawed and Ben Affleck so bland yet overwrought at times, that in the end you really don't care about him or the what happens next in the narrative. Why? Because the script lacks emotion, credibility, and character development, especially concerning Daredevil. What exactly makes Daredevil a superhero? Had Affeck researched the role a little, perhaps he might have been a believable do-gooder lawyer, Matt Murdock, defending the helpless in Hell's Kitchen, while his remarkable OTHER senses guide him without harm to his desired destination. But instead we get a cocky blind man arrogantly tapping his special cane along route, while wearing an inexplicable smirk on his face. And when it's time for Matt Murdock to serve justice, we get Daredevil, the whining, victimized and defeated caped-crusader of sorts. I'd rather fight my own fight on the street and lose without the appearance of a sulking straggler in a red cape and fake muscles assuring my safety. Daredevil deserved to have his butt kicked. Where was the emotional conflict, the deprecating sense of humor that we find so compelling in Batman? Where was the dignity...\n\nMoreover, the dialogue was painful to hear. I will cut some slack for Affleck's poor performance because the script required the actors to spew such redolent, trite, and ridiculous expressions. But then there's Colin Farrell's performance. He was able to develop his character in less than a minute. Perhaps Bill Everett and Brian Helgeland, the scriptwriters, felt more connected to Bullseye's character, hence, original dialogue somehow emerged. Nevertherless, Farrell made it work.\n\nFurthermore, I was disappointed that the special-effects did nothing to enhance the story. And when Affleck twirls into action, his motions are digitized to make him look as though he CAN fight...and we're talking basic street fighting, people...\n\nI didn't have much expectation going into this movie. But it was worse than I had imagined it would be. Please, don't make a sequel."

Even the subway station shown was correct geographically with the correct train nomenclature. The gaggle of New York-sounding actors also helped, including guys from \"The Sopranos.\" We see a real New York Post because Rupert Murdoch owns the paper and the movie studio.\n\nJennifer Garner of \"Alias\" makes stiff, expressionless Ben Affleck look better, though his spiky anime hair helps too. Especially in the rain, that is once again a means for sweet romantic scenes, here shown through sonar.\n\nColin Farrell is once again following Russell Crowe's footsteps, just as Crowe did a villain in \"Virtuousity,\" here literally chewing the scenery in his turn as \"Bullseye,\" (which I assume was rewritten from the comic books to let him be Irish).\n\nThe special effects are wham bang fun.\n\nThe soundtrack is coldly calculated to appeal to the movie's primary target audience of 14 year old boys, but manages to be entertaining, though not particularly creative in its loud selections.\n\nThe sound editing neatly reflects Dare Devil's heightened sense.\n\nThat this movie made PG-13 when so many foreign and indie movies don't is ridiculous as this is very violent.\n\nStay through the credits as there's a humorous follow-up scene stuck in.\n\n(originally written 2/17/2003)"

In a way, Matt Murdock almost reminds me of Dexter. But the movie fell apart when we were finally introduced to Colin Ferrell's Bullseye. As soon as he made his entrance on the screen, the viewer is bombarded with his endless mugging and facial twitches along with his pointless over-acting, so much to the point it took away from the rest of the movie and I just started making sarcastic cracks about him.\n\nThen I started thinking: has Colin Ferrell been in ANYTHING that was good? I scrolled through IMDb and he's been in mostly garbage. He's also responsible for destroying 2 beloved 80's films in remakes (Total Recall and Fright Night). The guy is literally the Kevorkian of movie material.\n\nIn a nutshell, I thought Daredevil was pretty good. The costume was AWESOME. Kingpin, for such a ruthless, huge guy, barely left his office (which I didn't get). It's a shame because the movie, tweaked just a LIIIIIIIIIITLE bit could have been really good!\n\nBut I'll say this: I'm not concerned with Ben Affleck as Batman anymore."

This excellent movie is completely underrated: the story of this Gothic and dark hero is very well presented, even for those viewers like me, who is not familiarized this character. The effects, showing how Daredevil 'sees' being blind are great. The heavy soundtrack is marvelous. The storyline and the characters are very well developed.

He's a street lawyer who takes only the cases for the underdog. And if justice isn't done, he metes it out as daredevil and sometimes that could mean just cold blooded assassination.\n\nThere are two villains in Daredevil, the 'kingpin of crime' Michael Clarke Duncan a long way from being the gentle giant John Coffey in The Green Mile. And there's Bullshot played by Colin Farrell who looks like he's having one great old time chewing the scenery to bite size bits.\n\nJennifer Garner is in Daredevil as Affleck's love interest who shows she has a few moves of her own.

        "review_detailed_main": "Back in the dark ages BT (Before Television), when kids walked ten miles uphill both ways to school there were limited entertainment options. One of the cheapest avenues of escape was the comic book: often crudely drawn, with simple storylines they provided a pleasant diversion without all that pesky reading. Their success continued on the small screen - who could forget the campy 60's Batman with its ubiquitous Biffs! and Kapows! - but their transition to the big screen was definitely hit or miss. While comic to screen films like Batman did boffo box office they spawned a legion of comic megabombs like Howard the Duck and The Punisher, and superheroes dropped off the studios' radar. It would take more than a decade for the quirky X-Men to rejuvenate the genre, and inspire A-list actors and directors to jump back on the bandwagon.\n\nWhen a freak accident robbed Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) of his sight it also enhanced his remaining senses and allowed him to `see' in a whole new way. A lawyer by trade, Murdock lives a dual life, defending the disadvantaged, and in the guise of DareDevil, meting out his own brand of justice for those thugs that live beyond the reach of the law. His solitary existence is shattered when he meets the beautiful Elektra a strong willed kindred spirit with a secret. Alas, hero bliss is usually short-lived.\n\nDaredevil is a unique character in the comic universe, as he possesses neither classical superpowers (he can't fly or change shape) nor is he a reclusive billionaire who can buy all kinds of really cool gadgets. He also doesn't fit in the everyman category as he belongs to a group that is classically considered disadvantaged. I believe it is these very distinctions that led to his tenure as a hero, because readers find it much easier to relate to his character. Luckily Daredevil won't be seeing this movie anytime soon.\n\nFleshing out a comic book character onscreen is a delicate balancing act between humor and drama - stray too far in either direction and what you're left with is parody .Ben Affleck often pegged as Hollywood's next big leading man, plays Murdock with soft-spoken amiability, providing a character that audiences will easily accept. If only he devoted the same attention to the character's alter ego. Every time Affleck dons the mask he slips into melodrama delivering his lines with such overblown self-importance and mock menace that they simply fall flat - several serious scenes spawned outbursts of laughter. The supporting cast offers equally mixed performances.\n\nJennifer Garner is disarming as the beautiful Elektra, simultaneously delicate and deadly. Garner demonstrates remarkable screen presence which begs the question why wasn't her character more thoroughly developed? If we knew a little more about Elektra it would have given some much needed balance to the story. Instead, Electra is essentially reduced to window dressing. Pity. This also extends to the big villain of the piece: in spite of his menacing physical presence, Michael Clarke Duncan is tepid as Kingpin, hampered both by poor writing and pedestrian delivery. Audiences are supposed to hate the bad guy. The most I could muster was apathy. Mercifully Colin Farrell rises to the challenge as Bullseye, the maniacal Irish hitman who can turn anything into a weapon. Farrell's over the top portrayal also helps to infuse the film with some intentionally humorous moments (his mini tantrum elicited ongoing laughter from those who could decipher his thick brogue).\n\nI could dwell at length on the noticeable plot gaps (like how is it that a blind orphan would develop preternatural acrobatic abilities and fighting skills with no training?), the dark setting, or the none too subtle ironies (Daredevil seeking refuge in a church), - but let's be honest, no one's going for the story. Thankfully there are several well choreographed fight sequences (courtesy of Cheung Yan Yuen of Matrix fame) to help distract the viewer from these piddling details. Although Affleck noticeably stumbles a few times, Garner's movements are virtually flawless, no doubt honed during her time on Alias. Nothing like a leather clad bombshell kicking butt to keep you mesmerized (works for me anyways). Mix in some above average (and sparingly used) fluid CGI for added eye candy, an energetic soundtrack, and a few comic creator cameos and you're left with a mediocre watchable popcorn flick. Just don't hold your breath for the sequel."

She plays her role beautifully. Magnificiently if I may say so. But her character was cut short and that was a bad move. No matter.

        "review_detailed_main": "I had seen the theatrical version of \"Daredevil\" a couple of months ago. I hated it. I thought it was dreadful and it was lacking in its story, characters and pace. The movie was incredibly weak and totally uninteresting to watch because it lacked substance. Still I decided to give the director's cut a chance. I'm glad I did, for the Director's cut is so much better to watch. The pace is better, the story makes more sense and the characters are more involving. The theatrical version was lame, the Director's cut is awesome!\n\nThe Director's cut takes its time to build up the story and its characters. The Director's cut is about 30 minutes longer than the original version and most of that time is spend on extended scene's with the characters. Suddenly because of that not only the characters but also the story became more understandable and interesting. Especially the villains became so much better. Colin Farrell as Bullseye gets more opportunity to show his coolness and his character became so much more cooler now. He also really seemed to be enjoying himself playing this villainous over-the-top role. Same goes for Michael Clarke Duncan. Main reason why his character didn't really worked in the original version was because his character had quite limited screen time. The only part of the movie in which he was prominent present was the ending. In the Director's cut he gets to show more evil and his character becomes so much more villainous. Also the Joe Pantoliano character no longer makes a pointless impression and he gets to play a way more important part in the movie. Same goes for the Leland Orser, Derrick O'Connor and Erick Avari characters. Because the movie takes its time to build up the characters suddenly everything in the movie just makes more sense and everything suddenly fits and feels right.\n\nBecause the story flows so much better I can now actually say that \"Daredevil\" is a really cool movie to watch. The action sequences also suddenly are way more exciting. They are nicely choreographed and edited together.\n\nSure, the movie still does have its flaws and it still is far from the best superhero comic-book movie ever made but its just the fact that the Director's cut is so incredibly much better than the original theatrical version that causes my sudden (late) enthusiasm for this movie.\n\nLets do the world a favor, lets all burn the theatrical versions and lets all embrace the Director's cut.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Ben Affleck was given No Quarter and was systematically Booed across the board, but Considering what Type of Film and Character that \"Daredevil\" is revealing, it Fits Quite Well.\n\nThis isn't a Bouncy and Comedic Superhero Movie, quite the Opposite, although Jon Favreau does His Best to Lighten the Mood a bit as Matt Murdock's Lawyer Partner.\n\nThe Film is full of Stylish, Foreboding Scenes at Night and in the Rain. It's 2003 CGI is put to some Good Use, but Admittedly some of the Stuff seems a bit Clunky or Dated Today, but Effective nonetheless.\n\nJennifer Garner Shows Up as Elektra and Enhances every Scene where She appears, as does the Psychopathic Portrayal of \"Bullseye\" by Colin Farrell that adds some Crazy Appeal. Michael Clarke Duncan as \"Kingpin\" Plays the hulking Crimelord and Menaces the Third Act.\n\nThis really is an Excellent Rendition of the Daredevil with the \"Director's Cut\" the Only \"Cut\" that's Recommended. There are Brutal Killings and some Bloody Action Scenes and it is all Done with a Neo-Noir Appeal.\n\nIt reinstates the Darkness and Gloom to another level where it Belongs and Fits the rest of the Movie that in the Theatrical Release Sacrificed the Edginess and went for the Safe PG-13 Rating. It isn't a Quantum Leap but a Needed Leap."

This is by far the lamest attempt to create a comic book movie I have ever seen, ( Even the 1994 bootleg version of the Fantastic Four was better!) This movie has shown me and many others how bad Ben Aflack's, ( forgive me if I spelt that wrong) acting can truly be. This movie consists of fast paced action scenes which are almost too fast paced, and are placed way to close together, and a plot that is almost as drawn out and sketchy as Rocky Horror Picture Show, (which is still better then this film).\n\nThis movie shows how unpractical these events can truly be, I mean take a look at the X-men movies, sure the thought of people gaining powers by advanced DNA structures is far-fetched, but it makes a hell of a lot of sense then just getting them, In the case of the Daredevil movie, apparently when you lose a loved one, You automatically gain superhuman abilities, demonstrated by the films short lived hero Elektra, (By the way I would not recommend that movie either.)After she loses her father, Who is killed by Bullseye, of coarse she wants her revenge, so with one nights training and an Evanesence CD, Daddy's little girl is now a one man army, and a killing machine. Out to get Daredevil who Elektra thinks killed her father, shes leaping tall buildings and dodging stray bullets, ( by the way this is all happening in a time span of about what appears to be three to four days.) \" Is there anything good about this movie?\" you ask, well there is some really nice end credits, and they play a lot of Evanesence music so I guess thats a plus. All and all this movie is for the simple minded and anyone who is basically looking for something to watch on a rainy day instead of reruns of Full House!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been waiting for this movie since I first saw the teaser with Minority Report. In fact I built up such high expectations, that I expected to be completely disappointed when the film came out on the 14th of February. When I finally got to see it was very, very happy with the end result. The main thing I loved about this film as opposed to other superhero films was the fact that it concentrated so much on the star of the film. Rather than giving the bad guy half the film, or just making the bad guy even more fun then the superhero. With films like Batman and Spider-man they gave so much screen time to the bad guys, that you never really fully understand the personal struggles of the superhero. You get a general sense of it, but you never see the down side to it as you do in Daredevil. Especially in one seen when Matt Murdock returns home after fighting crime that night. Spider-man and Batman could have completely avoided using the \"main\" characters name in the title and gotten away with it. Where as in Daredevil the film gives enough screen time to Bullseye and The Kingpin to the point where you understand what and why they are, but you are not overly saturated with it. The bad guys are just simply, the bad guys.\n\nOther things that I appreciated about the film was that I thought the action scenes were well done. It was fun to watch Daredevil \"serve justice\" to a ton of guys in biker bar in a matter of minutes. The action scenes made sense except for the fact that Daredevil always seemed to have 2 sticks even though he would lose them or throw one at someone else but then magically it would return to his hand. He literally can create a baton when he accidently loses one. I enjoyed the romantic chemistry between Affleck and Garner. The love story wasn't as poorly written as say Attack of the Clones, and it was fun to watch them interact with one another. Affleck to me was everything Murdock was in the comic books. He was as much as Murdock as Christopher Reeve was Clark Kent/Superman. I like Garner as Elektra, she was definitely sexy and she got a chance to show off some of her moves as Elektra. I really liked Colin Farrell as Bullseye, he was about as over the top as you can get, and I thought it played perfectly for what the character represented. Michael Clarke Duncan was perfect for the Kingpin, he was all powerful, imposing to all those around him, and you could see that he enjoyed being this God-like character. Also Jon Favreau was very funny as Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson, and Joe Pantoliano was good as always, although I wish his part would have been a little bigger.\n\nAll in all I thought the film was well written, well directed, and well acted. I think if your looking for 2 hours of afternoon fun this is definitely what the Dr. Strom ordered. For those who are fans of comic films I think they'll love it, and for those who don't I think they'll also have a good time at the theater. I read the comics as a child and still do and I thought this was a great adaptation. In my opinion the second best thus far, second only to Superman, although Spider-man was damn good, as was X-men, Batman, and Blade. Although Captain America, was not.\n\nOn a side note to the comic fans look for all the references to those who worked on the comic such as Frank Miller, Kevin Smith, Jack Kirby, John Romita, Stan Lee (of course), and the list goes on.\n\n10 out 10 for me, just because I enjoyed it so damn much, now if only they can release the R-Rated version onto DVD now."

        "review_detailed_main": "When it was announced that Ben Affleck would be playing Daredevil/Matt Murdock, the reaction was more or less what Michael Keaton got when it was announced he would be playing Batman/Bruce Wayne back in 1989. Keaton, a slender, 5'10\" actor best known for his comedies, seemed like the last person you'd put in a batsuit, but he displayed a kind of tragic irony blended with recently untapped fierceness that made him a winner in the end. Affleck, a broad shouldered, 6'2\" actor best known for the Kevin Smith films and \"Good Will Hunting\" among a few other romantic comedies and bottom of the barrel action films, also seemed like the last person you'd put in the DD costume. But since Michael Keaton proved so many nay-sayers wrong, I was willing to give Benny here benefit of the doubt. And to my surprise, he did a much better job than I thought he would. Was he perfect? Probably not, but Daredevil/Matt Murdock would have been a hard part for any actor to play, since he's blind and that means the actor has to ACT blind. Affleck gives his all, but the script lets him down at times.\n\nThe film starts off good, but after the first big fight and the sight of our hero chewing on pain killers and ripping a tooth out, the film starts to experience a down moment at the diner scene where Matt Murdock (Benny) and his law partner Foggy Nelson (Jon Favreau) discuss their clients and we find out that some of their clients are so poor that they pay in fish, cheese, and sporting equipment. An ethical lawyer who wants to help the less fortunate is one thing, but being payed in fish, cheese and sporting equipment? That's just stupid. Then we meet Elektra (Jennifer Garner). Or rather, the new Elektra, since the film Elektra bears almost no resemblance to the comic book character, and I'm not just talking about looks. I'm willing to tolerate an actor or actress who doesn't quite match the character's appearance, but they have to stay true to the character. In the comic books, Elektra dated Murdock in college and left him when her foreign national father was murdered. She went to Japan and studied martial arts from this Ninja clan called the Hand so she could seek revenge, but eventually lost track of her old life and became a relentless killer. But here, she's a good natured rich girl who just happens to be a kick ass martial artist and just happens to have a leather outfit in her closet along with swords and what have you. I really wished they'd tried to adapt her original story line, it would have worked much better than this 10 minute infatuation. Not to mention that the fight in the playground was just plain stupid, serving as nothing more than excuse to showcase some fancy wire work. That and a blind man can NOT be a skirt chaser, he just can't! Nor should he be able to afford an apartment that has a hidden room where he can keep multiple masks and costumes.\n\nColin Farrel and Michael Clarke Duncan make the most of their villains, Bullseye and Kingpin, respectively, but for once I think we've been given a movie where the villains don't have enough to do.\n\nNot to mention that the fight scenes are so poorly filmed and edited that it's nearly impossible to see what's going on.\n\nAnd what's really sad is that this sticks a lot closer to it's source than some other super hero films (cough ::X-Men:: cough). I don't think Mark Steven Johnson, a so called Daredevil fan, was the right man for this job, I really don't."

And Paul Michael Duncan steals the show as Kingpin.\n\nEvery time DD goes back out to fight the bad guys, you feel for his pain, like his father who fought against the mob way, and had the courage to stand up for what really mattered to him. DD does the same, in a similar high stakes game of cat and mouse with Kingpin and BullsEye.\n\nThe mood is dark and somber. The \"sight\" of DD is artfully depicted. The story evolves so in the end, you are rooting for the good guys to take down the bad guys, and you are not sure if that's possible.\n\nI'm surprised there was never a sequel because this movie delivered. An interesting story, excellent casting, and solid acting make this the movie you should watch if you are in the mood to see one of those good ole good vs. bad guy films, a la Death Wish or other vigilante shows like The Equalizer. Hence, my 8/10. Enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "But then again one does not go see a movie like Daredevil expecting Shakespeare.\n\nDaredevil, for all it's problems (and it does have a more than a few) is what it is, nothing more (certainly) and nothing less.\n\nWhile I will leave the honest to goodness critique's of this film to those that get paid to write them, I will say one or two things about it.\n\nNumber 1: Daredevil is what comic book fans call something of a supporting character, even though he has his own title. He never has been seen as one of the major stars of the Marvel line, the renaissance he had under Frank Miller's direction notwithstanding, he has never been as popular as say Spider-Man or the X-Men. So I was a little surprised when it was announced that a Daredevil movie was in the works. I was also surprised when it was announced who was going to play the part of the title character. Now, no, I am not a huge fan of Ben Affleck's, I don't dislike him nor do I consider myself a fan of his, Affleck is, like this film, nothing more than what he is and nothing less, a somewhat talented, good-looking individual, who does what he can with what he has. Having said that, I really honestly can not think of anyone else who could have played the part (Thomas Jane maybe and that's a weak maybe) for when you have material such as this you do not need (or want for that matter) someone whose acting chops is going to overshadow the material, and with Affleck one doesn't have to worry about that happening.\n\nNumber 2: One of this film's glaring problems (at least in my view) was it's explanation of just how Daredevil became a master of martial-arts. In the comic Matt Murdock is tutored by the enigmatic Stick in the ways of the warrior, in the movie Daredevil's fighting abilities are seen as an extension of the accident that heightened his senses, due to the fact (and this is an almost direct quote from the movie) his heightened sense of touch now provided him an excellent sense of balance. I dislike revisionism, be it with real-life historical events, or in the fantasy world of comic books. Granted keeping with the history of the character as outlined in the comic book would have cut into the films running time (and it isn't that long), but they really didn't have to take the easy way out like they did, simply having Stick show up during the turning point in Matt's life and then fast-forwarding to a grown-up Matt Murdock/Daredevil, would have set better with me, than what they actually did.\n\nDespite the one problem I outlined above (there are more than just that one), I did enjoy Daredevil for the kind of movie it was. No it won't win any Oscars, but then I do not go see movies like Daredevil for that, I see movies like Saving Private Ryan."

Garner and Ben have sizzling chemistry together especially their fight scenes which felt more like foreplay and I liked how he \"saw\" her in the rain.\n\nKingpin is played by the lovely Michael Clarke Duncan who unfortunately does little more than stand around and pose in good suits for the majority of the movie. I did enjoy Colin Farrell as the assassin Bullseye; a fun character able to hurl items (paperclips, darts, cards, glass shards) with deadly aim and just the right amount of c-c-c-crazy.\n\nSomehow though Daredevil never felt like a real superhero to me, just a poor version of Batman, lurking on rooftops and often reminded me of Spiderman too as he swings and jumps from building to building -which I wondered about, how does being radioactively blind make you able to leap about as if you can fly? Probably better not to think about these things. 9/21/15"

The movie just has an overall wacky vibe.\n\nIt feels like the family friendly, over the top superhero movie that it is.

This movie is Daredevil.\n\nThe current renaissance of turning comic books into movies has taken a turn for the worse (as if it was ever on the right track) with this sad collection of images made out to be daring and exciting, yet is remarkably typical of \"straight-to-video\" movies. I half expected someone like Ja Rule or Jean-Claude Van Damme to pop into this movie as some cameo performer. Which reminds me, how could a movie like this lack so much character depth? I see plenty of actors in the credits, but it felt remarkably empty and devoid of anyone but Ben Affleck. I see the likes of Joey Pants and Jennifer Garner in the credits, but they are mostly hyped, not seen. I mean, it was like the first ten minutes of \"Mission Impossible\" where all of the supporting characters are killed off in the first ten minutes. The only difference: the producers managed to stretch out that limited life span through the space of an entire movie. I was even disappointed in Leland Orser, who manages to steal every scene in most of his films, who pulled one of the most invisible performances in a movie full of them.\n\nAnd did Colin Farrell shoot all of his scenes in one day? How long did it take to film this movie? 20 days? 30? This film was so shoddily put together, one has to wonder if they went any further than the first take. Not even the music could save this movie. The soundtrack was subpar at best, and the collection of \"pseudo-hip\" hard rock songs and pop beats were so out of place in this film, it was like someone was trying to mix and match for the fun of it. This film was like a bad rewrite, only they decided to run with it. Yet sadly, producers, critics, and hundreds of IMDB users will most likely see brilliance in this cluttered and mishapen pile of film and sound effects."

But though his eyes do not work his other 4 sense do to a superhuman degree. Sounds, smells, touches and tastes go together to form a bizarre sight that has pros and cons over normal vision. It's pretty cool concept and it's reasonably well done.\n\nBut Daredevil has NO plot! It's a swift 90 minutes of practically nothing. The most involving part of the film is the romance between Affleck and Garner but it's cut short with the arrival of Colin Farrell who plays Bullseye, a paper-thin but funny character. Many have been annoyed at the fact that the Kingpin is played by a Black-American actor. But what does THAT matter? Who cares if he's white in the comic book? Michael Clarke Duncan brings some formidable integrity to the role but does come off as a bit too cuddly at the same time.\n\nA tiny bit of story is set up but it's over very soon. I guess the best you could say is that Daredevil doesn't outstay its welcome. But you'll not remember it 5 minutes after seeing it. And I don't like the fact they chose to separate all Daredevil and Spiderman links just because they were licensed to different studios.\n\nThe DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a very powerful DTS 5.1 track.

        "review_detailed_main": "Back in the early days of the rising popularity of the superhero movie, long before cinematic universes and multi-film crossovers, there were a handful of films that brought these comic book characters to the big screen. From Spider-Man (2002) to X-Men (2000) to The Punisher (2004), one of these films was none other than Daredevil (2003). For many years, I had seen these films, even going so far as having seen Hulk (2003). The one I had not seen was Daredevil, mostly because I had heard it was so bad. I had seen Hulk, so I knew how bad they could be.\n\nNow that a Director's Cut of Daredevil was available, I heard it improved on the original and decided to just skip the original cut entirely. With no understanding of what the film used to be, I can say that the Director's Cut isn't completely terrible. Sure, some of the lines are goofy, and the actors chosen for the roles might not have been the best choices, but it's a solid film. I did find it interesting how many actors who have had better success with directing were present in this film. From Ben Affleck (The Town (2010) and Argo (2012)) to Jon Favreau (Iron Man (2008) and The Jungle Book (2016)), and even a cameo appearance by Kevin Smith (Clerks (1994) and Chasing Amy (1997)), these actors definitely work better behind the camera.\n\nEven with the Director's Cut being a supposed improvement on the film, there still seemed to be too many sub-plots all running at once, each one of which I felt didn't get nearly enough screen time to fully explore what was happening. Another problem with this film is that it has not aged well. From the soundtrack being clearly inspired by the music of the time, to the CGI showing the limitations of the computers at the time, all these things just scream \"2003\" to me.\n\nProbably not as bad as it could have been, I give Daredevil (Director's Cut) 3.0 stars out of 5."

However at night he is DareDevil \u2013 a superhero of sorts who fights crime in his local Hell's Kitchen. His blindness has given him raised senses and he has trained his body to fight. He meets and falls in love with Elektra only to find himself caught in a deadly game when her father is murdered by crime lord King Pin's assassin Bulls-eye.\n\nThe actual plot is very simple and seems very short \u2013 the usual 'setting up' stuff takes half the film and the rest is quite run of the mill stuff indeed. Like I said, it doesn't do anything specific wrong but it feels quite lackluster. Every film this summer seems to have random fight scenes but the ones in DD are even more random than ever \u2013 while the fight in the kids park is good to watch, it comes out of nowhere and is just a little silly!\n\nThere are a lot facial close ups. The visual style is aggressively painful. How they visualized Daredevil's special vision isn't much better. It's all blue and wavy. If it's supposed to give him superior visual skills, it doesn't look like it on the screen. The production value looks cheap."

        "review_detailed_main": "Daredevil is a 2003 superhero film written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson and is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.\n\nThe film stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who fights for justice as a masked vigilante Daredevil. Jennifer Garner plays the love interest, Elektra Natchios. Colin Farrell plays the merciless assassin Bullseye and the late Michael Clarke Duncan plays Wilson Fisk, also known as the crime lord Kingpin.\n\nI will review how I feel about this movie and I also will review the special features on the 2-disc special edition that I have.\n\nThe plot is simple: By day, blind attorney Matt Murdock toils for justice in Hell's Kitchen. By night, he's Daredevil -- The Man Without Fear -- a powerful, masked vigilante stalking the dark streets with an uncanny radar sense that allows him to see with superhuman capabilities. But when the love of his life, fiery Elektra Natchios, is targeted by New York City's ruthless Kingpin of Crime and his deadly assassin Bullseye, Daredevil may be about to meet his match. Elektra is killed by Bullseye and Daredevil takes both of them down, but lets Kingpin be handed over to the cops.\n\nThe film is on my Top 10 Underrated Movies list on IMDb and I really hated that critics did not like this film, as well as most comic book fans because of the casting choices. Ben Affleck has gone on to say that playing this role was stupid and the worst things he's ever done. To this day, him and co-star and real life wife, Jennifer Garner, are still married.\n\nThe acting is this movie is amazing. Ben Affleck gives an amazing performance as Matt Murdock / Daredevil. Jennifer Garner plays the love interest Elektra and she does great in her role, until Bullseye hurts and kills her. Colin Farrell plays Bullseye and he is just menacing and creepy in the role. Michael Clarke Duncan plays Wilson Fisk / Kingpin and this was a good performance for the late actor, as his other performance as an inmate in The Green Mile was amazing as well. For The Green Mile, he deserved that Oscar and I will forever be angry that he didn't get it.\n\nJon Favreau plays Foggy Nelson and he would direct the first two Iron Man films and Cowboys & Aliens. David Keith plays Matt's father, Jack \"The Devil\" Murdock and he is amazing as well. Joe Pantoliano played Ben Urich and he was cool in his role as well. Scott Terra plays young Matt Murdock and he is not horrible.\n\nThe visual effects and sound effects, including when Daredevil uses his superhuman powers saves this movie, as well as the acting and direction that this movie took. The script by Mark Steven Johnson is really cool and his direction matches everything that was in that screenplay.\n\nGraeme Revell composed the music and my favorite theme is the \"Daredevil Theme\" and the soundtrack has great pop and rock songs here and there by Drowning Pool featuring Rob Zombie, Hoobastank, Fuel, The Calling, Revis and Evanescence, who sings \"Bring Me to Life\".\n\nOverall, DAREDEVIL is okay, but I just wish the critics or comic book fans did not criticize this movie as bad as they did and the film was successful enough to create a spin-off film, Elektra, which was released in 2005 and I will get to that soon.\n\nThe special features on the 2-disc DVD are incredible. On the first disc, you have an enhanced viewing mode that allows you to see how the visual effects were created with commentary by visual effects producer John Kilkenny, an on-screen trivia track about the comics and the film, including it's production. The audio commentary by Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster is really amazing .\n\nOn the second disc, there are two documentaries: 1): \"Creating Daredevil: The Man Without Fear\", which explains the comic books of Daredevil and with interviews by all of the comic book people who worked on Daredevil, including the man himself, Stan Lee. 2): the making-of documentary, \"Beyond Hell's Kitchen: Making Daredevil\", with the cast and crew and behind-the-scenes interviews.\n\nThere is also an HBO first look of the film, a documentary with the blind consultant on the film, Tom Sullivan. There are three music videos and that is really cool.\n\nThere are also six production featurettes, a screen test featuring Jennifer Garner, a featurette about the Kingpin character, with the late Michael Clarke Duncan being interviewed, photo galleries, multi-angle scene studies of two fight scenes in the film and theatrical trailers including 3 of this film's trailers and the other two being other Fox films called \"28 Days Later\" and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\".\n\nThe movie's special features on the two-disc special edition are really cool and the movie is really cool. The movie is an OK Marvel movie.\n\nI know there is a director's cut, but it's R rated, so if I can find it, I will check that out.\n\nMovie: 6.5/10 Special Features on the DVD: 10/10"

On the plus side, the fluid movements of Daredevil through the rooftops of the city put similar sequences in Spiderman to shame.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film seems to be getting a lot of mixed reviews, with most leaning towards the negative kind. I had to see for myself, and I had prepared myself for the worst. The verdict? Not as bad as they say!\n\nDefinitely not in the same league as Spiderman (you know the comparisons are BOUND to happen!), but Daredevil has merits of its own. Somewhat darker, it had a more realistic feel. It was kinda odd, but it didn't really feel like a \"superhero\" film. Daredevil has to be the most imperfect superhero I've seen on the big screen - which was interesting to watch. The pace was a little slow at times, but not yawn-inducingly so.\n\nThe actors did a good job. Contrary to what others have written, I felt Affleck fit the role nicely, he does well conveying the 'darkness' in Daredevil's character. Garner was pretty cool also, and although it would have been nice to see something more of a back story for her character, Elektra was a fun character to watch.\n\nConclusion? Don't believe the (negative) hype! See it for yourself. I for one was pleasantly surprised. Bring on the sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, a bit of context.\n\nI first read a Daredevil comic in the 1970s, when Roger McKenzie and then, Frank Miller were writing the character. My 12 year old self found a lifelong hero.\n\nSo when I heard about a Daredevil film, back in 2002, I was incredibly excited, hoping that they would do it justice, but those hopes were crushed when I finally saw the film on it's opening weekend.\n\nSo what was wrong with it. Well, if I could leave my prejudices aside (which I can't and I don't want to, anyway, because they were hard earned), I'd still think this was a terrible film. Badly underwritten characters (from an exceptional Frank Miller story arc), a script filled to the brim with idiotic and non-sensical plot details, poor performances by Garner, Affleck and Farrell, studio interference which led to 27 minutes being hacked from the final cut, poor editing and a director who, for me, didn't really have clear idea of what he wanted to achieve.\n\nI left the cinema, not just disappointed, but appalled at what had been done to my childhood hero. And I have not revised that opinion over the years, even with the advent of the \"Director's Cut\". I hoped that this would be some kind of magical rehabilitation for the film, but although it is less clunky and makes a little more sense, the aforementioned issues still persist.\n\nSo, If you like superheroe fare, this would be one to miss. Watch the TV series (although they allowed DD to become incredibly whiney in series 2) and leave this one be. It has no saving graces and will just irritate and annoy."

Affleck was a pretty good Daredevil not as bad as i thought he would be. There are people who would have done it better but he still did a good job. The best thing about this movie is i would say the villains. Micheal Clark Duncan was a very good kingpin. It doesn't matter that kingpin was white in the comics Duncan was perfect. Farell also was very well cast as Bullseye. He did a good job too. The best fight scene in the movie though was the one between kingpin and daredevil. I don't think Electra needed to be in this though. 2 villains were enough. She should have been saved for the sequel if they do one or her own movie. I don't know if they r doing a sequel maybe they just did Electra instead i don't know. I would see a Daredevil 2 if they made it though. I hope they use kingpin again."

There were only a few visual treats that helped me staying in the theater and not asking a refund. And eventually I heard about the Director's Cut and hoped it would show redeeming values and meaningful scenes that were obviously ripped from the original cut.\n\nGood god, was I wrong... The deleted scenes are absolutely useless and concern mainly the \"Courtroom\" angle, by showing poor Ben Affleck thriving by finding an even worse actor than him (Coolio) to chew the scenery with (I'm a bit heavy handed here since Affleck proved he could act sometimes) in a pathetic subplot treated almost like a comedy while the movie needed some drama to faithfully address the hero's dilemma toward Justice (a staple in the comics). Shame.\n\nWhat pisses me the most is the posture of some fans who can't acknowledge the fact that the movie is mediocre at best, and try to cover their disappointment by singing the praises of the Director's Cut while it's essentially the same terrible film, only MUCH longer. I can understand that some people genuinely loved it, and I respect that; but some are just boldface liars unable to admit that the new cut is a joke, and that the joke's on those who double-dipped the DVD.\n\nSo, here's a useful advice if you're reading these lines and were about to give the new cut a chance: DO NOT believe the hype, this is just 130 minutes of boredom, cheesy humor and bad acting. Just like it was in theaters."

The dialogue and acting was as embarrassing as the self indulgent, OTT direction. This is how NOT to adapt a comic book. Yes comic books have a certain dialogue and are by nature OTT, but that is what they are as an art form onto themselves. Just as a novel is a novel. In transition to the screen things need to change - costumes, dialogue, presentation. Hence the word 'adaptation'. Batman, X-Men and Spiderman got it right, and I have the utmost fate in Ang Lee to deliver this summer for 'Hulk'.

It was one of the first Marvel films to feature a rather dark and at times depressing storyline, one where the hero is not guaranteed to win and even if he does, it's a Pyrrhic victory at best. Of course there had been Blade before this one, but aside from that, this was the first one, which I found very refreshing. Aside from that, the character cast fits the mood of the film and the casting is pretty solid, with Colin Farrell absolutely nailing the role of Bullseye. Add in a great and gritty visual style, some solid action scenes and a love interest that actually is able to look after herself - to a certain degree - and I really don't get why this movie hasn't been ranked any higher than it is.\n\nWell, okay, one of the reasons is the original cut, which is nowhere near as good as the director's cut. The original is not bad in my opinion either, but the director's cut just flows better and enhances the darker aspects of the story. A shame that the director's vision didn't get a theater release, because it might have saved this film from its mixed reception.\n\nAnd that's my two cents about this film. It's a solid superhero film with a dark atmosphere, great characters and a good storyline. Definitely worth checking out if superhero films are your thing or even if you're just looking for a good action film."

Afflect and Jennifer Garner has great on-screen chemistry and Colin Farrell makes a good villain; really enjoyed seeing him in battle with Farrell, action-packed and riveting. The movie is shot in a more realistic and adult-themed approach, versus the fantasy, and at times campy, style of other superhero movies.\n\nThe overall quality, suspense and intrigue doesn't match those of the Batman and Superman, and the cinematography looked washed-out. But it's still a worthy movie to spend the Sunday afternoon with.\n\nGrade B-"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm obviously in the minority here but I just watched the Director's Cut and hated it. The original movie, while no Oscar contender, was simply a good action flick. The Director's Cut dumbed down the movie by adding a pointless sub-plot that distracted from the main story line. While others say that the added scenes \"fleshed out\" the characters I totally disagree. If you can read between the lines you can easily figure out those details on your own.\n\nThe Director's Cut also added a lot of utterly unnecessary scenes like the part towards the end where the reporter approaches Matt and tells him he is about to reveal the story. What the!?!? \u0085 the original version handles this issue much better! You just aren't sure right up to the end and then you see the human behind the reporter when he hits the delete key.\n\nWhile I could care less about the love scene in the original cut, the development of the love interest is much more crucial to the development of the story than others give credit for. If it was not for the love interest then why would Daredevil bother to go after her to protect her? Why would he suffer so much anguish when he thinks she is dead? Why would he have such a smile when he finds the brail charm? Overall, the Director's Cut dragged on in places it should not have, added 24 minutes of nothing to the movie and left out some important details.\n\nHearing the Director talk about his directors cut made me think of someone who wanted to stuff whatever *he* wanted into the movie without regard for the viewer.\n\nSee both versions and decide."

It starts off Dark and Gritty and then it all oh the sudden switchs to light hearted. This movie goes everywhere in that sense it switches to fast and to quick from Dark to Sad to Light. This creates a sense of unbalance to the movie. As for the blind laywer character DareDevil, well he just flat out is the worst superhero of our time. He has good intentions but he always does the wrong thing. He is killing people left and right, most of these people are people he failed to win a case against in court, what the hell!. The love interest Jennifer Garner (so damn hot) is probley the most rounded character, although her backround on the fighting skills is quite stupid. Kingpin was great, I mean you got the great Duncan playing him. Kingpin was just so bad ass, especially the fight at the end with Daredevil. Now as for Bullseye, I don't know what to say, I mean he was a cool character, but the horribly messy fight scene at the end was so bad it makes me want to hate the character. Then again, I think I would kill myself for not liking any disgruntled Irishman. Now for the things I liked. The fight scenes were for the most part awesome, I mean the high jumping and the kicking and the stabing (while very far fetched were still good). I mean the fight scene against Kingpin and DareDevil was so awesome. The way Daredevil saw things, he sees through sound vibrations and its pretty much a blue mist that covers everything and gives him a rough image of the room. I mean that was the coolest thing in the movie. Ayway this movie was Ok, thats really it. I mean if your looking for a slightly entertaining unbalanced action, well than this is it.\n\nGRADE: C\n\nI thought I might add something my friend said \"This is truly a love or hate it movie\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, there is one aspect to this movie that is deeply upsetting: Daredevil, in real life, is a lawyer, who is so noble that, when he loses cases, he decides to kill the guy who beat the rap. And the guys he kills aren't even on trial for murder. I'm no liberal, but, I mean... isn't that pretty wrong? Arguments of capital punishment and \"eye-for-an-eye\" aside, doesn't this send a really warped message?\n\nRelating more to the stupidity of the movie, this movie asks you to believe that having lost your sense of sight means that your body can withstand the tremendous force of falling twenty flights onto a window-washing platform. I don't care how much \"give\" the platform has - a leg has to be broken to be even plausible. The most likely scenario: You die.\n\nAlso, apparently we're to believe he can jump twice as far as the world Olympic record for long-jump... because he lost his sight. You heard me.\n\nStupid aspects of the movie such as this one are all justified by the notion that his other four senses have been \"heightened\" by the loss of his vision. Also, the loss of his father and vision have made him become obsessed to the athletic perfection of his body. Also, he sleeps in a water-chamber thing (I have no idea what you call it). So, naturally, that means he is now the greatest athlete in the history of the world. Doesn't that sound plausible to you?\n\nI can understand how the movie wants us to say, \"OK, I'll believe that even though I'm not a complete moron and know the things he is doing are impossible.\" I even like movies like that from time to time. But this movie goes so far and away beyond plausibility, that (for me) it's impossible to just accept it. It's like asking us to believe that dogs can talk (which is easy to do; see: \"Babe\"), while also believing that they have a knowledge of the cosmic universe that goes beyond anything human beings could ever comprehend. It's just asking for too much.\n\nVote: 3/10 (for Garner's attractiveness and Farrell's comedic parts)"

Granted, if you're going to watch it for the first time, I recommend watching the Director's Cut. This focuses less on the romance, and more on Matt Murdock/Daredevil; plus, it has a darker feel to it. Personally, I would've done without the Elektra stuff all together (and please, just skip that movie totally...you'll be glad you did). I thought Ben Affleck did well as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, and another solid performance from Michael Clarke Duncan...I wouldn't expect anything less from him. I give it a 7/10, but probably would've made it an 8 or 8.5 if Elektra was out of the movie all together. Recommended."

He's a terrible actor, he's corny as hell, and he ain't even that good-looking. This movie just further proves my theory. Him and Jennifer Garner don't spark at all. There was no connection there whatsoever. Jennifer Garner wasn't that great either as Elektra. She just didn't fill the part well at all. This isn't her type of movie. The storyline was full of holes also, and wasn't all that interesting. The only good parts were given to the bad guys. Colin Farrell was decent as Bullseye, but he just wasn't given a great plot to work with. Michael Clarke Duncan was good also, but he also fell victim to a lousy Swiss cheese plot. No director's cut could ever make this movie worth watching again. I don't recommend this to people looking for a good action movie, this will disappoint you big time. 3/10.

        "review_detailed_main": "Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) grew up in the Hell's Kitchen section of NYC. His father (David Keith) was a boxing has-been who, nevertheless, encouraged his son to do well in school and go for a law degree. Coming home with a terrific report card, Matt catches his father engaged in a crime and runs away from the scene. However, in his haste, young Matt collides with a truck carrying hazardous waste. Blinded by the incident, Matt discovers that he has, nonetheless, tremendous radar abilities and other special senses. When his father is killed on the streets, he trains himself in the martial arts and goes to law school, also. Now a public defender, Matt sees firsthand that justice is sometimes under-served when the poor are pitted against the rich and the powerful. Therefore, at night, Matt becomes Daredevil, a vigilante superhero trying to knock off the bad elements. His fighting and climbing skills are impressive and he succeeds in his quest. Yet, the city is not happy about his random acts and wants to find out who he is. Also, the nefarious crooks of the Big Apple are not happy, either, as Daredevil is killing them off. They send for the Irish Bullseye (Colin Farrell), a hit-man with sensational knifing skills. Look out, Matt! Then, Matt meets lovely Elektra (Jennifer Garner) at a cafe and he is smitten! He learns soon after that she has impressive martial arts talents, too and that her father is a wealthy man with many connections. With Bulleye out to get Matt, will Elektra and her father be in danger from association? This is a rather violent and uneven adaption of what was most likely a fine comic series. But, any weak qualities the movie sports are not the result of the fine cast. Affleck is very nice as the blind superhero and Garner is most lovely as the fiery little rich girl. As for Farrell, he is a hoot, despite his loathsome persona, and the rest of the cast, including Keith, Jon Favreau and others is wonderful as well. Ccstumes, sets, and special effects are fine, too. Therefore, the impact of the film has been lessened by an average script, an equally average direction, and a penchant for unnecessary violence. Nevertheless, most comic book fans will want to arrange a viewing, as superhero movies are still something special in the world of cinema. Fans of the handsome Affleck or the gorgeous Garner, too, will want to be daring and give it a try."

        "review_detailed_main": "My biggest gripe with this movie is its too much story for one movie, this should have been planned as a trilogy with the 1st instalment concentrating on the origin and early crime fighting of Daredevil and Matt Murdoch's development as an attorney and his early encounter with Wilson Fisk.\n\nSadly the director crams too much story into this movie and looses everything that Frank Miller created in his re-booting of the character for marvel comics.\n\nThis movie doesn't get a pass because it was made in 2003, let's put a few things into perspective, 2001 a space odyssey was made in 1968 with a budget of $10.5 million, The Matrix was made in 1999 with a budget of $68 million, both of those films are as incredible now as when they were first released, Daredevil had a budget of $78 million and is as poor now as it was when released in 2003.\n\nFor the most part it's style over substance, poor casting choices for many of the characters, poor fight scene choreograpy throughout the entire film and almost zero character development for all the characters because its too many main characters in one movie.\n\nWhile the movie can be commended for having a dark gritty storyline it's ultimately undone by the \"TV movie\" style directing.\n\nPoor understanding of each character and their abilities also make this a confusing and baffling watch.\n\nElecktras scene with the sandbags was silly and pointless as was the meeting and sparring between her and Matt Murdoch, similarly the scene of Elecktras fight scene with Daredevil was one of the most cringy and embarrassing scenes of the movie.\n\nMichael Clarke Duncan was wasted talent in the role of Kingpin and Colin Farrells depiction of Bullseye would have been more at home in the 60s Batman TV show, whatever they were thinking by having him constantly whisking his coat around like Batman's cape is a compete mystery.\n\nLet's also keep in mind this was a Fox studios property not Marvel and it never came back to Marvel, it is now owned by Disney.\n\nWhile This movie probably isn't considered as a flop it did do so spectacularly badly that Disney had no confidence in it being a worthwhile property to invest in, Netflix showed them the error of their ways, thankfully.\n\nWhile some of the action scenes ( not fight scenes) are quite good and some of the cgi is ok this is still a very poor movie.\n\nI don't base my score of 3 stars on comparing this movie to any of the MCU films or latest non MCU marvel character films.\n\nThis movie could have and should have been much much better and that is a failure by the director."

        "review_detailed_main": "From the director of Grumpy Old Men (1993), starring the guy who would go on to direct Argo (2012) and including the guy who directed Iron Man (2008), Daredevil (2003) is very much a movie of could haves and almosts. Much like the oft scorned Catwoman (2004) and the goofy but good-natured Fantastic Four (2005), Ben Affleck's red leathered superhero suffers from a studio system not yet convinced of the viability of superhero films but still in the business of making money.\n\nAffleck is Matt Murdock a trial lawyer by day and a masked vigilante by night. While still in grade school, Murdock was blinded by an accident involving toxic chemicals. While unable to see like you or I, he develops heightened senses including sonar-type hearing that helps him hunt for lowlifes and thugs. The thug Daredevil most wants to put an end to is the aptly named Kingpin aka Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan), who runs the criminal syndicate in not-Batman's neighborhood and huge swath of the city.\n\nAlso in the mix is Colin Farrell playing a goofily dressed assassin, Joe Pantoliano as a New York Post reporter and d\u00e9butante Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) whose billionaire father (Erick Avari) has some shady business dealing with Kingpin he isn't too proud of. A skilled fighter herself, she gets in on the action while simultaneously forming a bond with Matt.\n\nThus comes the part fan-boys seem the most fussy about, the love story. In this writer's opinion, the romance was laudable if flat and one-dimensional. The problem comes when a B-story of such flaccid ordinariness becomes a larger focus than the capes and masks that inhabit the world of Daredevil. Just because both the lovers are semi-superheroes, it doesn't make the romance any more interesting. You need more than schoolyard acrobatics, you need fun characters, good chemistry and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was written by a gifted teenager.\n\nThough for me, the reason this film is ultimately placed in the bargain bin Daredevil-Elektra (2005) two-pack is because of it's \"been there, done that,\" quality. Most of the inspirational moments in the movie are lifted from greater superhero films like Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002). Anything original is done sloppily which includes some laughable physics from Colin Farrell's Bulleye character. There's really only one creative scene that doesn't feel like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu; when Matt kisses Elektra in the rain so the droplets can create a consistent image of her face for him. It was romantic, inventive and genuine.\n\nDaredevil ultimately fails because it attempts to tell a dark tale that isn't dark enough, a romance that isn't romantic enough and a hero story that isn't heroic enough. All the ideas in it are unoriginal retreads from other films and the direction is too rudimentary to really be mentioned. While doing background for this review I became privy to a director's cut version of the film which includes a subplot involving Coolio. Detractors have been silenced by this new version so I'm slightly curious as to its allure. Curious, but not curious enough to watch the guy from Mallrats (1995) and the third billed starlet from Juno (2007); get silly on a seesaw again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into Daredevil expecting an incredible movie hyped for around 8 months. As is often true, movies don't live up to their hype and Daredevil is another fateful example of this. Other such dissapointments include X-Men and Episode 1/2.\n\nDaredevil, while indowed with plenty of incredible action scenes, falls short in the department of something that every film needs. That department, the audience's care for the characters, is ultimately far underdeveloped. We, the audience, fail to care for these characters packed into a 90 minute mini-movie of a great comicbook. Daredevil, a second tier character, would seem to be a very good person to base a movie on; however, it falls short due to his portrayal. He is a dark, destructive character who places revenge above morality. Normally, it would seem that the vengeful human race would find solice in a character such as this.\n\nThis mess of a film throws us into the live of Matt Murdock in the capable hands of Ben Affleck. BA gives a generally stand-up performance normally uncharacteristic of his skills. The great Kingpin isn't given enough screen time and the audience doesn't really care about him. It mattered nothing to me if he died or killed hundreds of others. He simply wasn't given enough time to formulate an evil presence.\n\nThe same is true with Bullseye, the \"main villian\" of this Daredevil picture. Although the writers tried to portray him as this evil assassin, I ultimately thanked him for his victories. I wanted that old hag to die just as much as him and thought the whole paper-clip death was fun. However, it just didn't create an evil persona for him and he comes off almost as comedic relief. This here is one fan that thinks Colin Farrell is probably the most overestimated actor out there right now. As of now, he has yet to star in a movie that I could sit through without wincing in agony every few minutes(I.E. American Outlaws).\n\nLastly I think that Jennifer Garner was perfect as the Deadly Electra. She fits the role to a \"t\" and doesn't falter even with the few lines that she is given. Plus, who wouldn't want to look at Jennifer for a 90 minute film. *watches the complete lack of raised hands*.\n\nI give it the popular consensus of 6/10 just below X-Men, but far off from the glory of Spider-Man."

This film is just one horrible cliche after another with corny lines and wooden acting abound, I swear to you if I see Ben Afflick on the street I'm going to demand my money back from him for this lame ass movie. We knew we were in trouble when about five minutes into the movie the kid and the dad start crying in each other arms, and is there a more believable multi-billionare than that big guy who when he gets threatened turns it into a \"Brooklyn thing\" and despite his incredible resources he'll fight Daredevil himself. I swear to god, I think one scene was lifted directly out of the Matrix, line for line, action for action. It got so bad that by about the 15th minute we were just laughing at how horrible this film was and cracking jokes about Nachos. The movie would have been a flawless comedy if only we all knew but hoped Daredevil didn't fight Kingpin after killing Bullseye because we wanted to get the hell out of theater as un-hurt as possible but alas it didn't happen but I guess we wouldn't get the \"thug\" element if he didn't. Unless you want to laugh your ass off two hours at such a horrible movie, I suggest you don't see this. However, this could be the best comedy of the year, kicking \"How to lose a guy in 10 days\" right in the ass. Also another example of my theory that there is nothing valid in mainstream cinema today and Ben Afflick is cinematic poison. Seriously in six months when the hype wears off for this movie no one will care or like this film anymore."

Of the actors, he stated that Affleck and Jennifer Garner were suitable for their roles, while Duncan's presence alone was menacing. He finished by saying \"I am getting a little worn out describing the origin stories and powers of superheroes. Some of their movies, like this one, are better than others.\"\n\nMost notably, the film brought together Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner and gave them a lasting marriage and children. Wow, a comic book romance!"

Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock wasn't a bad idea, since he looked like it. Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk was acceptable, as despite being black, he suited the character quite well. Colin Farrell left a lot to be desired, as the villain of him felt plain and generic. The digital effects are lame and haven't aged as well as the movie itself. It has action scenes that are good and at least the sequences of how Matt perceives things around him are great and surreal. The story begins very well with the origin of Matt, but the rest is a somewhat simple superhero story. In the end, Daredevil is a mediocre movie that only convinces a few and can be entertaining for some, but boring for others. This movie was another failed adaptation that didn't age well, but it still has its charm as it is from Marvel, since it is still remembered for something, for better or worse. My rating for this movie is 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Daredevil's been one of MARVEL's most iconic underdog characters: and his movie was a feature-length disservice to that status he gained through the years. I mean talk about a let-down that didn't even come close to the then-recent Spider-Man movie; you go from The Wall-Crawler to The Man Without Fear and the transition in quality is simply jarring on every discernible level.\n\nDaredevil meant well, but its cast is simply terrible and it taints the respective characters shown in the movie. There's no doubt that Ben Affleck is a competent actor, but he just wasn't meant to portray superheroes like Daredevil or Batman, and Jennifer Garner makes Elektra out to be a wooden joke of a love interest who's not even close to her comic counterpart. Though the Kingpin is pretty good thanks to the late Michael Clarke Duncan, it still doesn't negate the fact that the better-than-expected baddie is stuck in a film where Duncan's gentle-giant charm is out of place for a character as gritty and grounded as Daredevil is. Duncan's the best part of this movie because he's on a different level to everyone else; he cares about the character's integrity and does his damnedest to stay close to the Kingpin in the comic books for all that it's worth.\n\nDaredevil isn't as bad as MARVEL's other outings like Howard the Duck (1986), Captain America (1990), or Elektra (2005) but it's a tonal mess that tries seguing between dark and light-hearted fun that just doesn't work in the movie's, or the source material's, context.\n\nPlease note that this review is allocated for the original theatrical release: I have not seen the Director's Cut nor do I really intend to."

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing Daredevil, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I walked in expecting a stinker. The previews, in my opinion, were not very flattering, and the reviews others had given me were disappointing. The one saving grace I had heard was that Daredevil is a dark superhero story, more reminiscent of 1989's Batman with Michael Keaton than of more recent comic book fare like Spider-Man or X-Men.\n\nAlthough I dearly loved both Spider-Man and X-Men, I could not justify a nice or sugar-coated story to Daredevil, one of the most interesting characters in the Marvel repetoire. His is a story of darkness and ambiguity, and a noir-style film is best suited for such a story.\n\nThat being said, I was not particularly impressed with the special effects. Daredevil's radar vision was fairly impressive, but in general the fight sequences left me somewhat lacking. Kudos to the special effects and sound design teams for blending (or trying to blend) the real world and Daredevil's world during the fights, but for me, it just didn't seem to work that well.\n\nThe performances were acceptable. As a fan of both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, I wasn't disappointed, although I definitely thought both could have stretched their acting abilities a little more. Both are capable of so much more, and to see them practically walking through the script was a little disappointing. This disappointment was easily offset by Colin Farrell's performance as Bullseye, which I consider the best element of the movie. After The Recruit and this turn in Daredevil, Colin Farrell has cemented himself in my opinion as one of the better in his generation of Hollywood actors.\n\nAll in all, I'd say Daredevil was a worthy effort. 7 out of 10."

Never on the comics of Daredevil he dressed like that, his clothes always was of a normal tissue, like Spiderman for example.\n\nBen Affleck do very well the character of DareDevil, and Matt Murdock, so Collin Farrel that is amazing being BullsEye, and Michael Claine did very well too the king.\n\nAnother good thing on this movie is how they describe the super human powers of Daredevil, his super senses, they show this in a fantastic way, because they achieve that the audience feels like they are inside the body of DareDevil and you can understand very well how his super powers works.\n\nIf they do a sequel (I hope so), I expect that these things (at least - somethings) could be fixed to the next movie."

He doesn;t look like a superhero. He comes across as super dork, especially when fighting Jennifer garner in the park, who may aswell have been a cardboard cutout on screen. In fact it would have been more fun if they shot the whole thing using lego.\n\nThis film males Lost In Space look like The Godfather.

Many, however, might be let down after recent successes as X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002).\n\nThe overall plot is set up well enough, with the story prefaced by how Matt Murdock was blinded and eventually became the DareDevil. Sequences throughout the film which depict how he is able to \"see\" even though he is blind are wicked cool and do a lot to make his \"super senses\" believable.\n\nThere are, of course, some massive plot holes, such as how he managed to leap tall buildings in a single bound, a la Superman. But if you keep in mind that this is a comic book world we're talking about, you'll quickly realize that the rules of the \"real world\" don't apply. If you can remember this, you'll enjoy the experience a whole lot more.\n\nThe production values are certainly solid, with lots of great fight sequences, good CG work, stellar sound (this film is an audiophiles wet-dream, IMO), and a passable plot. All these things, however, do not quite add up in the end.\n\nThey seem to try to portray DareDevil as some sort of reluctant hero. However he often times seems way to human, then you see him doing very superhuman stunts. This is probably the biggest fault of the film and will undoubtely be a chief complaint among all but the hardest of hardcore fans.\n\nThe acting is pretty good and there are lots of familiar faces in the supporting cast. In terms of Affleck's character, I left feeling rather numb, not caring too much about him one way or another. Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin was a good choice, though he isn't given much to do here other than look intimidating. They also managed to waste the talents of Jennifer Garner. She just doesn't get enough screen time and very little effort is spent fleshing out her character. However, I am happy to say that Colin Farrell plays the coolest villian since Lex Luthor. He'll probably be the one thing you end up remembering most after walking out of the theatre.\n\nAbout my only other chief complaint is that some of the editing and camerawork falls into a trap we're seeing all too much lately: shots that are WAY too tight coupled with cuts that are so fast they could possibly cause a seizure. We saw some of this in the two latest installments of Star Wars and in other films such as Armageddon. Why editors and directors continue to do this is beyond me, as it spoils the impact of some fight scenes.\n\nOverall, DareDevil is a solid comicbook-to-screen transition. It's not nearly are spirited or memorable as X-Men or Spider-Man, though it is an enjoyable night at the movies. Just remember to check your brain at the door..."

I know its gonna be called racist, but PEOPLE COME ON KINGPIN IS NOT BLACK. Nothing against Michael Clark Duncan (in fact him and Pantoliano were by far the two best actors in the film and i'm qite a fan of his) but Wilson Fisk is a HUGE inhuman looking Brute of a man, not a big towering \"pimp\" as the film made him look. If they wanted to cast someone to play him and couldnt achieve it why not do him in CGI? Elektra was well... not Elektra. Jennifer Garner came off as an even bigger airhead in the film than she did in the movie special she hosted, and her costume was TERRIBLE. I could never lust for her return from death like that of the real Elektra because she was simplistic and plain beyond all stretches of mediocrity. Finally Bullseye... WHAT THE HELL DID THEY DO TO THIS GREAT CHARACTER??? Dont tell me that \"he wouldnt have looked right in movie form\" if that was the case then why have Daredevil look the way he did? They very simply could have made him look like a killer but instead he came off as a overly femme and non threatning goof, more like a patron at a local leather bar. Collin Farrel is a waste if this is the kinda crap he's gonna do and uphold... The plot was crap, the movie carp and even thinking about it enrages me. what the movie truly needed was a quick Cameo by Frank Castle into hells kitchen, maybe he could have ended the misery before it ever began.

In this instance I don't think the movie falls apart nearly so much but then Batman had several other problems added to the mix. Daredevil whips quickly into the story of this comicbook character's arch enemy (Bullseye), his greatest love (Elektra), and the great evil force behind everything (Kingpin) all in one movie. And on top of it all the movie has to take time to cover the origin of Daredevil himself. The lawyer Matt Murdock's partner is well cast, played and written. Daredevil is correctly portrayed (for the most part) both as a character and visually. The casting choice for Kingpin although not in line with the character as drawn in the books makes more sense than the books and works to the movies advantage. Bullseye was relatively well done (crazy and talented). Elektra was OK but the point is that each of these parts were thrown by the viewer at a reckless pace. It was like going to the ice cream store and only getting samples, never buying a full cone of ice cream. By the time the spinning sensation stopped the movie was over. There is a fight scene in a playground that should not even made it into the movie. It makes little to no sense. Liking the Daredevil comic book is probably the main reason that I stuck this one out. A few more like this and comics won't make it to the screen any more."

If I could, I would ask the distributor to get my money back.\n\nFirst: somebody should finally tell Ben Affleck that he is not made to be an actor, he has neither charisma nor any presence on screen (I doubt whether he got it at all ...), he simply cannot act. Even I would DARE him in this field! What a mis-casting! None of the characters was ... wait a minute ... CHARACTER - what CHARACTERS? There were no characters: even those who could have been some, like Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell didn\u00b4t have the chance to pull off some good performance. There was no chance to identify yourself with one of them or to create some sympathy. Although SPIDERMAN was partly soaked with romanticism, it was a lot easier to feel sympathy for Peter Parker or even Norman Osborne than with Matt Murdock. Then the plot: that what one might call \"plot\" seemed to be individual scenes put together like some patch work by some kid in elementary school. The dialogues were as shallow as they could get. If the movie were a puddle of water, I'd say it is too shallow to even drown an amoeba!\n\nThank goodness, I went to see this s*** in a triple feature night with X-MEN and SPIDERMAN (I have seen both of them already more than 3 times in the theater), so at least I had something to look forward to.\n\nTo compare all three of them - I can only give X-MEN a first class rating. It\u00b4s got a decent cast, good action sequels (not that kind of action overkill XXX revealed), a recognizable plot and even a message.\n\nStill, I also find SPIDERMAN a surprisingly good film, especially due to its comic style and the wonderful acting of Tobey Maguire. You had to try to ignore Kirsten Dunst (same league as Mr. Affleck) though.\n\nSo, for anyone who had the stamina to read through my comment, here is my advise: do not touch (or worse) watch it! To watch it might lead you to displaying a lot of anger about lost time, wasted money and about the fact that there are people getting millions of US$ for creating something like that. Better wait for the X-MEN sequel - it might not be as good as the first movie, but it will beat DD anytime. (Don\u00b4t know, if this really is a praise, because in my opinion it doesn\u00b4t take much to beat DD.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Dare Devil was a complete surprise to me. I was expecting little and I got a lot. In fairness, it's nothing spectacularly new. Tim Burton's Batman films covered similar ground a decade ago, but Dare Devil has been unfairly roasted by critics and deserves better recognition. It has good fights and stunts, plus some colourful villains (especially the delightfully vicious Bullseye). The plot works in the usual childhood trauma nonsense to good effect, and there is a nice ambiguity to the way Dare Devil administers so-called justice as he tries to reassure himself `I'm not the bad guy.' Better still is the moral centre of the film, personified by the Catholic priest Dare Devil befriends, who encourages him to leave vengeance to God. There are some nice twists and turns in the tale too, as well as the obligatory sequel set-up.\n\nThe film was well directed, especially where the audience sees the sound wave vibrations the hero's POV. Performances were all fairly solid, and the special effects quite good despite one or two dodgy shots. I had a few nits to pick, such as the tedious and unnecessary sex scene with Jennifer Gardner (less annoying here than I usually find her). However, on the whole this is another fine addition to the recent ranks of good comic book adaptations, along with Spider-Man and X-Men."

Finally, both of the villains are well done in a campy sort of way.\n\nAs for the recent comparisons, I think it's a least as good as Spiderman, and is much better than the first X-Men movie.

I wouldn't do a better movie all by myself, would I?\n\nThis one made me wonder.\n\n\"Daredevil\" is a big-budget Hollywood picture, with experienced actors, probably a well-paid camera crew, make-up department, stylists, prop designers, audio/visual effects crew, and so on, and it is all based on a quite cool comic character. What could go wrong?\n\nFirst thing in this movie that felt wrong was the blind man, jumping around rooftops beating people up with his hi-tech white stick, philosophying about whether he is the bad guy or not, brutally killing rapists, all performed by Ben Affleck dressed up in kinky leather and designer boots.\n\nSecond thing that felt wrong was that the same blind man, who despite being blind, sees with his ears, apparently better than anyone with eyes. Especially in the dark. And especially when it rains. And especially ... what's the point with a character being blind if he still sees better than anyone else?\n\nThird thing is the \"Bullseye\" guy who, for reasons even less explained than the circumstances around the toxic waste accident that made Daredevil blind, has some kind of super powers allowing him to kill just about anyone just by throwing just about anything at him/her, and also getting away with it.\n\nFourth thing was the much too obvious use of supposedly cool music to convince the audience that whatever is now seen on screen is something really cool. Some guitar riffs and a nice pan over New York, to get us in the mood - then we get to see the Daredevil. Some rap/rock music - then the Bullseye guy. Some funky pop music - then the beautiful Elektra. And so on. Like if we are supposed to need a short break, every five minutes or so, from watching the \"acting\" and rest our eyes for a while at some beautiful landscape/city/sky, accompanied relaxing elevator music.\n\nThe fifth to about the thirtyeth things are all the wonderful Hollywood clich\u00e9s and rip-offs; a guy getting supernatural powers from toxic waste; a hero that manages to keep fighting despite being stabbed *through* the chest; a few pairs of the kind of boobs that makes poor young girls think they need silicon implants; slow-motion effects (some fast-forward would have been more suitable); a Lara Croft-type heroine (Christ! Why rip off \"Tomb Raider\"? It's a guaranteed catastrophe); good-guy-defeats-some-bad-guys-scheme plot; someone's loving father dies; a sex scene in the middle of the movie without any significance in the story whatsoever; vigorous attempts to create taglines (\"Stay. Stay with me\"); bad guy dies \"Die Hard\"-style, falling down from somewhere high, while looking angrily up at the hero; red roses used to create an illusion of symbolism; a big fat bald villain; a bad guy with goatee; climactic fight scene in a church; this movie has it all!\n\nI'm afraid I can't say anything rude about the plot, because there is none, and I don't think it would have been anything but confusing to try to incorporate something intelligent or artistic in a flick like this one.\n\nIf there was a coin in a 200-ton-pile of dung, I wouldn't start digging. Following the same logic, if I missed something worth seeing in this movie, I won't watch it again just to find out what that was either."

True, there is a lack of the real storyline to the comic book, but then again, the movie's only a little over one and a half hours. They make the story where the Daredevil is the main character, which it should be, but fails to support the other three characters, Elektra, Bullseye, and the Kingpin. Having no background of these characters only leads the viewers to questions such as, \"How did Bullseye get so good at aiming?\" The action scenes also suffer due to the length of the fights. They're pretty much straight to the point and aren't elaborated whatsoever. There are good things about the film that most people will not appreciate. Unlike the comic book movies such as Spiderman and X-men, Daredevil has a dark atmosphere about it that's reminiscent of Batman and Batman Returns, drawing the viewer's attention. Another positive note is how the creators utilized the soundtrack into key scenes in the movie. There's also humorous content that's better than most films like Daredevil. Whether you have or haven't read the comic, the movie is good overall. I enjoyed it."

A relatively unknown and unsuccessful director trying to adapt a virtually unknown comic book, starring an actor with a checkered resume, which does not include many action-hero roles. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the results. The cinematography was commendable, lending itself well to the dark, often chaotic world Matt Murdock inhabits. The movie made a point of not necessarily showcasing every single punch in a fight, but rather presented more \"realistic\" fight scenes (as realistic as one can expect in a superhero flick anyway). But the best component, in my estimation, is its presentation of Daredevil himself. This is a profoundly human superhero, as many people have mentioned. He takes his fair share of licks in any combat situation, even when he ultimately kicks a$$. Murdock is a scarred, battered man, both physically and emotionally. He does not hesitate to let a criminal die, yet contemplates whether he (Daredevil) is always in the right. The writing is not the deepest, or groundbreaking, but certainly as good as any in recent superhero movies. My only real gripe is that the villains do not receive a lot of screen time, which seems to be a prevalent trend of late. All in all, I give this movie a 7/10 and would rank it higher than X-Men. It is consistently entertaining, which is the most I usually expect from action flicks, and on top of that suffers from no major blunders. Is is Shakespeare? Hell no. But who said it should be?"

Daredevil, while on the more unbelievable side of super-hero characters, made sense, and his romance and subsequent fall-out with Electra made for some nice reading. This movie, however, manages to worse than X-Men 1, and even than Batman Forever. It all starts with casting. While Jennifer Garner has rightly been called eye-candy, Ben Affleck, slick (not to say greasy) as ever, is a complete mis-cast for Daredevil. To see him as a tragic character is a stretch for even the most gullible imagination. The story is muddled, and shakily paced, dragging on and on and on - without ever really gaining enough momentum to draw the viewer into the movie. The special effects belong in a video-game, and made me wonder where the budget on this went - especially since the music is some of the cheapest I've heard during recent years. The way strings, strings, and strings again, are used to evoke a romantic feeling during the rooftop scene where Daredevil sees Elektra's face by listening to the sounds of raindrops falling on it is sickening. Oh, and I wasn't the only one to be bored mindless by this. Several friends, none of them normally critical of standard Hollywood fare, who I watched this with, wholeheartedly agree with me. If you've got to watch this for any reason whatsoever (and I really can't imagine one), make sure to keep a bottle of hard liquor handy to ease the boredom and subdue the pain. Or better yet, watch X-Men 2 or Batman 2 instead, even should you already have seem them dozens of times before."

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing a great comic adaption done by Sam Raimi for Spider-man, I was pumped up to see another superhero take the big screen. Daredevil: Man without fear was more like man that needed to be a little more emotional. I'll just skip to the review points. Ben Affleck needs to be more emotional if he was to play a blind man. He is so stiff as his role as Matt Murdock. How he got the part is still beyond me. Jennifer Garner as Elecktra was decent but badly wasted in the film. Colin Farell as Bullseye was awesome! The sad thing though is that he doesn't wear a costume when his character does in the comics. Cheap budget I guess. Last, Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin? He was good too but the fact is that Kingpin is a white guy in all marvel comics. For now, Duncan's cool.\n\nMovie starts out great then we get treated to ultimately boring romance scene in the middle. Of course we get more of Ben Affleck's non-believable blind man acting. If the sequel does come out, I hope it won't turn out like this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Daredevil is the worst movie I've seen all year. It steals many of it's concepts from Spiderman, and it doesn't even pull them off. The same speaking throughout the film, parent/relative death/trama, and girl. I find it fascinating that these actors actually agreed to make this film, unworthy of being in the same theater as Lord of the Rings, Chicago, Adaptation, and The Hours. Many of the cast members have shown decent to exceptional acting, such as Michael Clarke Duncan who gave a great performance in The Green Mile, Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting, and Jennifer Garner in Alias. It's sickening that they would agree to make this only because of the paycheck. Do actors even care about quality films anymore? Not only is the story line slow and manipulative, the computer generated graphics are horrible. During the climax, a fight between Daredevil and Bulleye in a CHURCH on an ORGAN (lame location), the images before you are appear so fake, as if they jumped from a video game. The movie left me perplexed about the smallest unrealistic things, such as if he owns a small unsuccessful law firm, he's blind, and he keeps his identity unreveled, where did all his custom outfits and gadets come from? And is if he kills people who've been claimed innocent by the court why does he kill them? That's not what a \"hero\" would do, more like a murderer. I would not reccomend anyone see this film. It just overall sucks, plus Jennifer Garner dies in the end. They kill the best thing going for them."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is without a doubt the best superhero movie out there. Forget Spider-man with its colorful character swinging through the streets of new york. Forget Batman with it's dark brooding character and over the top comic to film transition. In half of the batman movies I half expected Wham Kasplat or kazump to show up in the middle of a fight scene. But this isn't about Batman, or spider-man for that matter. This is about Dare devil. A super hero that most people have never even heard of. Which is one of the reason's why it didn't do as good at the box office as it should have done. Which in hindsight this is a shame as some people out there are missing a great film. Right from the start we are drawn into the story by meeting a beaten up Ben Afflick in the title role. We then hear him say the immortal line \"they say that when you are about to die you see your whole life flash before your eye's. That is also true of a blind man\" And then of course we are taken to back to when the hero of the film was a normal boy growing up in a part of new york called hells kitchen. An origin story that to my mind hasn't been implemented as well in any other movie. The film doesn't let up from that moment either, and if superhero's existed they would exist in the form of dare devil. The scene where Mat Murdock return's home after dispensing of a really nasty rapist is masterful. Beaten and bruised he steps in the shower, and as the water trickles over his battered body you can see the blood trickling down the drain, then cut to his face as he pinches a single tooth that comes away from his jaw then clunks to the bottom of the shower with a ching. Then after stepping out we see him go straight to the medicine cabinet and pop some painkillers into his mouth. Then after stepping into his sound proof coffin so that he will not go mad from the high intensity sounds he is constantly hearing, he passes into something slightly less pleasurable than sleep. You know at this point that this is a super hero. There is no Aunt May or butler Alfred at home to cook him a nice cup of tea. He is completely alone. Doing what he does not to get thanks. But because he has the ability to do it. I don't even class this movie as a movie. This move is pure Art. Made and written by people that love the whole daredevil mythos. The man without fear. And to all those people that hated the movie I am sorry. I am sorry that the film hasn't got the recognition that it deserve's and i am sorry that everyone who hated the film so much hasn't really watched the film. Just remember as daredevil said in his own words. \"I'm not the bad guy\""

Jennifer Garner and Erick Avari (as the girl and her father) do the only decent acting among a cast that has every ability to do much better. When seeing 'Daredevil', I come to think how a blind man, though sharp senses, jumps 300 feet and catches a pole no wider than the regular at the playground. I wouldn't and I see well. Secondly, everyone seem to have muscle over mind. Marvel surely didn't pull it off with this one and I hope to see any sequel ideas go down the drain. 1/10"

This production I found much heavier and more intense, and mostly on the dark-side of humanity as shown by night scenes.

Or actually Nacheos but couldn't they think of something more creative? She looked great in the hand to hand scenes with Ben but the part when she started using those big knives at her house was real stupid. Bullseye actually says \"I want a bloody costume.\" What? Also there is a scene where Bullseye starts flying around the tops of the buildings. One other question before I finish is How can Daredevil fly around buildings like Spiderman? Why does he use a cain to walk but can kick the crap out of a room full of people? Got my money back. Please, don't see this. Dumb idea Ben and Jennifer couldn't save this crappy movie. Ben Affleck was pretty good, but this should of never been made into a movie. Dumb idea for a super hero. A handicapped superhero? P-lease."

The Action was good, the acting was fine, but the developement needed more. As well could they of please not borrowed from other Comic Hero Movies, including especially Daredevil's identity being discovered not once in the movie but three times! At least Batman, Superman and Spiderman all keep it down to the minimum. Lastly I feel that the fight with Fisk really didn't fit into the story, something that would of been better for a sequel in my humble opinion, but this was the least of the problems.\n\nSo Basically an Okay film, but if they had filled in the story with more background and connected each scene together more smoothly, this film could of been allot better received by its viewers."

Guy is disliked by the masses, gets powers, gets suits and even gets the girl and destroys the big evil bad guy. This follows exactly that. The fight sequences are choreographed by a 2nd grader because they look like a 7 yr old flinging their toys. The characters are too damn annoying and they are supposed to be meant to be liked! Especially Jon Favreau's Foggy Nelson. This guy is supposed to be the comic relief? This is the first time i'm going to say this but netflix did it better. Matt Murdock had zero personality and Wilson Fisk was the most cliche super hero villain. Seriously Ben Affleck? Seriously Jon Favreau?

        "review_detailed_main": "Daredevil is a 2003 superhero film written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson and is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.\n\nThe film stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who fights for justice as a masked vigilante Daredevil. Jennifer Garner plays the love interest, Elektra Natchios. Colin Farrell plays the merciless assassin Bullseye and the late Michael Clarke Duncan plays Wilson Fisk, also known as the crime lord Kingpin.\n\nI will review how I feel about this movie and I also will review the special features on the 2-disc special edition that I have.\n\nThe plot is simple: By day, blind attorney Matt Murdock toils for justice in Hell's Kitchen. By night, he's Daredevil -- The Man Without Fear -- a powerful, masked vigilante stalking the dark streets with an uncanny radar sense that allows him to see with superhuman capabilities. But when the love of his life, fiery Elektra Natchios, is targeted by New York City's ruthless Kingpin of Crime and his deadly assassin Bullseye, Daredevil may be about to meet his match. Elektra is killed by Bullseye and Daredevil takes both of them down, but lets Kingpin be handed over to the cops.\n\nThe film is on my Top 10 Underrated Movies list on IMDb and I really hated that critics did not like this film, as well as most comic book fans because of the casting choices. Ben Affleck has gone on to say that playing this role was stupid and the worst things he's ever done. To this day, him and co-star and real life wife, Jennifer Garner, are still married.\n\nThe acting is this movie is amazing. Ben Affleck gives an amazing performance as Matt Murdock / Daredevil. Jennifer Garner plays the love interest Elektra and she does great in her role, until Bullseye hurts and kills her. Colin Farrell plays Bullseye and he is just menacing and creepy in the role. Michael Clarke Duncan plays Wilson Fisk / Kingpin and this was a good performance for the late actor, as his other performance as an inmate in The Green Mile was amazing as well. For The Green Mile, he deserved that Oscar and I will forever be angry that he didn't get it.\n\nJon Favreau plays Foggy Nelson and he would direct the first two Iron Man films and Cowboys & Aliens. David Keith plays Matt's father, Jack \"The Devil\" Murdock and he is amazing as well. Joe Pantoliano played Ben Urich and he was cool in his role as well. Scott Terra plays young Matt Murdock and he is not horrible.\n\nThe visual effects and sound effects, including when Daredevil uses his superhuman powers saves this movie, as well as the acting and direction that this movie took. The script by Mark Steven Johnson is really cool and his direction matches everything that was in that screenplay.\n\nGraeme Revell composed the music and my favorite theme is the \"Daredevil Theme\" and the soundtrack has great pop and rock songs here and there by Drowning Pool featuring Rob Zombie, Hoobastank, Fuel, The Calling, Revis and Evanescence, who sings \"Bring Me to Life\".\n\nOverall, DAREDEVIL is okay, but I just wish the critics or comic book fans did not criticize this movie as bad as they did and the film was successful enough to create a spin-off film, Elektra, which was released in 2005 and I will get to that soon.\n\nThe special features on the 2-disc DVD are incredible. On the first disc, you have an enhanced viewing mode that allows you to see how the visual effects were created with commentary by visual effects producer John Kilkenny, an on-screen trivia track about the comics and the film, including it's production. The audio commentary by Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster is really amazing .\n\nOn the second disc, there are two documentaries: 1): \"Creating Daredevil: The Man Without Fear\", which explains the comic books of Daredevil and with interviews by all of the comic book people who worked on Daredevil, including the man himself, Stan Lee. 2): the making-of documentary, \"Beyond Hell's Kitchen: Making Daredevil\", with the cast and crew and behind-the-scenes interviews.\n\nThere is also an HBO first look of the film, a documentary with the blind consultant on the film, Tom Sullivan. There are three music videos and that is really cool.\n\nThere are also six production featurettes, a screen test featuring Jennifer Garner, a featurette about the Kingpin character, with the late Michael Clarke Duncan being interviewed, photo galleries, multi-angle scene studies of two fight scenes in the film and theatrical trailers including 3 of this film's trailers and the other two being other Fox films called \"28 Days Later\" and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\".\n\nThe movie's special features on the two-disc special edition are really cool and the movie is really cool. The movie is an OK Marvel movie.\n\nI know there is a director's cut, but it's R rated, so if I can find it, I will check that out.\n\nMovie: 6.5/10 Special Features on the DVD: 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Daredevil is the long awaited film adaptation of the famous comic book from Marvel Comics. It joins the ranks of other comic book adapted films that have hit screens over the past years: namely Batman, Spider-Man, X-Men, and Spawn. What do you get when you combine every comic book adapted movie into a single film? The answer is Daredevil. Daredevil, for the most part, is just the same rehashed superhero shtick that we've seen several times over in the past years. Does that make it a bad movie? Not necessarily, but it doesn't make it a great one, either. There are two problems here than any layman could propose. For one, perhaps Daredevil was converted into a movie after all the other really great comic book superhero films were made. That's debatable, I guess. I wonder how different Daredevil would be if it had been made during the mid-1990s? By that rationale, maybe it wouldn't seem to have been just a rehashed superhero flick. Second, Daredevil is not only just a rehash of everything we've seen before in superhero flicks, but it seems to literally feel like them too. I attended this film with a friend and we could easily point out where the films visual affects had been seen before. For example, a shot of Daredevil jumping off a building and the camera staying close behind him, that was Batman Forever. Second, scenes of Daredevil swinging around through the air are obviously reminiscent of Spider-Man. I wouldn't go so far as to call Daredevil a rip-off of these other superhero flicks, but it sure isn't original. Daredevil is the story of a blind man who fights to avenge his father's death. Boy, if I had $10 every time I've seen that scenario in a film, I'd be as rich as the good people over at Twentieth-Century Fox! Daredevil is undeniably a box-office hit with early weekend estimates showing it making $43.5 million in its first three days of ticket sales. This film will easily climb the box-office chart to earn over $100 million in probably just over a week, or two. Nonetheless, the film's apparent success can be contributed to the box-office drawing power of Ben Affleck. Affleck is a really versatile actor. By that, I mean he can give a superb performance like in Good Will Hunting, then turn around and do a crappy performance in a film like Pearl Harbor. But Affleck has part of the Austin Powers curse in that women do want him, but I don't think that many guys want to be him. Perhaps, beat him? Ha, ha! Ben Affleck isn't the only real box-office draw to this film, although he is the primary. Daredevil also stars the radiant Jennifer Garner, who recently was seen in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. Her very entrance is just as intoxicating to the eye as when audiences first saw Ursula Andress on the big screen in the 1962 James Bond flick, Dr. No. She has a few good moves in this film, kicking some butt here and there.\n\nI have to point out Daredevil's psychotic Irish hit man, Bullseye, played by Colin Farrell. Farrell is becoming somewhat of a box-office sensation these days. He appeared in Steven Spielberg's Minority Report last summer. And you can see Farrell is the recently released spy flick, The Recruit, also starring Al Pacino. Look for Farrell is the upcoming suspense flick, Phone Booth, due out in April. Among other talented actors in Daredevil are Michael Clark Duncan as the Kingpin, Joe Pantoliano as the journalist Ben Urich, and Jon Favreau who adds a sense of wit to the whole production. Favreau steals every seen he is in. The bottom line folks, is that we've been here and we've don't that! Daredevil actually met my expectations, which weren't too high to begin with. It's okay if you are looking for the same basic superhero/comic book film that we've seen in the past years. It's not as good as Spider-Man, though. Spider-Man was down right fun, exciting, and clean entertainment that both kids and adults could marvel at. However, Daredevil proves to be a little too violent at times. This can be attributed to Colin Farrell's character Bullseye, whose brand of killing involves the use of any kind of really sharp object. Nonetheless, I think the idea of converting comic books into motion pictures is a good idea. But maybe it's time to give the whole superhero genre a little break. There's more to comic books than just superheroes. I'll bet many of you didn't know that Road To Perdition, one of last year's finest films was actually a graphic novel before it became a movie. But as for Daredevil, just watch Spider-Man again. **1/2"

(At least people weren't over Matrixed like they would soon be in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle). I felt Affleck's Matt Murdock was quite good, and the other principles were well cast. The only complaint I had was that the movie was so dark, you couldn't see some of the fight scenes. Other than that, I am eagerly awaiting a sequel, and am fast becoming a fan of the series."

Some of the cons of the movie is that the movie rushes through it's origin. While some movies linger far too long on a characters origin (Malcolm X as a hustler) this one manages to cut shot a lot of drama and tragedy with Matt Murdock losing his eyesight. Ben Affleck is also a very wooden actor and it seems like Jenifer Gardner was phoning it in as well. The movie is also nowhere close to how good the comic is. However, one of the biggest saving graces of the movie is Michael Clarke Duncan. Despite not looking like the original Kingpin he is very intimating and I felt like he was one of the few actors actually delivering a performance in the movie."

The action was a little bit too quick for my eyes, the costumes were a little too sado maso for me. The director tried to imitate the Tim Burton Batman atmosphere and was successful - but only to the extent that many scenes were pretty dark, so dark you could only guess what was happening.\n\nSo what remains? A decent action movie which is quite brutal at times, still worth watching if you like Superhero movies. But nothing compared to X-Men and Spiderman. A pity."

I like the fact that Daredevil/Matt was at a crossroads in his life, that he didn't know anymore if he was \"the bad guy\" or not.

He often said yes to all of them.\n\nThe character of Daredevil is just like all of the comic book characters we read, he has an origin. Young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra) is picked on by bullies while his father (David Keith) can't catch a break in winning one game until a freak accident occurs to young Matt where radioactivity waste hits his eyes blinding the young boy where he has to realize that he can't give up. He realizes that even though he can't see, Matt has gained more within his other senses where he can get a radar vision on what he's seeing despite not being able to see at all. His father gets killed by The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) after realizing that he was suppose to lose in a fight rather than win.\n\nAs years pass, Matt (played by Ben Affleck) is part lawyer working for those who can't afford to pay and part vigilante who goes by the name of Daredevil, who leaves his trademark after capturing the bad guys.\n\nOther characters include Elektra (Jennifer Garner) a beautiful and sophisticated Greek goddess who's the daughter of a billionaire who happens to meet upon Matt where she takes interest in him. Joe Pantoliano plays Ben Urich, a reporter who tries to convince the cops and everybody else that Daredevil is not really a villain but out for justice. Prior to The Kingpin, another villain named Bullseye (Colin Farrell) is called by Kingpin to get rid of the the blind hero and kill Elektra's father.\n\nSome parts of the film work, but I had a hard time believing Ben Affleck could play a comic book hero since he often plays sidekicks or people THAT really deserved to die (Armageddon and Pearl Harbor). I however liked the rest of the cast despite that I'm not used to Daredevil compared to characters like Wolverine and Spider-Man."

The other problems 1: this movie is that the camera moment is not good enough. 2: acting is not good enough. 3: like I just say, the story line sucks. 4: Not as good as the comic 5: That chick's character looks so artificial. 6: The villain is pretty cool at first, but a pussy at last. 7: The action is not good enough. 8: The ending sucks 9: The director should know how to control the action and the love scene and not just trying to focus on the \"pose\". 10: The trailer is better than the movie.\n\nSo anyway, my point is \"You don't have to watch this movie if you already watch the trailer!\" PS: I know some people will not like my opinion, but this is from my heart."

        "review_detailed_main": "The only thing that kept my hope alive for Daredevil the movie, aside from my love for Frank Miller and John Romita, Jr. era Daredevil, was the writer/director status of Mark Steven Johnson, and how hard he fought to direct his own script. Other than that, I expected to be disappointed (more underwhelmed) just as I had with Spider-Man and X-Men. And while Daredevil is better than those two, it's not quite a step in the right direction. This is still a first installment as opposed to a successfully interesting movie, in of itself. But that's a lot to ask from a Hollywood movie of this magnitude, so why be pessimistic in a war that can't be won? X-Men suffered from a lack of character focus (Wolverine got the most screen time, but aside from barely learning about the evils of the Canadian government (what is up with that, anyway? Canada's responsible?) his character hardly develops.) Matt Murdock/Daredevil, however, is the only character Mark Steven Johnson seems to care about. Does this justify rendering all other characters with tacked-to-the-wall-and-squirming development? No. The Kingpin, Elektra, and the stupidly-attired Bullseye all enter Daredevil's life from tangents, and while his direction may have changed from beginning to end, and he may have \"saved himself,\" the integrity of the characters would have improved had Johnson allowed any of them to run parallel to Daredevil for more than a moment. It might also have helped the audience give a crap about them, and heightened their threat. The Kingpin and Bullseye only seem threatening because we're told they're evil; killing a guy in a bar fight is a w**ky thing to do, but hardly Evil. On the plus side, Ben Affleck did not suck. He was my greatest reservation about this movie, but, as opposed to Spider-Man and all of the X-Men, Affleck looked comfortable in the suit, making for a believable hero. The inner-conflict Daredevil deals with regarding the appropriate extent of justice throughout the movie--does a hero kill?--sustains the mortality usually associated with character, and that's good. The plot was less formulaic than expected--even beyond \"the sad part\" every Daredevil fan should know is bound to happen--giving a fine balance to the entire film. Johnson has created a strong and interesting protagonist, able to survive in a climate of blockbuster sequels. It's just a climate that sucks."

        "review_detailed_main": "As the release date of Daredevil approached, I became more and more skeptical of Ben Affleck's ability to actually pull-off a super-hero movie. After seeing it last night though, I no longer doubt this ability, nor do I doubt anybody else's abilities in the all-star cast.\n\nThe fighting scenes were excellently done. The presentation of Daredevil's superhuman senses was even better than I imagined. Jennifer Garner is one of the hottest actresses who can kick anyone's ass. Michael Clarke Duncan's gave a great performance as the Kingpin. Collin Farrell is one of my new favorite villain's in Bullseye. Everything about this movie is just as dark as it is truly beautiful.\n\nThere were two major elements about the movie that made me give it a score of 8 instead of 10 though. First, when Daredevil kills that rapist in the subway, the problem is that in the comic books, Daredevil has never maintained a \"criminals must die\" mentality. He has actually gotten into fights with other superheroes over this belief, so when this happened in the movie, I was a little miffed. Somebody has brought it to my attention that Daredevil actually killed his first criminal on his first outing in his hero persona, but my only response to that would be the fact that the incident in the subway station was presented as not being Daredevil's \"first time\".\n\nSecond, the god-awful soundtrack is touted around scene after scene in the movie. The main problems with this is that: a.) The music really, REALLY sucks; and b.) The music dates the movie. Watching the movie 10 years from now when our culture's preferences in music have changed will make us more critical of this movie in the long run. Nobody is going to remember these songs or the people who sang them in ten years, and I wish that they were not there to begin with.\n\nOther than that, I can't understand why there are so many people who didn't like this movie. If you liked Spider-man, you'll like this movie even better because, simply put, Daredevil is a better movie. The plot is well-written, the characters are as likeable as they are believable, and the special-effects/fight scenes are top-notch. It really is great that the Marvel superheroes are getting treated so well in the film industry."

No emotional payoff. Ever. Just distance. The flick alludes to Matt Murdock's inner demons, his fears, his losses, the tension between his two lives. But you never sympathize or empathize. Either the director didn't give enough screen time for feelings instead of emotions, or he shot the footage and it's on the cutting room floor.\n\nThe combat is weak, despite hand-to-hand and fighting sticks being the Daredevil's stock in trade. See a Jet Li flick instead.\n\nThe CGI characters that leap 50 to 100 feet are unreal.\n\nAny one of these would have been enough to tank the film.\n\nThe worst crime is that done to the spirit of Hell's Kitchen. It's a dirty, scummy, vice ridden, violent, dangerous place. Corruption and money denies city services to these poorest of New York. So the streets are strewn with garbage, the people are sick from industrial waste and filth-spawned disease, the cops only come when it is too late, youth gangs and organized crime rule with fear, and brutalized children starve. Despair gives hope a daily body blow.\n\nThat gritty sensibility ain't on screen. So this people's champion is out of context.\n\nDaredevil is supposed to be the spiritual counterpoint to the Kitchen's open wound. A gifted man defending the oppressed and helpless against oppressive forces in an uncaring world.\n\nThe film just doesn't get it across. Maybe if they cut the budget across the board, they'd have made a better movie. Fewer wasted effects, deeper character and plot development. The story begs for an indie film touch.\n\nSo: skip it."

This isn't the fabulous movie I always imagined could be made from that material, but it is very, very, good.\n\nIt is completely different in tone from other comic book adaptations, and if you go in expecting Blind Spiderman you may be sorely disappointed. Rest assured that lukewarm reviews that find it lacking are judging it as a popcorn blockbuster, and it's not that kind of movie at all. It is darker and much more adult; it evokes genuine emotion over the fate of its protagonists.\n\nIt may be impossible to make a movie that has great comic-book style thrills and a great real human story -- developing the latter just doesn't leave enough time for the former. (You could do it in a mini-series or a weekly series, as Buffy the Vampire Slayer has proved.) Ultimately each of the sides of Daredevil is less than perfectly satisfying. But nevertheless it's a real treat to see them both in the same movie. This is my second favorite comic-book adaptation, after The X-Men. 8/10."

Aside from the fact that all but one of them are hideously poorly lit (perhaps the cinematographer thought the audience should identify with the blind protagonist?) there's no tension, no long shots which allow us to view the action and appreciate the mobility of these supposedly athletic characters. What we get instead is some very poorly timed wirework, and some inhuman looking CGI. The Matrix this ain't. Sad. Strangely, the only parts of this movie that worked were some of the dramatic scenes. In particular, Ben Affleck's early interactions with his partner at the law firm remind us that there is an actor hiding in this movie, underneath the leather grope suit. Sadly, he's not allowed to come out and do his thing. D+"

In its favoutr, the\n\n\"radar vision\" of Daredevil is very well done, and Colin Farrell's\n\nBullseye is entertaining but underused. In the hands of a better film maker, this could have been great, but\n\nJohnson is lacking an originality that would have elevated this to\n\nthe same sort of level as the original Batman. The fight scenes are\n\nfilmed almost all in fast flashy close up cuts that show neither who\n\nis winning, or how the fighting is done. The early fight between Matt\n\nand Elextra is better, as Johnson shows some restraint and\n\nactually lets us see the two of them fighting rather than just\n\nshowing a blur of hands and weapons. The characters are underdeveloped, and I felt that Electra,\n\nBullseye, Kingpin and even Foggy were extended cameo's more\n\nthan real parts. Matt Murdoch showed signs of depth, but never\n\nproperly scraped the surface. My final gripe ( of many !) is the structure of the piece. Instead of\n\nbuilding to a climax, it just saunters along without a real plot to\n\nspeak of. I felt liked I'd been robbed of a big finish. This may sound harsh, and maybe I need to see it again, but hey, I\n\njust feel let down."

Shaky camera, flashing lights and too tight zooms are the trademarks of this unforgiveable style. How about this, hire stars who can actually fight, or at least look like they are doing the fighting themselves. This is especially true of the leading character.\n\nI never read the Daredevil comics, so I can't say how bad the casting is as far as accuracy to the characters. But I can say that the supporting characters were much more enjoyable than the main ones. Jennifer Garner and Collin Farrel I thought did well in their roles. Michael Clarke Duncan was well cast, although he gave a slightly flat performance.\n\nThe story was pretty flat as well. The story just kind of jumps into there being a conflict between Kingpen and Daredevil. There isn't a buildup it just is there. Yeah there is some backstory, but it explains, it doesn't create. Along with unwatchable action scenes, I hate having a romance shoehorned into an action movie.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie at the last showing of the opening day at 10:35 p.m. and the place was packed. I had thought it would be, but for a late-ish showing, this was sort of impressive. I could feel the excitement in the air. This movie had had non-comic book fans buzzing for over a year, let alone those that had followed the story avidly since its birth in the pages of the popular Marvel series. I, myself, had been looking forward to this film since the first trailers. The only preconceived negative notions I had toward the movie were those regarding my previous opinion of Ben Affleck's sub-par acting prowess. But I was even on the fence about that. So, anyway, the movie began and I was drawn in right away by the visual effects including the interesting Braille/cityscape opening titles and the literally awesome image of Daredevil himself wrapped around a sky-scraping cross. This movie had so much promise, it made me tingle. Would they delve into Matt Murdock's personal struggle of the virtue of vigilante-ism? Would they highlight the interesting religious symbolism in the story? Would there at least be some innovative action scenes and stunning special effects? The answer to these questions and many more was \"Not really.\" What followed the promising beginning was a corny, sloppily-written, un-clever screenplay with mostly mediocre acting and only semi-exciting fight sequences. The story had gaping holes that only grew as the plot literally unraveled (i.e. Why did Matt use blasting music to drown out noise in the beginning if loud noises hurt him so terribly, as was illustrated in the preposterous organ fight scene near the end?) There were a couple of scenes that suggested a tongue-in-cheek quality (i.e. Matt and Electra's childlike fight in the playground, Bullseye catching every piece of a shattered stain-glass window in perfect stacks and pitching them at an inexplicably back-flipping Daredevil), but the style was so muddy that I couldn't be sure whether these were purposefully amusing or unintentionally ridiculous. Ben Affleck's performance solidified my previous feelings on his abilities, or, more appropriately, lack thereof and Jennifer Garner's performance was only as good as the script (suggesting that she did the best she could with what she was given). Colin Farrell as Bullseye turned in the film's best performance as an engagingly creepy and often funny villain who could have better filled this movie than did the titular character. Jon Favreau, too, did a fine job as Matt Murdock's attorney buddy, Franklin and Kevin Smith made a cute cameo mid-film. As for the action, I would say it was as mediocre as was the acting. There were one or two scenes that were up to par (i.e. Daredevil vs. Bullseye on motorcycle), but the rest used rehashed stop-motion Matrix techniques and other methods making the fact that Daredevil and Electra are mere humans out of the realm of suspension of disbelief. Overall, I would give this movie a four out of ten, which is not terrible. It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was incredibly disappointing, especially in comparison to other super hero movies like X-Men or the sublime Unbreakable."

I think it needed a little more character development, more moments in the costume, and longer fight scenes. I also didn't like the music in the film and maybe it just my theater, but the movie was very dark visually. Sometimes I could hardly make out what was happening on screen.

The same goes with Elektra Natchios, Jennifer Garner does a great job, however we don't really get to know her character well enough but I guess we will when her movie comes out in 2005. I thought they went a bit fast with the pairing of Matt & Elektra, however it's a story that I think will be captivating if they decide to make another Daredevil movie and build on it.

Okay, maybe that is what they intended but it wasn't for me. I liked Jennifer Garner and also I found myself wishing for more screen time for Colin Farrell. The special effect and stunts were good but not up to the standards I have seen in other top movies. Finally, the movie had too much dark scenary for me.

The Good and the Bad come out pretty much exactly even, which is really unusual. Therefore, this movie really isn't worth your time, unless you're a big fan of the character like me and want to get all depressed about how this film definitely isn't all Daredevil deserved. THE GOOD: Ben Affleck. He's a pretty decent Daredevil. There's some cheese (see bad), but he mostly pulls it off by playing it straight. No nonsense. Jon Favreau is really really funny in this. Actually, the humor as a whole is fantastic. Laugh out loud even. The fight scenes are pretty awesome, despite some over reliance on CGI, which has caused the film to age a bit more than it should. Colin Farrell is having a ball as Bullseye. Absolutely over the top glory. Another case of wonderful humor, though this is much darker. I like it!\n\nTHE BAD: The cinematography. EVERYTHING IS BLUE! Seriously! What the hell? This ruins the costumes! Daredevil is red, therefore in blue lighting he looks purple! Stop it with the blue and make lights orange or yellow or red so that the superhero looks like he should! The costumes: Aren't red enough, and Bullseye looks kinda dumb at times. I'm not a fan of the leather jacket style taken with Daredevil, and Electra looks all wrong in her one scene as Electra. Jennifer Gardner is not a good Electra. Not that she gets to be Electra very much (she spends most of the film as a love interest who's inexplicably good at fighting, which, thinking about it, is never really explained). That damn play-park scene. If you've seen the movie, you know exactly what I'm talking about. He might as well be wearing a sign on his back saying \"kick me, I'm Daredevil!\". Ugh....\n\nSo, yeah. Would have been better if it was just a straight adaptation of Born Again, but I suppose this leaves that open to people with more talent, not that Marvel will let that happen. (kudos for including Daredevils mother by-the-way. Nice touch. Same with every incidental character being named after a comic writer or artist who's worked on Daredevil).\n\n5/10 for being half good and half bad."

This is one dark movie and that is definitely in tone with some of the storylines as established in the series. The amount of violence and the actual results of the violence is significantly greater than in previous comic movies.\n\nBen Affleck handles his lead role fairly well. He portrays the hero who has some enhanced abilities but is bottom line just human and his body feels the pain more than everyone knows. The scene with the medicine cabinet was priceless for it's feel of truth. Michael Clark Duncan is perfect as The Kingpin, his arch-nemesis. I realize that is not accurate casting as compared with the comic but I honestly can't think of anyone else to portray him. Colin Farrell was great as Bullseye. He also wasn't completely accurate but he seemed to be having a great time with the role. Jennifer Garner is probably the weakest link. She portrays the character much as the one that obviously won her the role (Alias on television) but it is a poorly written character and has even less to do with the comic than the others.\n\nI wasn't overjoyed by this one but I wasn't too depressed either."

        "review_detailed_main": "While not a totally abhorable film, DAREDEVIL fails in many areas. First, the Daredevil character is not as well known as say the likes of Batman, Superman, or the recent Spiderman. To make the DAREDEVIL film following the box office smash SPIDERMAN, it would have to live up to the web slinger. It just doesn't.\n\nDAREDEVIL falls prey to the comic book hero rubric, in that there is an accident that gives the hero his/her powers and a family death that provides for motivation in the use of those powers, and that is exactly it, nothing new.\n\nThe characters, particularly the Daredevil himself are not horrible, but nothing special and certainly not very memorable. Ben Affleck's performance is mediocre at best and his portrayal of the blind man doesn't seem very realistic, more of just a scripted portrayal. Jennifer Garner's as Elektra is nothing special either. What could have been a promising character (no doubt Garner was made for the part) was cut short and just there for kicks (literally). Micheal Clarke Duncan's talent is gone to waste as well, as his character (the Kingpin) is not given much screen time, nor do we ever learn much about him. Colin Farrel is the one who truly steals the show. His over the top, yet effective portrayal of the Bullseye is very daunting and quite creepy at times. Of all the good talent this movie holds within itself, it goes to waste here.\n\nFinally, the fight scenes are nothing new and are not that creative. This is in part due to Daredevil's weapons, or lack thereof. They become just like swordfights or little duals and do not have the alure of Spiderman's or Batman's fight scenes.\n\nOverall, not a very successful attempt to bring a superhero underdog to the bigh screen. This movie is a typical superhero movie without much creativity, and like I mentioned earlier part of that is just due to the lack of creativity with the Daredevil story.\n\nNot offering anything new, but still managing to withstand itself, I give DAREDEVIL a 4/10."

I just don't see the point. Ben played the role perfectly, even if the original wasn't that dark, he convinced the audience he truly was dark inside, and that there was more to him than just a stereotypical \"good guy\". One could tell he stayed true to the comic book character, as did the rest of the cast. Daredevil was simply great in the movie (directors cut better of course)and most of which was because of Affleck. Not many others could have pulled it off, and with the great cast of Jennifer Garner and Michael Clarke...damn...near perfect casting there. Jennifer Garner also kicked some major booty, even though I was expecting her as Karen Paige, but with that there would have been no way it could have been rated pg-13. Elektra did surprise me though, and in a very good way i'd like to add. So all I'm saying to those who disliked Ben or the movie in general, just go sit down and watch the Director's Cut, even the original, or refer to the comic books (Frank Miller's), and trust me, you will see Daredevil really is The Man Without Fear."

I suppose you have to forgive the usual superhero shtick where a \"normal man\" (Affleck's Murdock) who is blind seems to acquire super-athleticism alongside his hyper-attuned senses. But that's the least of the film's problems.\n\nThe performances are almost universally dreadful. Affleck is charmless and smug (as usual), Farrell was clearly inspired by Patty O'Brien, Dr Evil's Irish henchman, and Michael Clarke Duncan is just a very large man. I think Jennifer Garner was trying to act, but her character arc (falling in love with her stalker) is ridiculous.\n\nIt's clearly going for a comic book look, with lots of angled camera shots and contrasting colours, but the fight scenes that aren't straight copies of The Matrix are concealed in shadows. Daredevil beats up a bar full of bad guys and all you can actually see is him sliding down a bannister.\n\nThe script is cliched and lacks any kind of verbal maturity. At least you can follow the story - it's really very simple - which is not always the case with comic book adaptations.\n\nThe rock/hip-hop soundtrack includes big hits from the early 00s - but contributes to the general dated feel of the film.\n\nNot bad enough to be a guilty pleasure. Just plain bad."

This film was released in February/March of 2003,and that is generally NOT a good sign.\n\nBlind defense attorney Matt Murdoch(Ben Affleck,handsome and ineffectual as always)defends the scum of society,gets them off and then hunts them down to exact his own justice. At some point,he crosses paths with Elektra Natchios(Jennifer Garner(sexy,not particularly effecting either) in his war against dominant crime boss Kingpin(Michael Clarke Duncan,who may be miscast here) and the maniacal assassin he's employed,who goes by the id of Bullseye(Colin Farrell,who is really \"Irishing\" it up here). She wrongly believes that HE is responsible for her father's murder and thus begins a sort of revenge-fueled,three-way war between and among the title character and no fewer than three other super-characters. Somewhat along for the ride(and,IMHO probably the best turn in the show) is Matt's colleague Froggy Nelson(Jon FAvreau),who kind of acts as Matt/Daredevil's friend and conscience.\n\nI'm not too tough to please with comic-book movies generally,and this movie was not a complete waste of time,but it did feel like it was made almost entirely for looks. A very showy set,special effects and series of fight sequences allows for one to be distracted but not necessarily entertained or satisfied. I suppose if one isn't too picky with their Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Actioner movies,this film will be a decent--maybe even great--renter. For anyone else,it might seem rather forced and easily forgettable. Give it a try and see if you don't agree."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a Daredevil fan since I was seven and I liked the movie. I do admit that it was not very good. Trying to avoid any biases, I'll give you my take.\n\nThe worst parts of the movie were directing and Writing. The movie could have benefited from a much better director. Ang Lee would have been great for this film rather than MSJ. The script forced some of the actors to say lines that were just insufferable. \"I'm not the bad guy\", \"that's the C-Train\", \"Stay. Stay with me.\" AAAAAHHHHH!!! No actor should have to say ridiculous lines like that. Due to the slightly low budget, director and the producers the movie also walked a weird line between ultra-CGI Spiderman and non-digital Batman (original). Personally I think that the movie could have been done without excessive digital effects. In the commentary the MSJ admits that the CGI was atrocious at times. Daredevil, in terms of superpowers, is more like Batman than Spiderman and more stuff like the opening fight scene would have been nice.\n\nThe cast, in my opinion was excellent. There were plenty of moments in the movie that made me believe Ben was a good choice. He performed well in the courtroom as Matt Murdock and at the end against Kingpin. Farell was obnoxious (perfect), Jennifer Garner was solid as Electra, and Michael Clarke-Duncan was the best possible choice for Kingpin. They were good; too bad the script didn't make good use of them. Ben definitely is not the best actor out there, but he could have done well in a better situation.\n\nIn the end, it was not horrible, but not good either. I saw it a couple times and bought the director's cut (which I recommend. It is better). I try to see the potential in it and kind of gloss over the lame parts but sometimes they're just too bad to ignore. In spite of it all, I'd recommend it to hardcore DD fans because it's cool to see your favorite superhero on screen but I would not recommend it to people looking for a good movie to watch on a Friday night."

Credit should be given to Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell, and John Favreau. Ben Affleck - who is a huge Daredevil comic fan - completely nails the role of Matt Murdock/Daredevil, Jennifer Garner is a great female action heroine whose Elektra is truly electrifying. To call Colin Farrell's performance over the top is a major understatement. Farrell chews up the scenery and plays the psychotic super-assassin perfectly. John Favreau is funny and earnest as Murdock's best friend and Law partner.\n\nCan't wait until the sequels to see other classic storylines such as Guardian Devil and Born Again adapted.

Sure Michael Clarke Duncan was sort of corny, and, yes, sadly Jennifer Garner looked really campy. But you can't take credit away from where credit is due. The visual effects are amazing. So much better than Spiderman. A much darker, more film-noir type espionage than it's Marvel counterpart of last year. Also; as with Spiderman the thrill-a-minute spectacular also produces a killer soundtrack with a variety of tracks from both popular and up and coming artists. The filn does not stray far from its comic roots, which is a good thing, since Kevin Smith has turned Daredevil into a phenomenal realistic superhero rivaling other Marvel Creations like Spiderman and the Uncanny X-Men. Smith's cameo is also quite amusing. As far as skeptics go, Daredevil has a lot. Perhaps the hype can kill a film, but maybe this is due to how hype is related to commercialism. Those of you who know me probably think I'm going to go into one of my anti-commercialism rants now, but I'm merely giving my input on a film. I, for one, have read and enjoyed both the original Daredevil series, and Smith's adaptation. I think the film is a fantastic adaptation of both works. Give credit where credit is due and understand that although the acting may not be phenomenal, at least the film makers had the guts to try something different. They could have easily made $400 million US by doing a cheesy teen romance flick and cast big names like Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire. But instead, the film relays a dark setting. Such as the case, with such a story. Such a comic can not be adapted into a campy film such as Spiderman. Thanks for reading."

The examples are endless - some nonsensical romance in a coffee shop followed by a duel in a playground, a man with a literal bullseye carved into his forehead throwing paper clips around, and of course the Evanescence soundtrack. The scenes that are actually good are unfortunately too scattered and disconnected to really amount to much, like the irrelevant subplot in the courtroom which barely has anything to do with Kingpin's scenes.

I thought the effects were good, the story fairly compelling and the acting solid. It was straight faced and (mostly) realistic. The opening scene in a church sets a great tone for the film, and I loved that fact that he pulls a tooth out of his mouth after a fight.\n\nWhat I didn't like was that many of the fight scenes were confusing and dark, especially the first one. They do get better, though, and their are some genuinely cool scenes.\n\nAlso, I thought \"Bullseye\" was a bit too much. Colin Ferrel was good, but some of the things he did were needlessly overdone. The scene during the closing credits is especially stupid.\n\nOverall, though, a pretty good addition to the new wave of superhero movies. It's darker and less mainstream than last summer's \"Spider Man\", but then so are the comics. 7 out of 10."

His acting, his build, his physical presence and moves during the fight scenes were all terrible. Even with the aid of computers and trick photography he looked slow and not a very impressive martial artist. His leather S&M suit was bad, too. The overall story was weak as well. The rest of the cast was decent, although Duncan's performance wasn't confident enough to convey the Kingpin's knowledge that he pulls all of the strings, always. But in the end it's Affleck that ruins it. Not recommended."

Now nearly 6 years later i decided to pick this up on Blu-ray. I hadn't seen the director's cut version until just now and simply put it is a great improvement over the theatrical version. It is darker and grittier thanks to a whole scenario involving a murder of a prostitute and the trial following that Matt Murdock decides to join in on. The romance between Affleck and Garner has been less emphasized to put more emphasis on Daredevil's crime fighting in Hells Kitchen.\n\nPros: A interesting superhero film set in realism, Jon Favreau's comic relief, More depth to characters and story thanks to Director's cut and a pitch perfect origin to Matt Murdock becoming Daredevil that is faithful to the comics Cons: Colin Farell's overacting as Bullseye, A few cringe worthy lines here and there, Ben Affleck wasn't the right choice but does what he can with the role"

What makes it unique is that it is a weak script that was only made as to take advantage of the semi success of other cartoon books movies.\n\nThe CGI smells of cheap leather suits, matrix wanna be effects and bad choreography. In other words, nothing to see here folks.

His performance is the same . I think Russell Crowe might have been better cast in this or Guy Pierce or even one of Jennifer's co-stars on Alias ( Michael Vartan or Bradley Cooper).It is almost like the supporting players are the ones carrying the film.

        "review_title": "An average comic book film that just misses the mark",
        "review_detailed_main": "In an age when it seems as if there is a different comic book hero on the big screen every other month, 20th Century Fox in collaboration with Marvel brings us yet another super hero to gawk at. With films like Batman and Spiderman setting the bar quite high, does Daredevil live up to great expectations?\n\nDaredevil has a lot going for it. It has a different kind of superhero in Daredevil/Matt Murdoch(Ben Affleck) who is blinded as a young boy by a chemical spill, but develops some kind of super sensory detection in his remaining senses. He climbs like Spiderman, fights like Bruce Lee, and has a keen perception of everything going on around him. As Matt Murdoch, the attorney, he tries to put criminals away legally during the day, but when the justice system fails, he wanders the streets at night as Daredevil to seek revenge and right all wrongs. He doesn't care how he does it either as long as the job gets done. Murdoch's Daredevil is a vigilante that makes Charles Bronson in Death Wish seem like milque toast.\n\nEarly in the film, the background of how and why Murdoch becomes Daredevil, is played well, makes us sympathetic, and gives us enough of the story, without taking up too much of our time. Later, Murdoch meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios(Jennifer Garner), and all their scenes together are interesting, including a scene when they fight each other, and a very touching moment when Elektra lets the rain fall on herself so that Murdoch is able to \"see\" her.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin we have the villains, Bullseye(Colin Farrell)and The Kingpin(Michael Clarke Duncan). Farrell is menacing enough as Bullseye, playing him as a Charles Manson on speed type of guy. Duncan, is not quite as successful as The Kingpin. He's big and menacing but how can you hate him after The Green Mile? Part of the fault here though is that of the screenplay, which never lets us in on what these two villains are all about. In Batman, we knew why and how The Joker was as he was. In Spiderman, we were given the history of The Green Goblin and it was an integral part of the story. In Daredevil, Kingpin and Bullseye seem to pop up out of nowhere almost like some sort of jack-in-the-box.\n\nThe musical score, if you dare call it that, was aimed strictly at the teenagers in the audience, is totally misguided and out of place. It does nothing to compliment what is going on, and is there for the sole purpose of selling a few cd's. The cinematography, is very dark and fits in well with the underlying themes that Daredevil is about. The special effects are really good, and go a long way towards making us understand how The Daredevil perceives things around him.\n\nSo what when wrong? Alas, the blame has to be placed squarely on the shoulders of Ben Affleck. I can't remember the last time I watched a film in which the main character gave such a one note performance. It doesn't matter what emotion Daredevil is supposed to be showing on the screen, Ben Affleck basically portrays him as an emotionless being throughout. His expressions never change for one minute. I liked Ben Affleck in Bounce, and even in Pearl Harbor (which most people didn't), so maybe those were roles suited for him and this one wasn't. Whatever the case may be, he never really stirs our emotions enough to root for him as much as we should.\n\nThe best reason to watch this film is Jennifer Garner as Elektra. She is everything Affleck is not, and we care about her character every moment she is on the screen. Her performance so overshadows Affleck when they are together, that you begin to wonder why they just didn't make the film about her.\n\nThis could have been a great super-hero type film. All the ingredients were there. They just left out the seasoning.\n\nTill Next Time Next Class Please"

While not as good as Spider-Man or Superman, Daredevil has a leg up on most of the Batman movies.\n\nLike Spider-Man, this movie has a comic-book feel to it, but in Daredevil it comes through more in the acting than in the visuals. Ben Affleck does a good turn as the \"Guardian Devil\", it's probably the first movie I've seen of his where he wasn't playing \"Ben Affleck\". In other words, I could believe him as Matt Murdock. Jennifer Garner was absolutely stunning as Electra (I can't say I was pleased with what happens to her character) both in beauty and in fighting ability. the initial fight scene between Murdock and Electra is outstanding.\n\nColin Farrell as Bullseye. Oh BOY! Talk about your over the top, cheez-whiz, scenery-chewing, William Shatner school of acting, bad guy! Absolutely delicious! Here is where you are reminded that what you are watching is a movie made from a comic book. Look for this lovely little line spoken by him, \"I missed! I NEVER miss!\". Speaking of Bullseye, don't leave the theater immediately when the credits start rolling, there's a little suprise!\n\nMichael Clarke Duncan was excellent as Kingpin. There is no man on this planet I can think of who looks more menacing even when smiling than the towering statue that is Duncan. Jon Favreau provides good comedic relief as Fopggy Nelson, Joe Pantiliano was so forgettable as his character, I can't even remember the character's name.\n\nViusuals were impressive, though the movie is a little too dark to really see the action. What I liked the most was the rendering of how Murdock \"sees\" using his sense of sound.\n\nThe story itself has it's ups and downs, but overall it was a good trip to the movie theater.\n\n7/10"

I feel like I've bashed the film a little too much because I enjoyed it. It goes down in the history of enjoyably bad flix. But theres a limit with this one. And theres only so much you can take.. And now I've heard theres a sequel and a spinoff film. hopefully by different people. You can't blame it all on the actors because both Affleck and Garner and Farrell have shown promise. And I'm sure they did this one for the paychecks. And it's not beacuse I don't like the daredevil charachter or the story but when it's delivered onto the screen like overcaked plastic popcorn theres a limit too what I and the audience can take."

I've never been a big Affleck fan but he was outstanding in this, the role he was born to play. Jennifer Garner solidifies her status as the hottest chick in movies (and TV!) and Colin Farrel all but steals the show as Bullseye. It's a great time at the movies and I can't wait to buy the DVD.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a big comics fan and a fan of comic book movies. (I even saw The Punisher twice.) So naturally I was excited to see DD. From the opening scenes, I thought that this film would rank right up there with Spiderman and X-Men, both of which I loved. However in the end I was a little disappointed.\n\nThe story was good, Affleck was great as Matt Murdock and pretty good as Daredevil. M.C.D. was perfectly cast as the Kingpin, and Colin Farrell, who I usually hate, was the best thing in the movie. I loved the combination of humor (especially the mustard in the coffee bit) and dark imagery (the kid crying while Affleck assures him \"I'm not the bad guy\"). The struggle at the heart of this movie is real and socially relevant which is more than can be said for lots of comic movies (like the last three Batman flicks). Special effects were subtle and well done for the most part, and each of the characters looked almost perfect for the part. The \"radar\" scenes were especially good, and M.C.D. was so great that I completely forgot the Kingpin I read in the comics was a different color than him. And possibly my favorite thing about this movie, when Murdock is on the roof with Electra and he hears the crime below, HE DOESN'T GO FIGHT IT!! What a great twist of realism and surprise. What a powerful way to make the characters into real people. All of this brings me to the point where I could almost say that this is a great movie. . . almost.\n\nVisuals, which for the most part are stunning, suddenly fall apart in the big fight scene on top of the pipe organ. This was some of the worst effects work I've seen in recent years. It felt like I was suddenly watching a video game. The love story, while touching with the repeated line \"Stay with me\", feels a little forced. The movie was 15 min. short of the two hour mark, and a little added footage between the Electra and Murdock would've been a good idea. The Kingpin was another character who would have benefitted from more screen-time. We're intrigued by the character, but we never understand how he runs a criminal organization or even what he really does. His \"Nobody is innocent\" line is wonderful, but show us why he feels that way. Additionally, we never find out how the cops know that Fisk is the Kingpin. DD just says so and we're stuck taking his word for it. Who told the cops? What proof do they have? This would have been an interesting side story. These were problems, but the lowpoint of this film is the aforementioned fight scene, not only because of its poor visuals, but also because it shouldn't have happened. The man (DD) had lost enough blood to stain half of a Cathedral and could barely move when the priest finds him, and then, ten seconds later, he's flipping through the air and taking punches without missing a beat. This is the classic goof of action/superhero movies. They beat him up to build the tension and then, once they've got you worried about him, \"Don't worry folks it's all okay\" and he's kicking butt and taking names again. Either don't hurt him in the first place or give him some time to recover. Bullseye is tough enough to have a good fight with an uninjured DD, and so is the Kingpin.\n\nDaredevil is a good movie, it's worth the full price ticket, but it falls short of greatness due to a few bad scenes and fuzzy writing.\n\n7/10\n\nBen Affleck .... Matt Murdock/Daredevil Jennifer Garner .... Elektra Natchios Michael Clarke Duncan .... The Kingpin/Wilson Fisk Colin Farrell (I) .... Bullseye"

Spiderman was lacking due to the post-9/11 jingoistic editing, and this had much of the same. The 'if you hurt one New Yorker, you hurt us all' sort of bull. Leave this film well alone. Go and see something with substance."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is probably best watched as a bit of a laugh. You can never take films about super-heroes too seriously, of course, but they still have to maintain a coherence and obey certain laws of reality in order to prevent them becoming farcical.\n\nDaredevil manages this, but only just. I have to confess to never being a comic book fan as a kid (or adult, for that matter), so some of my comments herein are based solely on what I learned about the character from watching this film. For instance, I can buy that DD has super senses and amazing reactions/reflexes due to his accident. But how on Earth does that allow him to leap from the top of buildings and not get hurt when he lands?\n\nAs for the plot.....they wisely stuck with a simple revenge story rather than trying to art it up as in the Hulk as something more than it was. This works for the film as you are not trying to puzzle out what the hell is going on and why the character does what he does. A plus for the film.\n\nThe special effects work reasonably well, though there are some \"look at me! I'm CGI!\" scenes that had me snorting in amusement. Overall though, not bad and the dark look of the film helps in that department too.\n\nEven DD's helmet/skullcap thing was only amusing the first time I saw it. Again, not sure how true to the comics it is, but those \"horns\" looked more than a little foolish. In fact, the whole effect gave DD the \"novelty condom\" look, which I'm sure was not intended. A minor niggle, but worth mentioning.\n\nNow my real complaint.....Ben Affleck. He tries hard and gives a good performance but somehow I wasn't convinced by him in the role Daredvil. I can't put my finger on it, but it just doesn't seem to suit him. It would be only slightly more odd to see Hugh Grant as Daredevil! Come to think of it, I didn't really like Ben in Sum of All Fears either, though he was good in Dogma and even Phantoms. I guess he just needs to find his niche.\n\nAlso irritating is Colin Farrel as Bullseye. He was OK in Minority Report, but here he just grates on your nerves. Perhaps that was the intention, but it was still a relief when he gets his just deserts.\n\nAll in all, this movie is far from the worst superhero movie to date, but it is also far from the best."

As Mary Jane being an innocent victim, it's true also to the comic. Spiderman was better made, had MUCH better acting talent and scripting, and the plot was a whole lot better."

It was just a good movie and I had a fun time watching it. There was only one major problem I had with it. Aside from Collin Farrell who had some fun as Bullseye, the performances were pretty bad. Ben Affleck gave one of the dullest performances of the year. Wesley Snipes in Blade was like Sir Lawrence Olivier compared to Ben Affleck in Daredevil.\n\nThe cinematography by Ericson Core was excellent. Everything was beautifully lit. A lot of the shots evoked the feel and style of some of the best drawn Daredevil comics in recent years.\n\nGrade: 8 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Well I felt like giving this a review even though it's almost 10 years later. With the lineup of Marvel comics films now done, I think its time to put this one in retrospect.\n\nFirst of all, yes, the director's cut is way better than the theatrical release since it fills in a lot more plot holes and really develops the characters with its longer running time.\n\nStill you would think that a movie with this kind of intriguing premise would have been executed better. A lawyer by day, an acrobatic vigilante by night and he's blind! That is what Marvel is great at, making these kind of characters. And I'm glad that the film chose to go with the developments made by Frank Miller and the minor ones by Kevin Smith, making this film more darker in tone than Spider-Man which came out the previous year before that.\n\nWell off the bat I could say I wasn't too thrilled about the acting done by the kid who played the young Murdock. Neither the playground fight scene with Elektra and Murdock. It got incredibly cheesy with the narration by Affleck. We don't get to see much of his lawyering even with the gigantic subplot in the director's cut. None of that I plead the fifth or citing a previous case or something like. The blatant character exposition ('I want revenge' or 'justice'). And it's never a good idea to use Dutch angles (Battlefield Earth... ring any bells?). Just overall the dialogue became very cheesy and unnatural.\n\nWell it still manages to take advantages of its premise. They really show us Murdock's catholicness which Kevin Smith developed on. They actually made a costume which looks like it's wearable... enough. They had two pretty cool villains. Colin Farrell really nailed it as Bullseye and thank god they made him into an Irish biker. Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk who actually looked like the guy in the comic well except... he's darker. The scene where Daredevil is dodging Bullseye's projectiles by backflipping was crazy. And I can say that Jennifer Garner is hot, that is all.\n\nAnd let me say the soundtrack kicks all kinds of ass. This has to be the best soundtrack to any superhero film ever. It was during the dying stages of nu metal which I dearly miss to this day."

The cameos are getting to be a bit much- Affleck pal Kevin Smith, Marvel's Stan Lee... plus every minor character had an \"in-joke\" name (Jack Kirby, John Romita - all Marvel Comics artists)\n\n3. Murdock comes off as a bit of a stalker when first meeting Elektra\n\n4. His mortal wound seems to miraculously heal and not bother him as he jumps up and fights two more villains\n\n5.

I've been avoiding this, since I LOVE the series, and saw the poor rating of this. I also thought Ben Affleck is too 'pretty' for this role (and read that he wasn't the best Batman..).. However, I tried to bury my preconceived ideas, and therefore enjoyed it: I'm pleased I watched it, since I can't watch the first two series of DD AGAIN just yet! :o Overall I thought it was rather 'shallow', but then again, it must be hard to squeeze such a lot of plot/characters into a couple of hours of film. I prefer every character/actor in the series, but still, I did like this. Farrell was amusing, but Duncan is just a gentle giant in my mind ('John Coffey'): the size of him fits, but I kept expecting him to say something sweet or funny.. What I liked most of all, which I missed in the series, is getting a bit of 'visual' (yeah I know..) on how Matt 'sees'. You're left to imagine it for yourself in the series. I was very disappointed in the 'mustard' scene.. till he swapped them! lol. When watching something like this I try to be open-minded. Each 'medium' is different, and if you compare them, you're often disappointed. Of course, it is often nigh-on impossible NOT to compare them, but I find it helps to try ;) P.S: I've never read comics, and had barely even heard of Daredevil before I watched the series (this film is probably why I'd even heard of it at all..)"

Now I have seen it I have to say I liked it, but not as much as I liked the three mentioned above.\n\nMovies about this kind of super heroes all have a couple of things in common: talents we normally don't see with normal human beings, well choreographed fight sequences, one or more beautiful ladies and interesting villains. In the villain section the four 'Batman'-movies still win, although especially 'Batman & Robin' was terrible. The Joker, The Riddler and Mr. Freeze are more memorable than any other I can think of. May be it is because of the actor (Jack Nicholson, Jim Carrey, Arnold Schwarzenegger), may be it is the villain itself. 'Superman' has probably the best super powers although 'Spider-Man' makes it look better. For the fight sequences I have to go for 'Spider-Man' or the 'X-Men'-movies. 'Daredevil' (with Ben Affleck as Daredevil) wins one of those things: absolutely without a doubt the most beautiful lady (yes, I know, it is just an opinion). Rebecca Romijn or Famke Janssen in 'X-Men were fine, Jennifer Connelly in 'Hulk' was very fine, but Jennifer Garner here is perfect.\n\nThe action is pretty good, the story is familiar but what does it matter, and at least one of the two villains is memorable. Colin Farrell as Bullseye is pure evil and that is the way the villains should be. Don't expect too much and you will certainly have a good time."

Foggy Nelson (Jon Favreau) is his associate and Karen Page (Ellen Pompeo) is their secretary. Reporter Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) is chasing the enigma. He is taken with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) who surprises him with her skills. Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan) is the corporate criminal overlord Kingpin.

It's all blue and wavy. If it's supposed to give him superior visual skills, it doesn't look nice on the screen. The production value looks cheaper because of the attempt at a darker visual style without actually being darker. Ben Affleck as a blind guy really stifles his acting skills.

This heightens his awareness of the world around him and when his father is killed swears to give justice back to \"Hells kitchen\". He trains himself to become aware of all that is around him and boosts his physical strength.\n\nAnyway, he eventually becomes a lawyer and when he is not fighting crime in the courts he is exacting justice on low-lives in the streets as Daredevil.\n\nWhen, due to his success in attacking the Kingpins (Michael Clarke Duncan)henchmen sends for the worlds top assassin Bullseye (an excellent Colin Farrel). In all of this Daredevil falls in love with the stunning and dangerous Elektra (Jennifer Garner). When her father is assassinated by Bullseye she blames Daredevil and she sets out to exact justice.\n\nIn all of her searches she falls for Daredevil, while training herself rigorously for the fight with Daredevil. A wonderfully human moment happens where Daredevil has to choose between sleeping with the woman he is falling for or save an anonymous life, who he does not know and is probably a scumbag - so what does he do- the human thing.\n\nThe final fight-scene is well choreographed (as are all the fights), although the CGI climbing the church was as poor as that of Spiderman swinging on his rope.\n\nA brilliant movie, see it or miss out on the best comic book film since the Crow."

And since since this site only allows ten lines or more which is messed up i will continue typing even though i already made my point and i have nothing else to contribute or say. What is difference does it make if one wants to leave a short comment or a long comment. I am sure after this my account will be blocked for future submissions or something. What is that all about anyway? The most silly thing i have ever run across when leaving comments. Hope this was enough."

He's simply not a leading man. He is strong when he plays the yuppie in love, but he is not the dark psyched Daredevil. He does a really poor job and just adds no edge to the character. He is supported by the lovely Garner who is adequate as Electra. Colin Farrell steals the show as Bullseye and does an excellent job. Affleck should focus on romantic comedies and leave the action flicks to the big boys."

        "review_detailed_main": "The world needs another celluloid super hero like Posh Spice needs a diet, but with Marvel Comics bursting at the seams with classic characters, the movie people are virtually queuing up to transform them into big ol dollar signs. This latest effort is based on Daredevil - not as well known as its heavyweight stable mates the Incredible Hulk or Spider-Man, but it will no-doubt bear comparison with them. Like Tim Burton's Batman, there's a heavy dollop of darkness and moral ambiguity about Daredevil but the most striking facet is the humour. It's far funnier (and yet more solemn) than Spider-Man, with the laughs coming in the main from Jon Favreau as Murdock's mate Foggy and the excellent Colin Farrell as villain Bullseye. Affleck (as Murdock/Daredevil) and Jennifer Garner (as Elektra) are suitably good-looking, lithe and earnest in their parts, though J-Lo's better half does appear to be dressed in a red gimp outfit. It's droll, well shot, fast-paced and pretty stylish and while it dodges the moral questions most of the time, a little more grown up than most films of this genre. The only problem with Daredevil is that it follows such a tried and tested formula that maybe, we're all a bit sick of it. He's not an extra-extraordinary character like the Hulk and maybe it's all a tad too soon to be treading this path again."

Bullseye was fantastic as well. electra was alright, but in that outfit, I wasnt paying attention to her acting.\n\nMy only issue with this film, besides Affleck cant Act, was that again our director confuses which superheroes hes working with, this is DareDevil, not Spiderman. He isnt 10 times stronger and faster than a normal human, and even if you could hear a trigger being pulled, you cant dodge a machine gun."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just saw the opening night showing with my sweetheart. We were both looking forward to this movie since the first preview. This movie is a lot deeper than other reviews might make it seem.\n\nMost people watch comic book hero movies for the action, and there was plenty of that and it was fun to watch and even thrilling at points, but what I really got into was the depth of the inner characters. Ben Affleck did a wonderful job in his role. He made his character sufficiently believable (for a comic book hero) enough that you really sympathized with his inner frustrations.\n\nI saw a lot of plot in this movie, man vs self, man vs man, good vs evil, good trying to make sure he's still good, and I liked it. If Jennifer Garner's role was to be male eye-candy she did her job well. Perhaps if I hadn't been looking for more of the Alias character to come out on the screen, I could have better focused on the fact that this isn't Alias and wasn't supposed to be.\n\nThe Irish hitman was very well done, considering he played a sociopath that provided most of the \"well-aimed\" humor, even if it was a bit twisted. Funny how you can see Colin Farrell as the title role in The Recruit, as well as the lead in the upcoming, Phonebooth.\n\nJoe Pantoliano has a great role as the reporter who has discovered the identity of our hero and must decide whether to expose Daredevil, thus furthering his own career, or to keep the masked man's identity a secret and promote him as a good guy. Well done.\n\nIf you don't like comic book psychology, you won't like this movie. If you do like it, you'll love it as well as the character interaction betwen Affleck and Garner. Mesmerizing.\n\nI don't worship Ben Affleck but his appeal has increased quite a bit. I think I'll go see it again. I wouldn't mind a sequel. It took guts to take on those roles."

The movie is darker than Spiderman, and seemed to be aimed at a more mature audience. Ben Affleck, contrary to popular belief, can play a super hero quite well, and the cameos of Kevin Smith and Stan Lee were enjoyable to witness.\n\nAll in all, this movie was just great. The fight scenes blew me away, the narration at the beginning was excellent and if it wasn't for the unrealistic smoothness of CGI, and Collin Farrel (Brad Pitt wannabe), I would have placed this film above many of my current favourites.\n\nGo see it. Do not pay attention to the negative hype people keep throwing at this flick. Affleck is 400 times the actor Toby will ever be, and say good bye to most of the super hero cheese you witnessed in that overrated Spidey flick that picked up $400 million. I guarantee you it will tie you down for mind blowing action sequences and super hero flicks until The Matrix Revolutions and X2 emerge to steal the crowns respectively in mid-May."

But there are so many great elements in this comic, that it should be hard to miss them altogether, which is the case here.\n\nI guess the casting of non-actor Affleck as the hero should have warned me. Or the lousy art work for that matter. Jennifer Garners Electra-goes-Barbie performance is insulting. She's actually even better in the goofy spin off Electra. There is no chemistry between them whatsoever. The visual effects poor to say the least. The soundtrack is a mess. The stupid costume is a non-funny joke.

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the worst comic book adaptations I've seen only slightly above the unwatchable Hulk monstrosity. Reasons:\n\n1. Pretentiousness. This film never uses straight forward shots when posy ones are better. Consequently we get endless amounts of pointless 'artistic' cuts which are more annoying than anything else.\n\n2. Sadism. The comic hero is motivated by a desire to bring felons to justice, this version is a cold blooded murderer. His nemesis Bullseye also horrifically kills people for pleasure, although more justifiable by the nature of the character, the scene where he murders a boring Granny, played for laughs, is in poor taste.\n\n3. Too much plot. The story tries hard to cram in key moments from Daredevil's long history, his creation, the introduction of Bullyseye, the Kingpin, Elektra, the death of her father, her meeting with and her subsequent love affair with Matt and hatred of Daredevil etc... As a result, everything seems rushed through with very little time for character development or time to register the emotional impact of each episode. The dialogue suffers because of this with the characters given to talking in clich\u00e9-ridden sound-bites like \"stay with me\" over and over.\n\n4. Music. Partly I guess to hide the lack of characterisation but also to give it a trendy teen pop video feel, there are musical interludes every 5 minutes which add to the disjointed nature of this. Mostly they are annoying shouty metal tracks but a \"tender\" Clannad-type Celtic tune is added to the scene of Elektra's father's funeral. Sometimes this is unintentionally humorous like the scene when the Irish Bullseye first appears to rappers singing \"top o' the mornin'\".\n\nAwful.\n\n2/10"

There was one thing that I found they did wrong in this film, casting Colin Farrell as Bullseye. Don't get me wrong Collin Farrell is a good actor but he was just completely wrong for the part, he didn't have the right style or the coolness that the comic book bullseye did, Michael Clark Duncan in my opinion was a good cast ad the Kingpin, he's massive enough to play the role and he's got he right attitude and style to pull it off too.

Unfortunately, the influence of Spiderman required them to include dizzying CGI sequences with impossible Matrix like leaps and movements far beyond the abilities of the DareDevil character or any of the others. Spiderman had SUPER strength while physically, while in great shape and a trained acrobat, DareDevil is still of \"human\" limitations. One doesn't expect reality in a comic book film but they went way beyond any willing suspension of disbelief.\n\nDareDevil isn't a terrible film but it isn't exactly a good film either. It was hit and miss, kind of like the Austin Powers movies where there are lines that make you laugh and others that are groaners. With a decent fight choreographer and a director who knows how to stage a proper and coherent action sequence, this could have been another Spiderman. Unfortunately, most of the action scenes are poorly presented and the flaws in internal logic mount up to the breaking point.\n\nCatch this one on video/DVD/cable instead of going to the trouble of seeing it at a theater. A \"superhero\" movie with lousy action scenes isn't worth your money."

On the way out of the theater, my son, whose language isn't very developed, said that it was 'like Spiderman,' then a moment later said it was 'like Batman'. I knew exactly what he meant. Daredevil moves like these characters, and has a few other things in common with Batman, including an arch-enemy who was responsible for the death of the hero's parent(s)(which subsequently pushed them into their superhero roles). The idea of a blind superhero whose remaining four senses developed to superhuman levels seems to me to be a very novel and good idea. The moral questioning of the main character and the dark tone added to the film, also I thought it was visually very stunning."

Like the Batman franchise, the movie went for special effects and fast action over actual story line. The only really nice special effect was his \"vision\" when the rain hit Electra's face."

I find it does a good job at pulling the origin of him becoming a blind superhero. Him becoming a lawyer protecting the innocent also stems from the same thing. Elektra doesn't get a lot of development, but think, she got a spinoff. I find there was room for a sequel besides a spin-off I believe takes place before this film, but the theatrical version doesn't have the best reception and got around $180M in the box office (isn't considered the best but it was against a $70M budget), and it has been 20 years since it originally released."

I think she could take Ben in a real fight. The quick change from being hostile to being deeply in love between the two was fast and loose.\n\nI think I liked Affleck's friend the best played by John Favreau of swingers fame although he was on-screen maybe 5 minutes. Collin Farrell was way over the top but at least enjoyable as a bad guy. Affleck needs to stay out of the action.\n\nThe best thing about this movie was the \"vision\" effects but I couldn't see how seeing sounds would help you dodge bullets.

        "review_detailed_main": "X-Men and Spiderman were great movies on several levels. Action, entertainment, character development (although Cyclops got short shrift, they should have left in his deleted scenes that you can see on the DVD). And they are good comic book adaptations. The best part of the Batman movies was the atmosphere, the movies themselves were only okay.\n\nDaredevil is entertaining but fails to live up to its potential. It has the atmosphere of Batman, the action of X-Men, and the character development of Spiderman -- but only for one character. The villains barely get any screen time and come across as two dimensional (no joke intended).\n\nFarrell uses intensity to make up for what little screen time he has, and Duncan is big and fearsome (good choice for Kingpin). However, they really needed some backstory and motivation.\n\nThe token female / love interest stumbled a bit. The love scenes were clever, but when she had to fight she was sometimes equal to Daredevil, then not, depending on whether she had to be a strong modern woman or a damsel in distress. Combining both into one character didn't work.\n\nThe action plot was linear and a little boring, but the main conflict was internal to Daredevil, and that was done well.\n\nThere were some excellent points that made up for the flaws. They spent some time on the buddy scenes with Murdock's law partner, and they were terrific. Affleck did a good job with the character, showing his inner strength and his inner turmoil. I really liked the way they depicted Daredevil's \"radar\" and how he fought. Having a blind hero was a nice change, and they showed his strengths (scent, sound) and his weaknesses (loud noises, needing sound for his radar to work). There were little touches showing the life of a blind man, such as having to fold his bills in specific ways before putting them in his wallet. The ending with the reporter was also a refreshing anti-cliche.\n\nIn this era of long movies I have no idea why they didn't add another 10 or 20 minutes. Marvel is a gold mine right now, the producers had to know they would make it back. This movie would have been so much better if we could have spent more time with the characters."

But the main thing why it feels a bit boring is all the CGI (3D-animations). There are simply too much of them. Like in Matrix: Reloaded and in well, almost ALL movies of today, the effects are based on computer animations, which, to put it simple: looks boring and usually, very bad.\n\nIn DareDevil, with a budget of $75,000,000 one should expect more, and better, effects. To see a jumping guy in a red suit that doesn't look convincing is not entertainment. It just gets boring.\n\nBut instead of hireing stunt-men that do wire-stunts that look real, or just not doing these kinds of shots, they spend millions on stuff you've seen in plenty of films before and we didn't like it then either.\n\nIn Jurassic Park (1993) the dinosaurs looked real. Now, ten years later, they still can't make a guy jump and make it look good. Wow, how impressed I am that they spent $75 MILLIONS on this!\n\nThe script (by director Mark Steven Johnson) is not that good either. There are plenty of plot-holes and it doesn't hold any suspension. Why? Because we know everything from frame one.\n\nDareDevil is a cool comic character. The movie does not make this cool guy justice.\n\nSpider-Man and X-Men was good. HULK and DareDevil wasn't. Lets hope that the rest of the Marvel-movies are better than this. But they can only do it better if they stop this 3D-frenzy that is SOOOOOOOO over used.\n\n5 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Another movie watched for the \"How Did This Get Made\" podcast was 2003's \"Daredevil\". A Pre-MCU Marvel film that absolutely nobody is in a hurry to recover back into the main timeline. It has dated so badly it feels like it's from a hundred years ago and not just twenty.\n\nBlinded in a childhood accident, Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) developed ultra-heightened senses and uses those powers to fight crime in Hell's Kitchen. The area is under the thumb of Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) a crime lord whose size matches the brutality of his rule. Kingpin calls in a unique assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to eliminate one of his rivals, unaware that Murdock is romantically involved with his target's daughter, Elektra (Jennifer Garner).\n\nIt took longer than I thought it would to come up with what the plot of this film actually is. This is because much of it is flashbacks to Murdock's youth, and a side story about how whether his particular brand of vigilantism means that he is a good man or not. This plot doesn't really kick in until the last twenty-five minutes or so, which makes the film up to that point difficult to really care about.\n\nIt really isn't fair to compare this version of Daredevil with the Charlie Cox TV version that would come years later. The whole superhero ethos has changed, meaning that the Netflix version could be for adults and be wholly darker and more complex than this could consider being. It also has hours and hours more time to tell a story than this does, trying to introduce a bunch of, at the time, relatively obscure characters and get them in some sort of story. But this is not to say that the film is underappreciated, it's genuinely pretty awful. Much of the problems are also issues of the production year though, CGI is infinitely better than it was then and it looks underwhelming here. In fact, the look of the film is overall disappointing, with little looking real or convincing. The musical choices, with its Nu-Metal-ish aesthetic date the film terribly. There are little elements of racism and sexism in the script that you probably wouldn't choose to include were you making the film now.\n\nIf feeling charitable, you could say that it is \"of it's time\" but truth be told there's little to recommend about its time and virtually nothing to recommend about this."

Director/Writer Mark Steven Johnson did a great job of translating that DD onto the screen. Turning Daredevil's radar sense into a sonar sense was wonderfully inventive. I think I liked Spiderman the movie better than this one but I think it's the difference between the visual energy of the two movies, like comparing Superman the Movie to Batman the Movie (the first in each franchise). I give Superman/Superman the edge because, well, it's more cinematic to watch a character actively do super-human things rather than do things via a more passive gimmick (Bat-equipment or sonar sense). And part of DD's problem is that it suffers a bit from \"Batman III/IV-itis\" from the beginning. At least, the first Batman contented itself with a thumbnail origin story. DD does a more full-blown origin backstory plus introduces three pivotal characters (4 or 5 if you count Urich and the priest). All these characters get underwritten which wouldn't be bad if key characters got more screen time to establish them. The Kingpin, for instance, is, arguably, the most nuanced villian in the Marvel Universe (after Doctor Doom). What we get in DD is an big, brutal black man not a Godfather-esque figure tortured by the illness of his beloved wife who built a criminal empire as powerful and dominant as his brawn. What we get is Electra, who we are told has been studying martial arts since she was five, but not Electra Assassin, perhaps the most dangerous killer for hire in the world - discounting, of course, Bullseye."

The only thing that even halfway works in the movie is the relationship between Affleck and Garner. She is the one character who's halfway well done, she herself added at least a star to my rating, the fact that she's so amazingly beautiful probably helps too but that isn't all of it. The acting is pretty well done all around it just has no where to go and nothing to work with. The villians aren't given anything to do, they have no depth, we know nothing about them, and they have no cool lines. In fact, nobody especially has any cool lines which is tragic because superhero movies should be all about cool if nothing else. The first action scene (in the bar) is so disorienting that it's amazing it got out of the editing room. The entire film is full of continuity errors which I won't get into specifically because I don't want to risk spoiling anything.

With a lesser budget and weaker cast than either of its multi-million grossing antecedents it's not surprising that it pales in their wake. It's not without some redeeming features in terms of cinematography, stunts and even the attempts at characterisation, but it's all very second-hand especially considering what Christopher Nolan is now doing with The Batman. Unlike the Spidey and Batman movies however this effort seems aimed far too much at a teenage audience, with its more cartooney narrative and dragging along a lumpen teeny-punk soundtrack, obviously to push the related album - its afore-mentioned big brothers succeed by aiming at adults and giving younger viewers credit for the intelligence to appreciate their greater depth. On the positive side, I liked the prologue beginning of the movie, with its recreation of Hell's Kitchen, particularly the father-son relationship (well acted too) although the scene of Matt's bullies' come-uppance is unoriginal in the extreme. I also liked the casual match-throwing reveal of Daredevil's calling card by Urich after his first outing. The issue of the ying/yang duality of vigilante-ism (\"I'm not the bad guy\") is at least aired for consideration but not for long as we're soon plunged into another sub-Matrix fight scene to the backdrop of a Gotham-like New York City. The acting is variable, Ben Affleck seeming too lightweight for the tortured avenger of his character and Jennifer Garner is no better than his equal as love-interest Elektra. The villains get to do more, Colin Farrell barely having to change accent as he hams it up as the shillelagh-tossing (I'm joking) Bullseye and Michael Clarke-Duncan as The Kingpin, who changes colour in either a sop to PC or adventurous casting, depending on your point of view. Some of the set-pieces are fine, particularly Bullseye's first encounter with Daredevil which results in the death of Elektra's father) if slightly lacking in true white-knuckle adrenalin, while others fall flat - the first Electra / Matt playground fight in front of a teenage audience and the CGen scamperings of Daredevil up and down buildings over rooftops are poorly executed and most unconvincing. Oh and I'm well tired of film-makers' in-joke nods to the comic creators themselves (Stan Lee even gets a walk-on cameo appearance) - it's now an overused, boring and mildly distracting device. The closing scenes hint at the sequel that didn't happen and I think that's about right. Daredevil on this showing, didn't deserve to ride again."

Acting by Affleck is somewhat respectable, there are instances of him looking like he tries to hard to put on an emotion. Gardner... ugh, is plain awful in this role, her acting is very static, its as if she ONLY says the lines, no heart, no enthusiasm. Recommended to kids for the full satisfaction experience. For teens and adults, there are better superhero films out there.\n\n5/10 - Do you dare watch this?"

It is kind of a sad little film. I never really felt good about the hero and when the movie was over I found myself rooting for one of the villains. STAY AFTER THE FIRST BIT OF CREDITS!!!! THERE IS MORE FOOTAGE!!!! The story just did not have a very good climax. He is just a sad guy motivated by sadness and surrounded by sadness. The movie did not show more of the noble sides of Daredevil. I know this is kind of a stupid review, but fans of comics may see my point."

        "review_detailed_main": "I rented this not really knowing what anyone else, critics or friends, thought of the movie. I didn't know if it was considered fabulous or trashy, tremendously entertaining or downright boring. I found it to be somewhere in between.\n\nAll of the actors and performers did an excellent job with the roles and the stunts offered to them. I put the blame for mediocrity solely on the shoulders of writer/director Mark Steven Johnson. Don't get me wrong; the film looks fantastic. The costumes, sets, and lighting all work to great effect, and I was definitely impressed. The look was the most enjoyable part of the movie, because the story was just...there. Johnson took all the ideas from the comic book and put them on the screen, but they don't take on a life of their own. He makes it corny, and silly, because it takes itself so seriously. You can't have a comic book movie take itself seriously yet play it so over the top. One way or the other would work, but not both. This combination gives you a snarling Colin Farrell with almost nothing to do. In his first scene he shows off his skill in a bar, then he's on a plane to New York, then he disappears for the next twenty minutes of screen time.\n\nOften throughout the picture, actors are replaced with animation. This would be fine if it weren't so obvious. I don't mean obvious because it looks animated, I mean obvious because the animation is used the way one would make a cartoon, not a theatrical feature. It's one thing to show physical feats in movies that are slightly beyond possibility; that's what movies are for. But every five minutes, a computer generated DareDevil is leaping from one building to another all the way across the street, or falling thirty stories to land on suspended platforms, or any number of impossible feats. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief only so far, and this movie asked me to go to ridiculous lengths. I might have put up with it had it not been so serious the rest of the time. You can't have both.\n\nThere is too much obvious wire-work, too much pointless cgi, and too much movie-speak to make this movie as good as its look. Some of the effects were eerie, beautiful, and intriguing, while others were simply laughable. I also have a problem with \"see what cool stuff a blind guy can do\" kind of bits in movies with blind characters, and this movie is full of them. Overlooking all the superhero superpowers, there are still a number of things that are just too cute, and every movie with blind people does this, showing how they can hear stuff or smell things that us sighted folk never pay attention to. It's not like that.\n\nThe movie is entertaining in a purely comic book fashion, and I agree with another user comment I read on here: if you don't go in expecting much, you'll be satisfied."

        "review_detailed_main": "Of all of the Comic Book Super Heroes to be adapted to the silver screen in recent years, DAREDEVIL is probably the one least known to the general public. He debuted on the newsstand in late '63 or '64. While an original, his creators at Marvel Comics (Stan Lee & company)did manage to borrow a couple of items to give DD a good overall arsenal of powers and skills to work with.\n\nHis name was borrowed from a different, earlier Daredevil from another publisher. His weakness of blindness was the feature characteristic of DC's Golden Ager, Dr. Mid Nite. To this we add physical conditioning and fighting prowess, no doubtfully inherited from his father, who was a prize fighter by trade.\n\nAs an adaption to film, it made the transition much better than most others of this genre and managed to put up a movie which is appealing to all in the audience, be they adult or kid, comic reader or not. Certainly their interpretation of DD's extra radar sense was inspired,particularly in the love scenes. The casting was excellent, my personal favourites are Michael Clark Duncan as The Kingpin and Jon Favreau as Froggy Nelson.\n\nAnd it's about time for a sequel, other than that ELECTRA."

Coming off the box office bunnies of other comic-to-movie adaptations such as Spider-man and X-Men, the Marvel comic lore is a treasure trove for movie makers and with special affects and CGI now comfortably at the point where they are capable in suspending our belief that super powers can possibly exist, the comic book feats of Daredevil are very much on the big screen for everyone to see.\n\nThe story of Matt Murdock, a man who by day fights for justice as a blind lawyer (having lost his sight in a toxic waste spill) and by night a dispenser of said justice to those who escape the court system using acrobatic martial arts and sixth sense \"radar\" capabilities (imbued by the same toxic waste that made him blind) is one for whom generally all comic book fans would cheer for.\n\nBen Affleck playing the title role is supported admirably by the stunning Jennifer Garner (Elektra), the suitably imposing Michael Clarke Duncan as the evil nemesis Kingpin and the psychotically endowed Colin Farrell as Daredevil's main adversary Bullseye.\n\nAll play their parts with suitable relish and the chemistry between Affleck and Garner is evident (as this was the movie which eventually led to a relationship in real life).\n\nOverall an enjoyable ride and far superior than the disastrous spin-off movie based on Garner's character Elektra. If I was to be nit-picky, I'd point out that Kingpin is actually a giant white guy in the comic book series but Duncan encapsulates all the necessary qualities of the \"Crime Boss Overlord of New York City\" admirably and was a fine choice in the end.\n\nWhat probably prevents this comic book movie from reaching loftier heights is the lack of character empathy between their interactions. Bullseye is simply a mercenary for hire and his \"hatred\" for Daredevil is not really felt. Further exploration between Daredevil and Kingpin would've resulted in greater gravitas but this most likely would have resulted in less time for Elektra's character and potentially less box office dollars. Still an enjoyable popcorn movie in my books."

        "review_detailed_main": "Lemme break it down 3x3...\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n1. Ben Affleck. Affleck's taking a lot of heat these days (a lot of it deserved), but I thought he did a great job as Murdock/Daredevil, conveying the character's sightlessness as well as the inner struggle he was going through.\n\n2. Jennifer Garner. She was probably the best thing in the movie, and not just because of her looks; I don't watch Alias, but maybe I should start.\n\n3. Action. Really well-done action sequences, and I liked how they conveyed Daredevil's perceptions--I've never even seen the comic do that effectively.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n1. Villains. Everybody talks about how Colin Farrel steals the show. WRONG! He almost ruins it with his ridiculous, over-the-top antics. He's a clown, not a villain. Would have been better as a stone-cold killer, frankly; much more formidable a foe. And having two villains (Duncan, wasted as the Kingpin) clutters things up.\n\n2. Choppiness. It felt like there were scenes missing, that either wound up on the editing room floor or, even worse, edited out of the script. For example, the Murdock/Elektra romance flies by way too quickly. And Daredevil takes a knife wound to the shoulder (so he's incapacitated and can't stop Bullseye from killing Elektra), and yet that same night, he's healthy enough to take down both Bullseye AND the Kingpin? I know it's based on a comic book, but this stretches the bounds of believability. Should've been an extra couple of scenes where (a) Daredevil heals at the church over a day or two and (b) the bad guys figure out where he is. THEN comes the showdown.\n\n3. Music. Utterly forgettable, especially when they throw in lame pop tunes so they can try to sell a soundtrack album. Give it up, Hollywood! Spider-Man had this problem too, though to a lesser extent. Get a talented composer and use his/her themes through the whole movie. Think James Bond: everybody and his dog can whistle that theme. Or the late 70's Superman movies. Or Star Wars. Or...you get the idea.\n\nOverall, I'd still recommend watching it, especially if you're a fan of the character, because I think a serviceable job was done bringing it to life. But Spider-Man set the standard for super-hero films, and this one falls short. 7/10."

But when his father dies in the alley from an unknown gang, Matt Murdock avenges his father's death by becoming \"The Man Without Fear\" himself Daredevil.\n\nBen Affleck is the main protagonist of the movie and me personality while I don't think he's a good impression as Daredevil, he does do a good job as Matt Murdock, the Kingpin is played by Michael Clarke Duncan who also did a good job of his performance, Jon Favreau as Foggy is the typical comic relief, and as for Jennifer Garner and Colin Farrell they were both not the right casting for their characters, I never believed that Jennifer fits perfectly for the role of Electra and Colin as Bullseye is just over the top to me.\n\nIf you watch the Theatrical version of the film you'll basically get nothing but a bland and brainless action comic book film of the early 2000s (which I give it 4/10 stars), but the Director's Cut is the one that I'm reviewing because I felt it does help with the story. I wouldn't spoil all the details of what it is, but simply put is that some of the cuts makes the film like a crime drama than the typical good versus evil. There are other cut clips in the first that are nice to see, while some of them I personally felt doesn't necessarily need to be seen on the director's cut.\n\nOverall: Other than the cut clips that does help stand the movie up a little, there are few things of the movie I enjoyed seeing, like the blind scenes and some of the fight scenes were nice, but I still have some downside about the film such as the effect isn't all that good and at times the film tends to have its corny moment, but while the movie does has that early 2000s cliche, I still gave it a chance and I would recommend only the Director's Cut and not the Theatrical version."

Overall he was OK, but at no point is he ever \"Matt Murdoch\", he's always \"Ben Affleck\". Also, there's just something about his face...\n\nThe DD costume was also a little strange in how they separated the mask from the rest of the suit. It looked like a weird pirate cap or something on his head.\n\nJennifer Garner's acting wasn't too good. She also doesn't look like how I would imagine a real life Elektra. She doesn't have the fair skin and jet black hair, and she just looks too \"nice\". The actress they chose should have looked similar to Catherine Zeta-Jones (NOT Catherine Zeta-Jones though, she's too old for the role now).\n\nElektra was also the most horribly written character in this movie. Elektra IS NOT a hero, nor does she have any concern about killing someone (alteast the way she was when Matt first met her). They took an interesting character and destroyed her.\n\nMicheal Clark Duncan was fine as King Pin. His acting and physical frame made up for the difference in skin color. IMHO, King Pin is one of those characters that it doesn't really matter if they change his ethnicity; at the very least, it's not a big deal.\n\nColin Farrel as Bullseye was great, he's the best part of the whole movie. The \"bullseye\" on forehead thing was a little strange, but overall the character design and the way he was written was perfect.\n\nAs for the movie itself....\n\nThe story was alright, but some scenes were retarded, such as Matt fighting Elektra in the park. Good way to hide your identity Matt! Fight in a public park in the middle of the day and do a bunch of martial arts and show how capable you really are. Yep, no one will suspect your DD now! \"Hey, do you think that guy in the park doing all the unbelievable flips and martial arts is DD?\" \"No way, he's blind!\". Ugh They entirely remove the transition between \"Matt as child\" and \"Matt as adult\". He just suddenly has all these costumes and what not. Stick not being in this movie doesn't ruin it, but it certainly wouldn't have hurt, and it would have explained a lot.\n\nFinally, the CGI in this movie looks awful, and a lot of the \"wire-fu\" is very obvious, such as characters that are supposed to be jumping appearing to be floating through the air and then landing with no weight."

I cannot say this about the recent Marvel offerings of \"X-Men\" and \"Spider-Man\". \"Daredevil\" is the best work of Ben Affleck's career. Let's face it, the entire thing hinged on his performance. This fact initially scared me. I was fairly confident in all the other casting choices. I had to see the film, though, to be convinced Affleck could play Matt Murdock/Daredevil. I pleasantly surprised. The movie could have been longer with more screen time for the supporting cast and for me the ending was a little too \"rosey\" for a Daredevil story, but overall it didn't sport the flaws of other comic book movies in the near past. I walked away impressed with the product. Money well spent and pleased to have gone opening night."

Like all of them, Daredevil should wear a sign saying, \"Don't love me, or you'll die!\" Oh well, so goes the life of the gifted and the damned.\n\nMakes you like having a normal life, eh?\n\nAnyway, I liked the movie and Affleck was great in it.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm confused because I know that all these actors can do better because I've seen them do better, and I'm also confused why anyone thought that Mark Steven Johnson was the man for the job. His art direction looks like a boring version of Tim Burton's Batman vision, and he must be to blame for the ridiculous story and ridiculous acting.\n\nI find that with Ben Affleck, most people really like him, or really hate him, and I seem to be one of the few that think he's just okay. But this just looked painful to him. Murdoch's character just looked like he was playing the brooding loner bit because of the cool factor. He seemed only mildly invested in the revenge story which was apparently his one driving factor in life.\n\nThen there's Jennifer Garner, who I think is likely to become one of the better action actresses of her time. She's brilliant on Alias. And if she's a good Elektra, we can barely tell, because she's almost peripheral to the plot, with very little screen time and probably five minutes of actual dialogue. And her character is just as stupid as hell. Since it eventually turns into a revenge crusade for her, the backstory became very convenient for her, particularly with the black leather get-up she just happened to have stowed away. And then, she meets a sort-of blind guy who can still fight exceptionally well, and is surprised when he turns out to be Daredevil.\n\nMichael Clarke Duncan is a strange choice for Kingpin. I think he's an exceptional actor, but he's just a huge detachment from the Kingpin of the comics. For one thing, he's too young, for another, he's black, and most important, he seems like an uber-thug more than anything else, whereas the Wilson Fisk character that comic fans came to know and love was an elegant villain. Ruthless and brutal, but elegant. You had no trouble believing that he could fool the public into thinking he was just a very successful businessman.\n\nJoe Pantaliano is a great sleazbag, but if he can do more, he certainly didn't show it here. His character was one-dimensional and archetypal. We never got a good idea of why he was so interested in these stories.\n\nColin Ferrell was as over-the-top as he apparently could be. He was amusing, but had very little to his character.\n\nBut I don't blame the actors. The dialogue and direction was the main culprit, here. Throw in a kitschy soundtrack, and you've got a disastrous comic book movie. It had it's moments, like the Stan Lee and Kevin Smith cameos, but these were few and far between. The plot seemed like it was written by a nine-year-old. I mean, Daredevil is apparently trying to hide his identity, but he walks around as Matt Murdoch brandishing the weapon he uses as a cane? These characters were idiots.\n\nAnd for those of you who aren't aware, Mark Steven Johnson is the director of Grumpy Old Men and Jack Frost (the Michael Keaton movie). So what ever gave anyone the idea that he could handle anything remotely resembling a serious movie, let alone one as dark and brooding as this?"

Or how the X-Men uniforms are much different than the ones in the comics, but to complain on that one would just be silly.\n\nI'm not try to bash Spider-Man nor X-Men, but I would say the Prime audience are those who collect or collected comics books, or were a fan of the animated shows.\n\nCollin Farrel I feel is the all time greatest portrayal of a Villain (Bullseye). Even of Jack Nicholson's Joker.\n\nThe only crime is that it looks like there'll be no sequel.\n\nIf there's any sequel I'd most like to see done, it's Daredevil."

Jennifer Garner brings a bit of spark to her role as Electra Natchios, and obviously trained hard for the role. I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck whatsoever! In fact, I can't stand his acting per se, but he was alright in this movie. Michael Clark Duncan is good, as is Jon Favreau as Ben Affleck's lawyer partner. It's a movie worth renting, but it's certainly not one I would go out and buy to watch again and again."

It's just barely better than Batman & Robin, the widely acknowledged worst comics movie ever.\n\nPoor dialogue, rushed storyline, and choppy and confusing action sequences are just some of the reasons why you should stay away from this one. Oh, and did I mention a simply horrible soundtrack that made me wish my superpower was to be deaf? I am a huge comics fan, but this movie was a mistake.

        "review_detailed_main": "Superman and Batman are arguably the two best superheroes of all time. Daredevil is arguably the least known. All recognition aside, comic books' presence in cinema is palpably apparent throughout the last few decades. Whereas Spiderman grossed enough money to spawn a sequel already in the works, Daredevil would be lucky to make a profit big enough to approach head executives in hopes to begin talks for a follow-up. With Hulk, X2, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen due out later this year, adding competition to the long list of comic book movies, it seems as though Daredevil will be unfortunately forgotten. Even though, it may be the best of them, as it certainly is since the visions of Tim Burton, with only Bryan Singer's X-Men in close competition, it may be too dark and honest for the people, excluding diehard fans, who go to see it expecting just another comic book movie.\n\nThe key to the movie's success is pivotal casting. Unlike Spiderman, Daredevil actually caters to a PG-13 audience. Do not expect bloodless battles similar to those involving teenage heartthrob Tobey Maguire. The gory battles verge on heresy at some points in one of the movies most passionate scenes. Second, of course, to the rooftop scene between Affleck and Garner in which Murdock uses the vibrations of the rain to paint a portrait for his mind's eye of Elektra. Absurd as it may be, it results into a moment more romantic than any of the last few romantic comedies could ever fester.\n\nAlthough Mark Steven Johnson is a newcomer when it comes to directing action movies, he never seems to be an amateur. His fight scenes are as engaging as his comic book-like dialogue. You may think that it is cheesy, but what isn't cheesy about a comic book? Daredevil turns its frames into an adaptation for the big screen. And it works wonderfully because of the heart in its filmmakers and in its cast, including top of the line performances by Farrell and Duncan as the two villains. With this in mind, there might still be hope for a sequel to answer some of the open-ended questions.\n\n*** out of ****"

On YouTube, there is a YouTuber by the username \"YourMovieSucksDOTorg\" and he made a video commentary for the Director's Cut version of this terrible, terrible movie. I watched the movie while listening to this commentary, and it was absolutely hilarious. If you for some reason decide to watch this movie, watch the director's cut alongside the YMS commentary because it is extremely entertaining.\n\nPlot - Over two thirds of this movie is a random nonsensical flashback. This movie is poorly written and makes no sense. I just finished watching the movie, and I could not tell you what happened.\n\nCharacters - The characters are extremely poorly written. At no point did I care about any of them, or understand anything that they were trying to do beyond random guesses.\n\nSights - I don't think that I've ever seen a movie with editing so bad. Whoever edited this movie had absolutely no clue what they were doing. There are way to many cross-dissolves of sped-up shots of skylines. Whoever was behind the camera also clearly had no clue what they were doing. This movie looks terrible. The cinematography is atrocious.\n\nSounds - For some reason the sound design is a mess. There are a lot of random cartoony sound effects and bad sound editing. You'd think a movie with a blind character with undefined powers as the main character (I'm assuming cause his name is the title) would pay close attention to how the movie sounds. The soundtrack is really odd as well. Some songs are good, some are terrible, but most of them don't fit what's happening in the movie. I have seen that stupid scene where Elektra slices up the sandbags in so many reviews, and in none of them did they ever mention that \"Wake Me Up Inside\" was blaring over top of the cartoon slicing sound effects.\n\nAction - The action scenes in this movie are hilariously incompetent.\n\nThis movie is such a mess. Not a single thing is done right. I would call this movie so-bad-that-its-good, but it actually gets a bit too boring for me to recommend it to be watched in that way.\n\nIf you are going to watch this movie, I'd recommend looking up the YMS commentary track. I would provide a link, but it got removed when the review published."

Someone needs to be able to compensate for the American director's inability to shoot fight scenes. The fight scenes in this movie were terrible. They were too dark and murky and the camera work was horrible.

The film begins with a Bang, dips in the second hour, but successfully reaches to an impressive culmination, which is nicely executed. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is decent, while his Direction deserves a mention. However, the overall impact of it's Superhero, is slightly missing. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is fair. Action-Sequences, are first-rate.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Ben Affleck is fantastic as Matt Murdock/Daredevil. The Actor sinks his teeth into the part, and delivers one of his best performances to date. He steals the show, all the way! Jennifer Garner is effective. Colin Farrell has been better, while Michael Clarke Duncan makes an interesting bad guy. Jon Favreau supports well.

Unlike Burton's Batman, which tries to make a dark movie just by having a dark set, Daredevil isn't afraid to question the moral authority of the main character just because he is a superhero.\n\nAlthough the director doesn't have the visual flair (or the big name)that Sam Raimi, Tim Burton or Bryan Singer, the proof of this movie is in the story, and that's where Daredevil shines. It's about a character whose dual life actual conflicts with each other, on one hand a vengeful vigilante, and the other an (honest!) attorney who stays well within the bounds of the law. Unlike other superhero movies, where the characterizations are pure black and white, the movie Daredevil doesn't mind getting it's hands dirty. It's okay for the hero to question himself, and not be perfect, because besides his superpowers, he is still human, and like all of us, is fallible.\n\nI also find it interesting that so many people are attacking Affleck and Johnson, not so much for their work here, but because of past atrocities. Now, Affleck is an actor I can take or leave. He's never annoyed me like he does many, but he's never impressed me all that much, either. In the role of Murdock/Daredevil, he works. He definitely has the physical presence for the superhero role, and his kind of bland charisma actually works in his favour for the Murdock role, as in the Miller comics, Matt Murdock WAS kind of a stick in the mud, except when Elektra was around. She gave him life.\n\nThe writer/director did a GREAT job on the script, for the most part capturing the essence of Miller's Daredevil. His direction, though not as flashy as Raimi or Burton, wasn't bad, and, at least unlike the cheeseball Burton, never overpowers the script.\n\nDaredevil definitely deserves, if not the best comic book adaptation, then definitely the smartest. It definitely holds it's own against Spiderman and Superman, is superior than X-Men, and whips the pants off Batman. Of course, for those who like their action with a black and white moral point of view, steer clear."

        "review_detailed_main": "NOTE: This is a review of the director's cut of Daredevil, which I have been informed countless times is the definitive version of the film. It invites the new subplot of Matt Murdock defending a client in a court case, and apparently ties up loose ends the theatrical cut left open.\n\nDaredevil's problem isn't that its hero is not as well known as some of the other Marvel alumni, but that its plan isn't a well-developed one. Its first mistake is incorporating actors for their names and not their proper skills. Its second is that the film isn't sure whether to take the approach of a goofy, imaginative romp or a seriously dark excursion. And third, well, it just isn't as fun as Marvel's Spider-Man or even Hellboy, which would come a year later.\n\nOur hero is the title character, played efficiently by Ben Affleck. Affleck's name alone could've turned off anyone at the time because of the constant tabloid exploitation with him and his girlfriend/fianc\u00e9e Jennifer Lopez, which led to his name being associated with ridicule and mockery (Phantoms anyone?). When he's not the masked-vigilante, Daredevil is attorney Matt Murdock, who was tragically blinded after a toxic waste accident. This accident corrupted his vision, but exponentially enhanced his four other senses, and sort of giving his vision an odd demotion to only being able to see sonic vibrations.\n\nMatt's father was, by the book, a bum. A former professional boxer, he lied to his son about working at the biohazard plant, and upon discovering that his father was an enforcer for the local mob, he attempted to run away from home, which is what triggered the accident. His father went back to being a boxer for a brief time afterwards until he was tragically murdered. Matt went on to pursue training in martial arts, and eventually became \"Daredevil,\" a crime-fighting hero in his hometown of Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan.\n\nBut what superhero film is complete without a villain and a love story? The villain here is Colin Farrell's Bullseye, a hit-man who simply doesn't want Daredevil to succeed. Bullseye was hired by William Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan), a rich executive who serves as his right-hand man and a secondary villain. Both of their motivations for evil are inexcusably underwritten.\n\nThe love story is corny and a tad distracting. The lady is Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), the daughter of a famous businessman. Mat and her meet at a coffee-shop, where he tries to be polite and get her name. She playfully refuses and leaves. Next thing you know, both Matt and Elektra are fighting on a playground outside like two young children. Needless to say, if the entire film played on that kind of level, scenes like this wouldn't induce eye-rolling but cheerful grins.\n\nThis ignites the film's major problem and that is it doesn't know what beat to drum Daredevil's song to. It doesn't know whether to be dark and gritty or campy and fun. The playground fight scene, Colin Farrell's over-the-top villain, and Jon Favreau's banter on Affleck say one thing, but the atmosphere, overall tone, and fight scenes say another. There is a miscommunication with direction that is perhaps one of the most fatal to a superhero film I've ever seen. The action sequences, on the other hand, are for the most part engaging and fun to watch. Even if the \"sonic vibrations\" POV becomes a bit distracting, it's fair to recognize Marvel's ambition to do something unique and innovative.\n\nNot long ago, Affleck gave an interesting interview about Daredevil, where he stated that it was made right before superhero films became very serious and crafty. It was made in that awkward period where unfamiliar heroes began surfacing (IE: Catwoman, Elektra, Hellboy, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, etc) and stylistic intentions began taking over (IE: Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films and Christopher Nolan's Batman revival, which would question just what the genre could do a mere two years after this). Watching Daredevil in 2012 is an indescribable experience, especially to those who aren't a big fan of it. Do we simply not care for the film, or do we not like the film because we've been shown the current revolution? The same question could be asked to those who are not fond of classic films of any genre.\n\nStarring: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan, Colin Farrell, and Jon Favreau. Directed by: Mark Steven Johnson."

Ben Affleck,(Matt Murdock),\"Gigli\",03, played Daredevil and got himself so deeply involved with protecting the general public from mobsters, he even had to go to confession and completely confused his poor Priest friend. There are lots of crazy characters playing real bad mobsters, and lots of ballet dancing type of combat scenes. Jennifer Garner,(Elektra Natchios),\"Elektra\",'05 gave Matt Murdock a hard time in many ways, and managed to wrap him around her finger. Elektra and Matt gave an outstanding performance through out the picture and it was very entertaining and worth while viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fate deals young orphan Matt Murdock a strange hand when he is doused with hazardous waste. The accident leaves Matt blind but also gives him a heightened \"radar sense\" that allows him to \"see\" far better than any man. Years later Murdock has grown into a man and becomes a respected criminal attorney. But after he's done his \"day job\" Matt takes on a secret identity as \"The Man Without Fear,\" Daredevil, the masked avenger that patrols the neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen and New York City to combat the injustice that he cannot tackle in the courtroom.\n\nIs this a good superhero film? Yes. Am I a fan of this superhero? No. In fact, I never heard of him until the movie was made. Unlike the family friendly \"Spider-Man\" movie, Daredevil is the opposite. It's dark, like \"Batman Begins\", and has its funny moments. This is one of some films that are really great.\n\nThe action sequences are fantastic. The fight scenes are choreographed well and the CGI seamless. There is a wonderful cinematography throughout each scenes, including the fight scenes, which gives the whole movie an original look. Even some scenes were incredibly beautiful to look at.\n\nThe direction from the director, Mark Steven Johnson, is really great. And Ben Affleck plays a charismatic man in the morning and one smart superhero at night. Jennifer Garner also gives us a great performance in her role. And you can't deny Affleck and Garner has great chemistry together as lovers. Michael Clarke Duncan as a villain is, I suppose, decent, while Colin Farrell was really kick-ass.\n\nSure, this isn't a brilliant superhero film but it is a really great one. It's arguably one of the best, in my opinion, though some might hate it. The action is fantastic, the CGI seamless, and the cinematography wicked. If you watch this film, there's a chance you might like it or not, obviously. I am one of the people who thought this film was lovely and found this truly underrated."

There also could have been more action in the first half of the film (It was mostly just people talking to each other), but it somehow kept me interested in what was going on throughout the entire thing.\n\nI had not seen the film up until a few days ago, and even then I almost didn't watch it (My friends were telling me it was not worth watching), but I did watch it, and I'm glad.

It is more entertaining than \"Spider-Man\", though \"Spider-Man\" is a better movie. There are excellent points in the film, and Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have excellent chemistry, and that helps propel the film dramatically. \"Daredevil\" also comes closest to having a love scene in a comic book inspired movie.\n\nThe best part of the film is the special effects and the fight scenes. The choreography is excellent, and Daredevil's \"radar sense\" (He, being a blind man, uses his acute sense of hearing to \"see\" his surroundings, much like a sonar \"sees\") is rendered amazingly in the film. Although there are a couple quick shots during fight scenes that look a little fake and computerized, but they appear far enough in to the movie that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief.\n\nAll in all, Daredevil is an extremely entertaining and spectacularly rendered venture. Chalk up another win to Marvel Comics and its movie division."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Man Without Fear finally strikes the hearts of viewers on this fine Valentine Day. As you well know if your a avid comic fan, Daredevil was created in 1964 by Stan Lee and Bill Everett. The story is based on the life of the hero named Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck, \"Dogma\") who is accidently struck blind by radioactive waste causing young Matt to obtain \"radar senses\". The young Murdock then learns and develops martial art skills to become a masked vigilante dubbed by one of the reporters, \"the Daredevil\".\n\nThe movie is based on the storyline from one of the greatest Daredevil comics ever (Daredevil volume 1, 181) and it involves Matt's love interest Electra (Jennifer Garner, \"Alias\") as well as Ol' Hornhead's mortal enemies of the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, \"The Green Mile\") and the crazed assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrell, \"Minority Report\"). Like most comic based movies you get lots of action and special effects which includes how Daredevil uses his radar senses and the way it is shown on the screen. Finally, this movie does as his slow moments but eventually starts right up again towards the climatic battle between Mr. Affleck and Mr. Duncan. If Marvel does well in this movie (and they should) then they will have a bountiful year with two other Marvel Comics based movies (\"X-men 2\" and \"The Hulk\", \"my boy\").\n\nMy rating as the Dark Gengar in this Marvel hit from 1 to 10: 7.5 (Expect a possible sequel) Aloha."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, Marvel is getting a lot of their comic book heroes translated to film and to be honest they aren't all that good. I must admit though, that I've not seen a complete failure yet. This also means that this film is not a complete failure, although in my mind it has much more weaknesses than the other recent Marvel films.\n\nBefore watching this film, I didn't really have too high hopes. I thought that Ben Affleck as a superhero would be somewhat of a laugh, plus I really thought that his costume was a bit gay. Also I didn't really enjoy the idea of the Kingpin being black. It's not that I'm not racist, it is just that I'm used to a white Kingpin from the animated comic book series of Spider-Man. So before viewing this film, the only possible upside to this film was Jennifer Garner's cuteness (judging from the trailers).\n\nThe film itself has a pretty good beginning and a pretty good ending, intervened by parts of somewhat instable quality. The strange thing for me was, that I actually enjoyed the parts in which the Daredevil was \u0091normal' much more than the parts in which he was a superhero. I felt that Affleck really got his character down good, as did most of the cast with the weakest character (in my mind) being Bullseye. What somewhat bugged me in this film though were the action scenes. They tried to be spectacular with the sole purpose of being that and I feel that many times they struck out. The action scenes were not spectacular. They were not even filmed in a good manner at times and last (but certainly NOT least) they sometimes weren't even properly built up to. What I saw here were a bunch of pretty good actors, working with good stunt coordinators and a director who knows some minor basics in directing action sequences. Not everything is to blame on the director though. The script is pretty thin and the music is too much focused on selling the soundtrack. There seems to be no real place and time for emotion of the personal drama and ambiguity surrounding Daredevil or Elektra. There was potential here, but it was wasted at times. If you're in it for the action go see a Matrix sequel, if you're in it for the comic book hero, see Spider-Man, X-Men or even Superman from 1978. If you're in it for Ben Affleck, enjoy Gigli and if you're in it for Jennifer Garner, hell wait two years for her to star in the spin-off Elektra.\n\n6,5 out of 10\n\npost scriptum: contrary to most other films I give a 6,5, this one will get a 6 and not a 7 upon voting"

        "review_detailed_main": "If i hear one more person compare Daredevil to Spiderman i will scream. I had high expectations for Daredevil ever since it was announced, and i wasn't disappointed. I took three of my friends yesterday to see it, who all went saying they didn't want to go and that it was a waste of our precious teenager money and that it looked crappy, and they all came out singing its praises. Maybe it wasn't a mirror image of the comic book and maybe there were a few inconsistancies in the plot, but when people who were aversed to the very idea of seeing it come out talking about how brilliant and entertaining it was, that is what you need to notice. You cannot adapt a comic to screen flawlessly because it would not work, things that people will accept on 2D paper with words like (biff!) and (pow!) in little bubbles when someone punches someone just doesnt fly on the silver screen. Have we forgotten the cheesy, pun- filled Batman and Robin of a few years ago? The inconsistancies of recent comic book movies.\n\nI feel sorry that Spiderman came out before Daredevil, especially as DD has been planned since the early 1990's, if Daredevil came first, Spidey would be the weak comparison, but with all comic book movies those that come before are seen as the line that all that follow strive to attain. People are so busy checking for flaws in DD that they dont look to the heart of the movie, a man who has lost faith in what hes fighting for, with all the scars on his back, popping painkillers and trying to make a difference. It's the gritty truth of what being a superhero is all about. Its not always about leaping from buildings squealing like a little girl because you can shoot goo from your wrists and have suddenly transformed into an uberhunk with pretty powers and a colourful costume. Daredevil shows the dregs of humanity and the real criminals out there, not the beefed up supervillains in camp costumes. The fact that rapists and murderers and muggers do get away with literally murder, that justice does fail and people who should be locked up walk free all adds realism and mirrors all that is wrong with the world.\n\nMaybe everyone who sees Daredevil can't see that, can't understand the issues at the heart of it and will only see a superstar engine for the lovely Ben Affleck to kick some ass and dress in a silly outfit, but thats your loss. Its a movie about regaining your faith and remembering there are still things worth fighting for, and i only hope all comic book movies can someday grasp what being a true hero is all about. I recommend everyone should go and see it, and make up their own minds. The performances weren't always as great as expected but that can be attributed to flaws in the plot, the camera angles were sometimes stomach turning, but that can happen in even the greatest movies. For a movie of only 102 minutes it delivers what it says, and like X-Men i think the first movie feels like a very expensive trailer for the second which thankfully is inevitable as long as the movie does well.\n\nShowing the vunerablility of a blind 'superhero' who isnt made of steel, who can be hurt and does feel the pains of humanity, who is fighting a losing battle in search of justice gives an extra strength to the character. Spiderman shows the thrill and energy of someone whose life has just changed, becomeing a superhero, getting the girl, not being an unpopular weakling loser anymore. Matt Murdock has grown up blind, gifted with a radar sense and driven to help people by personal tragedy. He's weary of fighting a fight that never seems to be won because people like the Kingpin let murderers walk free and the only way to get ahead is with terror and evil, hes lost his faith and needs to find some way to regain it and remember what hes fighting for. In many ways Daredevil is the everymans superhero, because in a world were terrorists hold the world ransom every day and even now we are facing war, DD's dark Hell's Kitchen mirrors our own troubled world, and reminds us what we are fighting for."

The Director Cut can't be called great, but the Theatrical Cut really ruined the movie. They cut out important scenes that connected the story and developed the characters. Now let me briefly talk about the Director's Cut. I liked the music and the Kingpin. The rest of the film couldn't satisfy me. It was also a bit dated to enjoy, at least for this style of filmmaking.

Collin Farell was hillarious as an Irish hitman named Bulls Eye. I would call this soon-to-be superstar the highlight of the film. Michael Clarke Duncan did a decent job (as expected) of his tid-bit bad and ugly role.\n\nOverall I would give this movie a 5/10. Jennifer Garner was sexy alright, but too decent compared to the Electra in the comics. Ben Affleck, he is better off playing a soldier or a lawyer or a doctor maybe even go back to Kevin Smith movies as he is, but not a super-hero for our sake :)"

I mean, if you haven't seen it you expect so much and then all ur gonna get is a mediocre movie which is not a complete waste of time but it's nothing special so better spend your time/money on better comic picturizations like Spiderman or Hulk or whatever... The Problem with the movie is that when your watching it your gonna think mmmhhh..OK and when its over your gonna feel like \"thats it? thats all?\" So keep away from that movie, there are millions of movies out there so why waste your time on bad ones... As I already mentioned Spiderman is a good comic picturization and if you haven't watched it yet make sure that you do it as soon as possible"

Marvel, captain marvel, iron man 3, eternals, ant man 3, Loki and all of phase 4 & 5 combined and just overall modern superhero movies that has forced humor ever 2 seconds.\n\nSure it had cheesy moments, and the music that dated this movie: Evanescence - Bring Me To Life, Evanescence - My Immortal it's very early 2000's and u can feel it.\n\nRap songs that doesn't fit the movie nor the characters such as neptune's lapdance like who did the soundtrack? It's TERRIBLE!\n\nThis movie wouldn't feel dated at all if it would've had danny elfman this movie would've felt timeless if he would've don the soundtrack.\n\nEven in the director's cut the movie still suffers from too many subplots and not enough time to developed and flush out all the characters there's 4 books of all different stories made into one under a 2 hour and 13 mins of run time.\n\nAnd ppl keep whinnying and complaining about his suit failing to realize that this movie was under literal development hell with fox melding, rushing out the movie and that's not even by the director vision. And in the concept art there's 92 pages of costume designs made for this film. 4 suits was already premade and looked alot better than the official final cut version.\n\nThere's 46 pages of daredevil suits, 15 pages of elektra outfits, 27 pages of bullseye suits and 4 pages of kingpin outfits.\n\nFox wanted none of that according to the director mark steven johnson during 20th anniversary: \"The executives wanted to replicate the success of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man - released a year earlier - but didn't understand the Daredevil character. \"They didn't want a costume,\" he later said. \"They didn't want horns. They didn't want anything.\" \"It was ridiculous,\" he said in 2019. \"They were like, 'We're not going to put a man in devil horns! They call him Daredevil because he does daring things, not because he dresses up like a devil'. I was like, 'You have to! Otherwise, he's not Daredevil'.\" Eventually, Fox executives conceded on the costume, but then fought Johnson on the colour red. The studio wanted black. They eventually compromised on something in the middle, more or less the colour of blood. Johnson added: \"And then some people go, 'Bah, he's got a leather costume, that's bulls***, he should be in spandex. You ruined my childhood'. And I'm like, 'Dude, you have no idea - I fought so hard just to get horns'.\" MSJ via independent\n\nhow the hell is this so one sided but Zack Snyder and David Ayer that later had the same thing happened to them there's an uproar?? As if fox never had a reputation on meddling with the director's projects, they have a history going back as far as x-men 2000.\n\nI feel like ppl are latching out their anger to the wrong thing it shouldn't be towards this movie it should've been towards the fox. The theatrical cut was never the director's vision that had almost an hour worth of footage to rerelease want his wanted with unused footage to make the director's cut and made an apology video in the director's cut explaining that fox wanted more of jennifer garner, love scenes and more of a slower, pace. I think it's alot of trolls and mcu/Netflix stans that's down voting this movie without giving it a chance and watch the director's cut for a far superior version and much better experince."

The theatrical cut is at least worth 6/10). To all who haven't watched the Director's cut, go watch it and then re-vote. I gave this movie a 6/10 when I saw the theatrical version, but after reading other peoples comments I bought the Director's cut, and god damn i'm glad i did.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after i watched the director's cut i logged back in to vote again. I was going to give it a 7 or 8 out of 10, but i saw the low score and the director's cut is much better than a 5.5/10 so i gave it a 9/10.\n\nAs the theatrical cut is like a stereotype Hollywood bummer, with a shallow story and some fighting and half the movie is based on romance, the director's cut is longer and a bit more brutal film that gives much more sense with a much deeper story, which doesn't focus that much on Electra but gives you more from all the other characters.\n\nSo my word is: Go watch the Director's Cut and vote again."

With such Wonderbread non-entities like Jennifer Garner & Ben Affleck on hand however this tiresome tale falls flat. The one thing I'll hand to the the filmmakers: they actually were able to make Joe Pantoliano & Michael Clarke Duncan boring, which is no mean feat. This cheapo sub B flick looks like a reject from the Made for The SciFi Channel universe. Blech!!"

No willing suspension of belief here. But that's to be expected when your blind hero jumps off of buildings for no reason, seemingly just to wow the audience."

Daredevil is about as true to the comic book as Spiderman was, if you are a huge fan of the comic you may be disappointed. Give it a chance though and you might enjoy yourself.\n\nBen Affleck's acting seemed a bit flat(good but flat), he certainly looked the part however his \"I am blind and to act blind I shall stare past the camera and look up while I walk, this is acting and proves I am blind\" approach seemed kind of annoying (although he may have been directed to do that).\n\nJennifer Garner did a good job with what she had to work with, the character of Elektra is more like window dressing than a character in the movie. I think they could have added 15 minutes just to explain and expand on her character more. In the end I didn't have any feelings towards the character.\n\nMichel Clarke Duncan, was a good Kingpin, dramatically different (yet not unbelievable ) from the comic, but still good. Just my 1000 cents."

While performances were quite stellar by the big actors, the roles themselves were quite weak. Along with Spiderman, there's a weak storyline in which we are asked to join along in and join with the \"superhero\" as he captures the girl of his dreams, overcomes his troubled childhood, becomes a great power in a corrupt city, and ultimatley comes close to death. Why should I watch this movie. The CGI is rediculous, and the plot is just plain stupid. I understand thats how the comic was written, and it was great seeing Kevin Smith make a cameo, along with special tributes to authors and drawers of comics. However, this movie should never have been released to the public, and the amount of money it is making is representative of how much people do not understand a good movie. Hollywood is killing itself, and dragging us all down with it. Stick to the nice independent films. Great job by the actors themselves."

        "review_detailed_main": "The 2003 film \"Daredevil,\" directed by Mark Steven Johnson and starring Ben Affleck as the titular character, offers a mixed bag of superhero fare that, while ambitious, ultimately struggles to find its footing.\n\nOn the positive side, the film delves into the darker, grittier aspects of the superhero genre, which was a refreshing change of pace from the more polished entries typical of the early 2000s. Affleck's portrayal of Matt Murdock/Daredevil, a blind lawyer by day and vigilante by night, captures the inner turmoil and complexity of the character. His performance is complemented by Jennifer Garner's Elektra, whose chemistry with Affleck adds depth to the narrative. The fight sequences, particularly the showdown between Daredevil and Bullseye (played with gleeful menace by Colin Farrell), are well-choreographed and engaging.\n\nHowever, the film's execution is marred by a few significant flaws. The script often veers into melodrama, and the pacing feels uneven, with some scenes dragging while others rush through critical plot points. The tone can be inconsistent, attempting to balance dark, brooding elements with lighter, more comic-book-like moments, but not always succeeding in blending them seamlessly. Additionally, the CGI and visual effects, which were cutting-edge at the time, have not aged well, occasionally pulling viewers out of the immersive experience.\n\nMichael Clarke Duncan's portrayal of the Kingpin brings a commanding presence to the screen, but his character lacks the depth and nuance that could have made him a more memorable antagonist. The soundtrack, featuring early 2000s rock, adds energy but sometimes feels out of place within the narrative.\n\nOverall, \"Daredevil\" is a film with notable ambition and a few standout moments but is ultimately hindered by its uneven execution. It's a movie that might appeal to fans of the character and the superhero genre but falls short of being a standout in the crowded field of comic book adaptations."

        "review_detailed_main": "The only Daredevil comic I have ever owned was given to me by my elementary school, in which Daredevil teaches the importance of being careful around flammable gas fumes. Needless to say, I was uneducated about the character's history before I saw this movie. Being a major fan of comic book movies, I decided to check this one out, despite what the critics said.\n\nI wasn't entirely disappointed. It dragged at points, but overall I found this movie to be entertaining. It centers on the character of Matt Murdock, a struggling blind lawyer in Hell's Kitchen. When night falls, he takes on the persona of Daredevil, a crime fighter aided with heightened senses and agility. This movie was a bit darker than previous Marvel movies (\"Spider-man\", \"X-Men\", etc.) and I think it worked out well. One of the coolest parts of the movie comes in the form of Daredevil's vision, a form of sonar. One of the major problems I had with this movie is that there were a lot of times it felt like it was pushing its soundtrack down my throat. It felt like it would give us a sample of what we could find on the CD when the music would rise up every ten to fifteen minutes, drowning out other sound.\n\nThe film had a strong cast backing it up. Despite what others say, I think Ben Affleck gave a good performance as Murdock, although I don't really see him as action hero material. I thought Jennifer Garner was a bit weak in her role of Elektra Natchios, her acting seemed stiff at some points. The best work came from the villains. Michael Clarke Duncan (Kingpin) was a helluva presence and Colin Farrell (Bullseye)was demented.\n\n\"Daredevil\" is not the greatest Marvel movie out there, but it isn't the worst either. Come to think of it, I think I still have that Daredevil comic book buried in my closet somewhere."

I've read some comment that Director's Cut is nicer, thus I watched DC version. From the very beginning the plot doesn't start as a typical action/comics/adventure movie. As a whole I find the screenplay/plot interesting and quite curiosity arising. Expecting for a dull action movie I got very well played interesting and emotional movie which was worth every minute of watching it. Of course some scenes seem a little bit childish and superficial but if you Emit this scenes and do not pay attention to them, you get a nice watch."
