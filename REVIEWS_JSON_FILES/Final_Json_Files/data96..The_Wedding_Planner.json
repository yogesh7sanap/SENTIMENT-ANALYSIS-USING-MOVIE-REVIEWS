Why make her Italian?\n\n2. Justin Chambers is horrible as the love forlorn Italian immigrant. His accent is so bad is ruins his otherwise likable character.\n\n3. Lopez and Matthew McConaughey generate no chemistry. I just did not care what happened to them. I hoped that Lopez would go for the other guy.\n\n4. This movie is an excuse to promote Lopez songs.\n\nMovies in which a bright and intelligent woman falls for a spineless letch are starting to wear on me. I just could not believe that a character as strong a Lopez's would fall for such a weiner.\n\nThat said, Brigette Wilson and Alex Rocco are great, and there are some fun moments in this film. But please - did the makers of this film watch the scene where Lopez takes a bottle of \"solvent\" out of her purse to remove a stone penis that his glued to McConaugehy's hand? Good thing she had that solvent! ** out of ****."

At lease this is watchable and kind of cute-Although you never believe for a moment that Jennifer Lopez character is anyone other then JLO at least the movie doesn't drag as with a lot of movies of this \"formula genre\" as I like to call them. It's an entertaining(mildly) way to pass an hour or two-I'd give this 6 out of 10."

        "review_title": "A flawed, mildly formulaic but likable and charming romantic comedy that will probably keep you smiling",
        "review_detailed_main": "True, \"The Wedding Planner\" does have its share of cinematic conceits. Just watching the previews, you pretty much have a good idea what's going to happen in the end. But unlike many romantic comedies, this is not predictable by the minute. The characters are likable and charming, and you get quite engrossed in them. The actors are charming as well. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McCoughnahey are equally good and have a fine chemistry. The scenes, in general, are handled in a sweet-natured fashion without becoming nauseatingly sentimental. The opening scene is very original and made me laugh. In the first scene, we get an idea of how Mary (Lopez) plans her weddings, staging them like a secret service operation, strapping wires to the bride and groom, feeding them suggestions as they walk down the aisle and making sure all the guests are in order pronto. There are certain moments of \"sitcom stupidity.\" There's a scene where Steve (McCoughnahey) gets his hand stuck to a statue's privates. The comedy was badly timed and the scene appeared quite lame. A similar joke was used in Rodney Dangerfield's \"Meet Wally Sparks,\" but was done in a much more structured manner and spawned hilarious results. About the member of the cast who I felt was a little hammy was Alex Rocco as Mary's Sicilian father. His accent comes and goes, and in some scenes he struggles so much with it that he starts talking like someone with down syndrome. Fred Willard has a short but funny, scene-stealing role (when hasn't Willard stolen the show?) as a ballroom dance teacher. There are some moments in the plot that are forced and created simply to move the film along, so we can quickly arrive at the \"juicy climax.\" One of the subplots involves Mary's father trying to fix his daughter up with this silly, thick-accented Sicilian cassanova. He wants her to get married to him, but she refuses. Throughout the film, they don't seem to have any more than a friendly bond. Yet later in the film, he makes a sweet proposal and Mary actually agrees to marry him. The ending is far-fetched and over-the-top, and though I can't discuss it you've probably seen this ending before. One thing I have to credit the writers for is refusing to make Fran (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras--Man, is she sooooo beautiful!!!) a total b**ch, like they would in most films of a similiar plot. The way the formula goes is the guy's engaged this girl, while another girl captures his heart. But the girl he's engaged to is usually so unlikable that you wonder why he wanted to marry her in the first place. I'm glad they didn't take that cheap route. Even Fran has a certain charm to her character. The charming characters and the charming actors are really what makes this movie worth seeing. Yes, it's pretty much (though less than usual) a formula romantic comedy, but a likable one because of the way we're captured by the people on screen. This is not a great film, it has its dull moments, it has its silly moments, but it's often a fun and pleasant movie experience. You'll fall in love with \"The Wedding Planner.\"\n\nMy score: 7 (out of 10)"

But why she wouldn't tell the truth right away is beyond me. What's the plan? More importantly why the plan? If she's trying to make Edison jealous, Massimo would be the last man to do it. It makes no sense. It's such a simple movie, and they screw it up so badly."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Wedding Planner tells an identifiable story about falling in love and failing to recognize it.\n\nThe Wedding Planner stars Jennifer Lopez as Mary Fiore, a hardworking, beautiful, single woman of Italian descent, who has made a reputable career as a wedding planner. Fully dedicated to her work, Mary successfully coordinates all the details of her wealthy clients' weddings. She even acts as a kind of therapist, transmitting to the brides and grooms-to-be the optimism that relieves them of their \"second-thoughts\", and that allows them to fulfill their true dreams of marrying. Yet one day, a literal \"faux pas\" turns Mary's orderly life upside-down: she walks across a street and gets her shoe stuck in a manhole. Just then, a dumpster menacingly rolls down the steep San Francisco street, towards her. Noticing that the dumpster is rapidly gaining speed, a young man rushes to help Mary out of her dilemma. The two are instantly enveloped by the rush of the moment, falling victims to love at first sight. Soon, however, fate shows its cruel side, proving that the handsome Steve Edison (Mathew McConaughey) is tied to Fran Donelly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras), one of Mary's most promising clients. In the meantime Salvatore (Alex Rocco), Mary's concerned father, tries to inspire her to consider her childhood inamorato Massimo (Justin Chambers), who just arrived from Italy. Torn between acting sensibly and fulfilling her long suppressed dreams of marrying, Mary must first determine which love is the one destined for her.\n\nThe Wedding Planner exploits the physical beauty of its star (Lopez) and emphasizes her character's style and professionalism at work, while defining her personality as that of a free-spirited, down-to-earth person who enjoys dancing and playing Bingo with her father and his elderly friends. Similarly, her costar (McConaughey) is depicted as a good-looking, sensitive man who enjoys his work as a pediatrician. However, the film's secondary characters, especially Mary's family, friends and coworkers, are sketchy and mostly inconsequential. Thus, The Wedding Planner creates a story that solely revolves around the coupling of its two main characters; a choice which makes The Wedding Planner's plot extremely predictable, although at times amusing. While the plot complications are limited to the unavailability of either of the two main characters (where Steve is unable to abandon his prior commitments and Mary is ready to take up new ones), The Wedding Planner is most enjoyable when it creates romantic settings for its lovesick characters."

McConaughey is of course sexy with a laid-back charm, but that's just who he is.\n\nThis particular romantic comedy isn't all that funny, but the writers did seem to know which elements were necessary and included them. We find out McConaughey's secret the same time Lopez does, which is good because it helps us identify with our main heroine and we don't have to sit uncomfortably before the characters do. They also gave us another man - he's supposed to provide comic relief, and I did at least enjoy him. We also need to dislike the fianc\u00e9e. Cast Bridgette Wilson and make her a stuck-up snob, so that is easily accomplished.\n\nOne thing that I found that \"The Wedding Planner\" has over lesser romantic comedies, is genuine chemistry between the leads. Although it's certainly lacking in the comedy, I found the romance tangible."

        "review_title": "So what will it be Jennifer? Singing or acting?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Jennifer Lopez has gotten herself into quite a quandry of sorts here. Only as of recently has her musical career exploded internationally, her focus on acting seems to be diverted elsewhere as her last few movies have been quite awful (ie. \"ANGEL EYES\", \"U-TURN\"). Before her musical career took off, her movie roles were quite commendable (ie. \"OUT OF SIGHT\", \"SELENA\"). For Jennifer, it is unfortunate that I feel she should have to choose between one career or the other because I don't think she can handle both. She is a great singer and she can be a great actress but it is apparent that she can't manage both at the same time. This mess of a movie is supposed to showcase her 'comedic' talents yet displays the worst side of her one-dimensional acting abilities.\n\nThe trailers for this movie depicted \"THE WEDDING PLANNER\" to be a few hours of enjoyable romantic light fluff that anyone could enjoy on a lazy Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately, I turned this movie off half way through after my nerves finally gave in.\n\nYes, Jennifer Lopez portrays a successful wedding planner who is successful in her career but apparently unlucky in love. That is of course until she has a 'run-in' with her knight in shining armor (dryly portrayed by Matthew McConaughey in a 'phone-in' role). The only problem here is that Matthew is getting married to one of her new clients and she may very well be doomed to a loveless life married to some loser from high school who used to pick on her. It's a no-brainer in figuring out how this movie will end.\n\nYes, movies like \"SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE\", \"WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING\" and \"FRENCH KISS\" were enjoyable romantic comedies. We all knew how they were going to end yet we enjoyed the two hour journey that we had to take in order to see the grand finale. Unfortunately for \"THE WEDDING PLANNER\", the two hours are a rocky mess that tries to pair two unlikely characters with no chemistry whatsoever backed by a sound-track filled with Jennifer's own songs. The only thing I really enjoyed watching was the San Francisco scenery (how can one not love that city?)\n\nUsually when the grand finale in these romantic films happen, you generally leave the theater feeling warm and fuzzy inside or at least basically satisfied for the plot outcome of the characters. When \"THE WEDDING PLANNER\" finished, I could only think \"Good, I'm glad this garbage is over.\"\n\nFor a generic romantic comedy, \"THE WEDDING PLANNER\" fails to deliver. It could have worked had the characters shared at least a little bit of chemistry, but I didn't even pick up that vibe from what I saw. The credits close with Jennifer's hit song, \"My Love Don't Cost A Thing\" and that generally tops off the point I raised at the beginning of my review - Jennifer needs to choose between singing or acting because her film career is beginning to suffer as a result.\n\nMy Rating - 2 out of 10"

They are joined by Alex Rocco, who comically portrays Lopez's widowed father.

They did a wonderful job of portraying love at first sight and not knowing what to do about it. Sure, there were some predictable moments, but isn't that always the case in these types of movies? I may be a little biased, since the romantic comedy is my favorite movie genre. I just can't get enough of those wisecracks used to hide true feelings, those charming dance sequences, those lingering stares under the stars... *sigh*. Well, if you agree with me, then you'll love this simply charming movie."

Matthew McConaughey is charming as the conflicted Steve, and expertly plays both his character's dry, cynical side and his boyish joyfulness. The two play against one another well, unlike the boring Fran, whose idea of the perfect wedding song is Olivia Newton-John's \"I Honestly Love You,\" and who can't seem to find one legitimate reason why she wants to marry Steve in the first place.\n\nAs there are no other true funny characters, Massimo is perhaps intended to provide the film's comic relief, but his \"humor\" flows less from witty screen writing and masterful delivery and more from the director's mistaken assumption that every line a character delivers in broken English must be funny. Overall, \"The Wedding Planner\" does a good job of fulfilling audience expectations and creating characters that, while likable, are simply rom-com archetypes. The true romantic, unsatisfied with paltry declarations of love and empty representations of it, hopes for a bit more.\n\nRead my full review here: thecorrelationfilmblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/29/my-best-friends- weddingthe-wedding-planner/"

I'll stick with \"The Wedding Planner\".\" -------------------------------------------------------\n\nTyler was right on, and I and my Husband LOVE this Movie. Yes, a MAN can like this movie and my Husband LOVES it. This movie is SO Under Rated and as a Romantic Comedy it has all the Story Line (quirkiness) that makes a Classic Movie you can watch over and over again. That's why we give it a 10/10 Star.\n\nSo-o-o, all you critics out there, put the movie in and sit back with some buttered Popcorn and a drink, and watch a FUN movie without criticizing and ENJOY. Thank You Tyler Durden for voicing you opinion. SJMillers :-)"

Watching this movie is like watching a stampede of wildebeasts coming your way. You know what is going to happen, and the only solution is to run. The story is one big clich\u00e9, with not even one attempt to make it fresh. Lopez and McConaughey seem to have been cast for their looks only (Which doesn't surprise me at all for Lopez, as I have never been convinced of her acting qualities). They have no chemistry and do not even seem to be interested in the characters they are playing, making the whole a very boring affair to look at. This is not a movie but a commercial product, a blatant attempt to squeeze some more money out of the public. And, with an opening week of $13,5 million, apparently some people will just watch anything that moves and has a pretty face.\n\nDavid."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is not as if there is any bias against romantic-comedies, as there are a number of good ones out there. As with all film genres, there are also some bad ones, and sadly 'The Wedding Planner' is one of those, or at least to me.\n\n'The Wedding Planner' does have some beautiful scenery, a stunning wardrobe for Jennifer Lopez (who wears it every bit as much) and is also very nicely shot. While the cast seemed okay on paper providing the material was good, only Judy Greer provides any enjoyment or warmth. Fred Willard is also quite good, and his scene is one few scenes that can be considered scene-stealing, but his appearance is too brief really.\n\nJennifer Lopez does look stunning in her wardrobe and handles the cutesy moments quite well, however her comic timing is leaden and the emotional moments are a mess of overwrought and under-cooked, a very bland performance while never quite reaching the \"horror\" depths that her performance in 'Gigli' did. Matthew McConaughey looks lost and like his heart wasn't in it. Their lack of chemistry is a large part of the film's failure, their scenes together are awkward and pained, McConaughey's chemistry with Brigitte Wilson-Sampras (who tries her best with an underwritten and particularly clich\u00e9d character, but sometimes tries too hard) fares better having a warmer and more natural vibe.\n\nOn top of that, there are also Justin Chambers and Alex Rocco, whose performances are badly marred especially by two of the worst accents in the history of film. Although Chambers' Massimo is little more than an annoying Italian stereotype and is as convincing an Italian as Keanu Reeves for example is as an Englishman (in 'Dracula'), this is particularly true with Rocco, it is ironic that the most seasoned of all the actors sounds like he had just come from a particularly boozy night on the town.\n\nFor romantic comedies to work, the comedy should sparkle and the romantic elements should touch. To me, 'The Wedding Planner' failed at both. The comedy is chock full of clunky and witless dialogue, in a film crying out for somewhat of a screwball approach, and the situations are wildly improbable and would be more at place in a short-lived and amateurish sit-com. Very few romantic comedies have screenplays this irredeemably and intelligence insultingly dumb either.\n\nLack of chemistry between Lopez and McConaughey is not the only thing hindering the romantic elements. 'The Wedding Planner' could have been sweet, but lays it on so heavy with the sugar that it becomes nauseating. The story is predictable, even for romantic comedy, with an ending that is so obvious five minutes in, and heavy in contrivance and sappiness and very low on wit, proper emotional impact and sass. This may have been slightly acceptable if so many scenes weren't so insultingly ridiculous and impossible to take at face value.\n\nDirection is bland, the characters are genre archetypes that are a mix of obnoxious and dull and no other extreme and the soundtrack is over-bearingly ham-fisted and heavy-handed.\n\nOverall, fails as a comedy and as a romance and even a good cast can't save it. Not recommended. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

Then the nightmare begins, he is Farn Donolly's husband to be and her father is trying to marry her off to Massimo, a geek from Italy, where she was born. The film charts the story of the wedding and Mary and Eddie's growing feelings for each other. The film may end happily, but that is why you go to this type of film. The leads show why they are major players in Hollywood. McConaughey and Lopez generate on screen romance, Wilson plays Fran as as the stereotypical career go getter but this is not too over the top.

However, I tried to keep an open mind and give it a fair shake. Unfortunately, this movie just fell below my already low expectations. First time director and first time screenwriters, what can you expect?\n\nThe script was just not believable. I know that romantic comedies have the liberty of taking some license here and there, but I just didn't buy so much of this movie that the whole thing just seemed fake. For starters, we're supposed to believe that Jennifer Lopez is an Italian immigrant? Come on! Her father (Alex Rocco) doesn't sound Italian, he sounds retarded. I don't even know why she had to be an immigrant. There was nothing in the plot that required her being from another country, except for the fact that her father trys to arrange a marriage, which was just another unnecessary plot device. There's just so much that was wrong with this script, I'm just amazed that the leading actors signed on to this project.\n\nThe talent in this movie was fairly decent. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey had some chemistry and they looked good together. Kathy Najimy is a wonderful comedic actress and her scene with Jennifer was very good and believable. Fred Willard, and Kevin Pollak are the other actors that do comedic roles extremely well, but their talents were simply not tapped. They did what they could, but they simply had nothing to work with. IMHO I think Jennifer Lopez signed on because she was friends with Adam Shankman (he's a choreographer) and once she signed on, everyone else jumped on board for their resume."

Ms. Lopez is completely believable in her role as wedding planner: the dedicated, driven career woman and handsome McConaughey is delicious as the charming, down-to-Earth husband-to-be of Lopez's client. This sweet romantic comedy even made me wonder about dissolving my vow to never get romantically involved again. These two make magic! It's totally entertaining and highly recommended!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first question you have to ask about this movie is, what is the target audience supposed to be? In what may be a most telling scene, when the main character has an accident and wakes up in the hospital, she just happens to be in the pediatric ward; perhaps giving those to whom this insipid drivel would appeal something with which to relate? But I'm getting ahead of myself. In regards to `The Wedding Planner,' directed (more or less) by Adam Shankman, that last comment should've been reserved for later, but by then I may have had to make it `cliche-ridden' insipid drivel. Actually, early on this film seemed to have some promise; but then the opening credits ended and it was all downhill from there. It may ring of paranoia, but the makers of this movie-- though unable to deny responsibility since they did, in fact, make it-- may have been able to make a case that they had been the victims of a conspiracy of sorts, beginning with the cast they assembled to bring it all to life. I can think of no other movie that boasts such a grossly unappealing, miscast bunch of actors, beginning with Alex Rocco as Salvatore, the father of Mary Fiore, the character played by Jennifer Lopez. Mull that over for just a moment, if you will; Rocco as Lopez's father.... For the life of me, I cannot understand Jennifer Lopez; she's beautiful and talented, and seemingly bent on making as many mistakes, career-wise, as she possibly can. Perhaps I should make that `artistic' mistakes, since with her singing career and being given the opportunity to make movies (even ones like this) she is probably going to be very materially well-off, even if she continues to do nothing of artistic merit for the rest of her life. Maybe when the teenyboppers have grown tired of her (which shouldn't be too long) and she realizes that she will only be able to invade Brittany Spears territory so far, she will go back to what she is really good at, making movies like `Selena,' and `Out Of Sight,' in which she demonstrated what kind of acting chops she has. How ironic that in this film she plays a wedding planner, when what she needs in real life is a `career planner' for herself. It just seems like such a shame that `J. Lo' has taken the fast-track to fame and fortune instead of employing her myriad gifts to better purpose. That she looks attractive in this film cannot be denied, but neither can it be denied that as far as her acting, it was nothing more than a walk-through for her. Matthew McConaughey, meanwhile, winds up in even murkier waters than Lopez here, with his portrayal of Dr. Steve `Eddie' Edison, the character whom circumstances bring into contact with Mary Fiore at a pivotal point in his life. He is engaged to Fran (Bridgette Wilson), but begins to have second thoughts about it after his encounter with Mary. The plot line gets pretty complicated after that, and for anyone who has trouble keeping up with it, I can only suggest that they confer with some of those currently residing in that pediatric ward. Any charm, charisma or screen presence McConaughey has must have been checked at the gate when he signed on for this one, because a more flat, uninspired performance you are unlikely to find without looking real hard. Hold that thought; can anyone say Chris O'Donnell in `The Bachelor?' And the lack of chemistry between McConaughey and Lopez is stupefying; interestingly enough, he has even less with Wilson. The producers would've had to bring in truckloads of rocks and flint to ignite any sparks on this set. The supporting cast includes Justin Chambers (Massimo), Judy Greer (Penny), Joanna Gleason (Mrs. Donolly), Charles Kimbrough (Mr. Donolly), Fred Willard (Basil St. Mosely), Kathy Najimy (Geri) and Kevin Pollak as Dr. Dojny (but don't blink or you'll miss him). Unfortunately, the best thing that can be said about `The Wedding Planner' is that it makes even the mediocre movies look good. It's always a huge disappointment to see talent, the likes of which are involved here, go to waste in such an unmitigated debacle as this. It would be so satisfying to see Jennifer Lopez, especially, in a project worthy of what she has to offer, and of which she is capable; as an audience, we can only hope that she gets some good advice about the direction of her career, and that she will have the guts to listen to and act upon it. I rate this one 1/10."

I'm not trying to be funny: there really is a mystery here.\n\nEveryone in the story is a complete idiot, determined never to say or do the obvious, sensible thing, and the film tries to persuade us that this is cute. (Partly by means of an ingratiating musical score, which winks and smirks and makes \"wry\" musical comments at us until we can take it no more.) An almost complete stranger walks up to Mary and announces to the four people she's with that the two of them are engaged. It's not in Mary's interest to have anyone think this and it's not hard for her to deny it. Does she deny it? Of course not! What do you take her for?\n\nAll we have to sustain us through this tortured, stupid plot-trundling is Jennifer Lopez's charm.

Maybe in the fantasyland this movie takes place in, someone who looks like Jennifer Lopez would be lonely...in the real world she needs 10 huge bodyguards just to keep all the would be suiters away from her. Who cares really anyway? This is a movie made by a huge faceless studio and directed by a dance instructor, where every element is tested by computers for the mass appeal rating. Every frame reeks of cute and demographic target audience. If you are a girl you will probably like this movie, if you are a guy than you should fake a horrible illness to avoid going."

        "review_detailed_main": "Admittedly, I approached \"The Wedding Planner\" with some trepidation. The title sounds like a weak ripoff of the enjoyable \"The Wedding Singer.\" To my great surprise, \"The Wedding Planner\" is a vastly superior movie. Opening with,perhaps, the longest single take since \"Touch of Evil,\" director Adam Shankman and Jennifer Lopez create a fresh look at a yet another \"control freak\" discovering she only BELIEVES she is in control. Like its star, Jennifer Lopez, \"The Wedding Planner\" is tightly constructed and quite engaging. Lopez is excellent, even if her gestures are more Hispanic than Italian. More convincing as an Italian is Justin Chambers as Massimo, Lopez's lovesick childhood suitor. One of the great strengths of \"Planner\" is that both Chambers and Brigette Wilson are so likeable, one roots for them as much as he does the leads.\n\nThis movie is almost equally romantic-comedy-drama. Anyone who views the outtakes will see that much of the drama was left on the cutting room floor (including Lopez's best scene).\n\n\"The Wedding Planner\" is not necessarily a movie I would want to see again, but it was certainly time well spent. I give a 7 out of 10."

The fact that this was involved in the Razzies and only won an award in the Kids' Awards speaks great volumes. Terrible acting, script, plot, everything. Don't watch this; if you're mad enough to watch it bring a double barrelled shotgun: that way, if you miss the first time, you can shoot for a second time and hopefully kill yourself instead of having your eyes exposed to Satan's creation to torture paedophiles."

However to be fair there were some moving scenes but they were far and few between. I won't even point out the irony between Ms. Lopez' role in this film and her real life matrimonial difficulties. My rating: 5/10. If you are a 10-17 year old female you'll probably like this film a lot more than I did."

I figured, what would I have to loose? I lost a hour and 40 minutes. The Wedding Planner wasn't necessarily a bad story, but it was bad casting and incredibly clich\u00e9d as usual for a romantic comedy. Jennifer Lopez, it was so funny because the \"review\" for the film on the back of the cover was \"Jennifer Lopez is smart and sexy, she has it\", considering that's not a review of the film, I should've known better.\n\nMary is a wedding planner who is having a hard time finding that guy of her dreams, but one day while planning a wedding for her biggest client ever, she is walking and her Gucci shoe gets caught in the sewer vent, instead of being smart when a garbage truck is about to head towards her and kill her, she goes back for the stupid shoe, but I guess it all turned out for the best since Eddie, a supposedly cute doctor, saves her life. But as it turns out he is the fianc\u00e9e she was planning the wedding for. She has to deal with a guy her dad is trying to set her up with while she is in love with Eddie and he also must confront some tough feelings before the wedding.\n\nThe Wedding Planner is just a typical romantic comedy that has nothing special. Jennifer and Matt had zero chemistry, I don't know what the casting director was thinking other than big bucks in the box office, because Matt and Jen had no chemistry what so ever. The story is alright, needs a lot of polish, but unfortunately it just has you begging for the stupid story to end since it's so predictable in the first place.\n\n3/10"

This guy did such a great job with his character that I was almost instantly in love with the sweetness and genuine feeling that came across in his overly-involved father role. His part was relatively small, but important and superbly done.\n\nWatch it if you want, but don't expect to be blown away or swept off your feet."

Jennifer Lopez is fantastic as a wedding planner who can seem to find herself a good man so she obsesses over everything else instead.\n\nI give this movie 5 stars and two big thumbs up!

Now THERE was some perfect casting and chemistry. In THE WEDDING PLANNER, it felt like she was just sort of \"filling in\" for someone else at the last minute.\n\nThe irony of that is that MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY replaced BRENDEN FRASER (who opted out to do BEDAZZLED)at the last minute and was more believable and natural.\n\nGood thing Matthew McConaughey stepped in because I have a feeling that Brenden Fraser would have been too clean cut against the sexy Lopez, where as McConaughey can keep up with her.\n\nThroughout the movie, I just kept thinking of other actresses who would have been more believable. Sandra Bullock...Calista Flockhart...JENNIFER ANNISTON. My sister enthusiastically agreed.\n\nI didn't care for the guy who played Lopez's supposed fiance. Italian? I dunno about THAT....His accent was so over the top and distracting...\n\nIt is a great idea for a movie and has a lot of nice moments. But it moves a bit too fast. They could have taken a little more time in the first 40 minutes of the film to develop a little more chemistry between Lopez and McConaughey. If they had done that, I might have been more willing to believe the contrived ending. Towards the last 30 minutes I rolled my eyes so much they started to hurt. And the theatre didn't hand out barf bags, so I stayed nauseated.\n\nToo bad. Such a cute idea. Fizzles towards the end.\n\n6/10"

Totally underrated character. We need more guys like him (you know besides the incessant stalking and trying to get a woman he barely knows as a grownup to marry him). There are more than a couple wholesome, teary scenes that timelessly resonate with many people, especially those who \"don't feel anything about love.\""

Unlike all those stupid Julia Roberts romantic comedies, in this one the main character can't even act! What is with all these supposed singers trying to get into acting. They can't sing, and they most certainly can not act. Jennifer Lopez is an absolute joke as an actress. In The Cell she seemed to think that putting on a `dark princess' pout would be all that is needed, perhaps she was right, it worked alright. But in this horrible movie you at least need some charming acting, not some wannabe."

Which is a shame considering that Jennifer Lopez has been in some pretty good films recently (The Cell, Out of Sight, U-Turn) as has Matthew McConaghey (EdTV, A Time To Kill). They are put in a film that not only do you know the outcome the minute you see the stars' names come up, you know the outcome when you see the trailers (just peachey aren't those all spoiling trailers).

The story is cute, and there are some truly romantic scenes that make us all wishing we had more of that in our lives. Jennifer Lopez plays her role well (all though some might argue that it's highly unlikely for a girl like her to have not had a date in two years!), and Matthew McConaughey does a great job as Dr. Steve Edison. I was very impressed with him in this movie. The supporting cast seems to hold their own all right. Massimo (Justin Chambers) gets slightly irritating after a while, but that's my only truly large complaint.\n\nOverall, not the best ever made, but great for those days you watch a movie just for the purpose of bringing a smile to your face. :)"

Become a wedding planner and steal your client's fiance!!!\n\nCameron, come on you're a wedding planner, not an engineer getting ready to launch the space shuttle at mission control, lose the headset babe, planning weddings IS NOT rocket science.\n\nWhy did Steve mis-lead Mary with a night of movies and soul talk when he was already engaged to an obviously smarter person who is better suited to his social circle? Are we not to believe that Mary would not think the same thing could happen to her if she also commited to marrying this louse(Steve)?\n\nMatthew MacConauhey a doctor? PUULLEEASE!!! I only eat brown M&Ms? What medical school did he attend? Jim Bob's Correspondance School of Medicine?\n\nWhy would a doctor marry a wedding planner in the first place? I can see it now, Cameron and Matthew at the country club. \"Doctor, what a lovely wife you have, and where did your wife go to college\"? \"Oh, she went to Daisy Duke's Junior College and majored in wedding planning with a minor in basket weaving\". \"She's now planning on staying at home and becoming a baby factory so we can pollute the world's gene pool with more wedding planners\". That'll go over real well in his social circle.\n\nOh let's see I'm writing this movie script who should I have Cameron Diaz fall in love with? A computer programmer?, no, a plumber?, no, an accountant?, no. I know, I'll write the script to make her fall in love with a rich doctor!!!\n\nThis movie is an insult to anyone who has and IQ above 90. Steer clear of it unless your below the age of 16."

This romantic comedy just didn't leave me with those warm, fuzzy feelings at the end.\n\nSteve Edison (Matthew McConaughey) is completely un-charming, and during the entire movie I was really trying hard to figure out what Mary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) sees in him. Mary Fiore is a wedding planner, who finds out after almost kissing Steve that he is actually the groom-to-be of a big wedding she is planning.\n\nIn addition to the fact that he doesn't bother to mention he is engaged when he flirts with her, he very rarely says anything nice to her throughout the entire movie. He has an irritating drawl, and his mediocre looks can't make up for any of these things or explain what Mary's fascination is. Still, it is apparent that she is in love with him, and although in her trade she is the best-of-the-best, she is having a hard time trying to plan a wedding in which he will marry another woman.\n\nThe rest of the movie is just a drawn-out plot that keeps you in suspense while you wonder if she is going to end up with Steve at the end (the predictable ending), or another man who is in love with Mary, but whom Mary does not love back.\n\nThere were many various annoyances in this movie, especially at the ending; I won't go into details as I don't want to spoil the ending, but let me tell you it was just plain dull.\n\nI have to admit Jennifer did a fine job of acting in this movie. Too bad she alone could not save this movie.\n\nMy score: 6 out of 10"

In this film she plays an unlucky at love, searching for Mr. Right, still living at home girl. To her credit this role is as about as far away as you can get from the real J-Lo. She attempts to hide her ample charms beneath a business suit and a pulled back \"professional\" hair style. Doesn't work.\n\nLopez, in a role more suited for Sandra Bullock, plays a wedding planner for the rich and affluent and who has no prospects of her own. Along comes Doctor Matthew McConnaghy with his dimples and perfect teeth who just happens by and saves our Jennifer and her shoe from a rampaging dumpster. Naturally they fall madly in love, or so it seems. Turns out old Dr. Matt is engaged to a high society miss (Bridgitte Wilson) who just happens to be Lopez' latest client. Well you know the rest. That's how predicable the story is.\n\nLopez simply is not believable as a plain Jane loser at love. McConnaghy's role would have come off better had his character been the cad that Lopez originally thought him to be. Instead we get a one-dimensional Hollywood pretty boy stereo type of performance.\n\nAmong the supporting characters, Judy Grier as Lopez' assistant is good but is not given enough to do. Alex Rocco stands out as Lopez' father who tries to \"fix\" his daughter up with a husband (Justin Chambers). Fred Willard is wasted in an all too brief appearance as Basil St. Mosely the dance instructor.\n\nYou know what the ending will be as soon as the main characters meet. It is a little unbelievable how easy Wilson accepts being left at the altar by McConnaghy and you have to feel sorry for the Chambers character when he too is unceremoniously dumped by Lopez.\n\nA forgettable movie."

As for Matthew Mconahey, I think I spelled that right lol, he is alright, not the best choice for the role of you ask me, but I didn't really hate him as the romantic interest for Lopez. Matthew is just slightly bland in the movie, I didn't really feel his energy or heart in it. Judy Greer is wonderful in her supporting best friend/coworker role. I thought she was enjoyable and funny. The chemistry was there, it just wasn't like electric or awesome, again, maybe if someone else would've played Matthew's role, then maybe the chemistry would have been better. The dialogue and writing is alright, I mean it's nothing too special, it doesn't bring anything new to the genre, which I guess it doesn't really have to, but a little more creativity would have been nice. When it's all said and done, I do enjoy this film, but I just don't think it's great, in other words, I've seen better when it comes to the romantic comedy genre. 6/10 for The Wedding Planner."

It was too predictable to be mindlessly entertaining. There weren't enough interesting images or wonderful music to be appealing to the senses. The leads (Lopez, McConaughey) were too miscast and their characters too poor to be enjoyed as actors.\n\nWhile I know brain-dead movies are \"in\", it surprises me a movie like this would be released when it has so little else to offer (along with being especially \"brain-dead\"). I can't recommend this to anyone except preteens who still dress Barbie and Ken up in wedding outfits and have fantasy weddings for the plastic pair (which actually, come to think of it, sounds just about as entertaining as this movie). 2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Mary (Jennifer Lopez) is a rising star in the wedding planner arena. She has been garnering some pretty high profile weddings, in the San Francisco area, and turning them into beautiful and hitch-less affairs. So, when her boss (Kathy Najimy) hesitates at giving Mary a raise, the two strike a deal. If Mary can land the wedding of a wealthy socialite named Fran (Bridgette Wilson Sampras), Mary will become a partner in the business. Mary succeeds in winning over Fran and the wedding arrangements begin. Away from the job, however, Mary is gun-shy with men, preferring to spend evenings at Scrabble tournaments or watching the Antiques Road Show in her immaculate and super-organized apartment. One day, Mary's heel gets stuck in a grate as she is crossing a busy street. As she struggles to release the shoe, she does not notice that a truck is bearing down on her. But, Dr. Steve (Matthew McConaghay) does. He grabs the beautiful young woman and pulls her to safety. Later, when Mary invites him to go an outdoor movie in a lovely San Fran park, he accepts. They have a lovely evening together, one that almost ends in a kiss. Yet, each of them hesitate and the moment is gone. Soon after, Mary learns why Steve pulled back from her....he is the fianc\u00e9 of go-getter Fran! Should Mary continue to plan the wedding, even though she feels drawn to handsome Steve? And, isn't he a rat anyway for flirting with another woman while counting down the days to his own wedding? This is a very nice movie, with a lovely setting and a sweet story. Lopez will never look more beautiful than she does here, for she is utterly gorgeous, from her enchanting costumes to her long, lovely hair. For those who feel the need to show off their forms in skimpy costumes, think again. One look at Lopez in a high-necked black dress and rose-colored sweater and you will realize that true beauty is elegant, and not a mere flash of flesh. J-Lo also gives a sweet performance as the lady looking for an earth-moving love. McConaghay is fine as the mixed-up groom and Wilson has her tole as a spoiled heiress down to a T. The rest of the cast is also nice. The whole production looks very attractive and eye-catching, to say the least, from the scenes in the park to a winery setting and on to Lopez' lovely apartment. If you love romantic comedies, this one should be one your top twenty list, absolutely. But, even if you think romcoms are for chicks only, take a chance with this one. You might be surprised at how much fun these movies can be, in between the required lovelorn gazes, of course."

Not a more predictable, nonsense story could have been invented. People in love at first sight, weddings crashing on the altar and runaways of brides. The script is stuffed with some comic gags (a bit vulgar, like the scene of the statue), and the eccentricities of Massimo and his family. At least they spared us the typical gay friend ! Too little to save the weak plot, clear pretext to give J.Lo a role and make a rich box-office.\n\nThe direction is decent (the budget was quite considerable!), as for the soundtrack and the two good starring actors. Surely, a classic in the genre, a must see for women on the point of wedding. Otherwise, it's a romantic, ordinary comedy for lovers only."

There was some over-acting by support cast, which I feel was meant to be funny but the punch line just doesn't make it across. The leading man, Matthew was OK and at least convincing for the most part in his role.\n\nFran's parents were annoying and I think the singing thing was a bit unnecessary.

While there are some classics of the genre such as HARRY MET SALLY or SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, there are others like THE WEDDING PLANNER and few others that are quickly forgotten and with low scores. I really liked this movie for what it was.\n\nMary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) is a successful wedding planner that despite her occupation is not interested in new relationships. After she flees from Massimo, a childhood friend that loves to putting her in embarassment, she risks death on the street when a wheeled dumpster goes down at maximum speed on the road. But she is saved by Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey), a young medic, and soon a love relationship begins. Unfortunately, after a while Mary discovers that Steve is engaged to Fran Donnelly (Bridgette Wilson) and the wedding is organized by Mary's agency! Despite Mary eventually begins to date Massimo and finally accepts him, she feels that Steve is her true love. After Steve eventually leaves Fran, he races against time for helping Mary in stopping her relationship with a man she doesn't love. After Massimo understands this, he leaves her and finally Mary and Steve can stay together.\n\nI personally liked the movie because it relies on the message that true love will never end for a person despite sometimes other people would stop it. Jennifer Lopez gives one of her best performances and she really is the soul of the film. And she really didn't deserved the Razzie nomination that year. Matthew McConaughey is very likeable despite being also a bit goofy, but he was right in character. Most of the supporting actors fare from scene stealers to annoying. The soundtrack is very good despite not having Lopez's songs in it.\n\nDon't trust the overall rating and most of the reviews too much, because I think that if you are in the right mindset (just like me when I saw it) you may like this movie for what it is."

Same as the acting Erratic.\n\nContinuity - Erratic some scenes why here others why deleted.\n\nScript - With the like ability of the competing characters and Rocco's buildup this has the potential for uniqueness and greatness, but after the teasing goes to the by the numbers lines Erratic.\n\nAnd so I could go on. This is why this appears to be a very good or bad movie with little in between. Erratic it teases you and then does not come up to where it could be to do the by the numbers scene.

        "review_detailed_main": "One (actually two) scenes in particular best reflect what I think is this movie's problem. Steve (McConaughy) is throwing away peanut M&Ms, leaving only the brown ones. Mary (Lopez) asks him why he's doing this, and he replies that, since brown is the colour of chocolate, brown M&Ms don't have artificial colouring. Now, whether or not this is a major health concern for the average M&M eater is debatable, but Doctor (Doctor!) Steve overlooks one very important fact: M&M shells are made out of sugar and wax and are therefore naturally white in color. Brown M&Ms are just as artificially colored as any other. Not only does Mary fall for this inane bit of 'logic,' she starts throwing away non-brown M&Ms as well. She is presented in the movie as a level-headed, quick thinking, intelligent woman. Why then, I ask, why would she ever fall for a man who not only cheats on his fiancee but forms ridiculous theories, acts on them and advises others to follow his lead without ever finding out if he's actually right. And if she has no reason to be with him, the movie can't work as a romantic comedy."

Then the romance kicks in and it's sappy and predictable. Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Lopez don't have the much chemistry. And you can't make a good romance without chemistry.\n\n\"The Wedding Planner\" is about Jennifer Lopez's character who is a wedding planner. One day, she is saved by McConaughey and they hit it off. Meanwhile, she has a big wedding to plan. And GUESS WHAT! The groom is McConaughey! Big surprise. Lopez gets angry and the two banter back and forth until he saves her again. And so on and whatnot.\n\nThe acting is alright, but there is no script. The actors try, but nothing happens. One thing I must say, though, Judy Greer (Jawbreaker) is hilarious as Lopez's fellow wedding planner. \"The Wedding Planner\" tries, but never gets there\n\n*Note: Look for Kathy NiJimy in her most... uh... glamorious role ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!!\n\n**queue intro music**\n\nToday's movie review is the romantic comedy The Wedding Planner (2001) is a romantic comedy, starring 2000s hotpocket Jennifer Lopez and super chilled bloke Matthew McConaughey where a successful wedding planner falls in love with the groom-to-be of her latest client. In the bustling streets of San Francisco, McConaughey's character, Steve, comes to the rescue of Lopez's character, Mary, in a chance encounter driven by a pair of high-end shoes. Their unexpected meeting sparks an instant connection, but complications arise as Steve is already engaged. As Mary juggles her professional responsibilities as a dedicated and meticulously organized wedding planner, she finds herself increasingly drawn to Steve. Working under the supervision of Kathy Najimy's character, a veteran wedding planner, Mary is portrayed as a utility belt-wearing professional, always prepared with essentials like fob spray, Evian, and sedatives. Despite her pragmatic approach to her work, Mary harbors dreams of her own fairy-tale wedding, a sentiment echoed in her iconic line, \"I'm the Wedding Planner,\" reminiscent of a superhero's declaration.\n\nAs their relationship blossoms, Steve, a man with idiosyncrasies like preferring brown M&M's, becomes enamoured with Mary. However, despite their growing affection, the chemistry between the actors falls flat, affecting their comedic timing and overall energy. This lack of spark makes it challenging for viewers to invest in their romantic journey. Amidst these shortcomings, the film showcases glimpses of San Francisco's charm, including a notable scene featuring a screening of the classic film \"An Affair to Remember.\" This cinematic reference serves as a poignant backdrop to Mary and Steve's evolving romance, touching on themes of love, fate, and the enduring power of human connection.\n\nOverall 5/10."

Two up-and-coming stars like Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey have no business being in this thing. Neither one has the talent to be thrown into starring in any romantic comedy, much less this one. The script is childish and even professional comedians couldn't make this mess work. Each of the characters is given a set of quirky traits that they carry like baggage throughout the story. They never step out of the molds made for them by the writers. They behave one way, each and every time that they're on screen. Utterly predictable. This was not a wise move for Lopez and McConaughey, making this film. They have dashed their credibility in this genre. I would even go so far to call it a career-killer if we, the public, didn't have such short memories. I've spent more than enough time writing about such an infantile movie. The director, Adam Shankman, should stick to what he knows best; choreography. Don't waste even an hour finding out that I may be right. If you must see this, please wait for it to be shown on cable.\n\nOn second thought, don't."

But I was pleasantly surprised that not only is her character actually likeable, but she can pull off a comedy. There is a misconception about this movie that its about how she steals some other woman's man. This isn't really the case, and its alot more about how a woman whose life is surrounded with romance and actually has a much more pragmatic approach to love as a result of being burned before. And there is one part, I don't want to spoil it, where anyone who has ever had their heart broken by the one they thought would marry will relate to. I have to admit that scene made me cry, it was like they had taken that exact situation from my own life. For anyone who has been a romantic, but in doubt of whether they will ever find romance in their life, this is a movie you should check out. Sure, its predictable, but if it touches you, who cares?"

Unfortunately, there's nothing much that's good about this romantic comedy. I laughed a couple of times, and it was almost romantic, but the whole thing was just too unbelievable to be successful. True, Lopez looks lovely, but I'm afraid her acting left me laughing in all the wrong places. There was almost no chemistry between the two leads, and many of the characters were underdeveloped, which left them looking like they belonged in a cartoon strip. Sorry, Jennifer, but I would suggest that you leave romantic comedies alone for the time being."

It was a very entertaining film with a story, no violence, no swearing.

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never really understood Jennifer Lopez's sex appeal, and The Wedding Planner just adds to my confusion. A friend of mine once called her the sexiest woman alive, but to me she seems like a mini with a trailer hitch made for a semi truck. She's not bad looking by any means, but really, are her looks worth the one billion dollars she has insured it for? Anyway I digress. As you probably know from the deluge of trailers flooding your television, The Wedding Planner is the new romantic comedy staring Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey. Lopez plays Mary, a Wedding Planner so good that she makes as much business for her firm as all the other wedding planners put together times five. She's also a total neat freak and organizer, a person who folds her shirts and blouses around a piece of sheet plastic to keep them flat. She might plan weddings but her own heart was broken when her fiance screwed her over. She meets Dr. Steve Edison (McConaughey) when he saves her life. They then proceed to go out on a sort of date and he fails to mention that he is getting married in three months. Of course it turns out that his wedding is being planned by Mary (what a shock) and it is also the most important job of her career. Most of this is straight from the trailer, no surprises. And for the most part that is the way that the rest of the movie goes, no surprises. I find it interesting that Lopez would choose a project like this however, because while not all of her movies are all that great, most of them are interesting and challenge norms (think The Cell, Out of Sight or U-Turn not Anaconda). The unfortunate thing about The Wedding Planner is that there are a lot of good character interactions here, but they are diverted and pushed aside because the female lead has to get together with the male lead in the end. The relationship between Dr. Steve and his fiance Fran (played by Bridgette Wilson-Sampras whom you may remember as Sonya in Mortal Kombat) is portrayed quite well. Although the problems in Fran and Steve's relationship are subtle and not given enough screen time, some of their scenes near the end of the movie work quite well. Along those same lines Massimo (played by Justin Chambers) does a good job endearing himself on the audience as the other man in Mary's life. By the end of the film you are quite ready to root for him over Dr. Steve. The romance between Steve and Mary however is quite a bit different. I never really saw the spark between the two of them. All I came away from the romantic scenes between the leads was that Steve wasn't ready to get married to Fran. The only real surprise is that, contrary to its assembly line style formula, there are quite a few funny scenes in The Wedding Planner. In fact, except for some of the labored romance scenes between Lopez and McConaughey almost every scene has some funny moments in it. Especially good in their roles as comic relief are Fran's parents played by Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough. Also Mary's friends in her Scrabble club lend a few funny moments. While I certainly wasn't busting my gut laughing, the comedy made me forget about the tepid romance through most of the movie. So should you see this movie? Well, if you're hard up for a date movie, and don't mind some gratuitously placed Lopez music, go for it. The slightly above average comedy makes the so-so romance bearable. But only go to this one as a last resort, there are plenty of good movies in the theaters right now and nine to twelve bucks is a lot to spend on slightly above average comedy."

But even trying to forget my 'standards', the scenes sometimes seemed too long (for example when someone is just waiting for the camera to stop, or looking in the horizon, without, of course, any music), the acting was OVERALL good BUT I really cringed at times, too many times for me to be happy about it. I didn't like the music, but this is just my taste in music that doesn't match. The plot-line was senseless. Sure, you don't look for extremely believable movies in that genre, but I still think this one is something else in that field. I'm not one to badly want a movie to end (Which actually only happened in the third installment of Hunger Games) but I was looking forward to the end of this one.

I'm not going to waste time bashing Jennifer Lopez--that's already been done by many a reviewer below and besides, it's like shooting fish in a barrel, plus her days in the spotlight are (hopefully) numbered anyway.

Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Lopez have zero chemistry in this movie. The comedy...hmm..other than a couple of inferences to McConaughey's rumored homosexuality there was none to be had. The Wedding Planner had zero twists to the plot that were not telegraphed in the first 5 minutes. What can I say....this movie gets a 3/10 at best.\n\nIf the choice must be a romantic comedy guys, get Bridget Jones Diary or even Americas Sweethearts. Avoid the Wedding Planner and The Princess Diaries (More crap although not half as bad as this one if you can believe that!)."

As much as I like Jennifer Lopez as an actor, we start on the end of a movie I'd rather see with Bree Turner, and I feel like I would have rather seen Judy Greer in the lead, she seems about as Italian as Jennifer Lopez.\n\nI understand when the meet-cute is a life-threatening situation where adrenaline causes chemical confusion, but this is sort of a head injury causes an almost \"love at first sight\" cliche, but mixed with an \"unavailable romance\" cliche.\n\nOnce we establish that she loves weddings and it's important to her for some reason, it's a lot of him (not) pursuing her because he's getting married, and her trying to be respectful, but honest.\n\nThe movie highlights more societal problems for people that can afford big weddings, or, in short, there is more dumb than funny in this.\n\nI'm not even going to say this is a bad movie, but it's not impressive, and just not for me."

With these actors, I bet a lot of people went and saw it, and I'm sure it made money, but it sure was terrible.\n\nIt's full of terrible jokes and scenes that don't make any sense, bad characters and side plots, and poorly written dialogue. I gave it a whopping four stars out of ten instead of something less than that only because...wait, why DID I give it four whole stars? I don't know. I really don't.

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a bit surprised to learn several reviewers did not like \"The Wedding Planner.\" However, they just did not \"get\" the way the plot is constructed, blending the plot of \"Cinderella\" in reverse and adding bits of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" by William Shakespeare. Very early in the film, Mary loses her shoe in a manhole grate and is rescued by Dr. Steve, just as Cinderella loses her shoe toward the end of the fairy tale and then has it replaced by the Prince. In both plots, there is the element of \"love at first sight,\" something that charms every fan of romantic stories.\n\nSoon Mary learns her \"Prince\" already is engaged to Fran, her most important client. Of course, this brings an element of disappointment as we want the neglected, down-trodden girl to get the \"Prince\" in the end, but how will this happen? Some reviewers accused Steve of cheating on his fiancee', but actually the engagement is proving to be lackluster and a mistake from the beginning because Steve and Fran want totally different things from life. Steve is a \"people person\" with altruistic values who unselfishly cares for and about his patients. Fran and her rich parents are \"users\" who invested in some sort of medical corporation, and they expect Steve to give up his medical practice to become their spokesman. Steve is totally unaware of this hidden agenda, and this adds to the tension as the viewer realizes Steve is about to be victimized.\n\nAnother element of the \"Cinderella\" plot is the ball, which takes the form of the ballroom dance lesson, led by Fred Willard, in which Mary and Steve dance together. Fran's indifference to her own wedding is shown when she devotes the dance lesson time to making a business call. This scene shows that Fran and her parents are all about money and using people to make more of it, whereas Steve and Mary are sincere, people-oriented individuals who know love is the greatest gift.\n\nThe elements of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" are the movie-in-the-park scenes which resemble the forest in Shakespeare's play. Furthermore, he elderly friends of Mary's father are like the sprites who encourage and confuse the two pairs of lovers in the play. At first, the two blonds (Fran and Steve) are a couple and the two brunets (Mary and Massiimo) are a couple, and then the switch takes place when Mary and Steve spend more time together. The reverse-switch takes place when Mary and Massimo briefly consider marriage, and then Mary realizes Steve is her true love after all.\n\nThe \"Cinderella\" plot in reverse comes to fulfillment in the later scenes of Mary at home with her father and his friends and when someone explains how Mary has been affected by her mother's death. In \"Cinderella,\" this is told at the beginning and shortly after the \"Once upon a time\" opening line of the story.\n\nI really cannot say enough about the beauty of this film in regard to the settings, wardrobes, romantic music, chemistry between the romantic leads, and the way it combines the two classic plots of \"Cinderella\" and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" I believe it truly is a gem of a film and always will be my favorite."

Matthew McConaughey is the Doctor whose wedding she is planning and, along with his beautiful fianc\u00e9, played by Bridget Wilson, who are making all the wrong choices, at least in Mary's mind. Meanwhile Mary's father tries to set her up with a nice Italian boy (Justin Chambers)--her childhood playmate who made her a doll house back in Italy. The Wedding Planner is one of my all time favorite movies--the kind you can watch again and again and still enjoy it!"

Even my action-flick-devotee boyfriend enjoyed the comedy of THE WEDDING PLANNER. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey seemed to be having a good time together, and I'm definitely happy that Brendan Fraser was not the love interest here. It would NOT have worked. McConaughey's charm, paired with Lopez's sweetness really make an excellent combination. I definitely recommend that you see this film, and ignore the jaded critics who aren't ALLOWED to like a film like this."

He plays Steve, a life-saving pediatrician. Put the two together and you have a great, fun loving movie. I definetely recommend this film for everyone. I took my daughter to see it with me.

The \"Love-theme\" in the film is the keyword and I don\u00b4t see anything bad in that. Love is something you trip and fall over day after day, at least the feelings inside.\n\nIt is a cute film, worth seeing a lot of times. The romantic comedy is there, and I laughed: a lot!

I thought that Mary (Jennifer Lopez) and Fran (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) looked very beautiful in all their dressy clothing, especially their wedding dresses. However, if you ask me, Massimo (Justin Chambers) was a crazy man. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that this film really touched my heart and made me feel good.

I'm a guy (last time I checked) and I realize I'm not the target for this, but to me, this movie is good enough to watch over and over. All of the acting seems good to me, the chemistry between the leads is definitely there, and the jokes are funny. Maybe it's exactly like fifty other films, but I haven't watched those other fifty films. I keep coming back to this one, and I enjoy it every time."

I love romantic and sappy movies, so this movie was perfect for me! It also had so comedy in it, which just as it was getting sad something would lift the mood of the scene. The Wedding Planner is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, with tears, laughter, happiness and sadness! If you liked the movie I suggest Monster-In-Law or Maid in Manhatten, which both include Jennifer Lopez as well."

So why the low rating? Oh well, who cares I suppose, but I wish people would be more forgiving, just because they may have such high expectations, totally inflated ones perhaps...sure JLO was no Julia Roberts, and Matthew Mc. Is no Brad Pitt, but they both hold their own quite well. There is decent chemistry, the supporting cast are skilled and charismatic...I rate films based on rewatchability and entertainment. This fits the profile of something I'd watch every 5 years or so. I've seen it thrice, maybe four times. The scenes in the park are classic, with the dancing and the old films. A sound romance this is."

Instead of immediately telling Fran about his doubts, he was determined to proceed forward with the wedding until she made the decision to have a transparent chat with him about their genuine sentiments.

        "review_detailed_main": "A warm and heartfelt romantic comedy left me with truly kind and sincere impressions. This charming film rightfully holds its place among the best in its genre. While its plot may not be groundbreaking, do love stories always have to be intricate? Love is simple; it blossoms in the most ordinary, seemingly mundane situations-if only one knows how to see it. This movie subtly emphasizes the importance of courage, determination, and faith in relationships-messages delicately woven \"between the lines.\"\n\nIt's impossible not to praise the brilliance of Jennifer Lopez, whose charisma shines through every scene. Her expressive facial expressions add life to each moment-from the scenes in Steve's hospital to the playful episodes in the word game club or the ride to the park. Roles like this, filled with lightness and romance, perfectly align with her acting talent. In this sense, she reminds me of Jennifer Aniston, who, though a versatile actress, is especially captivating in romantic comedies.\n\nMatthew McConaughey's performance, however, evokes mixed feelings. In some scenes, he appeared overly reserved, almost devoid of emotion, giving the impression of a \"frozen fish.\" Yet, surprisingly, his calm demeanor created a contrast to the whirlwind of emotions from the other characters-Mary's passionate father, her emotional assistant, the eccentric Massimo, and the chaotic family of the bride. This balance brought harmony to the film. Moreover, there were moments where McConaughey truly shone: the farewell scene at Mary's door after her emotional outburst, the touching moments at the children's hospital, and the sincere conversation with Fran in the finale.\n\nAmong the supporting characters, Alex Rocco stands out, bringing authentic Italian passion and soul to his role. Justin Chambers, portraying the naive yet genuine Massimo, also impressed with his sincerity and subtle comedic charm.\n\nThis film is the epitome of romantic comedy-a story about love and kindness, so vital in our times. It reminds us that, occasionally, we all need to immerse ourselves in the atmosphere of a magical, slightly idealized tale to keep believing in the power of emotions and the beauty of human connections."

Jennifer Lopez is not only a talented dancer and singer, but she is also an animated actress who seem fit for this role. Go to this film if you are looking for a sweet, romantic comedy with a happy ending."

I typically like J.Lo and Matthew, but the previews made me think of a cotton candy cringefest combination of \"My Best Friend's Wedding\" and \"The Wedding Singer.\" However. Other than the weird color on Matthew's hair and the full-on unbelievability that J.Lo is an Italian, the movie's actually pretty good. This is NOT a guy movie...but it has all the trappings of a date movie."
