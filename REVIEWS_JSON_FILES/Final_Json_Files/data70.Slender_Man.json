It's not great but it's simply not THAT bad.\n\nAlike Lovecraft Slender Man seems to be one of those commonly used subject matters that always seeems to miss the mark. Filmmakers just don't seem to be able to make the most out of the fantastic material presented before them.\n\nSo yet again we see a tale of a group of young folks on the run from the Slender Man and spooky things happen. Yadayadayada.\n\nWith a decent young cast including Joey King and Annalise Basso we're presented with the glossiest and most high budget Slender Man movie yet. Sadly along with the budget comes all the usual Hollywood horror flaws, demonstrating once again how badly Hollywood have lost their way when it comes to the entire genre.\n\nSure it looks great, but the plot tail spins out of control by about the halfway mark and that's such a shame as up until then it was showing real potential. Hollywood need to go back to the drawing board, hire indie filmmakers to adapt material otherwise we'll just keep getting this Insidious/Conjuring tripe.\n\nSlender Man has it's moments and the concept is pure gold, this however is more squandered potential.\n\nThe Good:\n\nIt's Slender Man!\n\nAtmospheric\n\nGreat cast\n\nThe Bad:\n\nPlot falls apart badly\n\nPotential isn't met\n\nToo many common tropes and cliches\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nSlender Man mythology is fantastic but really inconsistent, no wonder they get it so wrong with adaptations\n\nJoey King and Annalise Basso are going to be big stars\n\nSlender Man is like Aliens (Xenomorphs), he needs keeping in the shadows or he looks a bit silly\n\nThis should have been called The Ring: Slender Man"

Freddy Krueger was scary in the first Nightmare because they didn't focus on the character, but rather the psychological terror. Slenderman tries and fails to build a story around something that only needed to bring a feeling. It tried to get us involved in the lives of shallow and boring cookie-cutter horror-movie fodder characters. The horror genre needs to be left to the artistically gifted and intelligent artists. Slenderman is yet another mass produced generic label product waiting to be forgotten. Watch the trailer, it's way better than the movie. Or better yet, watch The Ritual for a better example of what Slenderman should have looked like."

Should of had him more of a shade background character. Not to mention slender man looked horrible. I can't believe they went with the cheesy internet depiction with the suit. The effects look high school grade at best. The only good thing I can say about the movie is that one of the scenes where a main character was making out with a boy from her class at his house turned out to be the most hilarious scene I've ever seen in my life. I literally died of laughter, cried real tears in the theater at how bad the scene was because she had a slender man hallucination during it and it was just so cringeworthy, silly looking and just flat out terrible. I've never laughed like that in my life. Ending was unsatisfactory and poorly executed. I was going to give it a 2 but the entertainment factor was there because it was so bad that it was good. So I give it a 3 for that. Wait until it hits streaming."

        "review_detailed_main": "Currently, \"Slender Man\" has the distinction of being on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...the 100 worst rated major release films. While I certainly didn't enjoy the film, it seems odd that this one made the list when there are so many worse modern horror films which somehow avoided the list. I just can't see this as the 50th worst film....let alone 500th.\n\nThe idea of the film is taken from a pre-existing story of a 'Slender Man' who will kill or make folks crazy who are dumb enough to call upon him. In many ways, the film is a very derivative project--using the existing notions as well as infusing it with ample parts \"The Ring\" as well as the \"Bloody Mary\" story that's been floating around for decades. With \"Bloody Mary\", a person supposedly calls the name out repeatedly until some murderous other worldly thing appears.\n\nThe story begins with four very dumb high school girls having a sleepover. They find some info on the internet about a Slender Man and despite being warned, they summon the creature...and the rest of the film is about them each disappearing or going mad one after the other.\n\nThe movie has a scary style to it, with its pulsing music and bass....though after a while it does become annoying instead of scary. The story itself is nothing new...consisting of lots of ideas from other stories, urban legends and films. The acting and direction are fair. My only serious complaint is that I wish it HAD been awful...that would have made it a lot more interesting."

Instead of a clich\u00e9 horror movie, we have a \"nothing\" horror movie.\n\nWhile The Bye Bye man was hilariously bad in all aspects, Slender man is just boring and frustrating. It's a film that was made 5 years too late, containing the absolute bare minimum amount of effort. I do not recommend it.\n\nThanks for another hit Sony!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes a single line of dialogue can stand out in such a way that you instantly realize that a movie is awful. For 'Slender Man,' that line came from Joey King.\n\n\"He's like a computer virus except he gets inside your body and messes with you!\" Oh, so you mean like a virus? Why didn't you just say, \"he's a like a virus.\"\n\nSeveral times throughout the film, that sort of hack writing shows its ugly face (as opposed to Slender Man, who technically can't be ugly because he has no face). There are zero clever lines delivered. Most of dialogue sounds like it was written by a Twitter bot designed to simulate mundane teen talk.\n\nThe putrid writing isn't limited to the dialogue-the characters themselves contain about as much detail as one could write on a Post-it note. I think of the four main characters as, girl A, girl B, girl with a sister, and token non-white girl. They're essentially indistinguishable from one another. The only difference is that some are slightly more talented performers, and, of course, the most talented girls are the first to disappear from the story.\n\nWhat's really striking about the girls is that, even though they're allegedly best friends, they don't even seem to like each other. At one point, I girl makes a catty, resentful remark about her \"friend's\" trophies. Later, she says, \"I thought you didn't care about track. I thought you cared about Chloe.\" (It's a miracle that I remember her name).\n\nThat moment is striking for a couple reasons. One, it doesn't seem like something that should be said between good friends, and, two, I hardly realized the girl ran track. Probably because it's never shown in the movie. I imagine the track angle played a larger role in an earlier draft then removed, but this line was left in. Editing isn't the movie's strength.\n\nWhen the girls aren't making odd comments to each other or expressing all the liveliness of a folding chair, they're attempting to appear scared. To show that they're scared, they basically do an impression of a panting dog that's trying to speak. It's a lot of breathing and stammering. Acting is also not this movie's strength.\n\nAll the above flaws are enough of a turnoff, but the worst offense of this movie is that it's a scary movie that's not scary. It's painfully dull and devoid of anything that may actually make it entertaining. It's as if all the interesting scenes were removed. Why, I'm not sure. Maybe they also cut out the parts that made this appear to be a coherent story.\n\n'Slender Man' is one of the worst movies of 2018. It's not a scary movie that's so bad that it's secretly kind of fun. It's just a bad, boring movie. I recommend a hard pass."

Surprisingly some of the cinematography looks good and there's some interesting surrealist moments, but the acting is okay at best and the dialogue is sometimes quite cringey. \"Scares\" are mostly just jump scares and a lot of the scenes felt the same.\n\nThe source material is hard enough to work with so those familiar with Slendy's origins will find this strangely adapted. Slender works more for creepypastas and video games, not so much cinematically. Far from the worst horror movie made, but definitely disappointing, although what would you expect from a Slender Man movie coming out in 2018? Some will hate this movie because of how bland it is, and I could totally understand that, but from a more objective perspective, it's a functional film that lacks spirit.\n\nNot really worth seeing."

Then top that off with having a movie that was downright laughable in script, plot, character-wise and fully devoid of scary moments, and you have the 2018 movie \"Slender Man\" from director Sylvain White.\n\nI had to divide this movie into two, I couldn't suffer through the hardships of sitting down and watching it in one prolonged go. It was just that painful to bear witness to. I managed to endure 50 minutes in the first sitting, then had to give up. And I had essentially given up on the movie entirely, but my wife convinced me to watch the rest of it on the next day. So I did... And let's just say that the rest of the movie didn't do anything to lift up the ordeal that was the first 50 minutes.\n\nThe entire movie was wholly and fully devoid of anything that would be scary to a grown up, which leads me to believe that this movie was intended for the same kind of airheaded audience whom would also believe that the Slender Man legend is actually true.\n\nThe characters in the movie were unbelievably stupid, one-dimensional and completely devoid of any sense of intelligence and common sense. It was just painful to witness their actions and the way they milled about on the screen. Now, I am not saying that the actresses were subpar or inadequate. No, not at all. I am saying that the characters written for the story could just as easily have been portrayed by cardboard cutouts.\n\nOnce the movie ended, you didn't even fell that the movie had come full circle. It had just dragged you along by the nose for the entire duration that it ran for, without providing any kind of proper entertainment.\n\nDo not succumb to the same mistake that I did when I went to watch this movie. The trailer actually made it look interesting. The actual movie, well let's just say that watching grass grow is far scarier..."

        "review_title": "More is less",
        "review_detailed_main": "Much like the Blair Witch, Slender Man has always been scarier as an idea within the lore built around it than as a literal and physical presence of it. We laud what the Creepypasta community has done to up the ante with the character originally created by Victor Surge (properly credited at the end of the film as an early billing), and there have been positively freaky spins on the subject matter such as the YouTube project Marble Hornets, yet there have also been negative effects attributed to the character in the attempted murder in Wisconsin by prepubescent female friends. The tormenting figment of our minds is spooky enough to carry throughout 90 minutes of film with flashes here and there. Apparently Sylvain White (director) and David Birke (screenwriter) didn't get the memo.\n\nI won't pretend like I could have written or made a better film, but I don't know if the right plot was chosen here. This is a story where SM is already embedded in the national consciousness and skeptical friends decide to attempt to summon him, only to bear the burden of his haunting, kidnapping and/or killing. I personally would have liked to see this have gone in one of three different directions: (1) have a tone more like The Ring where the demonic evil is not known as a figure but simply as a watched video with a curse (they even mention \"virus\" that would be a lot like the Ringu series and get into the anatomy of it), with no alias or concrete image in association to it; (2) let it play out more like a psychological horror, even if it means recapturing elements inspired by the stabbing incident four years ago; (3) found footage fashion, but Marble Hornets already did that, so I'll annex that recommendation immediately. There would be larger opportunities to provide a certain cloud of mystery and intrigue to explore something further, rather than simply to have too tangible of a grasp on the subject matter. Idea #2 might glorify and inspire that notion a little more than we need though, and since idea #1 would tie more closely to the film's actual events I'd say that #1 would be my personal go-to. In fact, when the girls watch the video it actually reminded me of The Ring to begin with, and that was a good thing; too bad they did not continue much down that path.\n\nCharacters also never really had any kind of realistic dialogue. The opening conversation between two schoolmates just has you thinking: \"This feels like they're reading a script.\" That's never a good thing. Like many horror movies, characters have trouble elaborating what they see and feel with each other, and it comes at an unnerving level here. Only one character ever tries to really cope with what's going on in a verbal manner, but she simply doesn't push enough to bring the others to her side and it feels like a lost cause. I'll admit that she tries, but she doesn't articulate herself well enough and from the outside looking in just comes off as sounding irrational. Well-written horror movies have characters who can actually think and speak rationally, yet still have trouble being able to overcome their villainous adversities.\n\nThe way it was shot was another concern of mine. This film is dark, and by that I mean it is dimly lit to a fault. I know they probably opted for more natural lighting at times, but even then there are no carefully-constructed shots to contrast silhouetted characters with some sort of lighter background from a light or a dusk evening sky. Even many interiors seem like people forget to pay their electricity bills as they only light up the bare minimum amount. Forget tone, this was just a slighted level of realism that probably could have resolved a lot of the characters' dumb moments if they just turned on a couple of more lights at times. They're also always going out on their lonesome after sunset, which tends to be a recipe for disaster. White chose to let sound play a major role in the film, but often did not establish a shot for us to sense our place in the scene. Everything looked too same-ish to lack the feeling of impact moments take place as they should. I think the choice of shots got better as the film went on, but at that point it was too little too late.\n\nThere were three scenes in the middle of the film that are almost back-to-back-to-back that probably provide the best overall tension. All three scenes have great buildup, but unfortunately only one executes strongly and the other two flatten out rather quickly. This mostly has to do with the fact that they try too hard to show more, and the effect is lessened as a result. That, or like many horror films it is just poorly edited (sorry to stray off-topic, but speaking of poorly edited... in the beginning of the film there is a \"One week later\" moment that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen and it fades away the moment it comes on that you might actually miss it). The scene that pulls off its moments well works because of SM really only appearing soft in the background if that, and a lot of mentally-jarring moments for the character that make the sequence feel nightmarish. If more scary moments in the film were like this or if there were less attempts at scaring the audience in general, it would have heightened these moments much more and become extremely effective. Alas, it was not meant to be and we are resorted to cheap thrills. What makes matters worse is that I think some moments would have been great without inserting eerie music alongside them, and I don't want to call them jump-scares because to be honest there aren't too many here (most times they are intentionally telegraphed as they creep into the frame, but the ones that are there could have served better without the score).\n\nBefore those three scenes that I mentioned (and outside of watching the main video), the story really had trouble grabbing me; past those three scenes (outside of a great 'mentally disturbing images' sequence and one of the visual shots near the end of the film), the story really begins to whimper out. It tries to work in two other characters to an extent and does not deliver on carrying out their arcs throughout (add in one of the main characters as well), parent involvement is set to a bare minimum and they are useless when present (in fact, there's a weird bit where someone thinks they are at the wrong address because they didn't see any cars in the driveway... ever hear of a garage??), there is little to no conveyed emotion for the loss of people near and dear to the main characters to feel their motivation as a great driving force, nobody ever listens to anybody in the film except when it's a detriment to their cause, and for some strange reason the girls all know the passwords to each others' laptops (just a small nitpick on my end). Worst of all, Slender Man was only slightly imposing and just not very scary, and he appears far too often. When I watch the Marble Hornets series on YouTube and he rarely appears in a quick couple of frames, I get the most unsettling chill in my body. When I play Slender and am traveling the forest as the stomps begin happening, the tension ramps up and gets me in the right mood to freak me out when something actually happens, no matter how scary. As a constant, Joey King was the only onscreen redeeming quality of this abhorrent mess.\n\nThey should have gone with \"less is more,\" and they instead went for the reverse tactic. That did not work for Blair Witch (2016), and it's no surprise that it didn't work here as well. This wasn't even in the \"so bad it's good\" camp unfortunately, and I am someone who will be curious to watch this regardless of any ratings. I do ask that you try and heed my warning when I say there is not much you are going to get from this movie. It wasn't scary, gripping, fun, exciting, or anything like that. Just a morose form of cinematic poppycock that probably came out five years later than it should have, and with the wrong story to boot. I just feel like they missed the mark on what makes Slender Man spooky, or they tried too heavily to rely on his spookiness to tell the story that they did.\n\nOh, and the first trailer ending shots of the girl in the dress is not in the film. I don't even know who that girl is suppose to be, because she is not in the film either heh. Sorry to spoil you there (more of an anti-spoiler)."

The silly storyline is senseless and certainly targeted to brainless teenagers, with four stupid and annoying lead characters. There is nothing worthwhile watching in this flick.\n\nIn the past, IMDb was a reference to movie lovers with relevant content about films. However, presently this site is easily manipulated by fake reviews, many of them with one or two lines, and votes by robots making the User Rating absolutely unreliable. My vote is one.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Slender Man: Pesadelo Sem Rosto\" (\"Slender Man: Nightmare without Face\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "At the time of writing this 'Slender Man' currently has an IMDb rating of 2.9. For anyone unfamiliar with the site that is incredibly low, for any film of any genre. Does the film deserve a rating that low? Not in my opinion, no. It is far from a perfect film and has many, many flaws, but what exactly has got it that low I can't say.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about this film is that it doesn't have the most attractive cast. We are used to horror movies having abnormally beautiful casts with actors and actresses who are perhaps not so great at acting. That really can't be said here and I think it was a good thing for the film. It made the characters feel more real and down to earth (mind you considering the subject matter for the film that goes out the window pretty quickly anyway).\n\nThe films biggest sufferings come in the form of the writing. For one thing there are far too many dream sequences. I find most horror films have at least one these days unfortunately and that is bad enough. 'Slender Man' has at least half a dozen and they can be seen coming from a mile away. The dialogue is also especially sloppy in certain scenes.\n\nThe character of 'Slender Man' is suitably creepy and definitely good enough to make a film out of. There are a couple of really good jump-scares, but there are a few appallingly bad ones too, like one where a woman simply walks past a character in a library. This is far from a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is also far from being as bad as people seem to be making out. Watch it for yourself and make up your own mind I would suggest."

The acting for the most part was good, considering what they had to play with. But everything else about the project was predictable and outright trashy. There is nothing new or note worthy here. I felt nothing, for the characters or the story...if that said nothing I don't know what does. The best element of this film was the cinematography. The look of this film did 60% of the work. I felt genuinely unhinged, and it was the use and movement of the camera. Other than that the film had not a lot holding it up."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite 'Slender Man' being one of the year's most poorly received films, more than once cited as one of the worst films of 2018, the premise was actually really intriguing and did have potential to work. So this is not coming from someone who wanted 'Slender Man' to fail, far from it. Also have an appreciation for horror and saw it with an open mind, just want to make all of that clear before somebody else tries to invalidate and criticise the opinions of those who disliked it.\n\nSeeing it, 'Slender Man' turned out to be that bad, for me it is one of the year's worst along with 'The First Purge' (have seen a lot of 2018 films so this is hardly coming someone hopefully with a sheltered life) and deserving of the panning it's gotten. Not quite worst of SyFy or The Asylum bad, it's not as amateurish, intelligence-insulting or non-trying-ish. It is however difficult to believe that it got a cinema release when it could easily pass for direct to video.\n\nThe only halfway decent things with 'Slender Man' are the spooky setting and the atmospheric and moody lighting.\n\nBoth not shining as much as they should have done, thanks to camera work that's at times chaotic and at other times self-indulgent, sloppy editing that made me physically ill and nausea-inducing use of flashing images. The sound is over-bearing and too obvious that it affects the horror.\n\nIt is also very cheesy and awkward-sounding in the dialogue. The direction is pedestrian and while the cast try gamely their performances are thin and ill-served by having little to work with, clunky script-writing and poorly developed and bland characters doing them in.\n\nWorst of all is the story and the atmosphere. On top of not being \"fun\", 'Slender Man' fails badly at its two main objectives, being scary and being interesting. There is no tension, suspense or sense of dread for the horror to work, the reactions are too indifferent, the pacing is deadly dull and there is far too much of an over-reliance on jump scares, all without build up and incredibly predictable.\n\nFrom start to finish, 'Slender Man' feels like a short film over-stretched to lifeless breaking point. As said there are real issues with pacing and that there is far too little in the storytelling to sustain the length. The content is not substantial enough and too much of it is nothing new and sometimes pointless, with the horror elements failing badly the paper thin story and the predictable, disinterested way it's told makes for a real slog of a film.\n\nOverall, lifeless, very bland and poorly made. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

It features horror alumni Joey King (The Conjuring, Wish Upon) and Annalise Basso (Oculus, Ouiji: Origin of Evil) and introduces Jaz Sinclair and Julia Telles to the genre, the latter turning in a great lead. I never would've guessed that she was 23; makeup and wardrobe did wonders helping her fit into a high school setting, as well as everyone else, for that matter. Joey King's characters have always ridden the fence between strong and annoying, but this was one of her best performances I've seen. Annalise Basso in particular has always been one of my favorite actresses, and here she delivers a more minor yet important role with ease. The story wasted almost no time ratcheting up the oppressive mood, starting as early as the third scene and not letting up for the rest of the movie. Aside from a few unintentionally silly moments, the camera work, audio, and transitional effects were mostly great, with one fantastic scene near the end reminding me strongly of the 1990 Tim Robbins movie Jacob's Ladder. Slender Man isn't the new Blair Witch, but it's likely to stick with you for a good while. Just remember: whenever you hike through the woods, keep your blindfold on."

The movie was in focus, for around 30 seconds the dialogue wasn't bad and there were around 2 seconds of scary imagery. Now with a few points, I will mention the things that make it one of the worst horror movies of the 21st century. 1. The story makes no sense. Scenes just sort of happen and end. This is probably due to the fact that the studio had to cut out a major piece of this movie. This movie isn't The Magnificent Ambersons, a bit of gore wouldn't save it, though I hope the original cut was more cohesive. 2. No rules. 'It Follows' is a great horror movie, which establishes the rules of our antagonist throughout the movie. Here slender-man does all sorts of things, so you can only sit and observe sloppily put together scenes of things happening. 3. Jump scares. While they didn't startle me, when I looked around, people were constantly jumping due to the loud sound effects. It would be alright if these jump scares were earned, but putting a loud noise because a character walks by is the laziest garbage. 4. Boring. It's not bad enough to be 'so bad it's funny'. I only laughed 2 times and chuckled 4. Not enough laughs to spend money, gas and time for the sake of laughing at the weird decisions of the filmmaker. I genuinely hope that movies that don't rely on cliches and cheap tricks like Hereditary will pop up every once in a while even if audiences won't give them millions of dollars."

The problem here is that I should've been paid to waste ninety minutes of my youth on this... movie? It's not really a movie, just like an uncooked frozen pizza is not really a meal. It's not so bad it's good. It's so bad it's scary, and not in the good way.\n\nA movie based on one of the Internet's most popular and frightening creepypastas should've yielded a decent film. But without a solid flow in the storyline, and WITH plenty of cliches, bland acting, and poor CGI, this is a heap of trash.\n\nHow do you make Slender Man go away? Show him this movie!"

Like 'Scream', 'nightmare on elm street,' 'I know what you did last summer,' or 'Friday the 13th.'\n\nIts interesting under 18 gave the lowest reviews and over 45 the highest. Like 50% higher. If I had to guess, the younger viewers were turned off by the lack of abundant CGI. The other 'scary' franchises all built up a following before CGI. In the old days this would have been a great drive in movie.\n\nIf you are/were a fan of genre above, I'd suggest you give it a try."

        "review_detailed_main": "Literally THE worst 'horror' experience I've had across every medium. The acting is terrible, the 'scares' are hardly scary, and the characters are so unrelatable and easy to dislike that I spent most of the movie rooting for their deaths. The script is so poorly written and the story is unbelievably cliche and dull. The ending was quite depressing, which wasn't a problem for me as I usually enjoy that sort of thing, but it was terribly done and incredibly unsatisfying. The formula for every jumpscare is the exact same so you always know when one is coming, which takes the fun out of it, not to mention a majority of them are just fakeouts to supposedly get you prepped for the 'REAL' scares, which are stupidly tame. There are no truly unexpected scares. The titular antagonist is only on screen for about a minute throughout the duration of the entire film, and his portrayal isn't even that frightening. Every scary scene has way too much buildup and not enough bang, although it does get slightly creepier within the last 10-15 minutes, but even then it isn't worth suffering through the rest of the film. I scare quite easily, but even watching it on a huge screen in a dark theater I wasn't scared in the slightest. Honestly, I could not stop laughing at how stupid the characters and their choices were and and how unscary the movie really was. I had read plenty of bad reviews and even from trailers I could tell this would be terrible, but it far exceeded my expectations. An outstanding experience if you like to roll your eyes and laugh at bad movies, but if you're looking for something genuinely scary and interesting, this ain't it chief."

I admit somethings in that movie could have been done better such as camera moving around too much as well as some of the acting could have been better... however in my oppinion there were a lot of things in that film I enjoyed then again my idea of a horror/psychological thriller id different to most for instance I really enjoyed that it wasn't overdone with blood and gore like most horrors do to me that doesn't make a good movie.. The other thing I enjoyed was from start to finish it had a creepy tone which made it hard to know when the monster was going to appear... the false jump scares I found actually worked for most of the film the only I didn't like with the false jump scares was the library scene where they way overdid it to the point that when monster appeared and did something it wasn't scary they used the scares up with all the jump scares... In my oppinion it's not a bad movie I found the story was interesting I liked the use of the terrain and as a psychological thriller which is what this movie is in my oppinion It does that side of the job well... the creepy music kept me on the edge of my seat.. I felt there really was a mystery to the movie... I say go see it and make up your own mind"

        "review_detailed_main": "Take it for what it is. You are watching a movie based off of a scary-fun character out of a game. Is it innovative? No. But it's not the \"worst movie ever\" like everyone loves to say about horror flicks nowadays. Go into it ready for some jump scares.. that's literally the game!\n\nNow, with that being said, the most notable negatives are character development and the the frequency of Slender Man. When I got out of the theater I couldn't even remember the characters names. The only one I could remember was Wren who was the worst and best character in the film simulatenously. Also, they made slenderman out to be summoned and whatnot, like The Ring, which in my opinion was a lost opportunity. I feel having Slender Man just exist out there in the world and prey on unsuspecting victims would be more intriguing. Because of this lack of origin, it sort of had me going, \"so wait.. where did he even come from then?\"\n\nSome of the acting was straight up cringeworthy, and some of the jump scares were completely unnecessary. The beauty of Slender Man is your ability to hear nothing but your footsteps on the leaves. The dead silence is what's terrifying. If any movie needed more silence, it would be this movie. Also, if any movie needed unexpected Slender Man placements, It would be this movie. Everytime he shows up, you know it's coming, and this totally defeats the purpose of this character!! Not knowing when or where he's going to appear is the beauty of the game to begin with!\n\nAll that to say, I had some fun with it.. there are some notably uncomfortable moments that'll stick with me for a long to come, and open-minded viewers will probably agree to this. Just go in without your movie critic hat on. No one goes a day without that thing anymore."

Like Elm street, something dark is happening to a specific group of young people.. Like scream, it's a charming small town, and your average high school clique, have found themselves entangled in something they don't understand.. it's that narrative that i enjoy the most. for me scary movies don't need to be as thought provoking or psychological as , say Hereditary, or the Witch.. they also do not need to be as visceral and bloody as the saw-sequels with all of the torture porn.. For me, this is along the lines of The ring,or vhs, where something awful will happen if you watch something.. it's spooky like candy man, in that you can summon this \"monster\"... and it's visual scares are not unlike those of One missed call, Shutter, Ouija, etc... It has all the elements of a good, saturday night scary movie party... it's not to be over studied. it's not to be judged at an oscar level... it's unfair to even complain that it's been done before, due to the fact that the \"hip high school kids are dying\" trope is its own genre. The fx are fun, the jump scares are entertaining, the acting is accurate and well above the average for this genre. it's a fun film, if you like a classic date night saturday fright. it doesn't slow down at any point to become boring, and it's also not constantly shoving the villain down your throat like the last two TX Chainsaw movies did..if you enjoyed films like Urban legend, final destination, and the others mentioned above, there's no reason you wouldn't enjoy Slender Man."

They did not: Start the movie off with a gory shock death. Rely on jumpscares Have bad actors Throw slenderman on screen too much Have slenderman talk Come up with some stupid lore about slenderman about why he exists\n\nPoint is that even though the movie isn't oscar worthy, it definitely elevated the horror genre to what standard the bare minimum should be, and yet other crap horror movies out there get more stars.

The fact that this horror movie was rated PG-13 instead of R didn't bother me too much, but pretty much everything else about the movie did. It's really badly photographed and lit for the most part - even scenes taking place outdoors in the middle of the day more often than not look murky and dull. A lot of the special effects also don't look that great, this maybe coming from the unfortunate fact that the budget wasn't that big. But what really sinks the movie is its storytelling. The story details are often as murky as the visual look of the movie, with details being vague or simply lacking explanation at all. At times the movie feels like it originally ran a lot longer, but was cut severely down to 93 minutes. But even with that standard running time, the story moves at a glacial pace, leaving the viewer so bored that they won't be able to get much out of the occasional horror sequences. I'm glad I watched the movie for free thanks to my local library, but of course I'd be happier if the library hadn't stocked the movie at all."

But during their meeting the girls make eye-contact with the gaunt giant and are cursed with madness. The only way to stop him now is to give him want he desires.\n\nInspired by the real-life legend that has claimed some real victims, this fictional account ignores reality opting for a more Bloody Mary vibe. Unfortunately, the scares are cheap, the acting amateurish and the overall execution is ham-fisted.\n\nBesides, just like every scam on the Internet, Slender Man is really a Russian hacker.

In many scenes, the movie can set the fear, special effects are good. It's not a masterpiece, it's not a bad movie either.\n\nThe evil character Slender Man is a good character for a horror movie, but in this situation creators of this movie have made some mistakes.... gives me the impression of a movie made in a hurry, could be much better! Sometimes in the film the story has no logic, it is hard to follow the narrative thread... in some points you do not know when it's reality or when it's dreaming. There are some questions that have not found the answer (about some characters in the movie) Those who wrote the story of the film are guilty for the very low rating. But it does not deserve less than 5. However, sometimes people exaggerate with a very low rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "The stage curtains open ...\n\nThe Slender Man walks among us. We just can't see him, until we really want to.\n\nTaking a chapter out of \"The Ring\", four teenage girls decide to summon the Slender Man by calling up an online video and following the directions they read before it plays. They watch ... they close their eyes ... and on the 3rd bell tone, they open them again - never to be the same. It was all done on a whim, none of them really knowing what they were doing, or really even caring. It was just something to do when you're bored and watching POV porn together on a laptop. As one of the girls says when watching said porn, \"Some things you just can't un-see.\" I'm sure they all wished they could un-see the Slender Man video.\n\nOne by one, they are all taken victim to the Slender Man in different ways after various sightings and attempts of appeasing him. Until it comes down to the last of the four girls - who is willing to do whatever it takes to protect her younger sister, now involved despite her attempts to keep her away from it all.\n\nThe acting was something to be desired. The script and dialogue run-of-the-mill and generic. Basically the same teenage dialogue that is in pretty much every horror film of this caliber. The same story line - discovering weird drawings, online videos, mysterious chat sessions, etc ... nothing new or surprising here. They all even knew each other's laptop passwords too apparently, as they had no problem accessing them.\n\nThe strength of this movie is in its visuals. The Slender Man \"sightings\" were fun. The cinematography was actually pretty good with excellent camera and CG work. They didn't overdose you on the Slender Man, keeping him a haunting mystery until the movie's final scenes. And even then, it wasn't overdone. The movie's sound was also very well done, keeping an ominous and dark overtone throughout.\n\nThis wasn't really that bad overall. Not exactly good either though. I wouldn't recommend it, but I would say it's worth a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\n\nYou know when you have this hopeful feeling that a movie might surprise you? Naturally, my expectations were extremely low for this film, but my \"affection\" for the Slender Man character (I used to play the games where I would crap my pants quite often) somehow managed to insert some hope into my brain ... Oh, what did I get myself into?!\n\nThis is the worst movie of the year, so far. Without a shadow of a doubt, Sylvain White horribly directed what is supposed to be a horror flick. 2018 is actually being such a fantastic year for horror films (Hereditary, A Quiet Place, ...), but apparently, I am going to have the genre represented on both Top10 and Bottom10 of the year. So what went wrong?\n\nBasically, everything. The only reason why this is not an F is due to the young actresses, who I genuinely think do a job good enough to deserve a bit of credit, especially Joey King as Wren. She goes through some nasty stuff and even if the visual effects are awful (I'll get there), she is able to make them less unbearable. Julia Goldani-Telles is also good as Hallie, but these two are the only ones trying to make this movie work.\n\nI don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll start with the (alleged) scary scenes since it is definitely the aspect that annoyed me the most. There is an absurd lack of background lighting, the cinematography is appalling. I can barely see a single scene at night since it is so freaking dark. I can't be scared by a random girl screaming or by an increase in volume if I don't know what the hell is happening.\n\nSylvain does not show anything worthy of technical merit. Besides the shameful cinematography, the editing is incredibly choppy which does not help the running scenes (which are already filled with poorly handled shaky-cam). Every scary scene is a predictable and cliche jump scare, something that not even the lousy horror films of today are doing anymore, to be honest (they are just bad for other reasons). He also uses an excessive amount of close-ups on people's faces and bodies being deformed by some ugly visual effect that left the entire audience laughing out loud. Yes, it is that bad.\n\nThe score is a mere device to let people know that a jump scare is coming which completely ruins the element of surprise. Thankfully, the tone was consistent, at least they kept the horror vibe during the whole movie, even if they sometimes escaped and introduced some dumb high-school drama. David Birke gives zero characterization to the characters. They are just a bunch of high school girls getting scared and doing stupid stuff. There is barely a backstory or any development throughout the narrative.\n\nBirke's screenplay is another major problem. It is a massive exposition festival! If the characters are not searching for something online, they are reading it on a book or watching a video. There is not a single shred of information that comes out clean with a minimum of effort to not be absurdly lazy. The mystery surrounding the Slender Man is evident from the very beginning, and Birke still exposed so many unnecessary details, which dragged the film, ultimately becoming a boring time at the theater.\n\nTherefore, the pacing is profoundly affected. With such a short runtime, Slender Man is able to be astonishingly tedious. I yawned every five to ten minutes, while I was laughing at the horrific (not in a good way) scary moments and no, this is not one of those movies which \"is so bad that you love it.\" It is tiresome, scare-less and so annoying that it is impossible to fall into that category.\n\nI can't grant any entertainment value to this film. Even if you enjoy this sort of horror flicks, I can't guarantee your money will be well spent. Even if you love cheesy and predictable jump scares, these ones are too weak. Even if you get scared easily, this movie is annoying as hell. I don't think I will ever allow someone to watch this on my watch, and I will never watch this film again. I left the theater perturbated and it was not for the \"right reasons.\"\n\nSlender Man is probably the worst movie of the year, so far. Don't watch it, at all. I am sorry to Joey King because she does not deserve to be in such a mediocre film. Horrendous cinematography, choppy editing, the horror heavily relies on silly jump scares and on hilarious close-ups, and the screenplay is a lazy exposition party. Compared to other horror movies of 2018, this one looks like a Disney fairytale. That says it all."

        "review_detailed_main": "There was a lot of good work put into this movie. The casting, in my opinion, was awesome. I really felt that these five girls were believably cool and believably New England. I appreciated the move away from typical bland horror movie casting. I also believed that these girls would hang out with each other; again, it was believeable to me that these girls were in the same social circle. I super appeciated that the filmmakers shot in Massachusetts as opposed to LA. LA's great and all, but South Pasadena does not New England make. The location for this film was beautiful and absolutely necessary. These two aspects really worked for me, it is necessary for good horror to pay attention to realistic details - the movie is scarier as a result, and the experience feels authentic.\n\nThere were some major story problems. I'll explain without spoilers. There was some slight allusion to the actual news story surrounding slender man, but I did think filmmakers could be more daring in this way. Amityville, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw ... there is a long list of films that have loosly based their stories around real events, and I think this film could have come closer to the actual horrific newsstory. There were nods, perhaps, but it seemed too reserved, which made me feel I was watching a movie made by a bunch of 'fraidy cats, which made me feel safe and protected from controversy, which is the opposite of what making a movie about slender man should have been. Also, there was no need to invent the summoning. Again, here, the original story of slender man, and the news stories surrounding it, were far scarier.\n\nAlso, and I've said this recently about Dark Web, why are horror movies constantly pulling their punches?? Horror movies have gotten so much better in their production values, etc., but they rarely pay off all that suspense, that waiting for something horrific and grisly to happen, with anything horrific and grisly! You don't have to fill the movie with gore or anything, but give me at least one gruesome death that pays off my sitting and waiting for it the entire time, as you do in a horror movie. Not everything has to be Saw or Funny Games, but I mean, if you look around, some horror filmmakers have taken things pretty far, it doesn't make sense not to explore this, even for one scene.\n\nAnd, was something cut from what I saw in the trailor? Tsk, tsk. This alone brought my rating down from 6 to 5 stars. Looked like stuff was cut for a better rating or something, a note from marketing or distribution or whomever is calling the shots now. We need filmmakers, especially if they are going to make horror, to really make horror, and who can stand up to people who keep trying to tone down their films. If you want to see dollar signs, if you want to please the masses, please go make a Marvel movie and stay away from horror. And studio people, this was never going to be a blockbuster, this was always going to be for a niche audience, so make the movie that audience wants to see! Look at what you've done! Look at the ratings here on IMDB! And your audience wants to blame the actors or something, because that's who they see, but no, the acting was terrific, it was, if I could guess, the studio who screwed this up by watering it all down, and the filmmakers who screwed it up by letting them."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK first off, no it's not a great movie. But, it's definitely not as bad as the average rating indicates. Take it for what it is: an average teen horror movie. It's a PG-13 people. It's a rating to include the teenies, so you should know that it will be (generally) less scary/creepy/intense than a higher rating.\n\nSecondly, it can be tricky to try and make a full length feature film based on a myth and slender man short horror videos. Sometimes it works (Lights Out for example) and other times it doesn't. For me, Slender Man is right there on the fence between working and not working. It's a decent attempt in my opinion and while it does tend to drag at times, it didn't really get too boring for me, especially not as far as for me to turn it off. Dunno about this whole \"too dark\" thing either as I managed to see everything with no problems.\n\nThe tension, scares and overall creep factor is pretty minimal in honesty, but they generally weren't TOO bad. I think if the film makers kept the full on detail views of Slender Man to a minimum it might have been a bit more creepy. The glimpses of him and clever 'blending in' tricks employed could have made for a bit more of a creepy atmosphere. The parts where this happened had more intensity for me rather than the full on 'up close & personal' shots although some of those shots were pretty decent enough. Javier Botet was pretty good as Slender Man and while it wasn't his creepiest role (Insidious holds that title I think as the Red Faced Demon) he still does a convincing portrayal as Slender Man.\n\nLike I said, this isn't a great movie but if you're struggling for something to watch then you could definitely do much worse than this."

I am of course talking about the incredible make out scene one of the girls who I can't remember the name of and some dude idk. Their romantic chemistry was built up throughout the movie especially the scene where they exchange glances - that part was just incredible. Anyway so they're making out and then the Slender Dude makes her start to hallucinate and the boyfriend starts to freak out screaming. Never have I laughed so hard in my life. It was like a terrible attempt at after effects - this was intentional of course.\n\nOverall, Slender Man is a modern masterpiece.It has just the right blend of comedy and story that makes it a super entertaining movie to sit through.\n\nAnd that's why I gave Slender Man 1/10"

I'm an adult who is in charge of what I do now, so I feel like I have few excuses for being bored. But even as a kid I got used to navigating some pretty boring spaces without getting too bored. Slenderman brought me back to a headspace of bored I haven't been for a while; that kinda of bored that sits in your stomach and starts to sicken you. A physically uncomfortable boredom.\n\nSure, I firmly stand by my opinion that the worst commercially released film is Dark Harvest 2: The Maize because it is the most boring and has no setting changes, plot twists, new characters, just one change in the form of day to night, to break up the monotony beyond the first ten minutes. And it has repeated scenes of children who had no direction besides \"scream as loudly as humanly possible; daddy wants to redline the mic.\" But Slenderman has the distinction of being the big budget, theatrically released equivalent of this. So boring you will be physically repulsed by it.\n\nThere's nothing here; the film is Rings but way worse, which is saying quite a bit. Things happened in Rings, though, and nothing really happens in Slenderman. If I am to say anything in praise of the film, there were production values and a couple promising moments. I'll spare you all the but at the end of that sentence. This one is just bad with so few distinguishing features that even a bad movie nerd like me can't imagine recommending a single scene of this film to anyone for any reason."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even if \"Slender Man\" wasn't tasteless in its own existence - coming a few years after a group of young girls stabbed a girl due to a belief that Slender Man was real - it wouldn't change the fact that \"Slender Man\" is an abysmal piece of cinema.\n\nThe real character of Slender Man is sort of a fascinating take on modern myth, the internet and how stories spread in a modern digital age. It could work in cinema in many ways. Unfortunately someone at Sony thought they needed to ripoff \"The Ring\" but for teen girls rather than do something original.\n\nFour stock small town teen girls having a slumber party decide to summon Slender Man via haunted YouTube video because, um, reasons? Honestly I don't know why they did but hey maybe teenage girls in these days love their psychosis causing monstrosities. This Slender Man is some sort of supernatural being that drives people who look at him insane, or just kills/abducts them, or something - honestly his motivations are never explained other than being evil. How everyone seems to know about him is another question I had but, again, bad movie logic. Of course they brush it off as an internet hoax until they start suffering nightmares and the \"get me out of this town\" girl Katie (Annalise Basso) disappears on a school trip to a cemetery. Remaining friends Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles), Wren (Joey King), and Chloe (Jax Sinclair, netting her a Razzie nom) investigate and find out that Katie was into the occult and wanted Slender Man to take her away. Why she needed a group is anyone's guess.\n\nSo down one friend, what do our somewhat disinterested teenage girls do? Summon Slender Man again in order to get back Katie, of course! You can see where this film is going. Unfortunately rather than play with the idea of a spirit haunting our teenage girls and slowly twisting reality until they break was beyond the scope of the writers so instead they opted for the most mundane path they could find. This isn't so much a slow delve into insanity, but rather a \"make the lights flicker a bit and throw on some kaleidoscope filters\" demonic haunting. The film isn't even 90-minutes long but it feels like an eternity.\n\n\"Slender Man\" is a passionless film. Director Sylvain White has a decent eye for filming but if he took this project with any level of enthusiasm it is painfully absent. There is the fleeting interesting segment that is immediately undone by actors who look disinterested in their apparent terror. No one ever seems invested in their paper thin roles, and not even a patented Joey King freakout can evoke a sense of panic. The titular villain himself is barely menacing due to his seemingly random interest in haunting our heroes. Writer David Birke just grabbed an unused \"Rings\" sequel script and copy/pasted some generic teen characters in there after watching \"Blair Witch\", but didn't know how to make anything scary at all.\n\nNot helping matters is the unavoidable fact that \"Slender Man\" is borderline unwatchable. No, it's not unwatchable as in being a bad movie, it's unwatchable because the lighting it atrociously bad. Never before have I seen a film so devoted to shadowy style that it shoots its leads in darkness on a sunny day. It's as if thick cloud hovers over our heroes despite the sun beaming on all around them. The night scenes in the woods - and boy are there many of those - are so darkly shot that I honestly had a difficult time telling what was going on. It's annoying because there is clearly a decent eye behind the camera with how some scenes are framed, but it's next to impossible to appreciate given its devotion to darkness.\n\nIt's also painfully obvious that \"Slender Man\" was released in an incomplete form. Sony Screen Gems apparently feared a backlash due to controversy and had horrid test screenings so they edited it down and rushed it out after failing to sell it to another studio. Characters and plot points just vanish. Death scenes are off-screen or just assumed to have happened. Several of the horror scenes that made it into the trailer never appear in the final film. Hey you know the terribly acted Chloe who we were all begging to see die like in the trailer? Not shown at all - she just vanishes from the movie midway through. I don't think the film would ever be good or enjoyable if the missing scenes were returned, but at least it could have been a passable horror story rather than the forgettable disaster it is.\n\n\"Slender Man\" is just a mistake of a movie. It rarely-if-ever attempts to be scary and offers nothing to differentiate itself from the vastly superior films that do similar things. I just don't know how a film as disinterested in its backstory got made. You can quite easily make a movie about Slender Man and have it be unique. Take advantage of its internet-based history and make it a horror story about the original creation of the Slender Man - perhaps its \"creator\" was manipulated by supernatural forces to spread it online.\n\nI guess the only positive thing I can say about \"Slender Man\" is it's not quite as bad as \"The Bye Bye Man\" in terms of terrible attempted franchise starters, though it is easily more forgettable. \"Slender Man\" is a film that arguably should not have been made, and definitely one that will be shortly forgotten. This is a bare-bones attempt to squeeze some money out of a decade old internet meme that doesn't take advantage of its origins in any way. Slender Man may drive you insane you if you see him, Slender Man's film may bore you to death instead."

I find that would fit Slender Man's character with the real life Slender Man stabbings (an attempted murder with the kids who did it believed that doing that would appease Slender Man). As well, a common early trait of Slender Man is body mutilation. With that being said, it should've been rated R for blood/violence, thematic elements, and language, than the take we have that's PG-13 and has no blood. I find the film alright but would definitely be better if it honed more in on the blood/violence enough to get a R rating and a longer runtime (around 20 minutes or so) to help cover the versions of Slender Man to have been told through the years."

The \"scary scenes \"mostly don't work also due to bad editing, a girl being pulled through a window by tree branches should at least scare a little but here it falls flat.

The movie tries to establish that the teens have been friends for years their conversations are so awkward like they just met. if you want to watch this film, be ready for some funny cgi, bad character development and plenty of plot holes and scenes that just don't make sense. There just isn't any story."

It had good atmosphere and story was captivating enough but pace was slow and the scares were too tame and there were too many unanswered questions and plot holes.

About 2/3 the way in the movie just slows down too much, but the beginning and ending were sustainable.

It's so all over the place, and the potholes grow larger every minute.\n\nThe film also suffers from trying to stay tame in order to keep the rating safe for kids to be able to attend. It goes so far down the safety hole that it's almost more PG than PG-13. There's no gore, sex, or nudity. The only thing I can think of to maybe justify Pg-13 over PG is that one kid says, \"fuck\" once. (They say \"frick\" other times... seriously) it's just way too timid, and it borders on being flat out boring.\n\nThe often beautiful shots (when they're not raped by hideously cheap CGI) and fantastic soundtrack are all that kept me from passing out into a boredom induced coma.\n\nThey repeatedly try for the cliche jump scares, but you see them a mile off. It just fails on so many levels, and it's frustrating because at the root of it all, they really could've made something brilliant if they hadn't succumbed to being lazy, safe, and cliche.\n\nI'd say a generous 4 out of 10 and only for the cinematography and score which really are wasted on a turd of a film.

This movie was full of heart and had lots of work put into it to present the audience with the best representation of slender man known to man. Regarding the movie, the beginning starts slow and offers some of the best storytelling I have ever had the privilege of witnessing. After a good intro filled with laughs and a reprenstation of high schoolers that very accurately tells of how I had spent high school it goes into the actual movie and how slenderman slowly inserts himself into the minds of curious kids who think that the supernatural and it's influences are just games. Through a series of intense sequences of dialog and quick scenes of suspense the directors make use of the greatest influence of literary influence also known as pathos to get the viewers to not even want to blink so they won't miss anything. Many people dislike this movie but I believe that is just the mob mentality holding the them from wanting to physically express their love for this masterpiece. I could go on and on about all the things that make this movie a future legend but I am going to stop myself at just saying that this movie is a must see and I strongly reccomend anyone who wants to go to the movies and see something that will keep them on the edge of their seat while delivering easily the best movie that has ever been made."

Pretty much every horror cliche was used in the screenplay, I guess. The characters were actually no characters due to non existent personality. Worst thing was by far how they depicted Slenderman on screen. They used CGI to create him and obviously didn't had the budget or talent to make him look realistic. When you could actually see him in all his \"glory\" at the end, he remembered me of a not fully rendered character from an animated movie of the 2000s. That's the reason for the horrible pun in my review-title. If you really want to watch this terrible flick, than look out for the date scene with our protagonist's boyfriend. It's hilariously bad."

This easily is one of the most boring horror flicks I've ever seen, to the point where I'd would say that any low budget Hong Kong Martial Arts movie is way more entertaining.\n\nI kinda have pity with the actors in the movie having to portrait rather generic and bland characters. The only good thing about the movie was the music. Other than that the atmosphere was boring, cheap effects and weak jump scares that wouldn't even scare a child.\n\nThere really is a LOT of missed opportunity here for a decent horror movie based on the Slenderman myth... but instead they just wasted their time and created a crappy film you should forget about and rather read some creepy pastas about Slenderman, since they will definitely get you more spooked than this."

If this was made in 2011 or 2012 when Slenderman was actually relevant I would imagine it would've been huge box office success, it'd still probably be bad but the hype would've helped carry and help with the succession.\n\nThe writing, first and foremost was unforgivably cringey. In the first ten minutes there's pieces of dialogue that I've never heard any real people say, let alone a bunch of fifteen year olds. It lives into endless bad horror movie cliches with both the characters, dialogue and cheap jump scares but manages to savour some sort of dignity with the occasional scenic shot. I'm sure if this was a 12A young tweens would be terrified by this for the best part of a year but as a 15, for the people who were around for the Slenderman phenomenon who are mostly in their 20s now Will just this mundane, cringey and tiresome.\n\nWorth a watch if you're interested but it's mostly a waste of time."

Add to that a bunch of cardboard cutouts trying to pass off as characters (that the movie itself doesn't even seem to care that much about), special effects that outright made me laugh out loud, jump scares you can set a timer to, and you've got a horror movie that fails on practically every single level. Did I mention it even has the dream within a dream scare? Well, of course it does, because this movie hasn't got anything you haven't seen before done many times better. The only reason I didn't fall asleep was because the movie insisted on using sound effects so obnoxiously loud I was constantly fearing it would permanently impair my hearing. It is a testament to a movie's lack of self confidence in being able to create a creepy atmosphere when it has to do it with loud noises and quick cuts to what I suppose was meant to be \"unsettling\" stuff, which just ends up coming across as laughable and unfortunately rather pathetic. This movie is sadly not so bad it's good - it's just plain bad!"

I decided I would check it out. While you could say it's past its used by date, a good 5 years or so, when this titular being was the talk of the net. And the stigma of a true-to-life attempted murder in the name of the slender man means unwanted negative attention. Still the story could be effective if in the right hands, but 'Slender Man' mostly drops the ball with something rather superficial, and quickly produced with the feeling of wanting to forget and move on.\n\nI found it simply mediocre... dreary, yet glossed up horror with plenty of blank stares... well, outside a nervy Joey King performance. There are terrible elements sure (e.g the dialogues and pacing), but i didn't hate myself for seeing it. Some slick atmospheric visuals (in spite of all the dark shadowy cinematography), effective sound design (snapping branches & trees rustling in the wind) and a chopped up feel to the narrative's structure (despite not purposely doing it thanks to studio interference in the editing room) kind of gave off a disorienting dreamscape logic blurring time and space of random scene transitions and incomplete character arcs that \"for me\" kinda worked. It had a \"feel in the blanks'' structure with a lot of foreshadowing. A real mess of sorts and little in the way of Slender Man frights, but those few moments, especially involving King showed promise. It actually had me thinking of Wes Craven's 'My Soul to Take', especially the dreamlike air playing around with the character's gradual loss of reality, and the encroaching fear that sees them caught up in a nightmare of no escape. Once he comes calling, there's no going back.\n\nI would be interested in seeing the full uncut version though. Would it make it any better, I don't know (...plot coherence probably), but I have a feeling the tone would be different especially those cut scenes which were in the first trailer."

        "review_detailed_main": "5.7/10 Honestly people are being way too harsh to this film calling it the 'worst horror they'd ever seen\", and just being completely extreme and vague in their \"criticism\" without actual legitimate explanations why they hated it. While it definitely isn't a good film overall, it's about the best portrayal you could expect from an internet horror concept which is essentially a very creepy tall faceless figure that takes children and is seen in old pictures that have been clearly photoshopped. The concept is creepy but really has no complexity or depth. This film at least delivers that same ominously bizarre atmosphere with sparing shots of Slenderman with the simple plotting and overall themes. You cant really expect a plot that goes anywhere with that simple subject matter. The film does drag on in between the creepy scenes with the annoying actresses brooding on in their personal terrors. Another huge problem is that Slenderman shows up maybe a total 2 min of the entire film combined, and the scares are very cliche and standard when he's sparingly featured. There is one sequence in the library that is done properly and has a considerable amount of decent scare ambition. The sound design and effects were firing on all cylinders throughout the film and created some very good sonic tension at times. There was also a considerably solid amount of solid camerawork throughout. Before you know it the film is over and the finale is ok at best but very abrupt. This film is the epitome of middle of the road cliche horror with some decent ambition at times, and is in no way deserving of such an embarrassing low rating."

The sound-mixing is fantastic and it does the heavy-lifting in regards to creating the tension and suspense.\n\nCons: 1. The dialogue is often very clunky which makes the character interactions feel forced. 2. The score is massively overused and overbearing. 3. For some strange, and unexplored, reason, Mr. Jensen (Kevin Chapman) suspects and attacks Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles) for kidnapping Katie (Annalise Basso). 4. There are a plethora of idiotic character decisions which are clearly just inserted for forced horror and drama moments. 5. Most of the jump-scares are obnoxious and they fail to land. 6. The character and plot development are pretty much nonexistent, which makes it extremely difficult for you to care for any of the characters, or for what's going on. 7. The editing in the horror scenes is over-the-top and ridiculously stupid. 8. The CGI looks absolutely awful. 9. The acting is stale and obviously forced at times."

But oh my word does this plot fall apart.\n\n1: the \"mysterious\" slender man isn't mysterious anymore as he appears on screen every 5 minutes or so. Completely gives the mystery away. 2: nothing made sense. This slender man just invented his \"powers\" the longer it went on and absolutely nothing was explained at all. It was all just stupid. 3: ending was an absolute joke. It summed up the entire 2nd half of the film. Absolute waste of time, a good ending could have saved this from being a low rating (4 I gave is generous), but no. I don't want to use spoilers, but it's the most pointless ending to a film I've seen. NOTHING GETS ANSWERED. I'm actually sat here fully triggered at the ending! 4: it wasn't scary. The very few jump scares that were used you knew were coming so it had no effect.\n\nIt could have been good. That's what annoys me more, because it really did start well. But my god that 2nd 45 minutes is absolutely awful. I don't recommend tbh"

        "review_title": "Slender Man: An Artistic Masterpiece",
        "review_detailed_main": "Slender man is a cinematic timeless neo-classical masterpiece of the horror movie genre. The genre of horror movies has long been notorious for bad films, with cheesy acting, characters and plot lines. Many of these so bad it's good films are b movies with low budgets. Slenderman creates a true and flawless recreation of this genre. The actors playing the main group of girls in this movie performed perfectly, managing to create humor through lines clearly written by writers out of touch with teenage social life while remaining completely serious. The writers of the film alone deserve a huge amount of credit for making the film the masterpiece that it was. The dialogue replicating the type of unintentional humor scenes in movies like the Room while not trying too hard to be humorous as to disrupt the movie. The dialogue between the characters illustrated just how out of touch the writers were with teenagers and high school social life, creating hilarious and absurd scenes such as the scene where the characters exclude Hallie's little sister from hanging out with them despite the fact that she's practically the same age and they really have no social standing in the first place to warrant this. This scene truly encapsulated the cheesy and artificial chemistry we see between teenagers in typically low budget movies, but to see this on such a high budget was great to see.\n\nAt the base layer of the composition of this film is a nostalgic replication of the classic horror movie plots, that pays homage to the genre of cheesy monster movies. The movie mostly revolves around a girl getting kidnapped and her friends seeking to find her, without consulting adults who are largely absent in the film. Rather than consulting the police or attempting an exorcism, the movie's characters ignore most obvious options and constantly take matters into their own hands which is truly reminiscent of the cheesy horror movie genre in general.\n\nTruly a feat of this film is its ability to keep the audience engaged. The downfall of most cheesy horror movies is that they are a slog to get through. However slenderman keeps the viewer interested through it's downright absurdity at failed attempts to create a villain. This is another strong point of the movie. Slenderman is such a classic urban legend, and has become the boogie man of the post 9/11 generation, who have grown up in a culture that creates a fear of strangers among youth. It is this constant worry that something bad will happen that allowed the myth of slenderman to be such a terrifying character in he first place, not to mention his relation to technology and the metaphor of slenderman being manifested in technology. The representation of slenderman in this movie misses the mark completely, creating a monster that is not scary at all and arguably likeable. Slenderman does not have a defined character, and is more of just a guy kills people. That's it. It is almost like the influences he has in terms of nightmares and otherwise are completely separate from his character. This really allows for the actors and plot elements to shine as the star of the show, being the most entertaining things about the movie.\n\nI believe that the Slender Man film was originally much more developed, as the trailers vastly differ from the movie itself. The trailers show an entirely different plot that seems less rushed and much more planned out. This is possibly the reason for the scenes changing so abruptly, to the point where the viewer is confused. This is one of the things that makes the film so comedic, because a \"scary\" scene ends up becoming downright hilarious. The trailer also shows the girl who goes missing in the film, Katie, come out of the woods covered in blood, something that downright never made it into the final cut of the movie. I believe that the directors decided that the movie would have a better role as a comedic film. This was a great decision as it sets Slender Man apart from your run of the mill horror film that gives the movie with such a generic modern horror villain a certain spirit that is not commonly found in big budget horror productions.\n\nOverall slenderman is a hilarious film that is fun for the whole family. It's poor writing and bad acting clash with its high budget and big Hollywood production style, creating a type of movie rarely seen in the big budget Hollywood scene. It truly is a victory for the genre of comically bad movies, that fits in with its contemporaries like the room. If you want to make your kid not afraid of Slenderman, show them this film.\n\n-Rolf"

This is more of a random short film you would find on YouTube, normally filmed by college students on an iPhone 6 rather than a big production company.\n\nThe movie uses too many overused things, like forests, maggots, hallucinations, and others you'd probably find in the \"My first horror movie starter pack\" or any other crappy-pasta.\n\nIn conclusion, this movie uses far too many dead topics and other lores. This movie is in no way creative and is straight up plagiarising the original creepy-pasta instead of coming up with another way to tell the story.\n\nAfter all, Slenderman isn't that scary anymore. It's either the plot writers and creative producers live in 2009 or they seriously have no imagination when it comes to producing horror movies. Enough said."

The acting was so cringe it became harder and harder to watch as the film went on however I've seen these actors in other work and I'm going to have to blame it on direction and writing here. The Slender Man concept, although slightly outdated had so much potential but unfortunately was made into one big snooze fest. The major fault here was showing Slender Man, thus eliminating all suspense and having to rely on underwhelming jump scares and making the audience wait for some sort of twist that never comes. If this film was created the exact same but produced 10 years ago for a teen audience I think it would haver received a much better reception.\n\nIf you're as excited or intrigued as I was about this film, watch it by all means but go into it with extremely low expectations so it is at least borderline bearable"

        "review_detailed_main": "Five years too late I'm afraid, although to be quite frank the year of release does not matter. It's still a terrible film regardless. Have Hollywood seriously run out of ideas that they are now resorting to popular viral memes? 'The Bye Bye Man' meets 'The Ring' with a sprinkle of every other generic horror film from the past ten years. Was so close to walking out, honestly. A small group of friends watch a video that will \"summon Slender Man\", which consequently allows the titular mythological being to haunt them and possibly \"take them to a secret world\". Aside from the dreary cinematography and a decent performance from King, there is nothing to make me recommend this. Nothing! For a creature that's supposed to be well hidden, he seems to be flipping damn everywhere. Does Slender Man ever catch a break? Is this his full time job? Stalking children and taking them? I wonder what we could compare that to...(hint: a well-dressed pedophile)! Sorry not sorry. It's just another case of stupid characters doing insufferably stupid things. \"Don't watch the video\", \"Ok I won't\"...guess what? They watched it. \"Don't take your blindfold off\", \"Ok I won't\"...guess what? They did. The constant prowling in the woods in the middle of the night in total solitude was relentlessly dumb. Of course he is going to take you, you're all practically offering yourselves to him! Want me to make a sign for you? \"We luv Slender Man. Take us! xoxox\". Christ! The reliance of jump scares is fine, I expected it. But when they aren't even frightening, it just infuriates me. Enough with the loud pointless noises of someone walking! The cheap visual effects and horrifically terrible ending was the icing on the cake. I was done. No more. I'm out. Slender Man, I offer myself to you. Take me or, better yet, take your inept film and merge it into a tree."

Here's why:\n\nThe film makes use of a small cast mainly consisting out of teenage characters. Here's why 70% of the movie consists out of high school- peer pressure, teenage romance, girls bitchfighting and family problems. Fun for some people maybe but for a horror maybe not so suitable. So its all about the small teen cast consisting out of 4 girls who are played by women I didn't even knew before. None of the acting is really worth mentioning but the actress playing the girl Wren does a decent job in my opinion.\n\nThen on to the horror part of the movie. It's all about our man Slenderman ofcourse. The ones who've played the game will know how he looks like and I can tell you: he looks exactly the same. Even the quality is the same. Its actually a very bad quality CGI/effect that runs through this movie. A highschooler could've done the same job. After the movie i noticed an actor was hired to play slenderman but this seems rather useless due to what's mentioned above.\n\nThe jumpscares in the movie are rather cheap, nothing you haven't seen before. Even sometimes a bit funny due to the crappiness of the effects.\n\nStoryline has some big holes and character development is a mess, you're left with a lot of questions afterwards.\n\nI'll suggest everyone who's not a fan of Slenderman but just curious about him to play one of the games that are released about this character, you'll get the same as the movie but even better."

I'm upset that I spent money on this because of the trailers featuring scenes and scenarios that were never even part of the actual movie and the overall missing the expectations set for it.

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know what I was expecting when I went see the movie. Somehow I was positive, I like the subject and I thought that after all the Marble Hornets and whatever else was there - a proper cinematic take with solid budget would produce a decent result.\n\nWell... Is that the curse of video game movies? I suppose that's the closest explanation. They can't for the life of them stick to the core material. None of them. Of course, it might not have been better to have one and a half hour of white noise and weeping angels, but then again they could've taken some notes from Marble Hornets. Mixing that and the core game material, adding some coherence, pacing and relevant plot...\n\nInstead they just went for the lowest common denominator. Four teenage girls do something predictably stupid in an attempt to show that girls are apparently no different from boys when it comes to being stupid. Well, goal achieved. Then somebody goes missing and the rest start to dig around for exposition. Which, of course, provokes numerous repetitive, predictable and, frankly, yawn-boring Paranormal Activity moments, all of which include and suggest that Slender Man is impervious to anything, doesn't have any particular moral center and that the girls are just screwed. That much becomes apparent almost one third into the movie. Yet they will still do this and that, one stupid thing here, another there, an ear-cringe fest at the house or the library... At least \"It\" was artistic, this thing is just basic demon hallucination with lots of... well, not even noise. Because I wouldn't mind white noise, but they had to make Slender Man into a Leshy, or, rather, Spirit of the Woods from Witcher - and that felt absolutely out of place. Sure, we've seen sight-based monsters before, though not on the big screen, so maybe literally replicating the game wouldn't be smart, but Slender Man is a psychological horror. It's the embodiment of paranoia, of being watched, followed. It's like a proper \"It Follows\", which is also quite a terrible movie, but still far better represents the subject.\n\nThe problem of this movie is that if you changed the CGI\\the dummy from Slender Man to ANYTHING else - the movie would barely change. Babadook, It, It Follows, Paranormal Activity, Insidious - you change the monster for any of these and the movie could very well go exactly the same. You don't have to change a single line of the plot. Maybe if this was a 90-ies movie - it could resound better, but nowadays you just feel that you've \"seen\" that before. And what you hoped to see - isn't there.\n\nI always like when characters try to take themselves seriously, or fight back. Clear Rivers in Final Destination 2 locking herself in the asylum, for example. It means that the writers want to explore, to tackle the subject, to toy with the viewer. Of course, when it becomes a monster slasher, like \"It\" - it kind of loses the mark, but if they have so much exposition, if they have introduced even the characters' friends, who, somehow, are involved - then why not work with it. Or, at least, make the conclusion properly tragic and realistic, like in Krampus.\n\nBut no, no no no. Again, they went with all the easiest solutions. It's almost like they were forced to write\\make this movie, and, obviously, people have to work. The question is - why is it always wrong people working in the wrong places... The only reason I give this thing 2 stars is because it's about Slender Man. Though I'd personally recommend this film as a stoner film. It might be enjoyable to be watched intoxicated, simply laughing at every stupid scene."

I know the suit wearing, faceless thing has a backstory on websites, but the furthest knowledge I have comes from a video game that I played a while back. While I wasn't scared of this like a lot of survival games, it did give a spooky atmosphere and a lot of people did play it. And yes, I do know about the tragic stabbing that happened by two teenage girls who believed in Slender Man and wanted to impress him.\n\nNow while he was big, that was almost four or five years ago. Like a lot of video games, anything revolving around the internet tends to have s short popularity window. This is why we have gotten very few movies based off of Internet memes. On the one hand, it's hard to see why a Slender Man movie got made, but I do see the potential.\n\nIn the New England area, we have four teenage friends; Wren (played by Joey king), Hallie (played by Julia Goldani Telles), Chloe (played by Jaz Sinclair) and Katie (played by Annalise Basso). They act like how a lot of high-schoolers, just trying to get through class, hoping to get the popular guy and trying to have fun. When they hear a group of boys admitting they were going to try and summon the \"Slender Man\", the girls decide to do the same. They go to a webpage and watch a hypnotic video that seems to invoke something.\n\nA few days later on a class trip, Katie goes missing and both Wren and Hallie figure it has to do with Slender Man. They spend a good chunk of the movie attempting to look into it's history and how it might be responsible for a lot of other missing children. The further they dive into the mystery, the more their lives start to become affected by occasional dreams and sights of the Slender Man. More people go mossing and they see more abstract images even if their the only ones that can see them. Can they figure out where their friends are?\n\nWhere do I begin with Slender Man? I can start by saying that the concept of watching a forbidden video has already been done with in The Ring. The idea of doing it on the Web isn't a bad idea, but I can a hundred percent guarantee that nothing new is added here. For a movie that took four years to make, it steals from other horror movies like The Ring, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Grudge, and The Craft. The cinematography is even shot like one of those films from the late 1990's.\n\nThe worst thing about it is The Slender Man is dull and boring. The characters have no personality, there's little narrative plot, no focus, and it keeps witching points of narrative at complete random. It might focus on Joey King as a main character, before switching to another girl while throwing her out. It's like the movie couldn't decide if the movie should be a group story or something more personal. The Slender Man feel like random notes from a horror film fanatic who went insane. I swear, this was a tough movie to get through. I can't imagine even the most hardcore fans of Slender Man even liking this.\n\nI'll give this two slender men out of ten. It's a bad sign when I went to see this with a bunch of teenagers who were silent for the majority with no laughs, no screams, or even that much interest. This is one legend that will not last."

Either way, take it for what it is, a creepy horror film, not some slasher that most seemed to have expected (for some reason).\n\nIt was an enjoyable watch, not an amazing movie, but enjoyable."

Considering most of the film is shot in a forest at night, you'd think the filmmakers would be sure to make that footage clearly definable for an audience. But no, we aren't that lucky. In these wooded scenes, we get the classic \"screen's too bright, so this black is actually a light grey\" and everything is indecipherable. We get layers of different shades of black, and hardly anything can be seen. So, ultimately, you're paying to see a film that you can't even see most of the runtime. Of course a fan of the movie may argue that this is on purpose to create a mysterious atmosphere, blah blah blah. I've seen enough films to know that this error is plain and simply that: an error. There have been dozens of terrible Slender Man films, and this is no exception; don't let its semi-blockbuster-looking production fool you."

        "review_detailed_main": "What an utter pile of trite this film was. At best, the acting was passable. There weren't any actors that I would say are phenomenal, but they were average. As for the visual effects, I will say that they were decent as well. As for the whole idea behind the Slender Man itself, I have no issues with because for there is little to no official backstory behind this internet boogeyman, so the film not really going into an explanation of what he is or where he came from is a nonissue.\n\nWhat is an issue is characters. All of the characters in the film hardly have personalities aside from the clich\u00e9 tropes that horror films use. Because of this, the film fails to keep you invested with the characters making their inevitable confrontation with the titular man in black lacking. This is one of the issues that several horror films share: these characters are not people. They are only there as disposable cannon fodder to be killed. As such, it's hard to care about the characters when they are in grave danger because you have no reason to.\n\nThe film uses the same tired horror tropes that most average horror films employ such as using loud noises or jumpscares. Ultimately, they do nothing to mix it up or add a new spin on it. The Slender Man itself even looks bad given how it is poorly CGI-rendered. It could give one memories of 2017's The Bye Bye Man because it looks like the developers of the film took a snap of Slender Man from that 2012 game and poorly implemented it into the movie.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Slender Man is another bad film brought to you by Sony Pictures that is around four or five years too late. At the very least, the film is a riot to laugh at."

The character has been outdated for like 6 years now, and NOW is the time you want to make it? Well maybe in those many overlong years they thought of something really good? Hahaha, no. Wishful freakin thinking. Instead, Slender Man is literally as bad as they get. Just think Bye Bye Man mixed with Jeepers Creepers 3 bad. The directing is really awful and it most of the editing and shots are super lazy and boring. It feels like they just got the director of one of those crappy teen dance movies..oh, wait, that's exactly what they did! And it shows. Most of the actors are bad but it usually looks like poor direction than bad acting. The script SUUUUUUUCKS and is literally the most cliche modern horror film ever, like a computer wrote it or something. The Slender man himself acts nothing like he does in the games or in the lore, and he actually runs around chasing people and roaring! Remember back in the awesome game when he just stands there staring at you from a distance? Remember how haunting that was how he didn't even move? Well now he runs and chases people like a zombie from The Walking Dead. Worst of all, the film just isn't scary and instead it's attempts to scare you are just really funny! You're blind if you don't see 99% of the jump scares coming and most of them are over the dumbest things. There's a scene with a girl in a library and you know a jump scare is coming...and it's just the librarian who walks past the camera in the most boring unclimatic way possible, like the director told her to not be scary...but the music is SO INTENSE when it happens, like this librarian walking past the camera was just the freakiest thing in the history of cinema! The entire movie is like this, just a painfully generic and boring modern horror film with nothing interesting, unique, fresh, or good. I gave it a bonus star because SOME of the cinematography shots are nice, and the musical score is occasionally good, although still a bit basic. Without those two things, this movie would be a hard 1/10 and the worst horror film since Jeepers Creepers 3."

I especially like the lack of gore in this movie, as it keeps Slenderman itself somewhat mysterious. The story was solid, nothing new but definely not bad. There were some new ideas to build up suspension, one in particular caught my eye and I like it alot: the video-call scene where Slenderman haunts one of the girls from his perspective, yet is nowhere to be seen. If all you want is gore, this movie probably isn't the one for you, but otherwise it should be pretty fun to watch, even though the ending is a little disappointing."

Good horror movies have a great build up and suspense and the really good ones make you not want to look at the screen anymore. When I first saw the commercial I laughed because by now we've all seen so many of these that we know what is good and what's bad. This director and writer should never be allowed to create another horror film. Hire someone who knows how to make one. What a waste of money. Slenderman, Bye Bye Man.

Okay so story isn't interesting at all, in fact it's one of the worst examples of uninspiring writing and story telling. Characters are really dumb and generic as well, with no personality to speak off. There is girl that dies first, token black girl, suspicious girl and girl that believes in legend.\n\nCinematography, acting and sound\n\nTo it's defense there were some cool and good looking scenes, especially how some of the camera angles were utilized. But really it relied to much on the cheap stock footage effects and facial close ups. Effects were overall alright, but you can clearly see that budget was lacking to make it look good. Acting was horrendous, wooden and over-exaggerated, with some cringe worthy moments in between. Sound was well used and it did fit the scenes really well, but like some effects, they used way to much stock footage like sounds for moments, although they were well utilized.\n\nEnjoyment and verdict\n\nI really enjoyed this movie, for all it's lack of creativity and scary scenes, it made me realize that this isn't really a boring movie, rather a really generic one. If you like Slenderman, you'll probably enjoy it, but if not skip it.\n\n5/10\n\nRecommendation lvl: PASS"

I couldn't wait for it to be over.\n\nI could excuse the bad acting, cause yes, the actresses probably did the best they could with a bad script. The script did not bother to make the group of girls original or likeable, the one thing accurately shown about them is what teens do when they get together. However the lighting was unforgivable. I don't know where their budget went but they should have invested in a few more lights, as it was really hard to make things out (even though I was watching with the brightness to the max) and the shades being sliced in clear lines did not make it in the least a professional looking production.\n\nI know they probably really tried to have the climax of the film be all creepy, but again, clich\u00e9s. There was a clear lack of originality but one aspect of the film that was actually a little redeemable was their one use of trees at the end of the film; that was interesting, but I wouldn't say it's worth watching the film for that."

There was a real life murder over Slender Man some while back, and for some reason Sony decided to whip this movie together and then back out after realizing it might be a tad tasteless or offensive, and thus they cut it down drastically and that's how we're left with this hollow husk of a movie that has to be seen for one to understand just how broken it is. It's possibly comparable to The Snowman, but I haven't seen that one. If you watch the trailers for Slender Man, and then the movie, you'll notice the boyfriend character from the trailer fails to make an appearance and several shots from the trailer alone fail to appear.\n\nWhat I think needed to be done to make this film worthwhile would be to have upped the ante if anything, making it more violent and wallowing in the tasteless nature of it, or making it a documentary on the real life murder, which is a vastly scarier and darker tale than the hogwash we get here. None of the characters are memorable whatsoever as they are all basically the same generic teenage girl characters, interchangeable from one another and equally ditsy with insane lines of logic throughout which somehow work out in one way or another due to plot convenience and poor writing and very little effort given in this project as a whole. This is only furthered with abhorrent pacing, with many slow, meandering shots thrown in of supposed visions, which are ultimately time-fillers to reach the 90 minute mark with inoffensive cheap shots of the wilderness. The image quality is downright gross and it's one of the hardest films to stare at for prolonged periods of time due to its disgusting color palette, horrible filters, and dull shot compositions.\n\nThis movie is one of the most boring pieces of rubbish ever made, and thus I can't even recommend it as so bad it's good, because you're likely to fall asleep rather than so much as chuckle."

I am fairly certain I can produce better effects myself in MS Paint. The screen is also so dark, that you would think you were watching a certain episode of Game of Thrones.\n\nOne could go into details but much like the people behind this movie must have thought all through the creation of this garbage: why bother?"

The actresses try to put on a decent performance but fall flat. The special FX were decently done. When you finally see old SM he's more cool looking than scary. The banter between the girls was realistic. The madness scenes were spot on, but outcome was predictable.\n\nThe bad - too dark and you couldn't see what was going on. You learn about the lore towards the end of the 2nd act so at that point (if you are still watching) no longer invested.\n\nThe ugly - w/o going into spoiler territory...screamy teen girls. This movie could have been a metaphor for drugs, growing up or puberty.\n\nConclusion: I think it was a missed opportunity. If the actors, set pieces, and director were the same but different script it might have worked."

I'm not sure how the unedited version would have turned out but either way this movie was gonna offend the real life people. At least make it worthwhile if you're gonna offend them either way! Also - there could have been many ways to do a slender man story without paralleling the real life events... if they were that worried about offending the real life people they could have taken one of those avenues... instead we're left with half of a movie using the blandest scenes they had. Honestly save your time and watch the 2 min trailer instead of the 1h30m movie."

I was a little concerned by some of the negative \"previews\", but am always one to make up my own mind. It seems to have really polarised reviewers, looking through the 300+ reviews on IMDB it seems to score either 10 or 1. I'm not sure exactly what people were expecting from this movie, but for me it was an very enjoyable watch, suspenseful, creepy, disturbing at times. Perhaps the negative reviewers would be more happy with a 10th installment of SAW, or another generic slasher movie. A couple of reviews mention bad acting, which I disagree strongly with. I thought it was well acted, not too over the top screamy, with a certain degree of naivety. It is a bit of a slow burner, but engaging, and builds the suspense all the way through. If you enjoy supernatural Horror movies, and aren't looking for skull crushing, eyeball popping gore from the first scene, you should enjoy this."

Those things are: the good suspense when Slender Man is on screen, the few disturbing scenes that were really well put together, Joey King's performance. If anything, I'd recommend it solely for Joey King. She steals the show. You almost forget she's not the main character. If it weren't for the boring nothing characters that were made, I'd almost think it was about her and her friends, but then we go back to Hallie for the final act after spending time with Wren for like 30 or so minutes. The ending is just an eyeroll-fest. This movie is nothing special at all. It's best for just a random impulse rent from Redbox or $5 ticket at AMC on Tuesdays. It's still better than The Bye Bye Man because I did find enjoyment in Slender Man."

But nothing else was present in the film but the scares and them slowly going crazy, no real other subplot that would make you want to keep going. I heard the people behind the movie wanted to shoot for an R rating but they couldn't cause a company or something wanted it to target a teen audience and also how some scenes were cut out but if they made it R and added the deleted scenes then maybe the film wouldve felt more complete. If they make a extended cut with over 5 minutes if new footage I'll consider buying it. It's The Grudge meets The Ring meets It."

Kevin Chapman also had a really solid role as Mr. Jensen, though it was rather short.\n\nThe plot had potential but got real lot washy, and the third act felt all over the place and a little silly. There's little to no suspense and anything really effective in the scare department, which is a shame. This is also a film that falls victim to an over-written script, which is always frustrating.

        "review_detailed_main": "A horror movie only needs to accomplish to very simple but very important things. It needs to be atmospheric and it needs to be scary.\n\nSlender Man is definitely an atmospheric movie. Right from the start, you see the abandoned shopping mall of a sleepy town in the middle of nowhere. Most scenes take place at night, often in dark buildings or in a forest. The progressive confusion, nervosity and terror of the four main characters is also fascinating to watch.\n\nHowever, the movie isn't scary despite the appropriate atmosphere. The supernatural entity that gave the movie its title is quite unoriginal. It doesn't speak, it doesn't have any unforeseeable powers and it doesn't even have a face which is quite revealing. The weak attempts at jump scares are clumsy and predictable. I would go as far to say that Slender Man is one of the least scariest horror movies I have ever watched and I have come across hundreds.\n\nThis would make for an average and quite lukewarm film but there are three minor elements that justify my slightly more positive evaluation. First of all, it's interesting that the movie focuses on four teenage girls instead of just boys or a mixed group which is a little bit different from the usual stereotypes. It's also great that the casting directors and writers didn't try to focus on artificial diversity, including one lesbian girl, one transgender girl, one physically disabled girl and one schizophrenic girl with borderline personality disorder. The four main characters might not have perfect chemistry but their friendship is at least believable. They are refreshingly normal.\n\nSecondly, the young actresses did a solid job. They aren't extraordinary by any means but they made the best they could with an at times shallow and unimaginative script. I really liked Joey King's acting as slightly sinister, nervous and hyperactive teenager who is a little bit different than the other three characters. I happened to find her just memorable and unique enough to not be exaggerated or even annoying.\n\nThirdly and lastly, I liked how the movie ended. In the beginning, I found the resolution somewhat confusing and short but the more I think about it, the more I find it quite original and even courageous to end a film the way it did here. It's definitely not your standard Hollywood happy ending and this fact alone needs some praise.\n\nIn the end, Slender Man is neither an ordinary nor an extraordinary horror film. It has just enough positive elements to be slightly above average or even good. I have seen far worse horror movies recently like Devil's Due or The Quiet Ones. The negative reviews of this film are often exaggerated. Horror movie fans should at least appreciate this film. Teenagers might even like it a little bit more because they could identify with the main characters."

It kinda disappoints me that a large majority of people hate this movie while I feel like I'm the only person in the world that likes it. If you don't lije this movie, that is perfectly fine.\n\nDo I see flaws in this movie? Yes. Do I think it's god awful? No. Do I think it's the best film ever? No. But I think it's somewhat decent. If the 16 year old part of me didn't like it, the 12 year old me definitely did. I have been a huge fan of him and his games back in 2013. I thought that a movie based on him felt like a good way to get him into mainstream again. I feel like it did it's job.\n\nThe Story felt lack luster, The CG where tendrils explode through the mirror and where Tom's Head was shaking rapidly and making a distorted face felt unfinished, there was many Cliches and missed opportunities here and there.\n\nSlender Man himself looked pretty amazing, seeing him always left me with a smile on my face. The library scene has to be the best scene in the movie, it is executed very perfectly, and The Scene where Slender Man rises on his tentacles made me smile so wide, teeth were showing.\n\nSo overall, not the worst film of the year, not an amazing movie, but I wasn't bored while watching it.\n\n-6.4/10"

Four females one that looks lifeless and disinterested, one that was a pretty ugly red head with bad acting, one that is black because you have to put at least one in there also with bad acting, and the one who had very little acting skills was taken first. My review is probably bad because the movie was so bad because it was that bad that I just can't explain it. I guess the people that liked it are idiots or just ones that like pointless dumb movies. I really don't have an explanation on why people would give this anything above a star and I'm still trying to figure out why I even watched even though it was on free. Smh I think this ring ripoff movie made me an idiot and a lot dumber cause I can't seem to summons the right words for it.

The movie certainly deserves a better score than the 3.2. I suspect what's holding it back is that, despite the good story, it is nevertheless a story we have seen before, and the overriding arc of the story follows a familiar pattern. Teenagers visit an urban myth site, get sucked in, then get picked off one by one. Regardless, it is a scare ride, and certainly has added some panache to a popular horror theme."

        "review_detailed_main": "Through a feminist lens and applying environmentalist objectivism, this movie showcases the modern fear of environmental destruction resulting in devastating personal consequences. By making the beloved character of The Lorax into a terrifying emblem of masculinity and misogyny, viewers are left to question their environmental impact and their roles within society.\n\nThe frequent symbolism of the oppression of the developing female body manifests through sensationalized imagery about the misunderstandings and stigma again representative of society's views. As feminism and environmentalism often go hand in hand, the film pays homage by using an actual image of a young pregnant woman birthing the roots for a revolution as far as environmental destruction pervades our society.\n\nThe scene in the library helps the viewers visualize The Lorax's other hunting ground, as wooden shelves (the tortured and disfigured products of logging) are forced to cradle even more flayed and minced products of deforestation of Mother Earth. The Lorax is angered by this blatant disregard for the gifts of Nature and attacks one of the young women. While herself not a perpetrator of environmental destruction, she is struggling with her own development, and the conflict between environmentalism and feminism is representative of the way the patriarchy turns the oppressed against one another to distract from the oppression they face.\n\nIn conclusion, this reinvention of the classic \"Lorax\" tale showcases the patriarchal fears of the consequences of oppression regarding deforestation and misogyny. The true message, as explained in the final scenes of the film, is that women must embrace environmentalism as a symbiosis to free themselves from misogyny and, at the same time, lift up the most powerful female entity of them all: Mother Nature."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I'm not very familiar with the Slender Man lore and have no experience whatsoever on anyhing creepypasta - I hardly even know what that is. So I just watched the movie for what it is, a movie about some scary monster.\n\nI thought it was watchable, somewhat enjoyable, though a little bit slow at times. Everyhting was pretty average. Some cool looking scenes, like the foggy forest. My favorite scene was the video call sequence where the monster(?) calls a person in the house...That was creative and genuinely chilling...a brand new take on the 80's slasher and \"Scream\" telephone tradition. Also the nightmare scenes with false awakenings and surreal imagery were cool because I like that kind of dreamlike randomness.\n\nIn general I felt like the movie was a bit scarier than average horror film. Usually the monster feels just like an enemy and you know the hero is going to find some way to destroy him. But here, the monster is more eerie and abstract and creates an unnerving feeling because you start to fear for the main characters who seem to become more and more helpless against the monster.\n\nThe monster itself was done pretty poorly. The concept of the character looks good on paper and has potential for super creepy scenes but that potential was not used very well. Yes, the movie is creepy, but mostly so when the monster is not visible. When he enters the picture the mood goes towards 50s' rubber suit monsters, if you know what I mean...you see the monster from close range and it just looks cheap. But even though the monster effects weren't that good, somehow the movie still has enough scarepower to stay interesting.\n\nI don't know why the movie has gotten so much bottom ratings. My guess is that fans of Slender Man internet stuff are disappointed in the movie and vote it down for protest. But for a regular horror movie watcher I say it's worth checking out once because it does have some creative quality. There are worse ways to spend your autumn night with."

They had source material of the actual creepy pasta online, they could've played it up to the slender man that people who were online back then know.\n\nA real missed opportunity."

I really couldn't have been happier, anticipating a fulfilling father-daughter time introducing her to one of the greatest films ever made, expanding her sense of what films can be and do. Then she had a last minute change of mind, picking Slender Man instead. What a come down; an artistry-free bore-fest that tries to make a teenage slasher flick out of an internet urban myth, and churns out something so non-sensical and uninteresting that its biggest achievement is an overuse of expositional dialogue when there's almost nothing for said dialogue to deposit. Do not waste your time on this."

        "review_detailed_main": "For those who want to know; is Slender Man a good horror film, the basic answer is...not really. For the longer answer, let's strap ourselves in and analyze this mess. Going into this film, I had heard multiple stories; none of them good. I'm not going to focus on the film's tastelessness in bringing to life an internet legend that resulted in a disturbingly horrific crime. By the time this film premiered, the Slender Man craze had come and gone, and despite there been so much material for this film to use, it is really quite two-dimensional.\n\nTo the film's credit, there are some genuinely creepy scenes that do create a sense of dread, with great use of imagery occasionally used. The functional original score does add to the sustained threat, the drum beat used when Slender Man is near being especially effective, though even the soundtrack can't save the film, with some of the 'scary' devices shamelessly repeated, causing the effect to be significantly reduced. As the film progresses, it begins taking clich\u00e9 horror tropes from better known franchises, in particular, The Ring, including a cursed video and a girl in desperate need of a hair-cut. If parroting classics wasn't enough, there are sequences of trippy hallucinations, in which POV shots that incorporate Hitchcock's dolly-zoom technique are used, alongside bizarre transitional effects that make little sense. During one 'horror' moment I burst out laughing, and unless Slender Man is secretly a parody, this represents a failure on the filmmaker's part.\n\nWhat doesn't help the horror are the film's characters. Two issues; first, I would be hard-pressed to describe any of them, considering the significant lack of characterization. Second, the main character is boring. Stereotypically in horror films, the protagonist tries to warn a group of rational-minded individuals who refuse to accept the truth, of the supernatural threat. This movie however, probably thinking it was being intelligent, flips this on its head, whereby the lead character is the one with their head in the sand. Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles) is a plank of wood, who isn't particularly likable, for A) her refusal to accept the truth, even when she sees Slender Man watching her, B) the inconsiderate attitude she demonstrates for her friends, being more smitten for a guy than her BFFs, C) her choice to ignore her sister (Taylor Richardson), and D) the idiotic decisions her character makes that put her, and others, at unnecessary risk.\n\nIf you knew there was an evil entity in the woods, would you go there? Well, these characters do. Perhaps I should now talk about the 'plot'. Hallie, along with her three friends, Wren (Joey King), Chloe (Jaz Sinclair) and Katie (Annalise Basso), during a sleepover, decide to summon Slender Man, which is as easy as clicking on a link. The three girls are all affected by the 'ritual', eventually leading to one predictably disappearing. There is also Tom (Alex Fitzalan), who is shoehorned in as a potential love-interest, and whose narrative is largely unfulfilled in the five odd minutes he appears in. Besides the contrived nature of the plot, the second biggest issue is that the feature doesn't focus upon Wren, who is the film's most intriguing character, demonstrating a determination to help others, studious investigative skills, and courage; three qualities that the other characters lack.\n\nThis is only exacerbated by the utter stupidity of the characters. Their investigation into how to put an end to Slender Man's pursuit leads them to an 'expert' online, who provides strict guidelines that must be followed to the letter. Do you think more than one character decides to do the complete opposite? You would be right. Do you think more than one character does exactly what they were told not to do? Two for two. This makes feeling sympathetic for the characters a challenge, for how can you feel sorry for anyone who lacks total common sense and reasoning?\n\nThat said, the film is almost entirely logical...until the 2/3 mark where we get to a hospital sequence. Then it devolves into a contradictory, illogical mess. There is a twist around this part, though it was less a shocker, and more of an 'Oh, that's what's happening, eh?' Over the course of the feature, we occasionally receive glimpses of the world Slender Man inhabits, and in so doing, we can almost imagine the kind of film we could have received. All ghosts are meant to have 'rules' that they abide by, and the lacking complexity surrounding the antagonistic force is disappointing to say the least.\n\nWhy is he summoned from the internet? How is he able to affect technology? Why does he wear a fancy three-piece suit? Why doesn't he have a face? How come he occasionally has tentacles? Why does he exclusively target children and teenagers? What is his secret to being so thin? I know the film is based upon an urban legend conceived entirely online, and the audience could do some investigation of their own, but still, refusing to add depth to the film's title villain is just lazy screen-writing.\n\nSlender Man is ultimately...fine, but it doesn't succeed in developing a compelling or thought-provoking narrative. Neither does it effectively create a nightmarish fantasy that will ruin your sleep. You can watch it once, though repeated viewing may potentially damage your intelligence."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was years ago when we were playing slender man game in a dark room with friends, trying to get scared, when we absorbed the creepypasta and the whole \"mythos\" of slender man, if you can call it that. I always thought that the concept would make a good horror movie & I still think it could work, but it definetly didn't with this one. I went in open minded, because of reading a lot of sensibly sounding 5 to 6/10 reviews, and because the trailer didn't seem all that bad. With an open mind I watched the 1st 1/3 of their movie, staying positive, but it just went downhill from the starting point. I'll start with the pros, whatever few there is: Cinematography & editing were the only things that held up, it's not really visually bad, if we're judging it by what a pg-13 horror can be. It's decent and does not create problems, that made that 3.1 rating up there happen. Acting was also on level, that wasn't the aspect that will make the most cringe. What could make you cringe is the story/plot - in my opinion, this was the easiest, cheapest way to bring slender man mythos to screen - there's way more potential to this. Even bigger problem was the screenplay which simply felt lazy and lousy, as if they went with the first ideas on the whiteboard, not pushing the creative thinking it all. Basically, you've seen the whole formula too many times already. That's pretty much it, the script didn't generate any excitement, mystery or suspense, so it all came out as a flat note, a boring snooze fest. The trailer was better than the movie itself, and that has never been good. Believe an honest horror fan and stay away from this, read the creepypasta again, if you want a slender man vibe again. My rating: 3/10."

One of the main protagonist girls goes missing and a token attempt to find her is made by her friends and the townsfolk. Her father has a rather extreme incident of harassing her friends about where she is. Then inexplicably she's never mentioned by anyone ever again except for the protagonists and only with regards to Slender Man.\n\nAn attempt is made to contact Slender Man and \"give\" him something that they each love. This is never even mentioned by any of them for almost a full half hour afterward.\n\nThe amount of fixation with the \"celebrity\" of Slender Man seems to be overwhelming everything else about the film. We are constantly told about how cunning and dangerous Slender Man is, and how he spreads all throughout the internet with his mythos, but we never see anything like this in the film. Anything involving SLender Man's actions in the film are incoherent and have to be explained after the fact in order for us to realize what is even happening, otherwise it all comes across as a completely random ghostly haunting from the ghost of something that might not even be sentient.\n\nIt's only very close to the end that the movie seems to remember that it had a plot once, and scrambles to catch up.\n\nAll of the above is enough to crater a movie, but it could've still been a watchable and even fun experience. Unfortunately, the movie is insufferably boring on top of all of it."

I'm not talking about plot holes, or goofs, but sloppiness.\n\nThe acting isn't even that bad, and the performer who played Slender Man, did a great job. But other than that, this movie relies on annoying characters, terrible motivation and dialogue, borrowing from an existing urban legend, but without adding background or originality, no conclusive (open) ending etc. etc. The biggest sin from this movie is (a) that it simply isn't scary, and (b) that it doesn't even attempt to be original, resulting in everything just falling flat.\n\nAgain, is this a huge problem? Of course not. It's a horror movie that you can watch with low expectations. But the amount of people giving this a 1 or 10, while writing a complete nonsensical review, is astonishing. I know this isn't rare nowadays, so it's a pity that many people are (purposely?) raising the wrong expectations."

And it is getting monotonous seeing people write \"worst movie ever\" repeatedly. So my 10 may be inflated to offset these inexperienced film viewers ( I'd have given this a solid 7, maybe 8). Back to my review... First thing that struck me was this movie actually utilized actors that looked and behaved like real teenagers. Unlike many teen based films where they appear in their 30s and act like immature 20 something year olds. While their are so many variations of the Slender Man legend, including the factual murder case that occured in Wisvonsin in 2014, this film did effectively capture a few of those story lines. The use of shadows, visuals just barely seen and the music were also all very effective. The additional hallucenogenic visuals and that of Slender Man himself were also pretty good, sometimes the CGI was a but too obvious. Overall this movie was able to create an atmospheric, supernatural, myth based teen horror without gratuitous violence or nudity often found in movies attempting to attract a teen fan base."

Not big studio, huge budget phenomenal, but phenomenal in the way that 28Days is. Lower budget than some big name horror movies but definitely put to good use."

It's 4-5 shallow, empty characters with just enough flavor to tell them apart, and I just can't care about them.\n\nThe movie focuses on the subtly of it all, the growing madness that Slender Man instills in his victims without properly building the tension or showing the characters slowly losing it, which would have given good actors the ability to save it. Instead they use a lot of \"it happened offscreen\" or sudden cuts to show a lose of time, and we get a character suddenly looking confused instead of taking the audience on a journey with the character.\n\nMaybe it's not the writing, and maybe the editor just didn't know what they were doing? \"What are all these long dramatic series in here? This is so boring! *cut* Eh, they'll get the point.\"\n\nWith all the options out there, I just don't think this is worth your time. I could tell you to just watch the 3rd act, and you'd probably get as much out of this movie as you're going to get from the beginning."

For me, There really isn't alot alot to complain about and it really brings a lot of suspense, horror, and thriller, and mystery which actually makes it more entertaining. Although it could have used a little more of Slenderman's wrath, It really describes his character which leads to a genius ending and a very good lesson. I recommend it to Creepypasta fans and people who are really into a lot of this genre. I personally enjoyed it. The suspense is my favorite part about this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm expecting this to be rubbish. I quite fancied it when I first heard about it and saw a few stills, but reports are not good. We're in small suburban 'get me out of this town' America... again. These things are always set in exactly the same place aren't they. This one see's us join a group of 4 high school girls. They're bored. At a sleepover the subject of Slender Man comes up. An internet lore about a tall bloke with long arms that takes children to another place. The film's source is a muddy story, born via the internet in the early naughties. A narrative comprising different directions and ideas from a multitude of creators, no one really taking ownership. A creature designed by committee. This fundamentally is the problem with Slender Man now brought to the cinema screen. The girls watch a video on how to summon him, it's predictably spooky graphic nonsense. Some chiming bells, pagan symbols etc. Nothing happens... or does it. Wren (Joey King) is having nightmares and Katie (Annalise Basso) is oddly drawn to creaking trees in graveyards. Then Katie goes missing. It's all fairly standard stuff, largely at night, where figures are hidden in the shadows. Forests with tall trees and flashlights. Eerie music and nocturnal wildlife. Teenage occult dabblings. There's too much instant belief in the myth from the three remaining girls for this to have any bite, but I guess you have to except the tropes and hope for the best. It's biggest problem is it's reliance on jump scares, not to mention lack of substance. It's a nice simple short story at best, that even at 90 minutes feels like it's struggling to hold any interest. I'm fine with a silly suspense thriller. I don't need gore, amazing FX, not this has those, but I need a solid story and a plot that's engaging. This essentially is a bit of dull preamble, followed by a flatline hour of the three girls being stalked by Slender Man whilst they try to retrieve Katie from his clutches. One by one they're picked off, there's no ebb and flow it's just a slow creep or plod toward the end. I'll admit I do like the Slender Man design, he's a simple and elegant monster, but aesthetics alone cannot carry a film. The reports were right."

I got nothing from this one. Too bad, there were some good actresses in this movie but they couldn't really put much into the characters because they weren't really thought out that well, in my opinion that is. If you want a movie to be good you have to be able to connect with the characters. I liked the characters I did but I didn't connect or relate. Weird friend group as well because the only thing that connected them was that they go to the same school. No background to why they're such good friends.

The way the plot unfolds, has also been done before, in some instances in the other stories I'm thinking about in that last sentence. The film actually felt like a 'lift and shift' from about 50 other movies I could name. Despite having an occasionally dumb script, the cast seem to do their best - thankfully they have to scream a few times and that detracts from the script.

It has everything that fails in its clich\u00e9 of horror movies. Stupid teens, boring direction that lacks scares and consistent scenes. Lets not forget the plot does feel more like a rip off from The Ring movies.\n\nThe characters are all bad and lacking in characteristics that you would root for.

Luring them into the forest or traumatizing them to the part they go insane. Teens make the stupid decision and it is difficult to even care for them. Also, if it is a plot hole or something. But where are all there parents. They go walking around their homes on a school night, yelling and screaming cause something is coming inside their homes. And no adult supervision is found. Until, one of the kids ends up in a hospital and the parents finally show up out of nowhere. The direction is lacking comprehensive with its storytelling. Characters go missing when one of the girls is trying to reach her boyfriend. You really do not hear back about what happened to him.\n\nThe acting is dull. Joey King, Julia Goldani Telles, Jaz Sinclair, and Annalise Basso were all tedious with their performance. The script also was lacking in characteristics with their characters. Which made it hard for you to even care for them.\n\nThe plot was similar to The Ring. Except, they are being stalked by a mysterious tall, skinny, faceless man. It does have some creepy moments. But it fails with its clich\u00e9 horror storytelling. And the climax and third act gets lazy with its storytelling. That is not even sure how to end the film. With one character going insane in the hospital and decides to face the slender man herself.\n\nOverall, Slender Man is a bad film. It lacks scares and suspense. Characters make stupid decisions. Acting is boring. The direction is lazy and the script lacks in fleshing out their characters. Only good thing is Slender Man is kind of creepy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Provocative, engaging, and for the most part intelligent- Slender Man may fall short of a full conclusion, but makes up for it in its earlier content and direction. The film has its flaws, there is no doubt about that. The acting from some of the characters, namely Jaz Sinclair (and quite a few supporting actors), are quite obvious and corny. However, that isn't to say the film has terrible acting as a whole. Both Joey King and Julia Goldani Telles give their performances all they can throughout the film, and I would never think for a second they were bad in those roles. I thought they fit the film perfectly, both in acting, and in tone, and I felt they made the right casing choices for what the film needed. Annalise Basso also gives my favorite performance in the film, as short as it is, as her character feels incredibly grounded and focused every time she is on screen. The formula is a bit typical for this type of film, and can seem a bit predictable and/or tedious to watch. However, for the most part, the film is pretty interesting to watch. It's interesting to delve into the minds of these characters and see what the future has hold for them, and it's quite impressive what these actresses have in store for these roles. My biggest problem with the film is the ending, as it seems remarkably abrupt, and almost as if they didn't have time to edit it with any sort of real conclusion. It basically gives you all you need to keep going, but it still feels more like a glimpse of what the ending actually was going to be, than any sort of true conclusion. That all being said, I did enjoy the tone of the film very much, and found it to be incredibly atmospheric and quite nice to look at. The cinematography is very well done, and I surprisingly enjoyed the look ad interpretation of Slender Man throughout the film. In the end, Slender Man is not a great film by any means, but it certainly is an underappreciated gem in the horror world, and I urge those who haven't seen it to go in with an open mind if they ever do decide to watch it. My Rating: 7.5/10"

One slightly better than the other but both INFINITELY better than this boring, uninteresting, unimaginable, dark film. Oh, I don't mean the story, I mean the actual movie. What happened here? It is so dark that I had to squint my eyes several times. I also spent an entire day as it was so incredibly boring that I nearly fell asleep(I actually think I DID once) I mean, I like thematically dark movies but when the movie itself is so dark that you can't see, you did something wrong.\n\nThe movie is about this girl disappearing. Why? Slender Man. How? I dunno, there's no build-up in the slightest , it happens in broad daylight and NO ONE SEES HER DISAPPEAR! IN BROAD DAYLIGHT! SURROUNDED BY TEACHERS AND FRIENDS! J-just how? How I tell ya?\n\nNow, is the story good? Well, no. It's a story. Long story short( HA!) The Slender Man movie is a compilation of \"scary\" images. There is no REAL story here, just a guy wanting to show his co-workers his film portfolio. Really, this looks like a demo-reel, a conceptual film about the character.\n\nOh, and how, you ask, does Slendy travel around? Apparently, by watching this rip-off Ringu( (The Ring) video on a website (Yeah, not Youtube, just a website) he comes around creepin' while you're sleepin', weirdly possessing the father of the girl to attack her friends. That's what I thought at first, but NOPE. He's just insane and nothing comes out of that: He breaks into the her friend's house, tries to kill them and gets arrested later that night. Yeah, and good ol' Slendy is in the living room in a scene, but it's so dark that I can't see him. I have to REWIND even though the sound is telling me to be scared.\n\nOh, and the ending? So confusing. I think.\n\nIn short, don't watch this unless you want a really good nap."

        "review_detailed_main": "Horror movies are flooding into the theater almost as fast comedies, and despite the mediocre reviews they continue to be churned out at the breakneck speed. Tonight, despite a Sci-Fi horror releasing this week, a second horror wants to take a stab at winning the box office battle. Robbie K here, bringing you another movie review to help guide your viewing pleasures. Let's get started as I share my opinions on:\n\nMovie: Slenderman (2018)\n\nDirector: Sylvain White Writers: David Birke, Victor Surge (based on a character by) Stars: Joey King, Julia Goldani Telles, Jaz Sinclair\n\nLIKES:\n\nShort Run Time Good Cinematography Makeup/Visuals Design of Antagonist Okay Acting\n\nSlenderman doesn't have much going for it for me, but at least the movie is at a short run time of about 80 minutes, so you don't have to put up with too long of a movie (assuming you stay for the whole show). The faster pace film has packs plenty of creepy-crawly mood to it, mostly thanks to the cinematography and setting designed for the movie. Bring in the makeup and visuals to further add that shadow of sadness/doom alongside the realistic setting and you an even strong case of being disturbed by the movie. Slenderman's various actions really can get under your skin, and once his form is solidly captured on set, you might get the final ambience of shivering in your skin as the CGI monster stalks the \"heroines\". As for the cast, they do well with the direction they were guided down, but I can't say more outside of that.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nThe Characters The Disturbing Imagery Plot Holes Chaotic Camera Work Aimless Direction\n\nUnfortunately, the dislikes pile up, more so in how stereotypical this movie went forgoing any originality and potential for superficial gimmicks. The first aspect are the characters, very shallow teenagers who not only dug themselves a major hole in this film, but refusing to change. The static development leaves little to root for, nor any promise that things are going to go well for the teenage girls. Sadly, the girls primary growth occurs in their ability to tolerate the awful images the CGI ghost brings with him. Like the Ring, these visuals are not the most pleasing to watch and some felt unnecessary to include, thereby making their inclusion all the more pointless. Instead they should have worked on the story, for it had many plot holes and dead ends that were disappointing to say the least. Slenderman's avenues are quickly interrupted by prolonged bouts of cat and mouse games, where the camera work fails to capture all the details you wanted to see. In addition, the movie did not succeed in taking a firm direction, leading to this spiral of hodge-podge horror that left me bored, listless, and counting the minutes for this predictable film to end. I'll applaud the nods to other horror movies, but this piece meal needed some refining to bring Slenderman out to his full horror.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nSlenderman looked insane, and it delivered on that quite well in regards to the mental war it plays on the girls. Your scares come from realistic setting and camera work, but outside of that there is little to harp on. The movie's story is unfocussed, needing some editing and rewrites to really dive into the tale they wanted to present. In addition, deeper characters and better focus on the CGI villain is a must if the series is to survive. As such, I can't recommend this movie for theater, nor is it worth your time at most rental sites (unless you are a teen looking to test your merit). Given everything coming out save your money and target those movies in the near future.\n\nMy Scores:\n\nHorror: 4.0 Movie Overall: 3.0-3.5"

The ending was the icing on the cake to say the film is something worth leaving in the past and never worth seeing again."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Those who hear the three bells toll, accept his invitation. When you hear the first, you must close your eyes, keeping words unspoken. If one wants to hear, you must listen closely, for they are soft and distant.\"\n\nI was really curious about this movie. Not that I expected anything spectacular. But the photos with this cult figure, which popped up on the internet, were rather intriguing. Not really scary but mysterious. A faceless figure with disproportionate limbs who appears in the background while observing children playing. A kind of Pied Piper of Hamelin who lures innocent children and makes them disappear. The fact this creation is the result of an internet competition is widely known. I was only curious if this figure would convince in a horror film. Well, it's not really innovative. You'll see the same clich\u00e9s again. And the same stupidities and bad decisions are made by those who are about to become a victim. And the same tricks out of \"Horror for dummies\" are applied.\n\nAnd yet, I didn't think it was bad. \"Slender man\" certainly isn't such a big fiasco as you might think. It isn't as disastrous as the comments you can read here and there on the internet. It won't go down in history as one of the most frightening or bloody horrors of all time. And the obscure and dark images creates an appropriate atmosphere but also ensure that you can't see a damn thing most of the time. But I felt that constant threat and the fear among the four teenage girls. And no, I won't have panic attacks immediately when hearing the sound of crackling wood. But these sound effects did create a creepy mood.\n\nNormally I am such a person who whines about the fact that too little background information is given in a film. You are kept in the dark (appropriate for this movies) in terms of the origin and arising of the particular creepy phenomenon. With \"Slender Man\", however, I didn't think this was necessary. It made Slender Man even more mysterious. Summoning malicious demons also isn't exactly something new. Only recently you could see in \"Pyewacket\" how a frustrated teenage girl evoked something similar with the help of an occult ritual. And a long time ago, a group of young adults played a tape in \"The Evil Dead\" which caused Kandarian spirits to ruin everything. In \"Slender Man\" the cause of all the misery is a video on YouTube. Maybe that fits with today's time, but perhaps this bothered me the most. They tried to make it too hip. Especially when afterwards this ancient legend also knows about mobile phone technology.\n\nMaybe that's the problem with this movie. They focused more on the continuation of the internet hype and tried to make a modern horror out of it. They lost sight of the concept of a well-thought-out horror. Maybe it fits perfectly with the life the four teenage girls Wren (Joey King), Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles), Chloe (Jaz Sinclair) and Katie (Annalize Basso) lead. A group of carefree teenagers who gained a certain popularity status at school (as seen in so many other Highschool films) and show an everyday affinity with current modern technology. They have more affection for their smartphone than for their fellow students. Yes, they display a kind of arrogance. To such an extent that they simply ignore the warnings for watching the video. Until one of them suddenly disappears and they realize that they might be stalked by this lugubrious figure.\n\nWant to know my conclusion in the end? The whole legend created around this Slender Man was much more interesting than the film itself. All in all, it wasn't original and I didn't see anything baffling new in this film. But I still found certain scenes successful. Such as the one in the library with the use of a sort of psychedelic footage. And throughout the film, there are more of those hallucinatory passages. Also, I didn't think the acting was that awful. Ok, sometimes the four girls acted rather childish during meaningless conversations. And yes, some of their decisions were downright stupid. But that suited these young girls. And finally, I also thought the appearance of the mysterious Slender Man was reasonably successful. He blended perfectly with the background so you had this feeling that he could appear at any time. It's Javier Botet again who has put his peculiar physique at the service to play this nasty character. Just like he did in \"Mama\", \"Don't knock twice\" and \"Mara\". No, \"Slender Man\" wasn't disastrous, but seasoned horror fanatics will look at it in a rather condescending way. Beginners, on the other hand, might be afraid this faceless figure will show up. After all, they've seen a large part of the illustrious video. Not?"

        "review_detailed_main": "For fanantics of the mythos and meme, Slender Man is too little too late. Slendy has been given mockumentary web shows (in addition to the awesome Marble Hornets) and plenty of fan films better than this supposed real deal, not to mention the popularity he was granted when an unfunny Let's Player screamed at some video games he was in. NOTE: One scene includes honest-to-God Deviantart images of the eponymous creature.\n\nIt isn't original or interesting as a film on its own, either. Its similarities with the Ringu series have been noted, and it fails to translate to film that which sounds intriguing when presented as a creepypasta; a purportedly legitimate blog accompanied by an ominous series of inexplicable YouTube clips. That close-to-home realism and, dare I say it, found-footage camera work is what made the mythos believable and effective. This film is visibly more expensive, stars obvious actors (bad ones), is shot like any other movie, and has an OST by the talented Ramin Djawadi, albeit asleep at the wheel with this one.\n\nI don't mean to say that the Slender Man can't ever appear in a feature-length horror film with a budget. It's just that his is a story that works best when you read it in an email, see strange videos immediately afterwards, and soon begin to pay attention to noises from far away, as well as your own coughs. If you want to make a full-on movie about him - especially years after the Slendy ship has sailed and people are more horrified by American politics than forest-dwelling monsters that cause space-time disruptions and insanity - you'll want to make something less derivative, poorly acted, unironically formulaic and bland than Slender Man."

I loved the Slenderman games and find them incredibly unnerving to play (particularly alone in the dark with headphones on) and when I heard this movie was being made I was certainly intrigued. I mean this is such a mysterious character. That means that the movie has unlimited options in terms of what sort of story to tell. However, once the trailer was released I knew what we were getting: a movie that is weird for the sake of being weird. But...as a fan of the games (and someone with too much time on their hands due to the recent development of insomnia) I decided to give it a watch. I checked IMDB beforehand just to see how it was being rated. 3.1! I've NEVER seen a movie being rated so poorly. But, the comments were fairly positive. In fact, many of them claimed they didn't understand why the movie was receiving so much hate. I'll tell you why: 1. The story is one of the most poorly written stories I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing. From the moment the movie starts, every single character is a cliche. Somehow, they manage to all be cliches and yet are still entirely underdeveloped. The character development is little to none and any character development that does take place is done through the characters themselves actually saying it. 2. The sound effects used in this movie are supposed to resemble the game (I assume) but they happen at random times, they don't sound creepy, and worst of all, you can see that the creators were under the impression that cheap-sounding special effects would help set the tone...they don't. 3. Without giving away any spoilers, you can actually see, moment by moment, all the other movies that this one took inspiration from (I say inspiration but it is closer to plagiarism.\n\nAll in all, rather than leaving me scared or unnerved, this movie has actually managed to make Slenderman seem less like a horror characters and more like a spoof of one. If you'd added some jokes here and there, this movie could easily have been considered a horror movie spoof because it's THAT far away from being scary!"

Multiple games, a youtube channel with enough content for multiple hours (which is something I would have appreciated seeing become the movie adaptation, so take this with a grain of salt if you will) and stories upon stories on wikis and creepypasta. None of these sources seem to have been referenced, as any ideas lifted aren't explored as much as touched upon. The villian has many powers, most of them only shown once, sometimes twice, making it feel super underwhelming.

I don't think any serious horror fan would have this in their collection and, if they do, I'd really like to know why.\n\nHey, at least it's better than anything from The Conjuring series."

For example the sequence of the video call was very frightening, as well as many other scenes and aspects. I'd say the ending was a bit rushed. But all the \"know it all\" people just let themselves go with the current, meaning that if they come aware that critics are destroying a movie, they of course go see it with a bad previously conceived idea, and think must hate it so critics do. It happens a lot of times. My advice is to go, see, feel and enjoy any movie you watch and create an opinion and an idea of your own. This movie is very enjoyable, mysterious and spooky.

One could be in the real world and the other you know isn't. This is the underlying reason why Slender Man has been so popular but the film will spoil the whole Urban Myth surrounding Slender Man and not add to it, which is an opportunity lost.\n\nRating 3 out of 10"

Although following precisely the instructions from the clip, the girls say that everything is nonsense, but when the suddenly begin to have nightmares about the creature and one of them goes missing, their sanity and also friendship will be put to the test.\n\nIt's a supposedly horror movie which introduces the legend of Slender Man and how four girls get involved in his stories. I say supposedly because it almost not scary at all. It bases solely on jump-scares, a cheap tactic which makes the viewer startle, but without a truly scary atmosphere or creature which can generate this type of emotion. Speaking of the atmosphere, it is mostly dull, lacking suspense, drama or any sense of empathy towards the characters, making the whole action truly pointless.\n\nThe plot is simply stupid. It bases its entire action on the summoning of a mystical creature, which is also as dumb as it gets, which will do what it does best to take care of the main characters, one by one. You get no drama, no suspense, no emotion... just pure linearity and also predictability. The characters are very simple, not well developed, acting strange and making irrational decisions in key moments, eliminating any chance of caring for their fate. It's almost laughable when you see how they react in different situations; that's how bad they are.\n\nIn order to describe the creature, the movie uses some \"special\" effects which are sometimes so bad that they seem to be made in a coffee break using last century's technology. You can only imagine how disappointing or even laughable this can get, when judging the fact that they should induce fear or at least drama. Another aspect which is to be mentioned is the finale. I honestly expected it to bring something different, something that might make the previous hour and a half a bit less pointless. Unfortunately, as with the rest of the film, it fails miserably do deliver anything out of the ordinary, ending suddenly and almost without any clue.\n\nAs you might have guessed by now, this movie is a disaster. It isn't able to be what it was supposed to be, a horror movie, it fails to deliver a decent story or characters and it really fails to generate fear, drama, suspense or anything like these, except a couple of cheap jump-scares. It's a truly awful movie which should be avoided at any cost."

The story was solid but a little cliche. The writing and dialogue was lazy at best, and the acting was decent. The film used every modern horror movie trope but tried a few new things. Far from perfect but really not that bad.\n\n\"This movie said it was the scariest movie ever and it's not, so I'm giving it a one\" is NOT a movie review.

It's obvious to anybody who has visited online horror forums before that nothing good is gonna come out of a major motion picture based in an internet creepypasta. The source material is not elaborate or cohesive enough to justify making a full-length film about it, unless the writers are able to expand on it and fix it, which is not the case here.\n\nSince there's so little backstory behind this creature, the plot is very straightforward and a little uneventful. Four friends decide to summon the entity known as Slender Man out of boredom during a sleepover. At first, they don't take the consequences of their actions seriously, until, after a while, one of them disappears. Not much else happens. However, part of the narrative feels disconnected from the bigger scheme, because some minor events are left without resolution.\n\nThe characters are basically non-existent, with only slight hints of what could pass as a personality for each one. The consequence is the audience's complete indifference to what will happen to them, limiting the interest in watching this film to an occasional jump scare or possible gory outcome to a particular scene. The actors do what they can with the material they're given, but the result is mediocre at best.\n\nThe awful CGI is distracting, though there's not a lot more they could have done here. The biggest problem is the concept behind the story, too broad to be scary. It negatively affects the cinematography that follows the same generic path. There is one or two interesting images that would form nice compositions if they were part of a collage in an art exhibit, but here they're just not very special.\n\nIf anything, the biggest flaw in this film is taking itself too seriously. It misses the opportunity to have fun with its own stupidity, and prevents the audience to do the same. Therefore, there is no reason to watch it. Skip it."

I wish I hadn't bothered. It looked good, in places. But the main thing was you saw him too much. The point in slender man is that you barely see him or just glimpses. It wasn't scary at all, no jump scares either. You can tell it had been cut to pieces to get a lower age rating and in places it didn't make sense because of it. The acting wasn't too bad but the script was badly written also. It was so cliche in places you wanted to throw things at the tv and scream why would you do that it's 2018!! The pace was slow in places for a \"horror film\" and it just seemed so bland. It trails along from bad to good effects then bad again. Parts of it looked creepy to start of with then looked silly. It could of been so good. It's great source material and if someone like James Wan had the directors chair I think it could of been something special. However I struggled to finish it but did and didn't really care about any of the characters because to be honest parts of it just didn't make sense. A waste of a perfectly good premise. Avoid if you like decent horror. I would say try the Nun this year but that also was pretty poor considering it was a conjuring spin off. Please someone try again and make a good movie of it."

Slenderman should not have had as much film time as he was given, if the film was made in a more atmospheric manner it potentially would have been better. The line for me was the excessive use of the Hitchcock shot; as a film student myself we were banned in college from using it! Overall this was a cheap, disappointing film that could have had potential, but tried too hard to scare and unnerve the audience."

Don't get me wrong though I love this movie to watch for fun; I think Slenderman is really cool and they did a fair bit of showing him which I love. This movie just tried and failed at what it set out to be, but on the flip side it accomplishes being a cool tense thriller that's a tad scary at times.

Will any of them survive?\n\nI thought this was okay... but it could have been so much better. On the positive side there was a good creepy atmosphere, the effects were okay and the acting wasn't bad. On the downside it felt far too anaemic, as though the makers sacrificed the chance of making it really scary or showing any gore or unpleasantness to get a more child-friendly rating. There are also quite a few genre clich\u00e9s that are overused such as dreams within dreams, lots of screaming and false scares. Overall I'd say this was decent enough for something I watched on Netflix; I was just left a bit disappointed as I felt the ideas were good and could have made a great horror film... perhaps it will one day."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Slender Man\" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch a group of teenage girls who are fascinated by the internet lore of the Slender Man, attempt to prove that he doesn't actually exist by summoning him with a ritual. After the ritual, each one of them started to experience some supernatural phenomena that make them believe that the story is real. Everything changes when one of them mysteriously goes missing and the others start to worry not only for her but also for themselves.\n\nI have to admit that I have high hopes for this movie and I was really disappointed by it. The plot was awful and had many plot holes and a script that could not cover them not even a bit. The cast made below average interpretations that made the audience not able to understand their feelings and what they have been through at these moments of terror. I did not like the interpretations of Joey King who played as Wren and Julia Goldani Telles who played as Hallie, and I have to say that I expected more from Annalise Basso who played as Katie because I believe that she did not reach her potential. The direction which was made by Sylvain White was average and some suspense moments - scenes were not enough.\n\nTo sum up, I believe that \"Slender Man\" is an awful movie with a bad plot and poor direction. I do not recommend anyone to watch it but if you are curious about it and you want to watch just do not have high hopes for it because I am sure that you are going to be disappointed by it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Slender Man was a very popular figure along with Jeff The Killer when Creepypastas had become a phenomenon on the Internet, giving rise to new urban legends for the digital generation. A movie about Slender Man was a good idea for this phenomenon and could have taken Creepypasta's fame to another level. Since they began making films focused on social networks, it is clear that internet culture has gained so much relevance that they wanted to take it beyond its borders through cinematographic art. Sony tried to do that with The Emoji Movie and the result was not pleasant for much of the audience. A year later, Sony decided to try again with a Slender Man movie and it ended up being a second setback. The only good thing is that both did not do very badly at the box office and with the arrival of the Wattpad movies and the Five Nights At Freddy's movie, the financial success they have received has made internet culture as relevant as the film producers wanted so much regardless of the bad reviews.\n\nThe Slender Man movie has been quite divisive due to the changes that were made when it was originally going to be rated R, but the negative reaction to the first trailer caused that to be changed causing the movie to end up being rated PG13 and being removed. Some scenes from the first trailer. The film may not have been liked by Slender Man fans due to the changes that were made to the final result, but there are fans who were satisfied and others were able to at least get to know Creepypasta through this film. Although it may not seem like it, the film does have positive things. It must be taken into account that Slender Man does not have a fixed canon and Internet users spread the legend with a lot of material that they themselves have created without having altered the main concept. What characterizes Slender Man quite a bit is that he usually captures children like Boogeyman and the film further expands that concept by suggesting that he can kidnap teenagers. The reality is that teenagers are not fully adults and are still children who are just going through the transition from child to adult. In addition, teenagers depend quite a bit on social networks and they are part of the audience that has expanded the legend of Slender Man. So involving teenagers in the film is justifiable, although involving children would have helped a lot.\n\nAlso, the movie is only based on the character and not on the Creepypasta itself, so what the movie presents is an interpretation of the character according to the lore. The film is partly faithful to the character's lore because it maintains that mystery and suspense that characterizes Slender Man and takes into account the influence that it has generated so that it ended up going viral all over the Internet. The nightmare-like scenes and the scenes where the girls are stalked by Slender Man clearly look like they were taken from the characters' video games. What the film offers is a kind of mix of Ringu and A Nightmare On Elm Street offering dark sequences that fit the character very well. The soundtrack and sound effects manage to create a good atmosphere of tension. The CGI is not very good, but at least they respected the appearance of Slender Man and offered good sequences in which you can feel the air of Slender Man. What is true is that Internet users have expanded the Slender myth so much Well there is a lot of material that could have been included.\n\nThe movie certainly had more room to add more material and further develop the Slender Man mythology. 2 hours and 30 minutes or even just 2 hours would have been enough for the movie to develop Slender Man more. Sony certainly wasn't going to do That's because the film was not going to be completely commercial and I was already worried after the first bad reactions. There is no denying that this film had a lot of potential, but the real problem is the script and direction it had. It must be admitted that the movie Always Watching is better because despite being a found footage movie, it knew how to handle the Slender Man myth with more subtlety and take advantage of the feeling of tension generated by the character. On the other hand, this film focused more on being a commercial film and that is why it falls into being just another movie in the bunch. Because some scenes were cut, you can tell that more of the movie is missing because there are moments where some situations are skipped. Katie's disappearance happens out of nowhere without giving much context and something similar happens with Wren, who disappears from the film without any explanation and becomes a loose end. There are several things in the film that are left unresolved or unexplained. There is still the question of who the mysterious user the girls were contacting was. Most likely, all the doubts that the film leaves would have been answered in a sequel that never came in the end. The script really has plot holes that needed to be filled. The girls in this movie are the same thing that has been seen several times in horror movies. They make bad decisions when they are so blinded by panic and desperation.\n\nSo the disappointment of many Slender Man fans is understandable because this movie could have been something great, but it ended up being another simple commercial horror movie about teenagers being chased by a monster. Maybe with another screenwriter or another director it would have been different. In the end, Slender Man: The Movie is not the worst thing ever made as many say, but it is a film that does not contribute much to the popularity of Creepypasta. It is a film that only serves to entertain and it does not fail in that. It's a movie that can be enjoyed one night in the afternoon, but that's all it has to offer. My final rating for this movie is a 6/10."

I think setting it around these 4 girls wasn't interesting mostly because you never really get to know them. Movie was extremely slow moving and none of the characters were flushed out enough that I even cared about them. Also the ending was eh and predictable. Also the cheap attempts of scare with sudden screaming and trippy flashing imagery were just not scary other than startling you because you're not expecting some sudden loud noise. It was just annoying."

I have seen some about Slender Man on the internet and watched a few people playing the game on YouTube, but not much beyond that. I thought the concept for the film could be good. But as I'm writing my review, I realize that there are so many other movies with the same concept, and many have done it way better. Sinister is a similar concept in which children are taken by this otherwordly being, and that movie was scary and suspenseful. This movie literally put me to sleep. I had to go back and rewatch the ending only to be more disappointed.\n\nDon't waste your time watching this movie. There are already many more movies that are so much better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Slender Man will surely go down as one of the worst movies of the year. As the title of this review indicates, it is mostly a boring, nonsensical series of events saved from a lower rating by a few scenes in which it crosses into \"so bad it's good\" territory.\n\nAlthough the acting and visuals are both terrible, the writing is probably the weakest aspect of Slender Man. Most of the plot involves characters doing the same things over and over again. Various \"scary\" set-ups are reused multiple times. Characters utter awkward, wooden lines at inappropriate times. Together, these constitute about 90% of the runtime.\n\nThe remaining 10% of the movie is where things get funny. A few scenes, which are concentrated in the middle-to-late portions of the film, go completely off the rails. In one, a wildly underdeveloped character's face morphs into a caricature while speaking normally. In another, the staff of a hospital turn into automatons. People openly laughed in the theater. These funny scenes elevate the movie from a 2 to a 3."
