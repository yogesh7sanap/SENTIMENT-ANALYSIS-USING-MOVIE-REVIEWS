        "review_detailed_main": "Alex Proyas' \"Gods of Egypt\" is a film that is boldly and unabashedly silly and preposterous. Few other words can describe it. It has the pratfalls that beset typical Hollywood fare. It is already the subject of controversy due to its preeminently Caucasian cast. It has both critics and audiences sharpening their knives, a film supposedly destined for failure.\n\nOh, but it works because the film truly bonkers. Truly insane. Truly out of its mind.\n\nProyas, a gifted and visionary filmmaker, is renowned for having thought-provoking and striking imagery in all of his films, and this film is without exception. Where in any other film do you get to see goddesses horse-riding giant fire-breathing serpents? Or wagons carrying infinite amounts of gold dumping their load in a funnel-like tube ala dump trucks? Or for that matter, gods bleeding gold? Or Gerard butler riding gold- chromed giant beetles into battle? Or gods that have body parts that, when disfigured, instantly become detachable jewelry? Or...\n\nAdmittedlly the plot is indeed silly even by blockbuster Hollywood standards, however a lesser Proyas film is still more visually inventive than the usual Hollywood movie factory output, and that is always a plus. Whereas a film like \"Pan\" bludgeons us over the head with its disgusting cynicism and disrespect for the source material by portraying its titular hero as a clich\u00e9d messiah figure, Proyas directs with the exuberance of a kid in Disneyland - with Disneyland replaced with an Egyptian museum exhibit \u2013 eager at the chance to create his own action packed tale while still respecting the gods as, well, gods.\n\nWhat is there to say about the plot, except that it has gods and it has Egypt? You get exactly what's on the tin. You get a chiseled hero in the form of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), his athletic and quippy comic sidekick (Brenton Thwaites) and beautiful love (Courtney Eaton), who set out to defeat Horus' evil uncle Set (Gerard Butler, simultaneously parodying his \"300\" persona while being supremely sinister).\n\nThe whole thing sounds very Greek. But rather than eschewing the silly tone and making it \"Gladiator\"-style dark and dreary ala the recent \"Clash of the Titans\" movies, Proyas and the actors let loose and have a ball with the material, never being too self aware while being silly enough to make for compelling viewing. Even rising star Chadwick Boseman (terrific in both \"42\" and \"Get on Up\"), as Thoth the god of knowledge, relishes in chewing the scenery with every moment, never afraid of being campy. Not bad.\n\nLook, it's clear that the film is a B-grade Saturday night matin\u00e9e film straight from the 1950s. Ever heard your grandparents told you about those? The ones where there's usually a double feature showcasing silly low budget sci-fi/horror/fantasy plots with handsome men and gorgeous gals, supremely cheesy one liners and having no purpose other than to put a goofy smile on your face from start to finish, almost guaranteeing a good time out? Well, this is one such movie, but with a blockbuster budget and the added pleasure of having Proyas wrapping the fun around with his wonderful thought-provoking visuals and production design, and going wild with this thing. Two set pieces involving a gigantic worm-like demon and the Egyptian afterlife are visual marvels, triumphs of set design and visual effects, evoking senses of awe and wonder like films from yesteryear and other gifted visionaries. For mainstream filmmakers, CGI is the cheat sheet. For Proyas, it's his toy box. This is eye candy on a spectacular scale, and audiences won't get short-changed.\n\nBear with me here, but if you were to replace the cast with genuine Egyptian actors, I think the film would be mired in even bigger controversies because it will definitely look more inaccurate and seemingly insulting than it supposedly already is. It's stupid, yes, but it's gloriously stupid and never succumbs to taking itself ever so seriously. Proyas sort of knew what he was doing here, and he didn't give a damn about what others thought. And that's the kind of filmmaker I admire the most."

        "review_detailed_main": "For some strange reason I was wishing for a big budget over the top version of Land of the Pharaohs (1955), with a bit of Cleopatra (1963) and Jason and the Argonauts (1963) thrown in. And true to form, it came pretty close to the campiness of those films! Apart from the storyline, this spectacular action adventure sure delivers in the CGI department and creative sound design. It's one for the big screen and thumping speakers, insulting your senses in a most pleasurable masochist way.\n\nDirector Alex Proyas mostly delves in dark films where \"The End Is Nigh\". These dark themes were noticeable in Spirits of the Air, Gremlins of the Clouds (1989), The Crow (1994) and Dark City (1998). They even had it's moments in the Hollywood blockbusters I, Robot (2004) along with The Knowing (2009). With Gods of Egypt, it almost felt like it wasn't an Alex Proyas film. Maybe a bit too spectacular for his style, but he managed to fit moments in where he got to play with his dark-side, mostly evident in the \"Afterlife\" scenes. In this film, Alex got to create his vision with perfection, thanks to today's technology. Hopefully he'll be able to use that on his next project, maybe something a little darker, a bit more Proyas than Hollywood.\n\nWhat saved this film from its own corniness is the talent it attracted. Gerard Butler is perfect as Gerard Butler the brute! Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gets to play around with his Game Of Thrones character, Jamie, by adding a little more manliness to it. The surprise of the lot was the mortal, Bek, played by the Aussie cutie, Brenton Thwaites. He supplied the wit and charm desperately needed in this. Even the Aussie icons, Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush came along for the ride. What they both managed to do was play it perfectly straight, in a theatrical way, that suited the style of this film. You noticed the tone of the film changed when Rush was on screen with Butler or Nikolaj. The level went up a notch, and it was momentarily intriguing. (And see if you can spot another Aussie icon, Bruce Spence:)\n\nThe true winner of this epic film is the \"Gamer\". This film has all the elements a Gamer would love. It has dangerous mazes our heroes have to get through, and thrilling combating scenes captured by frantic maneuvering cameras. If the film does well at the box office I'm sure there will be a game following hot on its heels.\n\nI must admit I was surprised how entertaining this film was. Maybe because I saw it on the big screen and was distracted by the incredible CGI and sound design. The story was pleasing enough, it has the Game Of Thrones element where characters you least expected to perish did. There was the Lord Of The Rings journey and a bit of everything else you might have seen if you love your big action adventure films. And not to forget the romantic element which played heavily in our heroe's destination. I think the studio executives got ever audience angle covered."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this film without expecting anything in particular, the trailer full of action scenes piqued my curiosity in addition to the director's name : Alex Proyas whom I discovered thanks to the very good I, Robot with Will Smith. I must admit that I did not go there without worry in view of the (very) negative reviews, from the press as well as spectators, but I came out of the screening more than satisfied. For once I don't understand why this film is being taken down on all fronts...\n\nAdmittedly, it's far from being a great movie but still there are a lot of things to take. Gods of Egypt is therefore a successful action/adventure film, skillfully combining fantastic with the peplum genre in an odyssey in the heart of ancient Egypt, at a time when gods rubbed shoulders with mortals. The atmosphere, the sets and the costumes transcribe well the features of Egyptian mythology, arid deserts with their sandstorms and majestic tombs, all with a mysterious aspect that makes us want to know more about its legends.\n\nThe story does not look very far in terms of originality, we approach themes such as wars of power and conquest, heredity, the initiatory journey with a touch of essential romance, but we can forgive this narrative facility with respect to the action. Alex Proyas is not Michael Bay in this field but h\u00e9 comes out with honors by staging fights between titanic gods in animal/metal armor. So in terms of special effects, we appreciate spectacular good quality. The rhythm of the narration is sustained for 2h10 even if 2-3 timeouts affect the quality the story.\n\nFrankly, even if it remains imperfect, Gods of Egypt is nonetheless a good entertainment , coupled with a rather pleasant little history lesson on Egyptian mythology. A pleasant surprise, I don't approve the bad reviews. 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "In movies there are the good, the bad and the ugly. This one takes the cake of the latter, eats it, digests it, evacuates it and proudly shows off the result on screen. In other words, it's crap.\n\nNot only pilfering the Egyptian pantheon but unable to make anything of it, Gods of Egypt pictures its titular characters like temperamental imbeciles, almighty beings only able to settle their quarrels by way of bad one-liners and fisticuffs. They are helpless fools, a bit like the Windsors, but working out, and very tall. They also are modular and bleed gold.\n\nIn order of appearance, please meet Osiris (Bryan Brown) who's about to crown his son Horus (Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau) king, because that's what immortal gods do, in front of a large crowd of which we'll follow only two humans, Thief of Baghdad Bek and his girlfriend Zaya, \"beauty of the Nile\", according to the poster. Argh. Osiris' brother Set (not Seth, since Gerard Butler can't spell), until then relegated to the desert, crashes the party, kills his brother and enucleates Horus, whose all-seeing eyes do not prove very effective on that instance. Horus is not killed thanks to Hathor, the Goddess of Love.\n\nWe are treated to other divine cameos, like Ra, the God of Sun (poor Geoffrey Rush, slumming) driving a celestial pedalo in hot pursuit of Apophis, the Night Snake, or like Thoth, the God of Knowledge (Chadwick Boseman), who's black, gay and a comic relief as he lives amidst clones of himself. Oh, and he's God of Wisdom, since the writers have no knowledge whatsoever of their subject matter: the thief will save the day while Gods bicker at each other. He's the audience, see, the one we can identify with.\n\nCGI is constant, allowing pyramids to grow like mushrooms. Egyptians can't build robust architecture but they are a very innovative people, inventing things like the umbrella or the elevator. Godly traps prove childishly easy to avoid. The Afterlife is crowded like a peak hour subway. It is, all in all, super easy to kill a God.\n\nDialogue is abysmal, from the Sphinx saying anything but \"Bummer!\" when his riddle is solved to anything regarding Hathor. \"Ah, you are not so good, Goddess of Love\" deserves to join another pantheon, the one of worst movie lines ever. She answers in kind \"I am the Goddess of too much!\". Well, rutabaga."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I watched this movie, I heard about the negative reviews about it. I read that the CGI was awful and that acting was terrible.\n\nI must say people are too quick to criticize. This movie has a unique style and that is what made a lot of people to judge very quickly.\n\nThis movie is not a realistic or historical representation of Egypt and it never tries to be. It is more of a picture of how gods would look like and with a taste of magic and dream. The fact that gods are portrayed twice the size of humans should be the first sign of this style.\n\nThe color palette chosen for the movie is beautiful focusing on yellow of gold and brown of sand. This coupled with the vibrant and warm colors of the environments and set pieces create a delightful picture to watch.\n\nThe story is interesting to follow as it unfolds right from the beginning of the movie with a clash between two brothers. As it is common in these kind of stories, the bad and the good characters are easy to see from the beginning.\n\nThe CGI is mostly good and not as bad as it is called out by some people. The creatures are nicely created and the effects are mostly good with the exception of fire/explosion effects. There were times they felt a bit cheap considering the big budget of 140 million dollars of the movie.\n\nI really like the humorous conversations between Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and Horus(Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the god of sky. Brenton's character really added a much appreciated tone of fun to the movie and made me feel that familiar sense of feeling of similar movies like Prince of Persia(2010). Actually this movie has some resemblance even to the video game of Prince of Persia for example with the design of creature/guardians. Anyway Brenton Thwaites really puts a good performance and I am curious to see what he will be able to do in the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\n\nGerard Butler fulfills his familiar role of war leader very well as expected, of course he is no stranger to these roles.\n\nNikolaj Coaster-Waldau does a great job portraying his character Horus as well. Although it would be nicer to see a bit more of his character's background.\n\nOverall this movie offers a fun, humorous, entertaining story in a fantasy world filled with magical powers of gods and hatred and love. This movie is bold, vibrant and fast, it's a shame some people couldn't see beyond the distinct choice of style, which I personally found interesting."

So it would not surprise me if all this was the true motivation behind its poor media reaction, which is a shame.\n\nIt was not the greatest fantasy there is, But its a decent film that had a bit of originality to it and if they done a squeal I would be happy to go see it."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's simply no justice in this world. This world where safe, sanitary entertainment is king. This world where audacity is roundly mocked and true vision garners sneers of contempt. Alex Proyas has made something ridiculous with his ancient Egyptian VFX extravaganza, Gods of Egypt. He's also made a visionary piece of summer blockbustasia. Weighed against the sterile ephemera slipping into and out of theaters today, Gods of Egypt proves its worth.\n\nIt is not Egypt-the geographic region in Northern Africa-that is represented in Gods of Egypt. Maybe this is an important point to consider for those puritanical air wasters who successfully raised a fuss over this film's racial demographics. It is a mythical Egypt where ten-foot-tall humanoid gods live among their creations. The fuss is moot. One of these gods is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Horus, the heir to Egypt. Another is Set (Gerard Butler) the jealous uncle who wants what any jealous movie uncle wants; power over the kingdom. The very basic adventure outline even makes room for a thieving street rat and his puppy dog romance. This story isn't going to surprise, move, or enlighten anybody. But you know what? Neither will Captain America 5.\n\nCoster-Waldau is a serviceable hero; Brenton Thwaites is a serviceable sidekick. But Gerard Butler is the most entertaining of the cast. Butler has softened into one of our most lovable movie rogues in recent years, but we forget that his break out role was as 300's King Leonidas; a hyper-masculine icon. With Set, Butler gets another go at straight savagery, and he's as committed to the character as any he's played. There are other fine actors present; all of whom get a chance to look or sound patently preposterous. To give you an idea, Geoffrey Rush shows up with a white ponytail and a flaming headdress to shoot sun bombs at a cloud with teeth. But who cares about the actors? This ain't 12 Angry Men.\n\nA movie like this, without imagination, is Avengers: Infinity War. Bland, weightless, flat, grey, tepid, digital runoff. It's true that Gods of Egypt is stuffed with computer generated effects, digital backgrounds, lots of action, and wall to wall green screen. But there is a vision behind all the effects, and that is an all-important distinction. Alex Proyas has a passion for image-making. It's a through line in his career. In Gods of Egypt, he uses special effects not to expedite or enhance, but to create. There is a tendency to think of all CGI, all action, as the same. That's not true. Gods of Egypt uses CGI to CGI's best cinematic potential; to create worlds, wonders, images that spring right from the imagination of the filmmaker. You can see in the crowds of thousands, in the surrealist landscapes, and in the striking ancient-Egypt-on-LSD architecture, that there is a real filmmaker at work here. There is creativity on display. Wild unhinged visions of a world that only exists within Gods of Egypt's two hours.\n\nI don't want to be carried away by hyperbole. Just because Gods of Egypt is visionary, doesn't mean it's great. In the end, this is still a modern VFX blockbuster, complete with many of the smaller problems that entails. There is ample room for bathroom breaks when the action stops and the dutiful business of humor, exposition, and \"true love\" is addressed. But it is hard not to go to the mat for a VFX blockbuster that actually amazed and delighted me. Gods of Egypt debunks the theory that huge CGI summer spectaculars are inherently stale. With a director that doesn't care about looking silly, blockbusters can still be astonishing. Gods of Egypt is a great blockbuster. I had genuine fun. Not a manufactured, conglomerate approved good time, but an actual imagination high you can only get by experiencing a work of passion and artistry.\n\n79/100."

The movie is a spectacular display of visual effects, both in CGI and props. And these dazzling effects do carry the movie a great long way, I will say that much. And the story, while it is simplistic, actually did turn out to be entertaining. Sure, it wasn't a brain challenger, not by a long shot, but you know what you are getting into with \"Gods of Egypt\".\n\nWhile we are on the CGI and special effects, then I must admit that it was the selling point for me, because I was blown away how they had managed to bring ancient Egypt and their ancient Pantheon to life with today's CGI and special effects.\n\nAs for the cast, well, they could have opted for someone a bit more thespian, considering the talents of both Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gerard Butler. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that they did it poorly. Actually far from it, but they are more of a physical kind of acting in terms of action, more than they are set in ways of deeper character portraying through acting.\n\nThere is a lot of action throughout the entire movie, and you are constantly being bombarded with visual effects, to the point where it brims on being over-used. But it worked for me.\n\nIf you enjoy a good fantasy movie with roots in actual ancient history, then \"Gods of Egypt\" is definitely worth your time and money. I do think, however, that \"Gods of Egypt\" is the type of movie that you can watch every now and again with some years in between each watching.\n\nI am rating \"Gods of Egypt\" a well-deserved seven out of ten stars. This was good, wholesome entertainment wrapped up in a visually impressive package."

It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet it manages to provide some kind of 'wow' factor.\n\nThe story is pretty straightforward: a god is jealous of king brother and decides to end matters when the king doesn't consider him to be the next heir. Things never get too complicated, but it is interesting to see a 'new' take on such characters. This is probably where the movie is so good. The fascination of how things are shown gives one even more to look forward to as the movie goes on. The CGI looks great most of the times, but sometimes it just looks OK.\n\nWhere the movie does lack is the acting department: the characters don't show enough emotion when they're supposed to, and the jokes aren't too original. Gerard Butler does great job and overshadows the rest in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, a great movie to watch in the theaters and to have a good time."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's \"fun but stupid\". There's \"so bad it's good\". And then there's \"Gods of Egypt\", a movie so bad it makes the rest of your life better in comparison. Here's an example, the opening scene is a thief stealing a dress from a shop. The shop keep notices, the thief runs, guards chase after... immediate cut he's talking to a girl now.\n\nYep, no fun chase scene, even if that's screen writing, like, 85, remedial screen writing for a 9 year old. Why was that scene there? Why does this movie exist? How did it ever get made despite having a huge budget? These are questions that, in a better movie, might cause you despair. It might ask you to question why you're stuck in a dead end job while the people involved with the movie in question got paid millions to push out this torrid drivel.\n\nBut there's good news, God's of Egypt is even worse than that! None of the actors give a sh*t about anything they're doing, and since they only did one take each time why should they! The editor did the whole movie in a single pass while blindfolded. The writers came up with a pitch that appealed to a bunch of idiotic producers in Hollywood and then farmed out the actual screenplay to high school English students that got all got Ds.\n\nPlot? The white god who's a giant Horus is going to become King of Egypt, even though he's a god, but he's king also cause shut up. Then Gerard Butler shows up, stabs the current king, and says \"I'm King now\" and everyone but Horus gives up, then he tears Horus's eyes out. You think I'm skipping over parts, or selling the drama short or something, nope. He's just \"hi, stab, I'm king OK? Well OK, that was easy, let's move on to the next part!\n\nGods of Egypt isn't bad, it's not so bad it's good, it's not even worse than that. It's worse than the worst movie you can think of. It's so bad it makes you realize all of life is a random joke. So relax, because if God's of Egypt can actually get made and released that means actually trying in life is for fools and your fate is anything but in your own hands. Success and failure are random and arbitrary, so kick back enjoy the ride!"

They don't go together at all and Gerard's acting is just way over the top. All the actresses in this film are incredibly bland...so it's balancing out as shite on the scale so far.\n\nThen there's the CGI...holy cow is there CGI. I believe this film has more of it than the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy combined. Not joking. I bet there's CGI in every single freaking scene of the movie! It really started to feel like my eyes were going to burn out of my sockets after almost an hour of watching it...and then getting a headache knowing I still had an hour more to sit through.\n\nThe main character is an idiot and is also terribly bland. I think the only *kind of tolerable* character was Horus...even then I knew this movie was doomed. I just sat there tapping my fingers on my seat as the credits rolled by slowly. The movie theater was almost packed yet nobody clapped. Me and an elder woman booed. I wouldn't have been surprised if anybody else would have joined me if they weren't with their girlfriends or boyfriends or 12 year old kids.\n\nDon't go see this movie.

        "review_title": "Entertaining and spectacular despite the whitewash casting",
        "review_detailed_main": "Let's get this out of the way first: most Egyptian gods and the main character should not have been played by Caucasian (white) actors. I tried my very best to get beyond that, but it was jarring throughout and hurt suspension of disbelief. Most of the actors were fine though, especially Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones) playing Horus with sincerity and gravitas, but they simply didn't fit the place and the mythology (especially Osiris and Ra). Gerard Butler (Leonidas from 300) was playing the kind of role he's a natural for, warrior-leader in ancient times, but evil this time. As for the main hero couple - Bek, a blond human thief, and Zaya of the ample cleavage - I'd just say they were mediocre and could have been easily played by many other young actors. I did particularly like the role of the ambiguous goddess Hathor who, as a bonus, also looked more Egyptian than the rest of her pantheon.\n\nSo enough with the casting controversy. Story-wise, it made the mistake of having an older main character narrate, which basically removed any suspense regarding his fate. In an ancient time before history, the Egyptian gods live among humans and rule. The benevolent king Osiris is about to hand over reign of the kingdom to his son Horus. Set, another god, arrives at the coronation, bad stuff happens, and everything is thrown into disarray. Bek, the previously mentioned thief, tries to steal something important (neat traps), loses something precious to him that he wants to regain, and eventually journeys with an exiled god or two. Unfortunately, plot-wise, I felt as if focus groups or someone somewhere ruined parts that could have been more memorable, especially the ending.\n\nThe gods were shown a bit bigger and taller than mortals, and could transform into humanoid animals. It might seem a silly thing, but I liked the size differences, which made them instantly recognizable and more impressive. As for the creature forms, those of Horus and Set looked CGI, but I liked their design anyway. As for the other creatures, be they giant snakes or Anubis, they looked and moved great (with the exception of the scorpions). This movie reminded me of a throwback to the big and good adventure/fantasy movies of the 80s and 90s. It wasn't too complicated, it kept you entertained and looking forward to the next incident or encounter. Weirdly, even though \"Gods of Egypt\" sometimes had the nostalgic appeal of a film made in another decade (with modern special effects though) and went through familiar tropes, it also sometimes felt fresh (like the sand magic or the afterlife). It had a few clever touches (like the assistants of the god of wisdom) but also a few dumb elements (\"good\" idea to leave your companion alone with a bad guy on a platform elevator going up while you decide to climb the side of the pyramid instead).\n\nMost locations looked very good (for example the \"ship\" in the sky) and were quite varied. Visually, I found it marvellous, and I didn't mind or notice too much the computer roots . I loved the costumes and armors, certainly not historically-accurate, and the gods looked more than mortal without going over the top (despite the terrible casting). With a couple of exceptions (the chariot escape), I found the action scenes above average, even exciting. The fights were well choreographed, but I liked more when the fights involved the human actors somewhat, instead of just the metallic creature forms that kinda took you out of the setting.\n\nIn that kind of movie, I want to vicariously travel to a different land, experience some wonder, and forget the real modern world for a little while. I also want to meet interesting, unconventional characters and be kept involved in the adventures even if they're not the most original. It especially needs some heart and sincerity to make the proceedings relatable, even if it's awkwardly done. For me, Gods of Egypt mostly succeeded in doing those things making it a decent entry in the maligned fantasy-adventure genre. It shouldn't be judged as a pure comedy, drama, action or romance film. I quite expect this movie to be savaged by the critics for casting (mostly), camp, lack of originality, CGI and what have you, but you know what? Overall, I had fun watching it and I would watch it again at home some time in the future. Not a lot of competition, but one of the better recent mythology-inspired films.\n\nRating: 7.5 out of 10."

Meanwhile, elephants and slaves are slowly dragging giant stone blocks through the sand. HUH??\n\nThe effects are generally good, and the fact that the gods are all around 10 feet tall helps sell them as inherently different (and explains their tendency towards smug condescension).\n\nI give this six stars for entertainment value, but I'm lopping off one star for having to switch my brain off to fully enjoy it.

Even before the release there seemed to be problems regarding the whitewashing of the cast, as there are isn't one Egyptian actor involved in the production.\n\nThe trailers also did not inspire confidence, with some decidedly ropey CGI used. I was hoping that this was just because of the trailers early release. Unfortunately, although a lot of the CGI is excellent, there are still parts of the film that look like a game. This is a minor nit pick though, as it is a fantasy and you can't really expect realism with this type of film.\n\nOf the leads, Gerard Butler seems to be having the most fun as the villain Set. From his scenery chewing intro, where he rips out his nephew's eyes, he doesn't let up. He also uses his own accent in this. Unfortunately he cant seem to decide what his accent is anymore. Still, he is still great in the role.\n\nNikolaj Coaster-Waldau, as the hero of the story Horus, is in great shape and plays the hero well, although the character can be a bit bland compared to Butler.\n\nBrenton Thwaites is decent enough but cant live up to the two leads. The supporting cast is filled with greats like Bryan Brown, Geoffrey Rush and Rufus Sewell (re-teaming with Proyas for the first time since 1998's Dark City), but are pretty much wasted in minor roles. Elodie Yung gets a bit more to do than the other cast members and Chadwick Boseman doesn't embarrass himself too much.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, some of the CGI looks more like a video game, but kind off adds to the overall look of the film. I like the fact that Director Proyas seems to do his own thing here, and doesn't give his fantasy film the expected drab, dark look that so many fantasy's these days have. I like it when a Director doesn't go with the expected. Perhaps that is why the film is failing so much at the box office."

The movie is a kind of fun adventure- it's not perfect, and its very stereotypical in terms of story and character development, but the visuals, the character looks and costumes are actually pretty cool and leave you wanting more.\n\nI'm actually really tempted to see this movie again.\n\nWhile the 'white casting' at times was ridiculous- the acting is pretty good and helps you get over that fact. (for instance Geoffry rush looks more like he's dressing up as a Chinese person with a long kong fu braid than an Egyptian- but he does a really good job, so you kind of chuckle/ roll your eyes the first second you see him, but 2 seconds later his acting kicks in and you like him.)\n\nSo to sum it all- if you're looking for a cute light film with great effects- go see this one."

It is a big surprise, that it looks just made in studio like movie. It just doesn't feel natural at all. Maybe it is a director's way to see the agent Egypt, but to me it felt almost like B-movie set. Story is quite predictable and not even script satisfy me. Movie rely on too much for digital effects and scenery. As it is a digital rumble effect movie it is not too bad, but I myself like too much of agent Egypt mythology to enjoy this movie story. If you enjoy CGI-effects and don't bother so much of the story you may find this movie entertaining. It remind me of Clash of Titans movies. Lot of action but not much content. You can watch this quite easily, but it wont offer you much of it's story line. It is one of those \"don't bring your brains with\" like movie. And of course it is a must to see from big screen. From television it has nothing to offer."

        "review_detailed_main": "The main news about this movie prior to its release was how no Egyptians were cast even though the story is about Egypt and its inhabitants. Now that it has finally been released the major talk should be about how silly it is. 140 million dollars was spent to make this? The poor and homeless in Egypt should have been given this money instead. Australian backers played a pivotal role in the funding of this production. It now seems like the stellar year of Aussie films in 2015 has been diminished by this so-called God hovering over its success. 'Gods' in name only, definitely not through merit.\n\nSet (Gerard Butler) is a God of Egypt who has ambitions to reign supreme. He kills his brother Osiris (Bryan Brown) in order to ascend the throne. His nephew, Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) seeks revenge for his father's death but cannot possibly do so without his eyes, which have been taken away by his uncle. Mortal hero Bek (Brenton Thwaites) finds one of Horus' eyes that has special powers, locates his whereabouts and teams up with him. Their mission: kill Set and restore order to the once peaceful and prosperous empire.\n\nThe acting is simply atrocious. There's Gerard Butler's Scottish accent which seems so out of this place in this movie. There's Chadwick Boseman who camps it up as Thoth, the god of writing and knowledge. There's Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau who delivers a wooden performance. There's Geoffrey Rush as Ra, the father of Horus and Set. He must have been in it for the money for this is one of his worst ever performances. At least Brenton Thwaites provides a hero that the audience can cheer for with his energetic and kinetic portrayal of the mortal who wins the trust of Horus.\n\nEven if the movie is aimed at generating escapism qualities, it doesn't excuse the awful dialogue. Here is an example of the dialogue that will make you wince: While Set is battling Bek, he asks him where Horus' eye is. Bek replies with, \"Up your arse along with the goats!\" There should have been some script editing in the development process.\n\nThere are several exciting action scenes which try to cover up the deficiencies in script and acting. It's only when the actors start talking again that you realise you have to endure further pain. The action sequences keep you awake, unfortunately the acting and dialogue do not.\n\nWhere has the 140 million dollars gone? Most of it has probably gone to the visual effects which is predominantly CGI. It's not even state of the art CGI with some scenes looking decidedly fake. There is one scene involving a waterfall which is obvious to everyone that it has been generated by computer.\n\nAlex Proyas is the director and he has made a few decent films like \"I Robot\", \"Dark City\" and \"The Crow\". \"Gods of Egypt\" isn't one of them. He has gone out of control with trying to make this a visual spectacle by bombarding his audience with as many CGI effects as possible. Movies intended for the big screen still need to have a reasonable script and half-decent acting performances!"

Perhaps make the dialogue even funnier, that would have worked too. The acting was pretty OK, same with CGI. The ways they tried to keep the difference in size is just laughable, but what can you do. I'd say it shows the mythology in a way that some people might actually retain at least a bit from. As opposed to what they teach in school - does anyone even remember that? I sure don't."

Sometimes easy films are just what we need.\n\nAccording to the IMDB Trivia section IT IS based on an Egyptian Legend/Myth/Religion? But I prefer to look at it as a complete work of fantasy fiction, because it would just be too complicated to try to understand all of the Gods and their relationships and how true to the original papyrus texts this story might be. It's also because I don't think you can even vaguely think of this as anything but fiction, so extreme and fanciful is it that you would never believe it.\n\nI actually think it might have worked better as a cartoon/CGI film. Their voices all worked fine for that, but came across as a bit corny otherwise. In fact it was a bit hammy too and quite a lot of cheesey as well. You could have made a picnic out of it all with the Beefy men on top of the rest (I wish Gerrard Butler was on top of me).\n\nIt's difficult to distinguish Nikolaj from his role as Jaime Lannister in 'Game Of Thrones' and in actual fact I think he would have worked better if he'd swapped roles with Gerrard and vice-versa. They are both very handsome fellas, so I don't mind too much, but the guy playing Bek was just annoyingly bad. I'm assuming that it was a directors choice to go down the route of Cheese and Ham, because I've definitely seen these actors do better. The star in the mix was Geoffrey Rush, who, although a very extreme character, managed to keep his Ra acceptable for any film.\n\nI also didn't know what was wrong with Chadwick Bozeman's voice, it was a bit all over the place. It was almost as frustrating as Gerrard's eye liner and hair dye job.\n\nIn the right studio, producer and directors hands and even with the same cast, I think that this story could actually be made very well, but it would have to be a proper epic with the time and budget to match or a Netflix series to rival 'Thrones'."

So yes, they pick and choose what parts they want in a (very) westernized tale...\n\nAnd I did think that they did a good job. For the ancient Egyptians, the gods did walk amongst the living. The king was supposed to be the living embodiment of the god Horus. So the storyline is not really that far-fetched.\n\nAs for the acting, most of the cast is pretty good. Horus was a slight let down. It's as if they wanted Aaron Eckhart, but had to make do with this guy. (Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart are in London Has Fallen). And the girl playing Zaya. I guess that was her character? to be \"sweet\" and steadfast in loyalty, both to her husband and to her God. Still, every time she came on screen, I thought the ancient Egyptians had great push-up technology. Seth and Hathor were great (Gerard Butler and Elodie Yung). Geoffrey Rush does justice to his role (as always). Brenton Thwaite (the mortal/the thief) wasn't so bad either.\n\nIt's a sweet story overall. And entertaining! Lovely CGI on top of it. I enjoyed it :). I wouldn't recommend it to scholars of ancient Egypt. But even they would appreciate the nod to mythological characters in this fiction piece :D.\n\nDisclaimer: I left pretty much the exact same review on rottentomatoes. I don't normally leave reviews, but this movie is getting a bad rep, and unfairly! It happens to be one of the better movies out there right now."

Thankfully this movie gets into his own groove and ends up to be an overblown adventure movie meets Transformers meets Attack of the Titans. It's completely ridiculous, but if you roll with it, it is actually entertaining and never boring. Although it's not on par with Starship Troopers when it comes to awareness and stylizing. Here you have one of those rare B-movies on a blockbuster budget. It's like a Saturday Morning cartoon brought to life.\n\nThe characters are servicable and there are some truly epic imagery here and there. You can tell it was one of those movies where the studio wanted to make a quick buck and post-convert the 3D effects on it. The effects intended for the 3D glasses are terrible and obviously an afterthought with the usual 'in your face' gimmicks rather than using it for depth like Avatar or GuyRitchie's King Arthur. The Cgi effects look kinda fake with all the shiny armours but at the same time it works pretty well with the trashy material. To be fair a few action scenes are well-shot and there's a great sense of scale to certain effects at the final showdown.\n\nThe only thing that is a bit disappointing is the villain Seth payed by Gerard Butler. He was better in 300 when it came to chewing the scenery. Here he gives a truly one-dimensional performance with no panache. On the other hand, Chadwick Boseman and Geoffrey Rush nail the tone perfectly. Anyone who wants to see a light-hearted and intentionally dumb action movie that seems like two children playing with toy action figurinrs, should give this a chance.\n\n7/10."

Firstly: the cast itself is a disaster: blonde blue eyes gods of the country that is not just a part of Africa, but racially speaking was also populated by Africans (some Theories even suggest Egyptians are the ancestors of all Africans). moreover the horrible costumes and acting of the small characters: seriously do the idiots who made this movie thought Egyptians since the dawn of time used to wear these absurd clothes? the decor is horrible and the camera is trying to hide it sometimes and some other times that stupid director thinks his computer generated decorations are worth it so he shows it in details. the plot is so stupid and ridiculous it almost is annoying. it is mostly so boring that you would regret watching the movie, with all the irrational twists, the scenes which emerge with no introduction and characters coming and going with no actual purpose but cheap action. i could go on and on with the cheesy lines, the stupid acting by every main character but again i must assert the main point: this movie is so offensive to me as an Egyptian that i was really furious when it ended. it is one thing to use our history stupidly but it is totally another level of insult to maim and tarnish it. the scene that insulted me the most is the one coming after one hour and 28 minutes: where the dead are stepping to be judged by disfigured and horrendous mommies: the scene shows that you offer something in a scale which is the measure upon which you are evaluated,if your offering is rich and valuable your you pass to eternal life in what seems to be heaven,while poor people with poor offerings are sucked into hell literally. well. here is why this so insulting: one of the very dear and honorable things we Egyptians remember of our ancestors is the moral and highly sophisticated way they dealt with life and afterlife. Old Egyptians thought Auzir - the God of Life awaits the dead in the afterlife with a scale of two parts: in one lies the Feather of Justices - the true measure of Honor and truth, and the other scale is for the heart of dead man or woman - the heart holds your deeds and thoughts. and the measure is easy: if your heart is filled with good deeds and intentions you have tipped the scale in your favor and you pass to live in the paradise of afterlife with no worries or burdens. if not, your hear t is thrown to a beast that awaits near the scale to eat it and you literally Die Forever in hell. the Director and the two writers did not just make a horrible movie but a very insulting one as well. shortly: the movie is below Zero, if IMDb would allow it the movie should be labelled culturally insulting and Racially offensive."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't expect to like the film, but I did, sort of. The actors are decent, the story a bit silly, but fun, the CGI is way over the top, but sometimes in a good way, sometimes it feels like watching a game cinematic from the early 2000's.\n\nIn this story where someone needs to tell Set this is definitely not Sparta, Horus not to loose any more body parts and Osiris that sadism is not everything in life, a young guy that looks and acts like Aladin, but is not, uses the power of love to rival the gods themselves - making the goddess of love kind of superfluous there. And since that was the only female actress that is worth mentioning, this is movie about guys with naked chests and big swords that has received positive reviews mainly from the female audience, but keeps some dazzling CGI fights and use of technical know how to keep guys interested.\n\nOne can go past the bad CGI easily - I mean, who has seen a god recently? it's not like you can say \"heeey, gods don't actually look like that!\" One can ignore the ridiculous cardboard motivations of the characters - they're from Egypt, how smart can they be, even if they are all mostly white? One can also go past the story, because face it: it's a fairy tale and that's how they are. However, once you have finished the getting past part, you realize the movie is over and not much else has happened except bits that you purposely ignored. Fun though."

        "review_detailed_main": "An action-adventure movie inspired by the classic mythology of Egypt, that is enjoyable and fun at times, but not very good in general. The extraordinarily silly effects that look expensive, yet so fake, and the boring and also confusing narrative, make \"Gods of Egypt\" a movie that you will forget very soon. In all this, also add the uninteresting performances and characters. Gerard Butler (who I really like by the way), in this film, is flexing his muscles and growling like he did in \"300\". He is nothing but boring, but he is still the only reason for someone to watch the movie. Alex Proyas \"Gods of Egypt\" feels like a bad video game that I don't want to play again."

        "review_detailed_main": "(RATING: \u2606\u2606)\n\nTHIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\n\"And what god should I be...the God of Stupidity?\" asks our hero in the loud and artless Gods of Egypt. And the answer is a resounding yes! A dumb glitzy fantasy that is closer to Vegas' Luxor than any Egyptian wonder. Adequately directed by Alex Proyas, with a feeble script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (yet another yes), the movie is overproduced and makes no sense at all. It resembles a video game rather than a film, with one obstacle after the next and its CGI is mostly cheap looking and schlocky.\n\nThe story (?) involves in-fighting among the gods as a common thief tries to save his Jasmine princess. The gods are titans amid puny mortal Munchkins, as they raise havoc on the masses. There's lots of action, sci-fi creatures. and the men's pecs compete largely with the women's cleavage to gain fanboys' attention. But the movie is unintentionally laughable from the start and never can be remotely believable, due to the many outlandish sets and glittery skimpy costumes, not to mention the terrible dialog. (A majority of the film's budget must have been spent on gold lam\u00e9.)\n\nNIkolaj Coaster-Waldau, whose character lost his hand in the superior Game of Thrones, loses two eyes in this mess and most of his dignity within the first half hour. Gerald Butler plays his mean uncle and he grimaces his way through the film. Newcomer Brenton Thwaites lets his long flowing hair do the acting and should omit this sword and sandal wallow from his resume. \u00c9lodie Yung wears her showgirl outfits like the goddess she is. Rufus Sewell and Geoffrey Rush collected a paycheck.\n\nGods of Egypt may successfully appeal to an eight-year-old mentality. It's harmless and brainless. But the movie is not campy enough for real fun or serious enough for rousing entertainment. The filmmakers should have read the hieroglyphics on the wall. Bad.

It's a falsely advertised love story that looks like it has a peanut butter sandwich budget but actually has the budget of a drug dealers house ($140 Million). Let's be honest the only reason I saw this movie is because the poll on twitter one. In the end, it's a forgettable mess that was unfunny repetitive and painful. I'm giving this one a 2/10 or a F."

They did not even try to make the actors look remotely Egyptian-ish, it reminded me of the time John Wayne played Jenkis Khan. I found the movie utterly ridiculous and boring, just another excuse for Hollywood to flex their CGI muscles."

        "review_detailed_main": "I seriously have a hard time understanding how this movie got made. There is hardly anything good about it. I really don't get why I saw what I saw, nothing in the movie made sense. I didn't give it a 1/10 because I liked some things: The girl Zaya is so beautiful, every time she's on screen I can enjoy her. The guy who plays Jamie Lannister in Game of Thrones was likable. That's pretty much everything what is good in this movie. I don't even know where to start with listing the bad things. I will start with one thing that bothered me straight away: the showing of the title. When they showed the title after the opening logos they threw a really loud music bit at it and I knew that was going to be an issue (I saw it in IMAX so everything was enhanced). Throughout the entire movie it tries to be so loud that I thought I was going deaf. Some sound effects and music bits are so incredibly loud that you can't understand what is going on. I also thought I was going blind at some points, the light switches on and off so much at points that it really is blinding. Also I was getting a headache, the camera-work is so dumb that it made me dizzy.\n\nOf course the entire movie is made in the computer, the title of the movie should be CGI of Egypt because none of it looked like Egypt. You can clearly see that everything is shot in a green screen studio because the lights on the actors never match any lights in the background. Also every background looks fake and 2-dimensional. Even the CGI on the gods is so noticeably bad, I laughed every time they changed. I laughed so hard at the changes because it looked absolutely terrible it was really funny.\n\nIf you look at more basic movie terms like pacing, tone, cinematography, writing, directing, it fails at every single thing. The writing was so bad, you can tell that nobody thought there was actual \"clever writing\". The directing is hardly there, nobody delivers a good line and nothing made sense. The tone changes so drastically throughout the movie, every scene is vastly different from the previous one that you can't focus on what actually is going on. I think I tuned out completely after 15-20 minutes. The pacing also shifts drastically, I never had a clue how much time actually passed because it switches so much it's hard to understand. And the cinematographer was either drunk or high, the look of the movie even changes every 5 minutes that it's really hard to get what they were going for.\n\nSo with all that said, I can say this is absolutely terrible but when you can rent the DVD you should see it because it's so bad, you'll laugh a lot. I had a great time watching the movie because my critical brain switched on and laughed at every incredibly bad thing. 2/10 because I had fun watching it and it had very few redeeming bits in there."

There are no words available in the known Universe that can describe the disaster that the \"movie\" Gods of Egypt represents (it doesn't even deserve the label movie). How can anything this bad be made on a budget of $140,000,000? The script is terrible, the sets are terrible, the acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, and worse, even the special effects are terrible. It's an utter disgrace to mythology, the culture of Egypt, the people of Egypt, and even the Gods themselves are turning in their graves (or should it be tombs). What a load of absolute $#@%^ - would love to start swearing right now. Yeah, the movie comes straight from Nickelodeon (the bad part, those on the soon-to-be-sacked list) and has a target audience either aged between 5 and 10, or with an intelligence quotient close to that of being _____. You can fill in the blank spot yourself. Deep sigh\u0085 this is the 3rd movie in a row that received the lowest possible score. Where is this all going?

I went into the movie not having read any of the critics reviews, and when I came home afterwards, I was surprised to see so many critics have bashed the movie. The only problem that they can cite is that this movie had too many white actors in it! This was never a problem in the past, The Clash of the Titans and the Immortals were similar mythological movies from just a few years ago, also with a mainly white cast and it was never even mentioned for them. Since this movie came out so soon after the 2016 Oscar awards ceremony, which was criticized heavily for not having any black actors or black-based films nominated, maybe this movie got unfairly caught up in the fad of the times?\n\nAnyways, there's a lot to love about this film. Watch the depiction of the flat Earth, with a Sun being dragged around by Ra's chariot. They could've gone with a modern scientific depiction of the round Earth and the Sun, but this is mythology, they wanted to stay true to the mythological depiction, and so they did depict it like mythology has it. But their depiction is a lot of fun, it is sort of a retro-modern depiction.\n\nI never felt the movie dragged at any point."

        "review_title": "Loud, dumb and silly, this overstuffed god-versus-mortals epic still delivers two hours of solid swashbuckling adventure, romance, epic CG battles and sheer visual grandeur",
        "review_detailed_main": "History is replete with the follies of Hollywood's gods-versus- mortals epics that have since faded into ignominy or is remembered with scorn, so much so that it is almost instinct to wonder which 'Gods of Egypt' will turn out to be, especially given its pre- release criticism about its literally white-washed cast. Yet Alex Proyas' first film in seven years deserves much better regard than the toxic buzz it has been getting \u2013 not only is it one of the more imaginative mythological adventures in recent years, it is also one of the most entertaining by simply not taking itself too seriously.\n\nImagining an ancient Egypt that never existed where gods and men live together, this effects-driven CGI extravaganza pits the benevolent if slightly flirtatious lord of the air Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) against the nefarious desert god Set (Gerard Butler) who usurps his throne of Egypt on the day of his coronation. As with most such power tussles, there is a familial dimension \u2013 Set is in fact Horus' uncle, who isn't just resentful that his father, the sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush), had given rule of Egypt to Horus but also seemingly banished him to a bleak and barren wasteland. So Set kills his brother Osiris (Bryan Brown) and blinds Horus, exiling him to some faraway dune to wallow in self-pity and eternal misery.\n\nThat opening sets the stage for Horus to embark on a journey of self-discovery on his way to reclaiming the throne, with immeasurable help from a mortal thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites). It is Bek who returns Horus one of his eyes after breaking into Set's seemingly impenetrable vault, who also subsequently accompanies Horus on his quest in exchange for passage for his one true love Zaya (Courtney Eaton) back from the underworld. And so begins a series of razzle-dazzle action sequences, including a thrilling chase by two evil goddesses Astarte (Abbey Lee) and Anat (Yaya Deng) atop two giant fire-breathing serpents and a near-death escape from Set with some help from Elodie Yung's goddess of love Hathor inside the chamber of a towering Sphinx.\n\nOh yes, there is no such thing as subtlety here. The chariots are pulled by giant scarab beetles. Sedan chairs take flight with hundreds of birds. Gods transform from their 11, 12 feet in height human form into glistening animal-headed robots and bleed liquid gold. Ra lives in a spaceship hovering above the Earth, bursts into flames at will and spends each night doing battle with the Lovecraftian ancient Apep by shooting fireballs from his spear. Indeed, as far as being gaudy is concerned, Proyas isn't shy at all about flaunting every single dollar of his significant US$140 million budget that went into creating the sheer visual spectacle (or excess, depending on how you see it) that you'll get to see on the big screen.\n\nYet its silliness certainly isn't lost on Proyas; indeed, along with his writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ('Dracula Untold' and 'The Last Witch Hunter'), Proyas gleefully embraces its absurdity with campy humour. For one, Bek is never too far from an amusing quib usually directed at Bek. For another, the god of wisdom Thoth (Chadwick Boseman) is a ball being haughty and all full of himself \u2013 and we mean that literally in the context of the hundreds of copies he has made of himself to serve him in his lair. It never does take itself too seriously, nor too flippantly to be completely dismissed, and the levity is a nice counter-balance to the elaborate kitsch on display.\n\nCredit that too to Coaster-Waldau and Thwaites, who sustain a lively bickersome chemistry as a pair of mismatched buddies forced to work together rather than apart. For the ladies, Coaster-Waldau also oozes sheer masculine charm, while Butler often chews up the scenery with pomp and swagger. Both actors are no stranger to the swords-and- sandals genre \u2013 the former from the HBO series 'Game of Thrones' and the latter of course from '300' \u2013 and have no trouble convincing us of their place in Egyptian mythology. Rush also lends his trademark eccentricity to Ra, looking just at home on his solar barque.\n\nAnd so like last summer's 'Hercules', 'Gods of Egypt' rises above the ashes by delivering two hours of solid sword-and-sorcery entertainment with dashes of self-aware humour. There is swashbuckling adventure, romance, epic battles and plenty of visual grandeur to meet its mad ambition with lunatic conviction. That it is overstuffed is part of its excessive nature, but you can't argue that it doesn't fill you with a sense of awe and captivate and delight you more than you expect it to."

No bad language no sex and nudity something decent for a change.the colors of the costumes were magnificent .Music lite and not over the top . The way the movie spoke about gods we all waited for DONALD TRUMP to make a cameo.\n\nWe shall see whatever the out come it shall be ENTERTAINMENT for us all .

        "review_detailed_main": "The entire film industry has always had a fascination with sword- and-sandal action adventures. They're like the Velvet Underground of movie subgenres, they may never be popular in their own time but they inspire countless film professionals with their bountiful style, unorthodox special effects and simple but effective story- lines. Where would the world of special effects be without Ray Harryhausen's work on Jason and the Argonauts (1963)? Would we know the name Sergio Leone without the famed director first cutting his teeth on the peplum film The Last Days of Pompeii (1959)? I dare not put the ghastly Gods of Egypt in the same category as Conan the Barbarian (1982) or Clash of the Titans (1981) but I do put it a head above the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans.\n\nMortal thief Bek (Thwaites) and his love Zaya (Eaton) are trusted into a web of palace intrigue after benevolent God Osiris (Brown) is struck down by his brother Set (Butler) in a public display of brutality meant to keep mortals and other Gods in line. Osiris's son Horus (Coster-Waldau) attempts to take vengeance but his magical eyes are plucked from his skull and he's banished. Bek steals one of the eyes from Set's newly constructed vault thus turning the wheels of the plot, ultimately resulting in a rematch between Horus and his uncle.\n\nAs garish as the sets are and as conspicuous as the computer generated effects may be, the movie is not without its inner-logic which works if you forgive some minor missteps. The characters are weak and uninspired but they all have perfectly respectable character arcs. What's more the precious moments of mirth are genuine in a cheesy Flash Gordon (1980) kind of way. The first act borders on self-parody and the last act is a-clutter with mindless action yet in-spite of all this, I think I caught myself actually enjoying the movie a few times. Yes, believe it or not Gods of Egypt is not entirely irredeemable.\n\nDon't get me wrong; it's goofy, it's dumb and it's loud; it's whitewashed to the point of cultural insensitivity, and it surrenders to some occasionally unsettling themes but none of these factors are important when faced with the film's endgame; it's here to entertain, that's it. With a bar set that low, it's easy to find a lot to like. Those with a thirst for blood and sinew will be glad to know that despite a PG-13 rating, the film showcases a lot of gleeful violence and action. They get away with it only because the blood of the Gods is gold not red. I personally enjoyed the application of certain Ancient Egyptian mythology, especially moments involving Ra (Rush), the granddaddy of the Gods, pulling the sun across the sky in his celestial catamaran.\n\nGods of Egypt cannot compare to the middling mythological epics of Italy circa 1950's. Heck, it can even compare to 300 (2006) which provided the template for so many of these goof-ball celebrations of male bravado. Director Alex Proyas knows the script for Gods of Egypt isn't exactly Shakespeare and maximizes all the points of entertainment while still telling a cogent tale. The results are crude but effective."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"If I were even to try to explain, your brain would liquefy and pour out your ears.\" - actual line from \"Gods of Egypt.\"\n\nSuch a quote is so appropriate for a film like \"Gods of Egypt,\" a two-hour long raucous ride through glorious production design and mediocre everything else. Rarely do I find myself sitting in an action film silently begging it to transition from scenes involving never-ending dialog and flat character relations to something more lively and harrowing. Fortunately, \"Gods of Egypt\" packs a wallop in its plethora of action sequences, but in order to get to the visual goods, you must sit through, in total, over an hour of monotone dialog spouted from beefy, hulking Gods that wears on the mind so quickly you wish they would just morph into chrome-coated creatures again and begin dueling until something meaningful happened.\n\nConsistent readers of my work will take note that I usually do not possess such an attitude when watching action films. Normally, I like my action/epic films with a lot of characterization and dialog; even if it's poorly conceived or lackluster dialog, I usually acknowledge the film's ambition to try and turn Gods and mythical heroes into characters modern audiences can sympathize with. With \"Gods of Egypt,\" my admiration began to breed contempt after I saw what the film's visuals were capable of; after that, sitting through endless, rote dialog by characters who are just mythical cut-outs of Egyptian Gods, was just not what I was in the mood to do. The visual effects in \"Gods of Egypt\" are extraordinary; a commendable mix of modern sleekness with the pulpy aesthetic of a medium-budget epic, the production design in this film is truly something to behold.\n\nThe film is centered around a mortal named Bek (Brenton Thwaites), who aligns with the Egyptian God Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) following the death of his lover Zaya (Courtney Eaton) in efforts to dethrone Set (Gerard Butler), the God of Darkness who has just seized the empire. What entails is a brutal struggle for Bek and Horus to get through numerous different traps and roadblocks in order to get to Set to reclaim the throne of the Egyptian empire and try to resurrect Zaya.\n\nI spend so little time introducing the plot for two reasons: one, if you're going to see \"Gods of Egypt,\" the plot is probably the last thing on your mind, and two, it's convoluted thanks to the overabundance of characters and the lack of clarity in the respective chronology and period when this is occurring. The latter issues make it difficult to sink into \"Gods of Egypt\" and become invested in it on a personal level. This is precisely what led to me simply wishing for more action sequences than anything in the way of character dialog.\n\nThe characters here are so archetypal and flat they might as well be hieroglyphics. They are fearless, immortal (even the mortals, it seems) beings that never seem to be in any real danger regardless of the circumstances, and they're played and written in a manner that doesn't engage. Thwaites and Coaster-Waldau are not very engaging screen presences at all, and for the umpteenth time, neither is Gerard Butler, who keeps getting cast in these films as if he truly bring some layeredness to the table. I'm convinced that all three of these actors, with the appropriate script, could be extremely convincing performers in a film, but once again, especially in Butler's case, Hollywood seems to have a lack of confidence and conviction in them as performers and throws them into a film with a low-rent script with a high-stakes pricetag.\n\nTo be fair, the high-stakes pricetag results in some of the most visually eye-catching effects we're likely to see this year. The entire film is gorgeously photographed, largely thanks to the sun-soaked cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr., who has helped shoot everything from the \"Lara Croft\" films to \"Kangaroo Jack.\" Menzies Jr. and director Alex Proyas direct this film with a series of sweeping shots and nicely paced sequences of peril, my personal favorite being a scene where both Bek and Horus are challenged with outrunning two gigantic, fire-breathing serpents on a maze-like floor. And let's not forget the suspenseful sequence involving Bek trying to obtain a glowing gem on heavily booby-trapped floors, which accentuates everything one has come to love about modern action filmmaking. However, as stated before, these scenes only come interjected between the incessant amount of droning dialog we have to endure over the course of a terribly long-wined two hours.\n\nThe epitome of irony is \"Gods of Egypt\" opening on the same weekend as the 88th Academy Awards premiering on TV, which is being criticized for the second year in a row now for a lack of diversity, and the film featuring a cast largely comprised of Australian performers. Not to mention, the country of Australian apparently gave the film a 46% tax break if it shot on-location in Australia, which continues to add to the question; was this film made by the people who have their names on the credits or simply made by the circumstances that keenly fell into place for the filmmaking process (no-name actors in the biggest roles resulting in lower pay for talent, tax writeoffs, an ethnically challenged cast, etc)?"

I am not politically upset by whitewashing. I just think it damages the quality of the film. Even though the setting is heavily stylized and barely historical, the single element of the movie not reliant upon Egyptian motifs is the ethnicity of the leads, and it just feels like a cynical movie executive choice that is difficult to ignore.\n\nJust imagine a movie about Norse mythology where almost all of the actors are black or Asian. It wouldn't be politically significant. It just wouldn't feel right, and that's the weird out-of-place feeling we get while watching Gods of Egypt.\n\nAs for the CGI and story, I thought both were perfectly adequate. The movie reminds me of Stephen Sommers' Mummy and Van Helsing series, and it's just the kind of fantasy/sci-fi movie we haven't seen very often since Marvel and DC have pretty much taken over that niche with comic movies. Gods of Egypt is old fashioned adventure movie, and that simply does not appeal to everyone these days.\n\nI gave it a 7 because I found it to be entertaining and interesting (I love mythology), but I deducted 1.5 points for the inauthentic casting, and I deducted another 1.5 points because I prefer my historical / fantasy media to be R-rated in the tradition of 300 and Spartacus, and Gods of Egypt definitely plays it too safe in the sex and violence department."

Lots of well-known actors, but I think they could have used a better script to tell the story... which ultimately is the power struggle between two gods Horus and Set to rule the kingdom of Egypt...which a mere mortal has to teach Horus how to do so.\n\nAs a woman I just want to say that the actress who plays Zaya is beautiful enough that it doesn't have to be all about her chest.

It is in my opinion a worthy buy when it comes out on Blu-Ray. I hope that if they do ever get a green light they fix a few things but in general keep the same flow as they had in this film. I wouldn't mind seeing some of those characters return. Anyways I love Egyptian Mythology and even though this was not something you'd want to base your term paper on. It was still something to eat some popcorn invite a chick over and have a nice evening while watching a action/love story. I may seem to be all over the place but that is because I just finished watching it myself. I wasn't disappointed in the film. Nor did I care that most of the main actors were \"White\". Personally if you look back in the history of acting it really didn't matter the color or sex as most actors who even played women were men dressed up. So I don't hop on this senseless PC race train. I just watch for the story or the plain entertainment of the film. So I say bring on another one. Or write some cheap novels based off the screen play I'd read it."

It also has a pretty good ending and story structure.\n\nWhat led to so many critics? There are several reasons to that. 1. It is silly. Not all actors did a great job on their role. Many characters don't seem to be emotionally affected during intense scenes. For example, at a scene were the main character's girl friend died. He seemed sad at first, and seemed to fully recover 30 seconds later... It is just too dramatic for an action movie like this. There were some scenes, where they are trying to be funny; however, it backfires by making it more silly\n\n2. Bad scripts. The wording and the things said in this movie are weird. It just seems weird that in Egypt there is a silly man talking with British accent. The way they talk are too modern. It shows no Egypt culture at all. For example, in one scene; they used the term \"pirates\" & \"ions\". Those things didn't even exist back then. There are many more modern term used such as lettuce. It seems to that the characters are 21st century people with costumes on.\n\n3. Bad character/costume choosing. Many actors did not fit well in the movie. Almost 90% of the gods in this movie are white people. No racism here! But they are suppose to be Egyptians; NOT Americans/British! The costume was also do not fit. Set, the fire god was dressed up like a Spartan in 300. Beck's girl friend was dressed up in a typical modern 21 century dress. The sun god Ra, was dressed up like a Pope. The god of knowledge was dressed in a Chinese style silk clothing. Silk didn't even exist back then! That just makes the movie even more silly!\n\n4. Plot with some flaws. There were some scenes or mircales that just happened without any previous explanations.\n\n5. Bad Special Effects. The special effect wasn't as bad as the movie \"Kingsmen\", but it isn't close to realistic. The special effects did show the 3D background. However, the lighting just seems weird and unreal. To me, it almost seemed like the stones were reflecting light.\n\nThe only actor that did a great job was Gerard Butler. He was like the only serious character. I already expected that, since he did a great job on the movie 300 too. This film had a lot of potential, but was ruined by bad casting. Don't blame the director, he did a great job. If it wasn't for the bad casting, I thought it would have earned at least an 8/10 on IMDb."

There are many excellent actors out there that would have been able to pull off the leads: take Oded Fehr for example; while not from Egypt, he's at least from the same continent and has the look, talent and comedic timing, sorely missing in this movie, to make an excellent Horus (Amr Waked would have made an wicked Set). Pretty much any decent actor would have filled the role of the young hero better than the insipid portrayal by Brenton Thawaites.\n\nVisually this was enjoyable and I wanted to like it.

Discount the historical inaccuracies, it is an enjoyable movie that will have you doing research on Egyptian mythology. I will say this, the humor and one liners will have you thinking, yet it is the eye candy and fights that will keep you anticipating the next scene. Now the story line is as old as time itself, it worked for me because of the way the story line was presented. Give the movie a chance and remember it is just a movie , not a remote viewing of history."

        "review_detailed_main": "So, this is a big budget action and special effects movie about Egyptian gods battling each other to rule the world, right? When you go to a movie like this, you have certain expectations--its not likely to be on the Best Picture short list next Oscar season, and everyone involved with making this movie knew this. But from the very first breathtaking camera shot, you can tell The Gods of Egypt was crafted with enthusiasm and a spirit of fun and unrelenting inhibition. For what this movie was striving for, it is absolutely on target. I saw it on IMax 3-D with my 5th and 7th grade sons, and we loved every minute! Visually dazzling, a soaring musical score, satisfying play-to-the-back-row acting, interesting and somewhat unfamiliar mythological characters, amazing costumes and set pieces--I think this film delivered on all fronts. In a way, Gods of Egypt is more original than many similar films of this genre in that it is not a prequel or sequel or reboot of a franchise, or a comic book adaptation. For instance, while it shares its episodic and implausible plot and style, it is a far more original film than the beloved Episode VII (but without decades of nostalgia and anticipation to paper over its weaknesses). It introduces and creates characters completely new to us in a fascinating and beautiful imaginary world. You will not forget the striking image of the stern but grandfatherly sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush plays it large here!) circling the disk of the world with his space craft/chariot, sun in tow, as he daily battles a hideous chaos monster in defense of all humanity! The judgment of souls in the underworld is another well-presented scene. Horus has a nice character arc. It ends with a worthwhile message from the gods to humanity. More importantly, it literally offers a thrill or two every 5 minutes for its entire duration. And unexpectedly, this film has no mummies whatsoever! I feel the culturally inaccurate casting issue, while perhaps regrettable, brought an undeserved sense of negativity about this film. In any event, these actors appeared to be 100% invested in making this film work, and they got the job done, in my opinion. We recommend that you set this concern aside and enjoy the many pleasures The Gods of Egypt offers--a no-expenses-spared B movie that presents striking and immersive visuals, appealing characters, and a clear understanding of its limitations and aspirations. I seriously don't understand the horrible reviews, and suppose that people who hated this film probably brought a preconceived negative expectation in with their popcorn. Give it a chance, there is much to enjoy in The Gods of Egypt!"

Don't get me wrong the movie isn't Oscar material or breath taking but surely not 5...\n\nThe movie was enjoyable with some good fighting action and nice scenes.Its all about love and that being kind matters(good point if u ask me)\n\nMy complaints are that the story is rushed at the beginning and doesn't give time for the audience to like the lead mortal actor \"bek\" his beloved one zaya.It would make a big difference if the film gave us 10-15 minutes more on just their story of how their love began and where it lead them.\n\nSo we have 1 enjoyable movie that makes 2 hours pass lightly. My score is 7/10 just for the \"poor\" character development of bek and zaya."

The plot was inane, Geoffrey Rush was so out of place it was laughable, almost, but not quite as laughable as the set-up for the sequel at the end...don't worry folks, there won't be a sequel. The CGI was over the top, as was the premise. I don't know what the director was trying to achieve other than launch a franchise, in that he failed and failed miserably. I read the movie cost $140 million to make, they will be very lucky to get back 10% of that, and the 10% includes overseas and home sales."

Above all i would recommend this film if you like God and God like things 6/10."

Now, if you cannot accept the world, if you say, \"hey, Egyptian gods were not like ____, and Horus was ____.\" Then this movie is not for you.\n\nWhat this movie is about is beautiful women, fun fight scenes and lots of action/humour. Think Indian Jones meets Egypt.\n\nOne thing this movie did get flack for was that none of the cast was Egyptian - and this is a very fair criticism, but one for which many more movies than this should feel the heat for. Countless movies with Greek/Middle Eastern cast almost entirely British cast for some reason, yet escape. Why is Butler an Egyptian god? Well, why is he a Greek king? If this movie is taken at all seriously then it falls apart. Sit back, turn the brain off and enjoy a family friendly action adventure."

I remember reading about the Gods when I was very young. My parents brought home books that told stories of Gods and Goddesses. So naturally, I was all hyped up about this movie. I can say with this is one of those guilty pleasures of a movie and I plan on watching again and again. I really enjoyed this movie. I am in hopes that this movie will have a sequel with the same level of intelligence, stamina, 3D and special effects to bring the characters to life on the big screen. I gave it an 8 because there were a few places where the story sort of got off track, but not a deal breaker in my book. If you enjoy fantasy and have a thing for Egypt, then this movie may be right up your alley. Just one question, when is the blu-ray going to be released. Sign me up."

Other than references in a lot of Mummy films Gods Of Egypt is the first I know to incorporate the ancient Egyptian religion and mythology in the plot itself.\n\nWe're going way back here even before the time Charlton Heston liberated the Hebrew children to a time when Egypt was ruled by their deities who walked among them and took human form. They also could take the shape of some ferocious creatures if need be.\n\nSet and Osiris divided up Egypt back in the day, both sons of the sun God Ra. But Set who only had the desert while Osiris had the good real estate of the Nile and it's cities got tired of this arrangement and slew brother Osiris. He also fought and gouged the eyes out of Osiris's son Horus leaving him a blind and pitiable figure and a living reminder of what it means to cross Set who is played by Gerard Butler with Bryan Brown playing Osiris.\n\nWhile the Deities are in their turf war mortal Brenton Thwaites gets caught up in it and his girlfriend Courtney Eaton is killed. He wants to get back at Set and would like to team up with Horus if Horus dare permit himself an alliance with a mere human. But Thwaites has some moves and proves to be an unusual and resourceful ally.\n\nIf you recognize it the elements from Alexander Korda's Thief of Bagdad loom large and clear here. The chemistry and scenes between Nicholas Coaster-Waldau as Horus and Thwaites is very good and the parallel of the two films is unmistakable. Korda only wished he had the computer graphic technology available when he did his spectacle masterpiece.\n\nKorda's film was shot in Arizona both for the vast scenery and for the fact that Great Britain was at war. The great vast interior of Australia has and will be a choice location shooting spot for a lot of films as travel is now easier to that still remote part of the world.\n\nI liked Brenton Thwaites character very much. In a cynical age where romance is not usually portrayed his was one of the best romantic characters I've seen on the big screen in years.\n\nIn fact the very romance of the film made it a winner with me. See this one by all means."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ten minutes into the movie, I was certain I was going to hate it. 12 ft gods walking next to 6 ft humans like Snow White and the 7 dwarfs, and all the shiny golden decoration - it was so ridiculous for a first impression. Half an hour later, I had somehow slipped into a mode of enjoying it. It's a tough start, because everything is so far fetched. Dare to open your mind, then it gets more interesting.\n\nIn the making-of on my Blu-ray disc, someone says it's rather Planet Egypt than Ancient Egypt, this pretty much nails it. Once you accept that you are in a fantasy world, and also accept its miracles and that gods are weird dudes with golden blood, it's possible to get into it. The world of 'Gods of Egypt' requires some kind of innocent child-like imagination, totally unlike historical dramas such as 'Gladiator'. But isn't that somehow suitable for a mythology from a more innocent age? Some scenes were showing an amazing creative vision, for example Ra's barge floating on water - in space! Pulling the sun over the horizon with a chain of steel! Making the audience believe something like this is a damn hard task. This movie is asking the audience for a lot of imagination, because it is so far from reality, but I'd like to watch it again. Last not least, Coster-Waldau and Gerard Butler were great opponents in the lead roles."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gods of Egypt is definitely an entertaining movie, but in all the wrong ways. Almost everything about it is hysterically awful. You will laugh your ass off throughout the movie, not because of the \"jokes\" in the film, but because of the dialogue, the CGI, the acting, etc.\n\nThe setting for the movie was to be it's strongest asset. When was the last time we got to see a movie set in Egyptian mythology? However, the movie does not do it's setting justice and people who like the mythology would be ashamed by how the movie interprets it.\n\nThe dialogue for the movie is horrendous. Every single line is either an exposition line or a horribly unnatural and forced line. The characters are are all so one-dimensional, each seemingly having only one personality trait, and only a very small amount of characters undergo the tiniest bit of development. Because of this, we're given no reason to care about anyone. A good portion of the lines are so hilarious, not because they were funny, but because they're entertaining in the sense that people actually came up with this dialogue and others approved of it.\n\nBeing a huge, high-budget, blockbuster action movie, you would think that it would be at least cool to look at. To be honest, the CGI and special effects are a mixed bag. Most of the time, everything looks awful. There is not a single shot in the movie which looks real and everything is so obviously green-screen. However, there are still a few CGI moments that don't look terrible. However, it doesn't make a movie good, it just means that there are some decent-looking effects in an otherwise garbage movie.\n\nI can't believe the talent behind the movie created such a piece of garbage. I would give it a 1, but the movie is so entertaining because of how bad it is, it gets a 3 purely because it's entertaining. Watch the movie if you're drunk at a party with friends but don't watch the movie because you want to watch an awesome, action-packed movie."

What it Lacks in Thespian Talent, it makes up for in a Grandiose Vision filled with a Colorful Vibrancy.\n\nIt's Artistic Scheme of Things Reminds of Comic-Books, Pulps, Heavy Metal Magazine, Computer Games, Poster Art, and other Pop Culture Splashes of Loud, Lurid, Luscious Displays that Attract Attention, if not Praise from the Cultural Elite.\n\nThe Tweaking or Embellishment of Egyptian Mythology is Clever and done with a Wink and a Wonderment from a Director that's Not Afraid to Take Chances, Tilt the Windmill, and Challenge the Film-Making Status Quo. Not Everything Works to Perfection but this Piece of Modern Art cannot be as Easily Dismissed by Uppity Critics and Knee-Jerks so Quickly.\n\nThis has all the Aspects of a Cult-Movie and while it is Currently Dismissed by most as \"God-Awful\", Future Reflection and Reaction to this Entertainment will be just the Opposite.\n\nProyas will be Redeemed as Time Passes, because this is a Timeless Treat for Anyone who can Enjoy Pure, Infectious Eye Candy that has No Pretensions of being anything else."

Seeing comparisons with this film to Clash of the Titans, but even though that film isn't great, it is easily more entertaining and enjoyable than Gods of Egypt.\n\nThis film as a whole was quite generic, bland and overly long. A story that is predictable and doesn't really offer much of anything new or fresh. Decent visuals but that is to be expected considering its large budget. This was a massive box office flop (noticeable domestic wise) and after viewing this film, one isn't surprised in the slightest."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've just watched recently on Blu Ray Gods Of Egypt, it was a very enjoyable ride. If the production were using more sets construct it could it been an epic, but that i leave it to the filmmakers. The story is part accurate part fable.It is the time of Zep Tepi (The Fist Time) when the Ancient Gods ruled over men, and how they found them self's in troubles,and struggle by learning their mistake they have learned their lessen through the human beings. The story folows based on the true myth of the Ancient Egyptian Gods, how Osiris was appointed ruler of Ancent Khemet with his sister Isis. It is the truth myth of the Pre-History of the Antediluvian world. aprox 10,000 - 12,000 BC when Atlantis was swallowe beneath the waves in the Atlantic Ocean.This is the missing pages of our forgotten history mind you.Is it hidden or a myths? Set kills Osiris then cuts his body into pieces, and spreads them across Ancient Khemet Empire, Only one piece survives and that is the phallus of Osiris.Hiis loyal subject finds it and hands over to Isis the Queen of the Gods, She uses it and gets impregnated and she bores Horus, that set to be the ruler of the throne of Khemet. Horus grows and become mighty warrior that go into battle with Vimanas against Set and fight in a mighty battle he is hit with a laser bear from the ship of set and dropes down. He is badly injured he heals then he goes on a journey to the hidding place of Set and kills him at Mount Sinai. At the same time Isis is set on the quest to find every piece and to resurrect her beloved husband Osiris. It is the Quest of Immortality.This is the true myth.The move should be made that way but because of sexual contents depraved from the story Alex Proyas uses the corner stone of the myth and changes the elements of the story to develop that led to a different interpretation of the Zep Tepi. A lot of people don't understand the concept of myths that is the history of bygone age of the real quest to immortality and their struggle with their ruling over men. That is the true history of the Gods. I like one particular element that is straight from Zacharia Sitchin pages, The Gods were angry at all times and thirst for vengeance, they didn't have emotions. and that is their fall. Only humans have those emotions that make us different and better then the Gods. In fact the Truth myth is Amon-Ra is not the father of Osiris and Set instead is Atlas the last king of Atlantis. Ancent Khemet is in fact the Osirian Empire that stretches through out the whole Mediterranean Basin, Lybia and Egypt it was a colony of the Atlantian Empire.The madeteranin Basin at hat time bas a valley tith lakes and rivers that is now submurged. King Atlas and the Queen Mu gave authority to Osiris to rule Ancent Khemet, but his brother Set been subjugated by the dark side fell short and become a jealous Prince that wanted to kill his elder brother Osiris. He wanted to be the ruler of Egyptian/Lybian Empire that was in parallels of the Atlantian Empire.In Ancent Khemet they used Vimanas that were fighting in mid air like the movie John Carter on Mars. Those elements should be incorporated into the story to make it an epic production it needed to be a cross between Thor and Lord of the Rings. The move its self is better then Scorpion King in production and story and better interpenetration of the Gods as 9 foot giants then in the movie Immortals, that was lacking. The Gods were 12 - 15 feet but that could it been outstanding or impossible to be made in comparison to the humans for the big picture. The Ancient Gods from Egypt were in fact the Sumerian Gods Anunnakies that were 33 feet, then as they lived on out planet and of the gravitation force their life span dropped same as the height. When you look at their family chart Osiris and Set fits with their third generation ruling Gods on our planet. the second been Amun and Amaunet . Lot of critics complain about using to much white actor to interpret the Gods, they wrong, because the Ancent Gods were fair hair and white skin, the Anunnkies. The Creation of their second class humans were the Dark skin or Bronze skin in Africa and those were the the mining class They used the proto-typed Proncozul the original earthly beings. Their first race was the Titans been the dark skin Giants, their second creation were the Cyclops and Spinx, Gryphons and other Monsters, then comes the Apes, right after their six generation they have had created the Humo-Humo Sapians the Adamites, been the same as their likenesses. Lets created men in our image to be the same as our likeness. The move it is fun to watch if you don't take it seriously. The SGI were cheaply made but some scenery were gorgeous. They showed the Earth or Shan been a Flat Star Ship not a sphere.probably that is how they've interpreted in those times, It might it been true. Everything that we know now is not new i fits the legacy of the Gods that we call it magic in fact it is their science and advance technology that we use a fragment in our society nowdays.Itas been lost or hidden in the course of time, ready to be discovered. Only time will tell how we will interpret those myths or been our lost history that is stored in our subconsciousness in every humans, that needs to be revealed.\n\nThe movie is very good It could it been an epic if they used more real sets construction and incorporated those elements above. They have spend a lot of money on their costumes that were breathtaking and on the wizardly, not so much on the production sets. But I don't want to ruin the imagination of the Director, everyone is entitled to their own opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched it with low expectations after watching the general score, but after reading the user reviews, I decided to give it a try, unfortunately.\n\nThe plot was very expected, and there really wasn't much to it:\n\nSPOILER: - Good guy is becoming the king, bad guy prevents this and becomes the king instead. Defeated good guy mourns in self-pity, until an unexpected nobody comes cheering the defeated good guy back on his feet. Together they fight against the bad king and defeat him, and everyone lives happily ever after. It just couldn't be no more a typical bedtime story, with no whatsoever plot twists. - /SPOILER -\n\n\nThe acting was mediocre, if not pretty bad. There were many new and unfamiliar faces, and I understand why (they were not remarkable). Some of the better ones (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) and Gerard Butler (300, P.s. I love you)) were average, but otherwise, meh. Okay, if you get past this, you could expect at least a decent and fun action, right?\n\nWell, that didn't go so good either, as the fights were in fact most cases fun to watch, if it wasn't for the, occasionally even horrible, CGI. Most of the movie and fight scenes looked more like a video game, than a movie. Although the choreography could have included some surprises, it'll pass.\n\nOkay, it wasn't probably as bad as I made it sound there, but overall is was okay, and watchable - have seen worse movies. However, there really was nothing new for a fantasy, or an adventure or for an action movie.\n\nIt's okay movie for a random movie to watch from Netflix when you are having a hard time making up something else to do. But I wouldn't recommend to pay for it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Gods of Egypt\" asks an age old question, \"Does flashy sparkle outweighs written words?\". Unfortunately for the two hours movie, its visual is inconsistent and the story has so many illogical flaws, that whatever gorgeous scenery it has would feel bland. Furthermore, the acting is sloppy, having less-than-charismatic characters mumbling cringe-worthy monologue for half its time.\n\nThis is the tedious story of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the supposed king of fictional Egypt where gods and mortals live side by side. He then finds opposition from his uncle Set (Gerard Butler). He then forms unusual alliance with Bek (Brenton Thwaites), a human thief with a single-minded drive for juvenile love.\n\nNikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gerard Butler are not bad, they have experience on this type of epic saga as Jaime Lannister and Leonidas, respectively. However, this also feels as though they are just going through the motion. Here they are shades, less appealing and more brooding version of their famous roles.\n\nBek as the other main lead is your typical charming hoodlum without the charm. His characterization is too rigid and any attempt to romanticized or deliver witty humor is instead annoying. The two leading females are too over zealously created for flamboyant melodramatic romance. There are a couple decent supporting cast such as Rufus Sewell as Urshu and Chadwick Boseman as Thoth, but they merely have small portions of spotlight.\n\nThe script feels forced to create any chemistry between the characters, however it often sounds like soap opera. Not to mention story line is plagued by awful plot devices. Being gods doesn't exemplify them from having sudden illogical and convenient twists, a few of these might be fine, but after half dozen times audience would appreciate more explanation than simple magic.\n\nVisual is arguably pretty. At its best the movie offers some aesthetically pleasing scenes and the costumes worn as well as the set are very easy on the eyes. Still, among these beautiful people and vistas, it's not often to see it smeared by strangely subpar CGI, as though these are Transformers made from low budget production.\n\nTainted by shady narrative, corrupted visual and barren script, \"Gods of Egypt\" is mindlessly numb."

When you can do absolutely anything, the anything you you do must be truly original and outstanding and that's a far harder trick to pull off.\n\nNot singling out this movie - many blockbusters that rely on CGI hit the same problem. Oh well...\n\nThe often-dim lighting, yellow (sand/Egypt - geddit) cast and fast edits don't help with clarity, either.\n\nBut it's not a bad movie, sadly it's just a bit of an average one. If you like mythological themes and epic action, go for it. You'll enjoy it."

It's way too easy to take this apart on many things. Gerald Butler is overplaying it, the CGI, the story and much more. But why get mad, when you can have fun. And there is a lot of that to be had.\n\nJust dive into this movie and watch it free of all, if you can. Because this is how this wants to be watched. And if you can do that, then you are in for a very fun and entertaining ride. Most of it doesn't make sense and it's more or less one sequence paired with another, but tries to encapsulate the Harryhausen feeling. And in some regards I'd say it did. Before you cry sacrilege (especially because it was real tough work that was put into those stop motion films back in the day), I'm talking about the general vibe. If you can appreciate that, roll with it."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are many issues with this film. We can start by the fact that yet another Hollywood blockbuster whitewashes what should have been a diverse cast. But even if you can get past the whitewashing, the film itself is pretty big mess. On its premise alone, it borrows from plenty of films we love including Hercules and The Lion King, but the execution is something else entirely. Sadly, talented director Alex Proyas never manages to create something entertaining or thought provoking out of Gods of Egypt.\n\nThe films stars Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gerard Butler as Horus and Set, two gods battling it out to be the king of Egypt, Brenton Thwaites as Bek, a mortal who possesses untapped courage, and Elodie Young and Courtney Eaton as the main love interests. As I said, the story isn't all that terrible, the performances and execution of the story is horrific. For a 140 million-dollar film, Gods of Egypt may be the worst looking film I've ever seen. I'm not sure who is in charge of controlling how the budget is being used for this film, but it was not a good job of properly distributing the time and money. Whether it's watching Butler fly through the sky or a halfway decent action scene, the green screen is blatantly obvious.\n\nAfter a good portion of the 2 hour and 7 minute film, my eyes began to drift. That never happens to me during an action film. I just never found myself caring for the characters. Not necessarily to the fault of the actors, but they didn't do all that much to help their cause. The performances were subpar at best, and even the one really great actor, Chadwick Boseman, was completely wasted. I'm not sure whose idea it was to have Thwaites yell like Tarzan or George of the jungle every time he fell or jumped off rocks, but that was not the best decision to make. Even Jaime Lannister couldn't save this one. I hope to god that London Has Fallen doesn't make it back to back horrible Gerard Butler films.\n\nAlex Proyas went on a social media rant over the wretched reviews the film has received. Even after I went in with even lower expectations because of this, I wasn't impressed in the slightest. I never saw Clash or Wrath of the titans, but I can't help but think the sword and sandal epic is officially dead. The best bet for studios is to stick to what works, and that's disappointing, because this genre has turned out some of my favorite films of all time in Gladiator and Braveheart.\n\n+Some of the action and story potential\n\n-Horrific CGI\n\n-Weak and uninteresting characters\n\n-Boseman wasted\n\n-Whitwashed\n\n3.6/10"

A lot of scenes if not all were shot in front of a green screen and it showed. The things I liked about this movie were the monsters and other creatures, they looked good, so credits to the makers for their vivid imagination. The acting wasn't bad but considering names in the cast you could expect better. The story itself wasn't that great unfortunately.

This was so distracting from the rest of the movie.\n\nThere are several scenes where Bek has to run and dive. It looked like a bad video game. After a while I caught myself thinking in PlayStation buttons while he was running and jumping. XO <- -> XOX\n\nI saw the movie in 3D and it was a mess. At times it was hard to follow what was going on on the screen. If you do decide to see this, watch it in 2D.

The \"brainy\" god was played with good humour and the sphinx was a bit \"Monty Python\" not that that's a complaint. Its not Shakespeare or Gladiator..its not even 300 but it was \"take your brain out, open a bottle of wine and enjoy!\" I would not want to see it at the cinema but as a cheap DVD or sky download its certainly not the worst I have seen!"

I couldn't believe the crappy special effects, especially in light of some of the amazing movies out lately (like Thor). The dialogue sucked. The big-God/little-mortal thing was creepy.\n\nI believe I've only walked out of two movies in my whole life: The Leopard with Burt Lancaster (yes, back when dinosaurs roamed the earth) and Wild Hogs (but I rented that, so I it doesn't really count).

I'd argue its light weight, simple fun, thats probably going to look good on a large screen LCD with a surround sound system. Don't for a moment consider taking this film seriously, it might have a reasonable cast and not half bad acting but it is, what it is, an action film first and foremost.\n\nI enjoyed Gods of Egypt, its well paced and quite watchable.

        "review_detailed_main": "Three years ago, I was at the California Science center in Los Angeles where I got to see an exhibit on Ancient Egypt based on the pharaoh Cleopatra. The experience featured several artifacts from the era that have been collected below the Mediterranean Sea and showcased a time full of gods and a collective tribute to the afterlife. This was one of my favorite museum pieces and reminded me that I used to really enjoy the history of ancient Egypt back when I was a kid. I think it was the fact that the Egyptian world was both beautiful with its pyramids and gold and disgusting with its obsession with death.\n\nAncient Egypt has been present in a lot of biblical based features like The Ten Commandments and The Prince of Egypt. The fascination of the country grew upon even more with the discovery of King Tut and the curses supposedly set upon those that opened the tomb. Presenting it in film is nothing new, but I can honestly say I have not seen anything about the Egyptian gods like Ra and such. Gods of Egypt does this and is a throwback to classic sword and sorcery movies like Jason and the Argonauts.\n\nThough the setting is ancient Egypt, the story is set in an alternate world where the Earth is flat and the gods rule over the mortals. In fact, King Osiris is about to hand the throne over to his son Horus (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), but a surprise visit from Set (played by Gerald Butler), one of the sons of Ra, changes everything. Set kills Osiris, takes Horus' eyes, and takes the throne. A year passes under the new rule where mortal Bek (played by Brenton Thwaites) is a common thief who is looking for his love, Zaya.\n\nZeya gets killed and Bek decides that exiled god Horus is the only one who can bring her back. He takes her to him, but Horus says that he needs his eyes back in order to bring back the dead (and to be able to change into a god-like animal). They strike a deal to get the eyes in exchange for saving Zaya's soul in the afterlife. The briefly receive help from Ra (played by Geoffrey Rush) in his floating vessel above the Earth before returning to finish the quest. They are racing against the clock as Set is obtaining godly items in order to increase his power.\n\nGods of Egypt is so fascinating! Not that it's a good movie (not at all!), but this is an example on how one can take an intriguing idea for an adventure and do almost everything wrong with it. The script is wrong, the castings wrong, the effects are wrong, and the overall direction is all over the place. The movie has gained controversy for having no Egyptian actors and it's weird how not only are there no Arabic people of any kind, but the majority is white (its even more embarrassing with Gerald Butler doing his thick Scottish accent in an Egyptian world).\n\nI have no idea how lazy the director was, but you'd think he would have taken another look at the computer effects and realize that maybe their not done yet. It's obvious that the majority of the film was made in front of a green screen. The lighting never convinced me once that they were outdoors. While some of the background shots look cool, most of the monsters and magical elements seem more like out of a video game then a Hollywood movie (I had this problem with Maleficent). These people need to learn from Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars: The Force Awakens with how proper effects are pulled off.\n\nI'll give this two Egyptian Ra's out of ten. I cannot recommend this as a genuine good movie, but I can recommend it for something else. Like how Battlefield Earth and The Room were made, Gods of Egypt is so bad that within its demented sense, it's actually kind of enjoyable. I could easily see this as an easy target for comedians to point out all the problems. So if your looking for something to laugh at and not with, \u0085wait for this to come out on DVD and put yourself in an strange Egyptian mind frame."

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed this over the top extravagant adventure set in Ancient Egypt.\n\nGood points: The script cleverly uses the legends of the Egyptian gods. It's fun to see the god brought to life and transform into various birds and beasts. Now everyone can visualize the gods instead of imagining them from a 2 dimensional painting on a wall. The tale of Horus avenging the murder of his father Osiris by fighting Set is brought to life. There is quite a lot of dialog and humor for a movie of this type.\n\nThe visuals are spectacular dizzying and fantastical. You get some pretty impressive cities temples caves tombs pyramids and the underworld. It's true they have gone a bit overboard with the sets and scenery that border on gaudy and crowded to be distracting. Egypt is just made to look too colorful, and there are too many massive heights to plunge down cliffs and waterfalls. Egypt is a pretty flat country and it just seemed a bit too much. But in the end even if it was too over the top at least it felt grand.\n\nWeak points: The cast was hit and miss. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Hathor looks more like a bad guy than a good guy - he should have been the villain Set instead. As Set, Gerard Butler's Scottish accent was jarring. Australians Brenton Thwaites and Courtney Eaton make the cute young mortal couple. Again their clipped British accents were out of place. It would have been better if they spoke with more neutral slightly Middle Eastern accents so as not to be so incongruous. This is tied in with the controversy that the cast was not ethnically correct. This is partly right with the very blonde actresses in various supporting roles and Geoffrey Rush as Ra is out of place. Chadwick Boseman is the only actor of African descent in a major speaking role. But this mistake in casting isn't a fatal flaw. At least Elodie Yung as love interest Hathor looks a bit more ethnically suitable and she is quite beguiling.\n\nSome of the fighting was a bit dizzying and formulaic. A bit headache inducing.\n\nBottom line - this is a grand blockbuster with it's clever story using Egyptian legends. Worth a watch on the big screen."

And a number of moments in the movie, where simply waiting a few seconds longer, before delivering a line or switching to the next scene would have made all the difference between epic moments or stupidly rushed parts with resulting lost effect. And this last bit, they did a number of times during the movie. It was pitiful to see such potential go to waste. Alas...\n\nSo, should you see the movie? Yes. Even though they missed and or simply messed up various opportunities for greatness, such as cobras as scary as and about the size of Godzilla dying way too easily; the movie has entertainment value. Just make sure you disengage your critical mind long enough, it'll work. And pray, that the high school teen who was lucky enough to have gotten his first draft made into a movie, has learned how to clean up his work, and that the weirdness between the directing and various badly timed delivery of lines which ruined what could've been epic moments, is figured out and solved by the time this crew puts out another project..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Amidst the current climate of unrest regarding the issue of racism in Hollywood, Gods Of Egypt hasn't escaped scot-free. Similar to the film Exodus: Gods And Kings, which was also set in Egypt, there has been much talk about the fact that there are non- Egyptians playing Egyptian characters. To me, I don't think this was necessarily a conscious decision by the casting agents to directly exclude Egyptians out of sheer racism. I genuinely believe this was just a case of hiring the right people for the job. I don't think it'd be right for a studio to deliberately seek out actors of a certain racial background and ignore others who might actually be a better fit. I could be wrong \u2013 there could have been a multitude of tremendous Egyptian actors and actresses who auditioned and subsequently weren't hired. Either way, I don't think this should affect the success of a film and the level with which we enjoy it.\n\nOkay! Now that the serious stuff is over and done with, let me get to the fun stuff\u0085 this movie was shot in my hometown of Sydney (yay!). It's great to witness the generation of local jobs in the film industry, so this is something I'm super proud of. We were able to showcase our range of extremely talented Aussies, both in front of and behind the camera, including the likes of Hollywood heavyweight Geoffrey Rush, legend Bryan Brown and starring up-and-comer Brenton Thwaites who already has several big films under his belt, such as Maleficent, The Giver and Son Of A Gun. He had his first big break in Home And Away, which has been the stepping stone for many a successful actor (ahem, did someone say Chris Hemsworth?). Also starring in this epic feature are international talents Gerard Butler (looking great in a skirt\u0085 and why wouldn't he, he's Scottish) and everyone's favourite incest Lannister twin, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. The film was also directed by Egyptian-born Aussie Alex Proyas who has directed a range of hugely popular movies, including I, Robot, Knowing, and the cult-hit \u2013 and one of my all-time faves \u2013 The Crow.\n\nFrom the opening scene until the end credits, the set design was phenomenal. Everything was on such a large scale, with intricate costumes to boot. This, along with the great cast, was unfortunately the only highlights for me. The dialogue was often stilted and unnatural and the visual effects were hit and miss. There were many similarities between this title and the 2010 remake of Clash Of The Titans, which won't bode well for some. In saying that, when they got it right, it was amazing to see on the big screen and I believe this is definitely a big-scale film made to be seen in theatres\u0085 if you're willing to pay the inflated cinema ticket price, that is.\n\nmotherofpopcorn.wordpress.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Gods of Egypt (2016): Once in a while,Hollywood always have a movie on Egyptian mythology which fail miserably(most of the times). Gods of Egypt is such a movie which repeated the same fate this year too.With huge casting and budget,Gods of Egypt has lot of features which has disaster all over it.\n\nPlot: In the ancient Egypt, the god Ra (Geoffrey Rush) has split Egypt in two: the fertile part with the Nile would be ruled by his son Osiris ( Bryan Brown) and the desert by his son Set (Gerald Butler) . During the coronation of Horus ( Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) by his father Osiris, Set betrays his brother and kills him. Then he withdraws the eyes of Horus that are his source of power and exiles him in the desert. The mortal thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and his beloved wife Zaya(Courtney Eaton) that worships Horus become slaves of Set. Zaya, who is working for Set's architect Urshu (Rufus Sewell), convinces Bek to steal the eyes of Horus from a well-protected pyramid designed by Urshu to give them back to Horus, the only one capable to defeat Set. Bek succeeds but retrieves only one of the eyes; however Urshu discovers the theft and Bek and Zaya need to flee. Urshu kills Zaya with an arrow and when Bek reaches Horus' shelter, he proposes to help the god to retrieve his other eye. In return, he demands that Horus bring his beloved Zaya back from the underworld. They team up and soon Horus' lover Hathor (\u00c9lodie Yung) , the goddess of love, leaves Set and joins them in their quest to defeat the evil Set. Did Bek help Horus in defeating Set and did he get Zaya back???\n\nPlus Points:\n\n1)VFX: God of Egypt has good visual effects.Even though there are less 3D effects,others are eye feast.Egypt locations and sets are well made.\n\n2)Performances: Everyone gave decent performances.Brenton as Bek,Nikolaj as Horus and Courtney as Zaya gave good performances.Gerald Butler as Villain is weird but good.\n\nMinus Points:\n\n1)Story: Gods of Egypt has typical plot where fight against evil brother by an abandoned family member:( Used since ages\n\n2)Duration: This movie has duration of 2hr 08min which may not seem long but felt so long.\n\n3)Dialogues: They are so clich\u00e9d that I got confused to watch it as either an adventure or a comedy...\n\nSo,Gods of Egypt is a typical fantasy based on Egyptian mythology with good VFX but poor writing and clich\u00e9d dialogues\n\nMy rating 5.5/10"

How could you tarnish your reputation with this movie? :-D\n\nThe movie had potential, not a bad story, not a bad cast, not a bad cgi team etc. Problem is, it just doesn't work in this case.\n\nThere is so much cgi in this movie, so the acting suffers from Star Wars I-III syndrome. The story is actually not bad, for a \"fantasy action\" movie. Unfortunately, Gerard Butler speaking with his thick Scottish accent as an Egyptian God, diverted my focus from the story. Don't get me wrong, he's not a bad actor per se. But a Scottish speaking Egyptian God...!? At some points in the movie, it felt a lot like watching a sequel to 300. Yeah, that's actually perhaps the best advice I can give...\n\nIf you liked 300, you will probably like this movie!\n\n(Gorgeous women in it too!!!)"

After a while, we got pulled in the movie somehow and enjoyed watching it except some clich\u00e9 love dialogues here and there.\n\nIt's got what it takes for a movie, good acting, coherent scenario, no surprises with a good guys win ending.\n\nI am sure action lovers will definitely love this movie and others would enjoy it.

The acting was bad, the script was poor, the action kinda sucked and it was really uninspiring.

        "review_detailed_main": "At first i was actually excited for this film, saw an interview with Gerard Butler, where he was trying to say this was going to be his \"Gladiator\" and then i saw the trailer. The trailer shows what you are expecting, and that is a visual spectacular of the mythological gods and cities of ancient Egypt. It also alludes that there film is based on some story. That is a lie.\n\nI don't usually do negative reviews. Unless the film is really terrible, and even so i like to talk about the positive aspects of that film too. So I will start with the positives. The film has some pretty cool visuals for most parts, and I do mean for most part, there are moments where it looks like you are watching cinematic clip from a game that is equivalent to PS3 graphics. The rest of the film is filled with colorful and what i'm hoping for is expensive CGI to make the film stand out on its own and bring people into the cinema to get their money back. Because honestly neither the story or the acting would do that.\n\nStory: now i'm not really sure who wrote the script, and where was the script supervisor during production. The story was all over the place, and just to give you an idea of what i mean. Why is that gods can die? why are they bigger then humans? and if only gods are bigger then humans to showcase that they are gods, then what about their big guards? are they demi gods? why do they bleed gold? why do they not get stronger from the prayers of mortals. Why is one mortal has the speed of a god, and the strength to withhold a gods mighty punch??.. So, there are a lot of questions and plot holes to ask and cover. That's why i choose to skip over it. its simpler like that.\n\nActing: I really have to say that acting was pretty terrible. Not just from new comers, but even from A-list'rs like Butler,Rush and Waldau. But it wasn't as bad as the new faces that played the love couple or the actress that played the love interest of Horus.\n\nOverall this film fails, not for it's lack of originality, but for trying to be too original and skipping over a lot of important information and key turns in the film, for allowing the film to have scenes which looked out of place and felt like they were made on Windows 97, and for really bad use of Green screen. The ride through town on the chariot is a perfect example."

I guess that's a Hollywood thing. The statues where also not correct in the introduction. I found it to be just a lazy production. I also felt the screening was wrong. At times it felt like the camera shots where framed to far at times. East Enders in Africa is how I would describe this for friends. The narration should have stopped but it drones on seeking to save more money on actual screen play. you may find a few miss matches in sets due to mixing scenes like a day time TV feel show then back again."

I can definitely watch it once a year.\n\nNow if CGI were of poor quality like in The Asylum movies e.g. Transmorphers, Mega Shark etc then forget it, this movie would've been one of the worst I've ever seen.\n\nA good CGI is saving this movie From being the worst I've seen Poor directing, conversations are goofy Critics will flash their grins."

So yes, it doesn't accurately portray Egypt and takes a massive dump on fact and history but it was enjoyable, plot straight forward, characters likable and some i hated, plenty of action and overall a watchable movie.

Honestly I got the feeling he hated doing this movie. The battle with the beast of the darkness was the worst. Clearly the stole a sandworm from Dune. Could have been much more inventive.

There is a sentence:,,Overly confident and CGI''. Yes, so there's that but i don't want to spoil it because some people want to watch it! Good but movie doesn't have some point and its pretty linear as movie can get! Well in some movies you would probably wonder what would happen if... Here?! NO! Don't even bother! See this movie follows ,,mythology'' but you just may go back in time to your history class in fifth grade! After this movie you will scratch you head and ask yourself how much this movie costs... But don't ask yourself that because human spirit is so so strong! Like when you want to accomplish something and you are doing well to make masterpiece, sorry i don't want to waste your time... Well you really need to be concentrated for this if you lose track you will begging movie to be over even at the half time! You will begging anyhow! If you like this kind of movies that is fine with you... One thing to mention where movie fails so hard! Movie doesn't know what it wants to be!!!(pleas understand this, it isn't like i don't know what to say, here its true) You should read books rather than watching this! What could improve this move! Less CGI sure and unnecessary characters(mercenaries) overly sensitive characters and overly confident and script(God please)! Well since there are problems like this we are stuck with move as it is now! Feels like Jupiter ascending(i can't say which one is worst than the other) when that movie came out everybody were like:,,Cool, it will be awesome and best thing ever'' but what came from that is bucked full of tears and salt water and what ever do you want... I watched this movie today with my friends and teacher(probably the awesome-st guy that i know) and they were like: ,,movie is awesome'' And i was like people get really what is good about this movie that pumped you so much and they were like brain washed!!! I watched obviously more movies then them and they are brain washed that is all! So here it is watch if you like this kind of movies! But i warn you there's so much bad things in but some good as well... Well this is it!!! P.S: Move need soundtrack from:Queen,Smak and Ramones and also 11 other bands that i like! :)"

The plot, if any seems to be written by a teenager; transformers seems a piece of art next to this low level work. I sincerely recommend people not wasting time with this movie. The opening of the movie in Egypt seems quite messy, and the battle that ensues makes whatsoever no sense, from my point of view. The CGI is not enough to mask what is lacking in other departments. As I said, I have not finished the movie, and have not whatever desire to come back to it again in a near future. It is a shame, because I do actually like films related to Egypt mythology, and the film had so much potential and background to draw on, that was wasted."

An original movie for a change, not a sequel, or prequel, or reboot, or franchise, or comic book adaptation, or spin-off film. This movie had very striking visuals, sweeping music, fun acting and action sequences, and engaging characters. It moved along very briskly, despite its slightly long run time. We had no difficulty following the plot (which is certainly no less plausible or linear than Episode VII!) or understanding who the somewhat unfamiliar Egyptian mythological characters were as some reviews suggested we might. There was a nice character arc for Horus, and even a thoughtful message from the gods to humankind at the end. Ethnically inaccurate casting choices--yeah, it would have been nice to see a more authentic cast, but these actors got the job done, and that is no reason to skip the movie if you like this sort of film, in my opinion. Give this film a chance, you may enjoy it much more than you expect!"

        "review_detailed_main": "'GODS OF Egypt': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nBig budget action-fantasy flick, from director Alex Proyas (the man who also helmed such beloved fantasy hits as 'DARK CITY', 'KNOWING', 'I, ROBOT' and 'THE CROW'). It was written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (the duo that also co-wrote such other mythical fantasy flicks as 'DRACULA UNTOLD' and 'THE LAST WITCH HUNTER'). The movie notoriously stars a mostly white cast of actors, as Egyptian gods and mortals: that are battling for all of Egypt. The cast includes Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Elodie Yung, Courtney Eaton, Geoffrey Rush, Bryan Brown, Rufus Sewell (who also starred in 'DARK CITY') and Chadwick Boseman (the one cast member of African decent). Despite being cheesy, and over-the-top, I mostly enjoyed the film.\n\nThe story is set in a fictional Ancient Egypt; where the god Horus (Coster-Waldau) is about to be crowned the king of all of Egypt. Then Horus's vengeful uncle, Set (Butler), kills Horus's father, Osiris (Brown), and steals Horus's eyes; while taking the throne for himself. He plunges the peaceful Egypt into a world of darkness; where citizens must pay their way into the afterlife. A mortal thief, Bek (Thwaites), teams with Horus; to stop Set, and restore Egypt to it's past greatness.\n\nProyas is a very talented director, and he doesn't disappoint here; the script could have used a little more work, but the movie is still a lot of fun. It's entertaining, action-packed and filled with colorful visuals. The performances are all decent enough, but it would have been nice to see a lot more ethnic diversity (if the studio would have just banked on more minority actors). Proyas has listed many reasons (why it was financially safer) to cast the actors he did. If you can overlook that racist injustice, the movie isn't that bad (it's mostly entertaining). Fans of the genre should get a kick out of it.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U"

It never feels as though there is anything at stake. The characters were poorly developed. Not only did I not feel any connection with them, I didn't WANT to have any connection with them.\n\nI loved some of Proyas' other films (Dark City, The Crow) and really wanted him to succeed. It was only out of support for him I went to go see this film and had extremely low expectations given the negative reviews. Unfortunately, after seeing it, many of these negative reviews gave him way too much credit. It's obviously not the worst movie ever made, but it's so difficult to sit through I don't care about the difference."

        "review_detailed_main": "I thought this was quite a good movie in the end, however, there were certain things which you had to get past and, for many, that was probably impossible. Firstly and most ludicrously, 99% of the cast is white and just didn't work, on any level, for a movie set in Egypt. Secondly, everyone has a ridiculously overdone generic English accent. What Americans don't seem to grasp is that (a) less than 0.1% of English folks just don't talk like that (b) English is not about pronouncing every single letter in every single word, perfectly. Even the poshest of folks don't speak like that - I think THAT is the movies biggest problem. The actors seem so preoccupied about perfect annunciation that they forget to act naturally. The black fella, Chadwick Boseman, who played 'Thoth', is especially guilty of this and his dreadful attempt at being English ruins his character's credibility; if he'd spoken with an American accent, no one would have noticed as much. The CGI is fabulous and the story isn't a bad one. The casting was a bit off and it did come across a bit like they'd spent so much on cgi that there wasn't enough for some more proper actors. I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong at first and then it dawned on me. It was as ludicrous as casting white folks in 'Roots' and asking them to do African accents. Once I forgave the actors for this I really started to enjoy the movie. Please, please, whoever made this movie; if you are thinking of doing a sequel, fix these major issues! Because there were no indigenous Egyptians and no attempt was made to even disguise the actors to look like any, you just never buy into the movie 100%. It doesn't feel like ancient Egypt and you have to work really hard to get your head around that. We have among others, Danish, American and Australian actors - who's idea was it to make them all speak in this ridiculous fashion?? Anyway - try to ignore this and it's quite a good film."

India? This film was not a bad idea. I liked the story, a mission based concept, but I did not like the CGI. Visually, it was okay, though those CGI characters felt like they're from sci-fi. I think they inspired by the ancient Egyptian arts. Other than that, this film is enjoyable.\n\nAt least I knew about Greek deities, I learnt a few words and names about Egypt mythology through this. Gerard Butler in a negative shade was good and the other actors too decent. I was not interested in this film, but now somewhat I enjoyed it, that mean they should stop it here, no sequel please.\n\nI had no issue with the casting, it is a marketing strategy. You can't just put a new foreign face in front of the camera and make money out of it. Cinema itself means fake display. Age, skin, death, everything is fake. So people must learn to accept it similar to when a black, Malaysian or Indonesian man says he's a mooslim, but genetically he's not, just converted to.\n\nWell composed stunt sequences, especially bloods with liquid gold, totally got the PG13. Least expected film of the year, but got entertained better. It got the mixed response and mostly negative feedback from the critics, but who knows you might have a good time like I did. So you could try it if you want in your free time, because it is not worth to spend your valuable time.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my review of Gods of Egypt (spoiler free)\n\n* (1/5)\n\nCast: Brenton Thwaites, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Gerard Butler, Courtney Easton, Geoffrey Rush.\n\nPlot: Mortal hero Bek (Thwaites) teams with the god Horus (Coaster-Waldau) in an alliance against Set (Butler), the merciless god of darkness, who has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict.\n\nI just want to start off by saying this film is abysmal in fact it is worse than abysmal. As far as summer blockbusters go this is by far the worst. Gods of Egypt is one of those rare films were the mortal is the hero. Director Alex Proyas concentrates on making this film action packed and look really pretty rather than focusing on an actual plot. This film is completely packed with CGI and it does look astonishing it's that that the story makes it a worthless experience.\n\nThis film packs in a lot of action mainly caused by Set (Butler) whose character looks very bad-ass but that is all that is working for him. This movie could have been a lot better if not for the idiotic story kind of like Clash of the Titans. This is probably going to be the biggest flop this year which is a shame because the hype was so high, and made on a budget of $140 million that money just made the movie look pretty and the actors in this were just cannon fodder.\n\nAnother thing is that this movie contains some of the biggest stars in Hollywood for example Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau whose known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Although Gerard Butler hasn't done anything good since 300 (2006) just a matter of an opinion. The one person that has gone down in standards is Australian actress Courtney Eaton previously known from last years action masterpiece Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nHere are some points as to why this is the worst summer blockbuster:\n\nPlot: As said before the plot is just non existent see normally films that have the main character as a mortal and he becomes a hero are well paced and a delight, but this is far from that with this your brain will just melt because of the stupidity. Essentially the plot of this movie should say witness my action and my pretty because that's all it's good for, just a poignant mess.\n\nActing: Now the acting is very complex sometimes it's good and sometimes it is not but most of the time it is just, just an added feature. While choosing the casting they just picked who thought would make this movie good they were picked at random, sometimes a good thing but in this case it is to be avoided. Some of the actors in this film are prestigious legends like Geoffrey Rush who is known for The Kings Speech (2010), the Australian actor made that film good and watchable, but for this even with his performance I was begging for it to end.\n\nOther than that this film is exceptionally gorgeous but this summer could been without it.\n\nVerdict: Very good looking, stupid and quite frankly doesn't even feel like it should even fall into the so bad it's good. It is eternally bad and should be forgotten.\n\n2/10 dreadful and an absolute mess."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gods of Egypt is a movie directed by Alex Proyas and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. It stars Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Courtney Eaton, and Brenton Thwaites\n\nMortal hero Bek teams with the god Horus in an alliance against Set, the merciless god of darkness who has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict.\n\nMythological stories were often told to teach a concept that was too elusive to be understood otherwise. For example, the story of Echo and Narcissus, was meant to define what narcissism entails and explain what reflections were. Like all mythological stories, Gods of Egypt, teaches all aspiring writers and directors, how not to make a fantasy movie.\n\nThere's little to nothing good about the monstrosity movie seems. With that said I did reap some enjoyment out of this senses- assaulting trip to Egypt. This is a film that I can definitely say will become a cult film one day as it is a true train wreck in every which way. But, like in all train wrecks, it horrible, tragic, yet irresistible viewing.\n\nPerhaps the most entertaining part of this circus freak show, was the script. Everything but coherent, Gods of Egypt's two writers seemed to have truly thrown in the towel in this endeavor as each line progressively sounds like it was ripped out of a poorly made X- rated movie. This 'style,' if I may call it that, is complimented by the overly convoluted story that fails to engage the audience past its first few scenes. Rather I found myself focusing on how many times Gerard Butler tries to imitate Nicolas Cage. Moving past the laughable dialogue, Gerard Butler delivers a villainous turn as a man who wants to freeze Gotham city, Mr. Freeze. Wait a second\u0085.I think I got the wrong movie. Though Butler's over-the-top performance was far from good, he stands out as the rest of the cast seem to be completely blas\u00e9 towards this 'epic' fantasy movie.\n\nTo add insult to a mortal injury, the direction in this movie feels overly stilted and scattershot. This is particularly annoying since I used to be a fan of some Alex Proyas' early works like Dark City and The Crow. In this movie he has fully demonstrated that he cares little about the craft of filmmaking as he opts to film eye- wateringly ghastly CGI beasts duke it out.\n\nGods of Egypt is an unwatchable mess that will one day be appreciated for its laughable content and execution. Gods of Egypt gets a D or a 1.8/10."

But Hollywood is obsessed with CGI, probably because it's cheap, but it ruins more movies than it helps. With that said I gave this film a 6 because the actors were good and the story was unique and entertaining. It's not gonna win any awards, though the costumes were really cool at times, but it's not going to ruin any careers either. Worth a weekday couple of hours to watch once."

        "review_title": "A two-hour epic of bloated CGI and total cinematic nonsense",
        "review_detailed_main": "Many movie buffs may know by now that the first three months of the year consist of some of Hollywood's biggest letdowns of the year, even big-budget epics starring a few A-list actors are immune to failure. When it comes to the action-epic genre, however, the last thing we need is a fantasy adventure that descends on the level of \"so bad, it's good\" or just laughably bad. This Epygtian mythology-based fantasy epic directed by Alex Proyas who directed by criminally forgotten 'Dark City' and the surprisingly entertaining 'I,Robot', may fit in this category but it doesn't escape the ridiculously messy, CGI-crowded train wreck this is. The most difficult task to endure while sitting through this flick is spotting a single redeeming quality during the two-hour mess. This film stars Gerard Butler as Set, the god of darkness in ancient Egypt who grows jealously over the sun god'a position as King and decides to take over the throne, leading the formerly peaceful empire to plunge into chaos. With the empire gripping in fear of his reign, young thief Bek (played by Brenton Thwaites) sets out to defeat Set and save his girlfriend Maya (played by Courtney Eaton) who is held captive, with the help of Horus (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the powerful god of the desert fighting by his side.\n\nIt is difficult tell whether this is supposed a parody of big-budget epic flicks or just another fantasy flick tainted by unintentionally bad script. Either way, this movie fails miserably. Whethers it's the horrendous visual effects, the stunted acting, the painfully incoherent plot, or the overall lousy script; this movie seems to have no idea what it's trying to be. The film begins a shiny bird's eye view of the Egyptian empire that is nice to look until the camera pans down for a closer view of the environment. With the villages looking like sets we may find in a high school play and the bloated use of lightening, results in a painfully unconvincing production design representing Ancient Egypt. The rest of the time, we are left with settings consisted with cheap green screen effects and dull CGI. And it certainly doesn't help that the cast along the extras are populated with Caucasian actors, leaving an absence of any Egyptian actors. I mean a movie that takes place in Egypt and features no actual Egyptians? Come on now! And sadly, that's not the worst part. The worst past comes from the horrendous performances the cast displays. Brendon Thwaites plays the main character and throughout the entirety, never seems to bring his A-game here, either does Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as the supporting character. The biggest actor on screen is easily Gerard Butler who plays the villain, and even his role falls short of appeal. Those expecting him bringing the powerful energy he brought as Leonidas in '300' are in for a major disappointment. The only thing we get out of the acting instead, is insanely laughable dialogue that incite more laughs than anything worth taking seriously, even during the scenes that supposed to dramatic.\n\nWhen going into a epic fantasy adventure, one can easily expect to experience some flashy special effects, solid characters, and a decent, if not groundbreaking plot to keep the film moving. None of these is found here. The plot to begin with, is vastly incoherent and in the end, makes no sense. When the film is not feeding us tense action scenes, it tries it's best to develop the plot through the characters arguing constantly, when it's really just trying to fill in a two-hour runtime. Yes, Set, the main villain is trying to take over the Egyptian empire but before the first hour, we are given almost no reason to care. In brief summary, it's just boring.The action sequences along with the battle scenes are supposed to fun. In contrary, these scenes are painful to watch. It's bad enough there is lazy acting and ridiculous spiraling camera work associated with these scenes, but the special effects are plain awful to the point looking like effects seen in a B-movie. The visual effects aren't too solid either, especially with the bloated use of CGI. The computer-generated creatures may not look too inept, but they're pretty unimpressive, especially considering this generation's technology that's capable of making superior animation in video games than this. It's hard to believe how a $140 million dollar epic consists of such bad effects.\n\nGods of Egypt is an epic disaster leading up one of worst films of this year so far. This film fails at just about every aspect in terms of writing, narrative, and technicality; and the worst part, it more than likely has made itself a wide target for the Razzie awards. With this film, slacking as both an epic and unintentional parody, If you hadn't seen this movie, don't worry you're not missing anything."

I get that it needed it because it's based on gods, but I KNOW there is better computer graphics out there. It was just so obvious. I did love the music though, I love the ancient Greek theme type instruments. I only paid 6 bucks for it though because of a special at our theater, but I think if you're paying full price, I would wait and watch something else. Might be good on DVD, but not really worth it in theaters. Unless you REALLY love Gerard Butler (he is a bad guy however)"

No gore or nudity to see.\n\nI mean, in the beginning there's a murder going on with stabbing, you can see the knife going in the flesh but no blood, when he wipes his knife clean there's no spot of blood to wipe. And we do have a love scene and the so-called queen is indeed undressed but it's all filmed without showing a thing.\n\nFurther the CGI used is really good but not that superb because sometimes you could easily spot the key used to fill in the picture. Also the Gods are shown on a strange way, some faces are correct with history but Ra sitting on a ship and stuff like that, just look at Egypt itself. Where is the dessert?\n\nFor me it was more a story like the old Sinbad flicks or even the Clash Of The Titans flick(s). An immortal helping 1 God to fight against his brother God and yes, there are monsters around to defeat.\n\nSo if you think it's truth to history it isn't, it's a pure fantasy flick.\n\nGore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh God, yet ANOTHER movie about a WHITEWASHED version of Egypt. Based on ancient Egyptian mythology, Gods of Egypt features the epic journey of a mortal named Bek to save his true love from death and rescue Egypt. Along the way, he is assisted by the god of the air, Horus, who is fighting against Set, the god of darkness who has proclaimed himself the rightful ruler of Egypt. This film has everything an eager movie goer could want: an out-of-this world plot, special effects, an epic setting (who doesn't like Ancient Egypt??), romance, thrill, humor, and sweeping music. YET...it is about as accurate as watching an ALL BLACK version of 300 (Spartan movie) or Gladiator. Hollywood would be in an uproar. I'm sorry but as much as I liked the movie, I couldn't feel at ease sitting and watching a BOLD-FACED LIE. The whole time I felt like I was in some sort of DELUDED Caucasian/Asian FANTASY of an Egypt without African roots. There were just too many subtly insulting scenes in the movie to mention, but the overall feeling I got from the film was a sense of European ego-centrism. The only significant black character is Thoth, the god of wisdom; couldn't even make one goddess a Black woman even though they were often the rulers of ancient Egypt. No, the actress playing Hathor, the goddess of love, only serves to propagate racist, mainstream standards of beauty (non-black beauty), even if she's NOT blond haired and blue eyed. The idiot producers in Hollywood haven't figured it out yet (or they have and just don't want to ADMIT it)! The ORIGINAL ancient Egyptians were NUBIANS, Africans and people of color. It wasn't until the Hittites and other Caucasian peoples completely invaded Egypt that it became the diluted Egypt of today (Read The Destruction of Black Civilization by Chancellor Williams). That's why there are these delusions with some Arabs/Asians having the audacity and arrogance to somehow assume they ONLY are the true Egyptians (or denying Africans are). Look at movies like The Mummy, etc. Some may dismiss this as an Afrocentric rant and say that color doesn't matter and all that BS. But as a person of African descent, it's a little annoying to constantly have OUR history INACCURATELY portrayed by people who don't really wish to acknowledge us in the first place. STOP hijacking our history and projecting yourself into EVERY area of history you think you can do so!!! Hey Hollywood and SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT, get a clue from DREAMWORKS and have some historical accuracy. Look The Prince of Egypt, Joseph King of Dreams, and even La Reine Soleil (produced by Cinemon Studios). They got it right, and those are ANIMATED movies. Oh but why wouldn't they want to use an all- black cast? Because most whites would never want to see it, as they LACK empathy for brown/black people, as proved in scientific studies. I wouldn't be surprised if half the people watching this movie wouldn't entertain the idea of a Black Egypt. No, not just one anomaly black pharaoh but a lineage of African rulers who spanned many dynasties. All- in-all, maybe the movie would be 10 stars if they got the BASICS right."

Our spunky young mortal hero is particularly tiresome, and you'll quickly be rooting against him.\n\nMost of the cast is strictly White European, but that's fair enough if we can have Africans in Asgard.\n\nWhat's to like here? Well, it rattles along at a decent pace, and isn't over-burdened with long dialog scenes, a particular kindness given the awful script and performances. The scaling of the gods and mortals is kept generally (but not always) consistent. Sets are pretty good, although under-dressed.\n\nAgainst that, much of the CGI and green-screening is awful, comically bad for a film of its era. The score is jarring and becomes increasingly overblown, and the plot is a series of (poor) CGI actions scenes stitched together with the minimum of narrative. In one astonishing gaffe a character jumps onto what seems to be an undisguised modern airbag\n\nThe very best thing that I can say about it is that there's plenty of toned and well formed flesh on display, but you can find that on adult video sites, and the scripts and acting are of about the same standard."

I thought that there were some parts that worked out, but there were way more that didn't, and unfortunately those weak points completely detract from the overall quality of the film.\n\nFirst of all, the CGI in this movie is shockingly bad. I don't know why the film makers didn't try to polish the effects up a tad, I mean they had 140 million to work with, but for some reason, they chose to keep them as they are presented here. For a movie that quite significantly focuses on the CGI aspect of movie making, this is embarrassing.\n\nThe writing that went into the production is just as poor. It fell short on so many levels that I both laughed and cringed on multiple occasions. The acting from most of the cast (which is mostly British, weirdly enough) is sub par, and doesn't do much to add some humanity to the very lazy script.\n\nThe only things I can say I enjoyed about this movie are Nikolaj Coaster-Waldaus performance - which is the only performance that did so much as intrigue me slightly - as well as the depiction of the Ancient Egyptian setting.\n\nThis movie is mostly a complete miss, and I would not recommend it to anybody. Seriously, you'll wander why you wasted two hours of your life watching this."

(i was already very tired and sleepy when i started this on Roku free movies + ads at around 01:30a last night and was about to fall asleep involuntarily a couple of times near the end but did manage to keep awake trying not to miss a moment ...)\n\ni'll probably watch it again if i do get the time later ... preferably on a larger screen (mine's a 40\" old TOSHIBA flat screen placed about 12' from where i was sitting) and i may as well even buy a copy for keeps as it is truly worth it ...\n\nagain, forgive the not so realistic mythical storyline plus its somewhat mundane wrappings (as we ought to do in most similar cases anyway!) and just enjoy the VFX and SFX and lovely music in addition to some beautiful characters ... and you'll most probably like it just like i did! :-)"

This Americana version of the story is very poor. 2- Cinematography was truly funny, gods height was ridiculous. this variance of height between gods and humans affected much on the scenes joining both specially drama scenes. 3- There are many ridiculous visualizations of ancient Egypt, and the worst visualization prize goes to Set's high tower. It's taller than empire state 4- Editing and sound are rather good\n\nFinally , I do not recommend to watch this movie"

He steals one of Horus' eyes but his love Zaya is killed. He makes a deal with Horus to return Zaya to the living after they defeat Set. With Hathor, Goddess of Love, and Thoth (Chadwick Boseman), God of Knowledge, they set off to answer the riddle of the sphinx.\n\nThis is overloaded with CGI flash and grandeur. It's fun visually for awhile but by the end, it becomes more of the same. The climax becomes sound and fury that signifies nothing more than waiting for the end. The story is simple good versus evil. Gerard plays evil for all it's worth. Horus is selfish at the beginning. Quite frankly, Bek is also selfish. Bek and Zaya are not more than puppy love. There is no development. They are simply in love. The good guys aren't that compelling. The whitewashing controversy doesn't help either. This is not the worst but it's not worthwhile to defend either."

Really interesting movie about the story of the Egyptian gods and how they lived amongst mortals. The movie keeps you engaged throughout, the CGI was good and the morals and lessons in the story were more than satisfactory. I highly recommend this film if you lie action, mythology, fantasy and hints of romance too. Great film with a happy ending."

Nice special effects, a debatable sense of humor, and overall products that do not match their promise. Is is the screenplay, is it the actors? I am not sure, but every time with these movies, I tend to laugh at the wrong moments (strange dialogue, weird plots) and am generally underwhelmed. So many flat characters... Despite a budget of 140 million dollars, as entertainment it does not even come close to for instance The Mummy movies."

I do have to give a little credit to all the actors, considering they most likely spent day after day filming in front of a green screen. The amount of CG was one thing and the poor CG quality was another. Coaster-Waldau, although solid, could not carry the entire film. The rest of the actors were indistinguishable and generally poor.

However, the film's weakness became evident in its often cheesy dialogue and occasionally over-the-top acting, which detracted from the immersion. The music added some gravitas to the epic moments, but it wasn't particularly memorable.

        "review_detailed_main": "So there were apparently a ton of critics looking for a home-run in terms of plot and character development. That's a lot to expect from a 2 hour action movie seeking to tell an entire story. Though I sound like I'm saying it's bad in these aspects, I thought they did a great job of explaining the characters and creating a clearly understandable story. It's not as there is a narrator walking you through the events. If you pay attention to the actual depiction of the story rather than something ridiculous such as an actor's accent in a story where gods roam the Earth, all the events will be clear to you. Somehow, critics have the magical power to ignore what an author portrays by trying to nit-pick all the clich\u00e9s and tiny inconsistencies. If you become immersed within this movie and accept what might be normally odd in the modern world, the story will transcend being simply a cgi thriller. The cgi is in fact extraordinarily well-done, but the purpose is to make this impossible world come to life. The characters portrayed their roles excellently. There were only 2 parts which were rather silly, but after each of these events was a scene that was rather reconciling. The fight scenes also don't look like mindless exchanges of punches, stabs, and pointless movement, but was rather well choreographed and you could trace each action. Both the beginning and ending were great, and I left feeling thoroughly satisfied. Even my mother who normally despises action movies felt that it was terrific."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hollywood's take on ancient Egypt is like slapping a spoiler on a donkey cart: it makes no sense, but you can't help but chuckle. Gods of Egypt kicks off with Osiris about to hand the throne to his son Horus-until Uncle Seth crashes the party like a drunk relative at Christmas, killing everyone in sight. The result? Chaos engulfs the kingdom, and Horus gets his butt handed to him. Nothing groundbreaking here, except for the CGI-packed battles that feel like a glitchy DLC for Assassin's Creed Origins.\n\nTo save the day, Horus teams up with Bek, a mortal thief. Why? Apparently, even gods need an intern for their rescue missions. Bek is like a less charismatic Aladdin with a questionable accent. But hey, he's good at climbing walls and loves his girlfriend, so we let it slide. Their partnership delivers action scenes that sit somewhere between Prince of Persia and Fast & Furious in slow motion.\n\nThe gods? Think Avengers on steroids. Shiny armor, ridiculous animal transformations, and battles that could make Thor blush after a night of heavy drinking. Alex Proyas goes all-in on special effects but seems to have misplaced the script in the process. Special shoutout to Gerard Butler's Seth, a villain with a Scottish accent who looks like he wandered onto the wrong set. Even Butler seems confused about why he's there.\n\nAs for Egyptian mythology? Don't expect accuracy. This is full-on freestyle mode. Pyramids crumble, gods bleed gold (or is it acacia honey?), and mortals seem to have better survival odds than public transport during a strike. But hey, it's flashy, fun, and you'll walk away with some random party trivia-like \"Seth was kind of a jerk.\"\n\nThis isn't Gladiator, but Gods of Egypt gets the job done. Sure, the pacing stumbles, and the plot is as predictable as an episode of Days of Our Lives, but you can't help but enjoy the cosmic chaos.\n\nGods of Egypt is like a kebab at 3 a.m.: greasy, overstuffed, and a bit of a mess, but undeniably entertaining. Proyas delivers a fantastical epic that fully embraces its kitsch, with blinged-out gods and gloriously absurd battles. Watch it once-with a beer in hand and your expectations firmly in check."

        "review_detailed_main": "He was said to be born of a virgin and his birth came to be celebrated on or about December 25th. As a baby, he was depicted in a stable scene, lying in a manger, with the image of his mother beside him. He was considered the light of the world, an avenger against the power of darkness and, as such, the savior of mankind. According to many historical sources, including the writings of former Catholic priest Joseph McCabe, this was the mythology surrounding the ancient Egyptian god Horus in the centuries before the birth of Jesus. Horus is the central character in the CGI-heavy fantasy film \"Gods of Egypt\" (PG-13, 2:07).\n\nThe film, however, focuses more on Horus' deeds as a god than how he was worshipped. The plot is very loosely based on ancient Egyptian mythology, particularly the story \"The Contendings of Horus and Set\", and takes place at a time in Egyptian pre-history when it was believed that gods lived among humans. These gods aren't omniscient, omnipotent, or immortal, but they can live over 1,000 years, they bleed gold, they can be resurrected if killed, they have special powers (like turning into the birds and animals that symbolize them in ancient mythology) and they're about three feet taller than most adult humans. Naturally, the humans serve these earth-inhabiting gods. In return, they protect Egypt and its people.\n\nAs the movie opens, the god Osiris (Bryan Brown) is about to crown his son, Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) God-King of Egypt. The other gods have turned out for the ceremony, along with all the puny mortals, including an arrogant and self-righteous young man called Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and his girlfriend, Zaya (Courtney Eaton), who is sporting the dress that Bek stole for her to wear at the coronation. But, alas, this coronation was not to be. Seconds before Horus was to receive the crown, Osiris' brother Set (Gerard Butler) shows up to totally spoil the party. Tired of ruling the isolated desert regions of Egypt and unhappy with being passed over for the throne of all Egypt, he stabs Osiris, gouges out the \"all seeing\" eyes of Horus and claims the throne for himself. He then presents the crowd this choice: worship him or be enslaved. What a jerk! The noble and selfless warrior from \"300\", Set is not.\n\nLife in Egypt really goes downhill for both humans and gods with Set in charge. He kills other gods who get in his way and he forces the people to work on his massive construction projects. Zaya ends up working for the mean and nasty Urshu (Rufus Sewell), Set's chief architect. Zaya, who still believes in the power and basic goodness of the other gods, convinces Bek to go find Horus and convince him to come out of hiding and help Egypt. But it's not that simple. First, there's that whole blindness thing. Bek breaks into Set's vault, survives enough booby traps to impress Indiana Jones and is able to make off with one of Horus' eyes. Secondly, Bek has to convince an exiled and bitter god to help the insignificant little humans. Bek accomplishes that as well, but with only one of his eyes, Horus' powers are limited.\n\nHorus and Bek are going to need a lot of help. Horus prays to his grandfather, the sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush), who transports Horus and Bek up to his space-based solar barge from which he battles the powers of darkness. Ra chooses to stay neutral in the power struggle between his son and nephew and does very little to aid Horus. Back on earth, with only Bek at his side, Horus has to try enlisting the help of Horus' former lover and now Set's wife, Hathor (Elodie Yung), Thoth (Chadwick Boseman), who is the God of Wisdom, not to mention Anubis, the lord of the underworld. Even with the help that he's able to gather, defeating Set looks to be nearly impossible. Now, I won't tell you how the movie ends, except to say that the last scene sets up a possible sequel \u2013 but not likely, considering how poorly this movie did.\n\n\"Gods of Egypt\" isn't the grand fantasy epic that it clearly wants to be. The quality of the CGI is mostly pretty impressive, but some of the visuals (like Ra's aircraft carrier-looking space barge) border on the laughable. More importantly, overblown special effects are a poor substitute for a good story. The film's plot points are alternately confusing, non-sensical and silly, as is much of the script's dialog. Take the character of Bek for example. While the gods helping the people and people standing up to the gods is indeed part of ancient mythology, the attempt to put modern phrases into Bek's mouth feels out of place and his attitude probably should have gotten him squashed like a bug by any self-respecting deity.\n\nIt doesn't help that the actor playing Bek lacked the charisma to sell this silliness. He's not alone. Most of the acting was of poor quality and the glaring omission of actual Egyptians in the cast made things even worse. This movie is all style and little substance. Pre-teen boys may like it, but if you're outside that relatively narrow demographic, you should probably pray to the gods that you don't have to spend two hours with this highly-fictionalized cinematic interpretation of ancient Egypt's rich mythology. \"C-\""

Otherwise you are better off skipping the rest. Those 20 minutes of the movie though have some pretty imaginative battles with the Gods being shape-shifters. The VFX are composited well sometimes and other time they simply drop the ball. There are some very awkward shots with the giant gods and tiny humans side by side, it just looks terrible compared to something like Lord of the Rings which was made long before this film."

Not white either, but not black. And does it really a problem? Did the performance of Laurence Olivier as Othello (a character who IS black) bothers anyone? No. The director of Gods of Egypt is Alex Proyas, who was born in Egypt. I guess he was well aware of his country's history when he made the casting choices. And he has the right to choose anyone he wants. He is the director. Not the director of a documentary or a drama that's based on a true story. He is the director of a fantasy movie. Yes, the mythology has been around for thousands of years, but it's still a fantasy movie where Horus and other gods exist. None of this happened, so no one should look for historic accuracy. Let's move on.\n\nI felt this movie is like Clash of Titans or Prince of Persia. It's not flawless. It's absolutely forgettable. It's 15 minutes longer than it should be. The CGI (when Horus and Seth transformed) is cartoonish. BUT: It's entertaining! The production design and the cinematography is great! I've always loved the Egyptian myth, and I was glad to see this movie's world was creative and visually great to look at. The music is solid. I liked the actors and their characters. For me, Chadwick Boseman had the best part in the movie. Minor role, but I loved every second of it. And I liked that neither of the main heroes is a comic relief.\n\nYes, the script was not the best, but I've seen some blockbusters in the past one year (like Mad Max: Fury Road, Furious 7, etc.) that were loved by critics and viewers but had no superior script.\n\nOnce again, GODS OF Egypt is not for everyone, but it is for some. I didn't regret I watched it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gods of Egypt is meant to sell itself primarily on the visual effects spectacle - not unlike, going back some generations, to those dopey but entertaining special effects extravaganzas with work by Ray Harryhausen and featuring a stock of memorable creations amid a sea of lame-to-competent acting and direction. But now it's 2016 and with this movie, not even the CGI on 1990's XENA TV series (if you've ever seen that and know what I mean) was this cartoonishly awful. If it had been a SyFy channel movie I might accept it. As a 100+ million dollar extravaganza, it's almost a nightmare - too long (at 127 minutes it feels like 187), and it's got story turns and characters that... wait, what characters? This is the kind of movie that gives a major talent like Geoffrey Rush little to do but spout platitudes and be set on fire shooting at things.\n\nSome of this is so stupid I found myself laughing - a lot - but not in the places I'd think Proyas half expected people to do so. And no one, not even poor Gerard Butler, can get enough energy to possibly ham or camp it up, but the serious delivery doesn't allow for many rewards for the viewer looking for good OR bad movie fun. Most motivations are weak and things involving how this world works can sometimes turn on a dime and not make sense anymore (it'd take too long to go into some of the things that are not nitpicks but glaring, holy-s***-how-did-anyone-let-this-pass flaws), and despite a consistency to the look of the world and the characters, perhaps the director's only strong suit in coralling so many elements together, it's all for a story and heroes/villains/Gods/side Gods/hot-Goddesses that is dead on arrival.\n\nWhat have you lizard people done with Alex Proyas?"

As for the actual characters, I was surprised at how some gods were so weak. The actors matched the characters they portrayed aside from the fact that some looked so old when as a god, I don't think they needed to look that way. Battle music could have been an addition they could have done. The transformations were super cool. I would highly recommend this movie. It is one of my favourites and will probably be wanting to see it again in theatres."

        "review_detailed_main": "Many people, including myself saw the trailer for Gods of Egypt and automatically concluded that this film would be not so good. It had a negative controversy/reaction due to the casting choices. Especially since it takes place in Egypt. The CGI didn't look all that impressive, and overall I believe it didn't receive a fair chance. I decided to give it a fair chance, and I wasn't all that impressed.\n\nObviously, this isn't a representation of the real Egypt. This story is pure fantasy. What you have here are The Gods of Egypt getting together. Things don't go according to plan, that a$$hole Set, played by Gerard Butler (300, Olympus Has Fallen) has to have complete control over Egypt, and take over everything. Set kills, and even takes out his own nephew Horus. If Set weren't bad enough, he has to dig into Horus' face and pull out his eyeballs too. One day Horus meets Bek, played by Brenton Thwaites (Maleficent, The Giver). Bek and Horus work together to stop Set. Will Horus overcome Set's cruel rule over Egypt? Will the land of the pharaohs regain peace once again? Only time will tell.\n\nNo out of all the controversy this film has gotten, Hollywood can keep this silly ass Egypt for all I care, because I sure as Hell don't want it. This movie is not good; it's Egypt on acid. The plot is loose, the history is to fantasized, and the characters are just white yogurt and plain as you can get. Call me crazy, but I think Jupiter Ascending is more scientifically correct and accurate than Gods of Egypt. They emphasis the CGI over story, which I will never understand why they do this. CGI should be used to enhance the story. The actors really do try, but the source material isn't there for them to work to the best of their abilities. Also, why is Gerard Butler the only man in Ancient Egypt with a mixture of a British and Scottish accent? (TONIGHT WE DINE IN KEMET!)\n\nI know it sounds like I'm over writing about the CGI, but I've seen video games that look more realistic than this. I've read children's books with more character development than this. 140 million dollars went into this film, and I've seen movies that go straight to the Chiller and Sci-fi channel that look far superior than this. This film is directed by Alex Proyas (director of The Crow and I 'Robot). I personally enjoy those films, and yes they are also visually stunning. But they had a compelling story around it unlike this film.\n\nSo these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the movie Gods of Egypt. I know it sounds like I'm ranting, but if you haven't seen this film, you can skip it. It's way too much CGI, the Gods are weak, it's sexist, characters are boring, the story is loose, the characters are paper thin. The actors do try; sadly they are the only ones I believe put some effort into this project. I believe it's bland, and made for a quick dollar. I found it to be funny, even though that is not the tone. It's some bland B.S. I believe that Gods of Egypt earns a\u0085\n\n3/10.\n\nThis review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading and or viewing, and I hope you have an amazing day as always. :)"

The motivation of all the characters is ridiculous and the only ones trying to put some dignity on it are Geoffrey Rush and Gerald Butler. You can see they are trying to convey some emotion. Other than that, his work is terrible. Nobody is saved. The excess of cgi is boring especially at the end. The film does not offer an adequate closure, it is sweetened and leaves bitterness since there is neither passion nor intrigue. Bad."

I did however enjoy myself and had a laugh, and squirm on the way.\n\nEffects are pretty spectacular to say the least, and the story is told in a way that that mandates you chill and switch off from the everyday.\n\nAfter reading some of the trash reports, I suspect people are too full-on about everything these days, too ego centric... Lighten up people, it's a blockbuster, it's a bit of this and a bit of that, and a bit of something new and old.\n\nDamn fun if you can unplug from the politically correct madness of Hollywoood at the moment.

It's cringe after cringe of the worst sins a film can commit, to the point where one wonders if they have tried on purpose to make the worst film they could.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe costumes are gorgeous. If these costumes had been used in any other setting, they would really have helped in making a great film.\n\nMore Leonidas than before. We can't get enough of that one character Gerald Butler played in 300, so we get a second helping here.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nMassive CGI overload. It's not \"bad CGI\", but there is just so much of it, the eye notices more. Also, there's just more detail on screen than there is in the same objects in real life, making it super obvious.\n\nHorrible acting; the actors don't even attempt to fit the characters, aside form Butler, they just read their lines, which results in half the cast sounding like they just got out of Jersey Shore, and half trying to ham it up (FORGIVE ME FATHER, I HAVE OVERACTED !!).\n\nDespite what the title implies, AND the multiple mentions of Egypt, Gods Of Egypt is not set in Egypt, nor is it set in the past, but rather, this is a completely fictional film set into some parallel world with a limited resemblance of Egypt.\n\nThe director seems influenced by small screen film, such as music videos; i find it hard to believe it's the same guy who directed the excellent Dark City.\n\nThe script, worst guilty party in this film, tries to cram as much garbage on the screen as it possibly can .. i haven't seen something this bad since Episode I.\n\nThe plot isn't as horrible as the rest of the film, but it is however overshadowed by the rest of the garbage piling up on top of it, such as, for example, the dialogue. One scene can have comedy, tragedy, action and violence, sadness, amazement, all crammed into the same 3 minutes.\n\nI suppose that, after all, Gods Of Egypt does have a few things going for it, some scenes are visually impressive, mostly due to the sh*tton of money they have thrown at the screen, but i can't count one which isn't spoiled by something, be it greenscreen, some actor chewing the scenery, horrible dialogue, or simply the constant, relentless abuse of CGI.\n\nSo, Gods Of Egypt is garbage. If you are no older than 15, and you want to see a 2-hour video game cutscene (and also have very low standards for acting), then this film is for you; if you are older, or simply want to watch an actual film, properly made, then i suggest you skip this monstrosity.\n\nMy vote: 4/10 - revolting."

One of the opening scenes has the camera sweeping in from a distance to a bustling and thriving Egypt during the early times of the Pyramids. I thought okay, that was cool but I purposefully kept my expectations low for the time being. To my surprise the visually stunning cinematography didn't stop there. The movie presents each and every scene up on a golden platter with an eye for opulence and bejeweled detail. The storyline, while not bad takes a back seat to the non-stop sensory overload of what you're seeing. It imagines the unimaginable and takes you there in a good way. The unearthly spectral realm is treated with due respect and given a realistic authenticity. This movie dresses you up in gold from head to toe then dangles you out over a ledge. The story and acting didn't really affect my opinion either way. This movie is an experience to be enjoyed like a roller coaster ride.

What annoyed me most was that all backgrounds were vague, something like bad photoshoped skies or desert sands.\n\nIt's a pity they made it like that. It could have been a better movie if they had used more solid backgrounds, real scenery and more slow pace. The casting (although more Nordic than Egyptian) had great names that could have taken the film to satisfactory levels, if there was any dialogue that is! I think the 1st time the actors actually acted was somewhere in the middle of the movie and then words faded away again, leaving their place to foggy cgi.\n\nThere was however some good material, like some traits of production design, a couple of action scenes and a couple of Courtney Eaton's assets, but other than that, the movie is as alive as the 2 pita-soulvakis I ate watching it."

The characters are cardboard people and the main hero's girlfriend's awesome boobs have more personality.\n\nGerard Butler chews up and spits out the scenery and he was made my favourite part.\n\nSome of the CGI looks pretty cool whereas at other times it looks really bad.

        "review_detailed_main": "If you google 'Gods of Egypt' and click on the reviews available on Rotten Tomatoes you will find an amusing paraphrase of PB. Shelley's great sonnet 'Ozymandias' which reads: \"Look on Gods of Egypt, ye filmgoers, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay of this colossal wreck, boundless and bare. The lone and level sands stretch far away.\" I have quoted these lines because to me they are an accurate description of this brainless, soulless, insipid film. Despite featuring a solid cast, 'Gods of Egypt' is a massive failure which follows the standard formula of a conventional and boring action film with uninteresting characters and careless dialogue and stupid fantasy sequences. It is a fatally flawed and creatively inept effort. I will never understand why this film has got at least a 5.4 / 10 in this platform, it really doesn't deserve to pass. It takes away the fun of the sophisticated and fascinating Egyptian pantheon of deities. Overall it feels like a video game, not like a film. Come one, just look at the poster, it is telling you: 'This is going to be a bad film'. The elaborate visual effects and its cast are the only merits I can see in this deeply flawed adventure movie. You can watch it if there's nothing else in TV, and you'll probably be entertained by its lifeless fun. But on the whole this is a godless vision of Egypt.\n\nGrade: 2.3 / 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: After an epic beginning, I was quite impressed with this movie but the storyline was all over the place. The director kept on adding new elements, which spoilt the flow of the movie, which could have been much simpler if he would have just stuck to the good vs. evil concept. The main character, Bek (Brenton Thwaites), was quite annoying throughout the film but Gerard Butler was great as the evil Set. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau also played Horus quite well and the extravagant scenery was well put together by the director but it did look a bit over the top in places. He certainly took full advantage of today's CGI abilities but the epic journey did seem slightly unrealistic. In terms of entertainment, it reminded me of John Carter, which also had a massive budget but it didn't really smash the box office, and I can just imagine how hard it must have been for the actors, who spent most of the time talking and fighting against objects that wasn't really there. It was good to see Butler back in 300 mode, and Geoffrey Rush was great as Ra but the storyline really let this movie down, which is a shame because all of the efforts which were put into the visual effects, was pretty good. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up: This movie was directed by Alex Proyas, 52, who also brought you the Crow in 1994, Dark City, I, Robot in 2004, with Will Smith and Knowing in 2009, with Nicolas Cage. He's not one to take on many projects, because I can just imagine how long this film and some of his previous movies, must have taken to make. He definitely has a track record of using a lot of visual effects, so this project was a great choice for him but the writing really wasn't that great. It was written by Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpness, who also brought you Dracula Untold, The Last Witch Hunter and the upcoming Power Rangers movie, so judging by there previous projects, I'm not surprised with the way that this movie turned out. I was expecting it to make more money at the box office but it obviously didn't go down too well with audiences. The critics didn't put it down like they did with John Carter but it still seemed to come in and out of the top ten for that period, really quickly.\n\nBudget: $140million Worldwide Gross: $146million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/fantasy/adventure movies, starring Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Bryan Brown, Chadwick Boseman, Rufus Sewell, Courtney Eaton, Elodie Yung and Geoffrey Rush. 5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Gods of Egypt (2016) Starring: Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Chadwick Boseman, Elodie Yung, Geoffrey Rush, Courtney Eaton, Rufus Sewell, Abbey Lee Kershaw, Bryan Brown, Emma Booth, Goran D. Kleut, and Emily Wheaton Directed By: Alex Proyas Review The battle for eternity begins When the film came out earlier this year I knew very little about it, just that it had to do with Gods, mortals and had Gerard Butler. I have been looking into sword and sorcery films as of late and am going to have a marathon for those types of films next once I own all the films I need but while I searching up the sub-genre on facebook I saw that Gods of Egypt was one so I decided to review it now because I'm mostly going to cover the 80s fantasy ones for my marathon. An opening voice-over states that according to a legend, Egypt was the birthplace of civilization. The gods co-existed among the mortals and created the flourishing land for them to share. The son of Ra, Osiris, ruled over the land, while his brother Set was relegated to the desert, to his anger. The time has come for Horus, the son of Osiris, to take his place as king.\n\nA mortal young man named Bek (Brenton Thwaites) steals a dress from a vendor in the market to give to his beloved Zaya (Courtney Eaton). They are preparing to go to the coronation event later that day.\n\nHorus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is passed out from a wild event of drinking with the gods the previous night. His beloved woman is Hathor (Elodie Yung), the goddess of love.\n\nThe time comes for the coronation to take place. Bek and Zaya, along with nearly the whole city, is in attendance. Osiris (Bryan Brown) and his wife Isis (Rachael Blake) bring their son forward and are prepared to pass leadership to him, when Set (Gerard Butler) arrives at the last minute with a gift for Horus, a battle horn. Horus blows into it, summoning Set's army to the front. Turns out Set is staging a coup against his brother and nephew. He demands Osiris to battle him, but he refuses. Set stabs Osiris in the abdomen, leaving him to bleed gold and die. Enraged, Horus transforms into his winged god form, while Set morphs into his dog-like form. They battle in front of everyone, but Set gains the upper hand and is ready to kill Horus until Hathor kneels before him so that Horus may be spared. Set orders all the gods and mortals to kneel before him, and he plucks out both of Horus's all-seeing eyes.\n\nA year passes, and all of Egypt is under Set's rule. Those who do not follow him are either left dead or thrown into slavery, like Zaya. Bek frequently visits her in secrecy while her cruel master Urshu (Rufus Sewell) tends to his business with Set, which is building monuments in his honor. Zaya says that only Horus can save them, but he needs his eyes, which are kept in Set's vaults.\n\nThe plot is interesting and the cast is pretty good but when you get to the CG I mean it is just a mess It is a big giant computer your looking at when the Gods transform I mean you can feel the pixels coming off the screen. The adventure is grand in scale which is great. This looks like a great new sword/sorcery epic but with the lousy effects that's just one huge thing that brings it down. Along with a stupid decision or rather pointless made by Hathor. You'll get it if you some reason plan to see this mess. It didn't click with me because of how much it just looked like one big video game cut scene and I didn't or rather much couldn't get into the characters. Director Alex Proyas has made some pretty decent films in the past, I really enjoy I. Robot with Will Smith and I've good things about Dark City. But with this and Knowing he's become much worse. I'm going to be giving Gods of Egypt a two out of five its just terrible."

Everyone else at least fell into the fantasy hair style, costume look the audience is used to.\n\nUnfortunately more laughs were induced in our audience of teens to forty-somethings - all in the wrong places.

The earth is shown flat as a pancake - Ra goes over the edge to go the \"flip side\". Thus this is not the Egypt we know in real life, but a fantasy one. Therefore all the hubbub about incorrect ethnic casting can be ignored.\n\nThis fantasy world is consistently imagined. Sure the plots are nothing special and some of the action seemed to have been lifted from other films or even video games. And the CGI was glitchy sometimes (edge of wings). But it is overall visually satisfying and I found myself caring for some of the characters (e.g. Hathor).\n\nBut I wished that they had shown that the body parts of the other gods survived the death of Set, and that the Architect found that his jewels were for nothing at the final gate since Horus changed the rules."

Eight or ten fight scenes or harrowing escapes would be plenty. After that, the viewer's mind begins to numb.\n\nThe first 20-30 minutes were fine, to me, although the characters could have used more development. You can almost imagine the director saying, \"We need to get through this stuff so the CGI guys can take over. That's what they want to see!\" Even after the story is launched, the interludes where we get to learn more about the characters were too brief. Bek was an entertaining, Ulysses-like character with some great lines, and Zaya was endearing and a feast for the eyes. They might have saved the film with more time on-screen. But no, they disappeared in a headlong rush of CGI-driven scenes where there's no real feeling of peril, just raging gods and goddesses, collapsing buildings, strange creatures slithering around, and Geoffrey Rush imagining what he's going to do to his agent after he gets off work.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I know it's a fantasy movie, and it is imaginary gods we're talking about. I also know that people who pay ten bucks for a ticket and fifteen more for popcorn and a Coke expect to go home having been entertained. But I think more focus on the characters, and a running length of 100 minutes, would have made this a much better movie."

It seemed very uninspired and even cheap, which is generally not good for this type of movie. Unfortunately, this premonition did not deceive me.\n\nThe plot is not important. It's too generic! Here one god kills another, a son tries to avenge his father - it doesn't work out. Everything is bad. Mortals are slaves, just like other gods. A hero is found who takes the side of the exiled God, Horus. And a generic story about the noble rebellion begins.\n\nIt is clear that the script is not the best thing in the film. It's common for a blockbuster to focus on staging action... However, the CGI is somehow even worse.\n\nIt's funny that the Gods (Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) at least try to express a couple of basic emotions, which cannot be said about the \"mortal\" (Brenton Thwaites). The latter does not express any emotions when misfortune happens to the girl he loves... absolutely terrible acting.\n\nAs a result, Gods of Egypt is one of those films that you can still watch at the end of a difficult work or school day. There will be nothing special here, but it can serve as some kind brain fast-food if you're really bored or just want to turn your mind off for a couple of hours."

The larger than mortal Gods does not work as a special effect here.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie to anyone for any reason unless you need some background noise to fill the silence."

Being faithful to a mythological story is sometimes tricky when you want to make a good movie without being ridiculous but, nowadays, audience is more used to fantasy movies and fantastic stories so producer, writers and directors can be more bold. Maybe that's the fault, maybe a story based on a mythology (which means old funny religion) is a good ground for a stunning, eye candy, nonsense movie. The many discrepancies and anachronisms are often too much to allow this film to be called Gods of Egypt. The gods hierarchy is messed, the earth is depicted as flat (really??) while we know perfectly that Egyptians were perfectly aware of the roundness of our planet. and (once again after Stargate) gods (RAH) looks more like aliens (not that crap again) than deities. Worth a look but not the box of popcorn and, certainly, not the cost of the disc."

        "review_title": "Interesting movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "Great movies on ancient Egypt are always very interesting and quite captivating. I've always paid some kind of interest in mythology for whatever reason because whether you like it or not they are in a similar way to soap operas with a little bit more action. There was almost everything in terms of ingredients in regards to what one should expect from such a movie. A hot spice of betrayal, romance, adventure, some humour and action. In other words, something you would very certainly enjoy in couple or in family.\n\nFirst, I have to say that Elodie Yung for instance is the real incarnation of perfection. She is unlimited with her beauty and I'm not sure of another type of profile that could embody this role. She is graceful and suits the role of a princess/goddess in a variety of ways and to perfection. She has a certain sense of humor, of entitlement, class and elitism that I really did appreciate.\n\nOn the scenario itself, it was interesting and actually did make sense till the end. However, the romance around Courtney Eaton became annoying after a certain time and I did feel that it could have been tempered a little bit. I understand that they love themselves and I also understand that in Greek mythology there has always been these kinds love struggles but I found that was a certain form of obsession for her. I know they love themselves, but that was becoming a little bit overbearing.\n\nThe action scenes were sometimes quite impressive to say the least though one could see that they were entirely manufactured through digital process but this was not enough to disrupt the overall good quality.\n\nWhile there was some visible scenes of humour, I think this aspect could have probably been explored a little bit more with the characters. I think there was attempts but that trait was underused quite a bit. For example, the whole scene when they were on their way to meet Chadwick Boseman including the one where they were actually with him had some interesting sequences of humour which were not entirely pushed to their advantage. Knowingly, this was not a comedy but I did think that it brought a different perspective.\n\nGlobally, the main negative point is related to the animations of the gods when they transformed themselves. Like I had previously said, on some aspects you could see the computer at work. Some of them lacked fluidity and natural feel compared to the rest.\n\nFinally, to continue on the environment, some of the landscapes did also lack a certain feel of reality for the same reasons. That scene with the horses for instance with Courtney Eaton, you could easily see the green background.\n\nDespite these small technical detail, from an overall standpoint they were quite beautiful and there was a lot of variety into which the characters were placed. Generally, this is one aspect that I appreciate in movies related to mythology. You get a wide array of characters and unexpected elements that make them fascinating. This generally makes the movie extremely dynamic and interesting for the spectator.\n\nI would say in general, this was a good movie that I would recommend."

I think the movie suffers from the fact that they were doing something new with the Egyptian gods being bigger than man and having to match that up (of course that does not explain the other effects). Definitively nothing to brag about, just made my eyes water.\n\nNot fully familiar with all the Gods of Egypt and I was hoping this movie would change that. I don't know if the movie was using a actual tale of the Gods or was this an original story starring the Gods of Egypt. Either way the story was bland. Most of this had to do with both heroes of the movie, Horus the god and Bek the mortal by his side, being so uninteresting.\n\nI thought the supporting cast was a lot better. Chadwick Boseman as Thoth was amusing and so was Gerard Butler as Set (but I don't think that was the plan). The two girls that are in the movie are beautiful, but forgettable in their roles, plus Geoffrey Rush was kind of a waste of time.\n\nI have to say skip this one, definitely. There is not enough positive elements in the movie that justify going to see it.\n\nIt's a real snooze."

The special effects and designs were stunning, representing the Egyptian gods in new, yet very adequate ways, except maybe for Horus who looked like a golden Iron Man, the rest of the characters looked gorgeous. And the monsters were also amazing. The backgrounds made me wish I could jump inside the screen and live there, just so surrel and marvelous they were designed.\n\nBut the plot....was that a gameplay I was watching? Seriously, I could pretty much tell what was a bossfight, a sidequest, a NPC talking, a RESPAW, an upgrade, even that moment of Set and the pieces of other gods felt like an RPG character and his inventory! Brain of Tot, wisdow +5, wings of Nemphis, agility 10+, eye of horus, Accuracy +20. WHich also made this movie completely TRAMPLE the Egyptian mythology. Oh yea, the gods of Egypt do have their OWN story and it's much better than this movie's. Whoever wrote the script really had a lot of ideas, but simply wasn't fit for a movie.

So much is going on and that's one of the reasons I love adventure movies. The cinematography and the CGI are fantastic. You really enter another world without hesitation. This Is Pagan Friendly Film About the Egyptian Gods! There's no camp here. The Egyptian Gods are respected and feel quite real. This is a story about love, hormones, real courage and dare I SAY SELF-SACRIFICE! Yes! There is a really positive spiritual message in the Gods of Egypt.Wow!"

I digress.\n\nRegarding the movie...\n\nThe special effects were neat enough to keep my kids (ages < 7) attention. However I found myself disinterested. I walked out the room to multitask during the apex battle of the movie; which should tell you something. They could've stop trying to remotely pull this poorly written plot together and cut 30 mins off the movie. It felt like someone read a couple paragraphs regarding Egyptian history on Wikipedia, then just took off with their own interpretation. I get it's fantasy and we're supposed to just let everything go, but it turns into a CGI fest where you'd rather see special effects than see any dialogue whatsoever.\n\nI wouldn't suggest this movie, but it is something to have on the TV while you're doing something else productive."

Its heavy reliance on seriously flawed & cartoonish visual effects for its flare and climactic scenes, was a mistake, as its cheapness was glaring and disengaging. The cinematic acting of its lesser named, yet gorgeous stars is another irritant, mirroring soap opera actors, where talents are foregone for eye candy's sake.\n\nGods of Egypt then, is definitely in play as one of the worst 2016 has to offer. It opens our eyes to the reality that not all filmmakers who dare venture to ancient epics, are Zack Synders. Some are Alex Proyas' whose offerings resemble B movies at most."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm truly divided when it comes to reviewing this movie. First of all it's not a good movie, the acting was cheesy, the characters are beyond annoying, 80% is CGI/green screen, the story/script is half baked and the tone of the movie jumps from comedy to action to drama. But damn what did I have a good time watching this. Now LET ME EXPLAIN!!\n\nMost of you all know that I'm a man of nostalgia. I love things that can pull my nostalgia strings \uf04a and boy did this movie do that and in spades. Why you may ask? Well let me tell you. Movies these days, good or bad, have become too serious and gritty, which isn't a bad thing. However, because of this I've noticed that a specific genre of movies have been dying out. Namely, fun adventure movies, or fun action flicks or just fun movies. How long has it been since you've seen an action movie in the vein of demolition man, commando, or (to stay in the theme of the movie) the mummy. Movies that can take you on an adventure and not take itself too seriously without emphasizing the humor.\n\nDAMN Henny you're OLD!! That may be the case, but let me ask you (everyone older than 25 :P ) don't you miss fun movies? Movies with one liners, adventures with ridiculous plots, a basic message like \"be good\", and just have a good time watching it? NO? Hmmm . Well I do miss it and this movie brought me back to that time when these movies were the standard and not the exception.\n\nGods of Egypt hearkens back to a time of simpler movie making. A homage to the times of old. However, the question remains if this was the intention of the director. If it is I find it surprising that Alex Proyas, one of the founders of gritty and serious movies like The Crow and Dark City would make something like this.\n\nNow let me sum it all up and quickly end this review (since everyone thinks that my reviews are too long).\n\nThe story: The movie is about the Egyptian gods of old and during a coronation of the god Horus (aka the protagonist) his uncle staged a coup d'etat and took the kingdom and his eyes away from him. After that we follow a mortal boy named Beck (sidekick) whom steals the eyes back. And together they go on an adventure to take revenge.\n\nThe bad: I've already summed up most of the bad in the introduction. What I do want to add is that the movie is too long: 2 hours. It was hard to keep my attention. I would cut 30 minutes from it. The movie also wasn't balanced, switching from a slow pace to a fast face. They should have cut some of the action and spend more time on character development and MYTHOLOGY building.\n\nThe good: It was fun for the most part but it is a shame that they didn't make the script more compact. I truly liked the cinematography (even though it was mostly cgi). But I especially liked the design of the movie. I thought it was original how they have given the mythological creatures form. And I truly liked the cheesy performance of every character (except the sidekick).\n\nThree-Act-Structure: The movie has a fun interesting beginning, lazy middle, and an acceptable ending.\n\nSo should I recommend this movie? Absolutely NOT. If you truly want to visit the good old times just re-watch the old movies. This was fun for me since I had nothing better to do but it isn't worth your time.\n\nI'm feeling generous today and I'll give this movie a: 5.5"

What can I say, forget about Lenin's useful morons and their thought police whining about the cast. Nobody freaking cares, besides real Egyptians have way more to worry about lately than getting their movie careers off the ground.\n\nThe plot takes a bit of a back seat to the incredible effects and visual treats but its pretty decent. At least the characters aren't running around chasing some idiot ring that only destroys them...This actually is a film about mythology with plenty of dazzling action and the good old tried and true absolute evil vs the power of love. In a weird kind of way it reminded me a bit of The Risen (another great film by the way) There are similar themes woven through both movies surprisingly.\n\nThe movie is rated low here cause Bernie's politically correct wanna be tyrants come on here in hordes and slam films that don't have a communist slant. Ignore that bs and go see this amazing cinematic miracle."

        "review_detailed_main": "If Denzel Washington were cast as the emperor of Rome, that decision would be rightfully assaulted on every platform of social media. Yet this, and every other film about ancient Egypt casts a white actor as the ruler of Egypt.\n\n\"Europeans\" of Egypt is yet another demonstration of \"liberal\" \"inclusive\" \"progressive\" Hollywood's propagation of white supremacy. They even included the typical token black character as they often do to ease their hypocritical, liberal conscience. Now that I know (according to Hollywood) Europeans ruled Egypt as Kings, Queens, and Gods; and they created the universe, my indoctrination is complete.\n\nIt is extremely unfortunate that due to their inherit racism, Hollywood glorifies all things historically white such as Greece, Rome, and England. I can't count the amount of movies based on these three sick and depraved civilizations. The extremely rare occasion Hollywood puts money into a period-based, non-white civilization, they cannot resist themselves and must use even those civilizations to glorify White Supremacy by inserting Europeans into the roles of leadership, royalty, and Gods.\n\nI am sorry if this reality stings a few toes, which is not my intent. I am just sick to my teeth of Hollywood liberals preaching inclusiveness and diversity, when their films are anything but inclusive beyond the typical token-black character. When it comes to rubber meeting the road, and non-white actors getting lead roles, their White Supremacy propaganda films are anything but inclusive. This film, Europeans of Egypt, is additional proof of their \"progressive\" hypocrisy.\n\nAs to the story, the overall imaginary premise gave this film potential. Unfortunately the dull writing, clumsy plot, and cartoony CGI fails to meet any mark. Europeans of Egypt writing and imaginary effects reminds me of the writing and effects of the 1930's sci-fi series, Flash Gordon.\n\nIf you just want to see a movie with special effects and cartoon-like CGI, you will love this movie.\n\n\"Liberal\" Hollywood is still one of the most powerful racist institutions in America. They introduce one new African American talent for every three-hundred new white up-and-comers. They voice the need for diversity and inclusiveness, but appear to be referring to diverse height and hair color among the majority European cast. Hollywood has become slightly more subtle with their overly-blatant racism compared to the days of their greatest creation, the late actor \"Stepin Fetchit\" (look him up) as well as the TV show called \"Beulah\" (look this up on YouTube).\n\nEuropeans of Egypt had a lot of potential and could have even evolved into a franchise, but Hollywood could not overcome their century-old nature of exalting members of the European culture over the historical culture of the region. They attempt to shove a racially inaccurate round peg into a square hole every time. Ever notice how they never exalt black rulers over Greece, Rome or England? Blacks in the movies are always slaves, servants, or a supporting role (aka token)."

With all that hoopla I thought I might give the movie a watch.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed was the overwhelmingly white cast. I don't know why Hollywood continues to paint a wrong picture of historical events as they pertain to Egypt but this is done deliberately. I'm normally not much of a social justice warrior but this is something that's just disrespectful. I mean, have you ever seen a movie about the history of China that was cast almost entirely with white people? I don't think so. Then why the exception with Egypt? I digress.\n\nThe movie starts out with a fair share of CGI effects which kind of gave me an idea as to what should be expected. The CGI wasn't very convincing so it seemed a little cheap at times. Especially the \"transformations\", they were quite goofy in my humble opinion. Nowhere in the hieroglyphs does it say that Egyptian gods are Transformers so I really don't get why they decided to go this route.\n\nStorytelling-wise the movie doesn't have much to offer. It's so one- dimensional that even a child could predict most of the occurrences beforehand. The deaths that occur during the movie are what I'd call \"premature death scenes\". Instead of waiting until some sort of emotional bond can be established with the viewer the characters just die way too early. So early indeed that no one really cares. Even the other characters in the movie seemed totally apathetic towards the deaths of their \"loved ones\". I call that bad storytelling.\n\nTowards the end the movie gets actually interesting. But unfortunately that's not enough. The negative points clearly outweigh the positive ones (of which there are few to begin with), I'm afraid.\n\nIt's not the worst movie I've ever seen but I wouldn't recommend it either. The movie has a strong cast, weak story, and mediocre VFX."

From where I sit special effects frequently usurp character development and any empathy we might have for any of these actors and actresses. According to this page, this film is going to lose a lot of money so maybe in the future we will see more attention to the script the script and the script. One can only hope. The film is mildly entertaining and has some interesting art direction and costume design but for the huge amount of money they spent one could expect something more."

We have to remember in the end it's an American film, such was the case in Memoirs of a geisha were they used Chinese actresses to portrait Japanese ,would we call that \" yellow washing\". When you see other countries make remakes of American properties no one cares( the Turkish knockoffs mostly) or when there are remakes of foreign cinema made in the U.S. and it take place in the states with American characters cast in the roles, no one cares. My theory is that this movie looked so silly and rushed that the casting got under the skin of the viewers as soon as the trailer was out.\n\nNow that's that out of the way here is what I thought of the film. It was a very generic action adventure film, this could work in the early 2000 like in the case of the mummy and the mummy returns but now we look for more complex and story telling in a movie rather than a joyride, the acting was OK the effects were very painful, Alex Proyas is a great director but he was out of his element, he did the crow, dark city, I robot and you combine that with the writer of Dracula untold and you have a genuine flop, Proyas works with dark and dystonia settings not a happy go lucky action film.\n\nGive it a watch out of curiosity. But be aware it's 2 hours long."

        "review_title": "A fantasy-adventure movie that should have instead been a fantasy-adventure videogame",
        "review_detailed_main": "On the one hand, filmmaker Alex Proyas isn't wrong: the setting here is not ancient Egypt, but a newly invented fantasy setting that borrows elements of ancient Egyptian mythology, and Egyptian culture. From the moment it begins there could never possibly be any confusing the world of this 2016 picture - swirling together sword and sorcery with science fiction - with, you know, Actual Egypt. On the other hand, that doesn't make it okay to appropriate said elements of real-life culture and mythology, and it doesn't completely excuse the casting of predominantly white Australian or European actors as figures who are very plainly not Australian or European. The actors themselves are generally fine, sure. The feature benefits from swell modern production values. The visuals are rich and dazzling, including sets/environments, costume design, hair, makeup, props, and weapons. Then again, outside of pure animation even the very best of computer-generated imagery grows tiresome, and looks worse the more we see of it. For as much as CGI is employed here, even before twenty minutes have elapsed, 'Gods of Egypt' very swiftly just becomes rather gauche before it really has a chance to get on its feet. Factor in the somewhat dubious conception, and it's no wonder that this flick floundered so completely.\n\nAncient mythologies can be ripe for adventure storytelling, whether we're looking to Egypt, Scandinavia, Greece, India, China, or any other culture. And so they have been, from Ray Harryhausen classics like 'The 7th voyage of Sinbad,' 'Jason and the Argonauts,' and 1981's 'Clash of the titans,' to 'Xena: Warrior princess,' to videogames like 'Immortals Fenyx Rising' and the 'God of war' series. Given the proliferate CGI and the visuals that aim at all times to stun, awe, and impress, and given the plot of a mortal thief becoming a hero worthy of an immortal pantheon, maybe those latter points of comparison, celebrated titles of electronic gaming, are the real, meaningful kin of this movie. Maybe if 'Gods of Egypt' had been developed not for cinema but for console and/or PC gaming the project would have come off a tad differently. Maybe if there were fewer pixels, polygons, and paltry pretending, and more actual stunts, practical effects, and tangible creations, the film would have been more interesting, engrossing, impactful, and successful. At its best the digital wizardry looks really neat, offering up visions one wishes they could explore inch by inch; at its worst, one is reminded of the gawky opening moments of '3000 miles to Graceland,' Jan Kounen's 'Dobermann,' or Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah.'\n\nI think there are a lot of genuinely terrific ideas in Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless' screenplay. Against all odds there are some nice poetic flourishes in the dialogue, and the scene writing and narrative are ripe for an epic of fantasy adventure. The entirety does quite come apart in the details, however, for despite excellent thoughts, a lot of the storytelling is blunt, clunky, and graceless, not unlike the worst of the CGI. Too much of the dialogue is, in fact, decidedly awful; characters are not written well, the women least of all. It's debatable how well anyone in the cast comes off, though certainly some (such as, in my opinion, \u00c9lodie Yung, and in a much smaller part, Chadwick Boseman) find greater success than others. Among those \"others,\" Gerard Butler is once again basically just chewing scenery for two hours - although, bless his heart, the least that can be said is that this so-so blockbuster, questionable as it is in too many ways, is superior by astronomical leaps and bounds to his best known disaster, '300.' I really do feel sorry for all who participated in this creation in one way or another; their contributions in and of themselves range from fine to splendid, but the best that we might say in a spirit of generosity is that these contributions were guided to unfortunate ends. Once again, in all earnestness, I can only express regret that the script that became this motion picture wasn't instead shopped around to game developers, because there are no few aspects that would feel right at home in that format.\n\nIt's not totally rotten. I can honestly say that I was entertained in at least some measure. The overwhelming phoniness does mean, however, that no matter how cool This or That might look, and how much potential there may have been at large, the viewing experience is generally a sadly empty one, and frankly longer than it should have been. There are no real thrills to be had; it's a flick that we can \"watch\" without actively engaging, and at its worst, maybe it's ideal to only leave it on in the background. Wherever Sazama and Sharpless try to weave in some comedy, it only occasionally meets with any success. The flaws that all too heavily define 'Gods of Egypt' are far too evident, and its worth struggles to keep its head above water. If you do happen to come across it there are worse things you could watch; regrettably, there is so little reason to watch in the first place that I don't really even know who I'd possibly recommend it to. What it comes down to is that this is a middling, somewhat ill-advised title that should have found itself in an altogether different medium. I'm glad for those who get more out of 'Gods of Egypt' than I do, but I'm not so sure that this was a wise way to spend two hours."

        "review_detailed_main": "Given the ratings, I was a bit nervous about spending money on the movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot gives the viewer the gist of the Horus vs. Set myth, while still differing enough to offer surprises to people who are familiar with Egyptian mythology. To some degree, the path that one of the main characters follows (to avoid spoilers the character will remain nameless) is a bit predictable, but that doesn't make it bad!\n\nNow, of course, we come to the racial controversy. I need to take a point off for some questionable casting roles. The reasons I don't take off more points are a) we don't know what color Ancient Egyptians were, and b) there was diversity, even if there should have been more. Ancient Egyptian art depicts people with varying skin tones, some light, so it would be difficult to narrow down one particular skin tone and say that this is what the actors should be. The main cast is composed of Scottish, Danish, Australian, Cambodian/French, and African American actors. Overall, there should have been more diversity though, because the bulk of actors are Australian. Which, in no way is bad, it's just that Australians tend to have light skin and, while some Ancient Egyptians may have had lighter skin than people think, the hieroglyphics depict it darker than most of the actors. Even though we can't be sure what skin tone Ancient Egyptians had, the cast should have at least included more people with African descent, given that Egypt is in Africa. If we can't narrow down a skin tone, we can at least be sure of country of origin.\n\nAll of the actors did a decent job playing his/her respective character, but I have to say that some choices seemed odd. Geoffery Rush is an amazing actor and he will forever be the one of the best pirates I've ever seen on screen. He wasn't as memorable as the sun god, though. For Ra (and maybe I'm a bit biased, being a fan of classic lit.), I'd expect someone to ooze majesticness. Rush's performance seems a bit more surly. I mean, hey given what he has to do every day, I could see a bit battle-worn. But I never get the feeling of awe I'd expect from the head honcho of the gods. Gerard Butler makes a very attractive and powerful Set and I feel bad about discounting him on something he can't control. However, his Scottishness made the choice of him as Set seem a bit odd. Hearing a Scottish accent in the voice of an Egyptian god causes a bit of confusion. Honestly, I would have chosen different actors to play them. I can't narrow down one for Ra, but Peter Mensah would have made a great Set.\n\nAnyway, I loved the movie and was extremely entertained even if I disagreed with some of the casting choices."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alex Proyas's return to directing following a 7 year hiatus couldn't have come at a worse time. Just as the film industry was up in arms about the #OscarSoWhite debacle, Gods of Egypt arrived in cinemas boasting a near-all Caucasian cast despite being set in Africa. The demand for diversity in Hollywood duly followed, and rightly so, but the questionable casting isn't even the worst thing about the film. Gods of Egypt is a bloated, garish and nonsensical piece of trash, the cinematic equivalent of Raheem Sterling's bathroom. Is this really the same visionary who brought us The Crow (1994) and Dark City (1998)?\n\nSadly it is, and it completes a steady quality decline in Proyas's output which began in 2004 with his middle-finger to Isaac Asimov, I, Robot. On paper, the big-budget tale of Gods living amongst humans battling it out for the throne may seem like the perfect the opportunity for some campy, brain-on-auto-pilot fun. However, it fails to even offer any sort of camp appeal due to a cast either gobbled up by the video-game cutaway special effects or so utterly devoid of charisma. The main offender is Brenton Thwaites, a young actor who looks like he's been custom-built to appeal to any teenage girls in the crowd. He plays Bek, a human living in a thriving Egypt governed by ten-foot Gods, and sadly he is our protagonist.\n\nBek, along with his pretty girlfriend Zaya (Courtney Eaton), witnesses the handing-over of the crown from the abdicating Osiris (Bryan Brown) to his dashing and popular son Horus (Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau). The coronation is rudely interrupted by Osiris's uncle Set (Gerard Butler), who feels that the time has come for him to rule, killing his brother and ripping out his poor nephew's eyes in front of a terrified crowd. With the Egyptians forced into slavery to satisfy Set's greed and vanity, Bek, a talented thief, swipes the plans to Set's vault in the hope of stealing back Horus's eyes and assisting him in defeating his uncle. But when Zaya is killed after the successful theft, Bek strikes a deal with Horus to help guide him through Set's pyramid in exchange for returning Zaya from the underworld.\n\nThe main question lingering over the head of Gods of Egypt is why was this film made? For a modern blockbuster from a talented director, the film lacks maturity and brains. For a film possibly designed to appeal to fans of explosion-heavy sci-fi/fantasy extravaganzas such as Michael Bay's Transformers franchise, the CGI is often embarrassingly bad. And for anybody hoping for a throwback to the kitschy B-movies of the 1950's and 60's, where giant monsters and grotesque gods mingled with us puny humans, you will find more charm in one frame of any movie involving the work of Ray Harryhausen than you will for the entire 2 hours of Gods of Egypt. The whole thing just feels oddly out of place, paling in comparison to even the most sickly of recent CGI-fests. Re-telling essentially the exact same story told a thousand times since Homer put ink to paper, this could be re-titled as A Simpleton's Guide to the Hero's Quest. Utter tripe."

The CGI were just UNBEARABLE and it makes me wonder how any human being (or even gods) could think that this was OK to be released to public. If the visual effect supervisor ever get another job, it would be nothing less than a miracle.\n\nIt was impossible to like any of the characters, also. I couldn't care less about those guys with such a bad acting on screen. The comic approach they've tried - maybe taking a hike in Marvel's successful action-comedy-light movies - didn't work here at all.\n\nIn the end, established names as Gerard Butller and even a decent actor as Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) will eventually look back and think, \"why did i ever do this?\"\n\nDo your brain a favor and run away from this."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"A gift from someone with great assets, and someone with very few. But when both die and are at the Final Gate... What is its value? I say we are equal.\"\n\nI thought this would be something similar like \"Exodus: Gods and Kings\". A historical story set in Egypt with immense scenery's and an abundance of special effects. Well, it certainly is situated in Egypt. And the bag of tricks, full of kitsch and console-game-like special effects were exploited to the utmost. Only, now it's not about a biblical figure but the mythological world of Egypt. Ancient Egypt where people and gods live alongside each other. It sometimes resembled \"Gulliver's Travels\" since all those gods of Egypt have an imposing figure compared to the ordinary mortals. Ultimately, it's a kind of historical \"Transformers\". So, full of exaggerated action and impressive transformations into imaginative creatures.\n\nFrom the opening shot, it's clear where the biggest amount of money was spent on. A gliding flight over the Egyptian landscape and arriving in a busy shopping street of Egypt. I thought this was already a delight to watch. We get to know Bek (Brenton \"The Giver\" Thwaites), a kind of Aladdin and a petty thief who succeeds in stealing a (probably in those days) fashionable gown for his beloved Zaya (Courtney \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" Eaton). And this leads us to the second, unavoidable story : the idyllic love affair. An Egyptian couple with a bright future in front of them and who'll ultimately be victims of the core story. Eternal love, divine adoration for each other and languorous glances, are the obnoxious symptoms we are witnessing. Granted, it wasn't overly annoying. And also this story introduces the most eye-catching prop of the entire movie. That heaving bosom of Eaton. I am almost sure that it does not comply with the usual proportions of that era, but it was the only thing that could distract me from all the other epic violence.\n\nObviously you should watch this spectacle movie without thinking and let yourself be overwhelmed by the lavish fantasy world. The only thing that bothered me was that they tried to cram the entire Egyptian mythological world in this film. As a result, the pacing is scorching high. You've only just put yourself down in your cozy chair and two over-sized gods are already rolling all over the city center. A sort of re-introduction of \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\". And so one action-packed scene after the other passes by. The fascinating situation about Anubis and the Underworld, two giant snakes writhing over a huge maze or some \"Tomb Raider\" platform stunt-work in the temple of Set (Gerald Butler). You won't get bored. The most fascinating and crazy part was reserved for Geoffrey \"Barbossa\" Rush as the god Ra who's pulling the sun with his floating spacecraft around a disc-shaped earth. I instantly wanted to reread books by Terry Pratchett.\n\nConcerning content you shouldn't expect too much. And sometimes it's quite illogical. Of course those gods always tend to have an easy solution when a problem occurs, which is an advantage for the subsequent course of the story. You can predict the outcome already from an Egyptian mile away. That's no surprise either. And also the CGI wasn't top notch sometimes in this sword-and-sandal. But this film is mainly judged based on the trailer (which I obviously haven't seen because I try to avoid them studiously) and therefor is ripped to pieces by critics. Yet I find this somewhat exaggerated.\n\nWell it's true. At all levels it doesn't contain any profundity. But what do you expect of this type of movie? Highly intellectual conversations and thoughtful screenplay? You also don't expect in a movie such as \"Schindler's List\" diabolical fright moments or exciting car chases with stirring music? \"God of Egypt\" showed what I was expecting. Over the top spectacle and action which is digitally displayed in a partially successful way. It effortlessly transcends the level of any Asylum movie. Thank God.\n\nMore reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

        "review_detailed_main": "Gods of Egypt is directed by Alex Proyas, written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, and stars Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Chadwick Boseman among others. The film tells the story of a mortal named, Bek and the god Horus coming together to thwart the plans of Set, a merciless god who usurped the throne of Egypt turning the once peaceful empire into one of chaos and destruction. Released in February of 2016, Gods of Egypt was met with negative reception from both audiences and critics, leading the film to struggle at the box office which barely turned a profit during its theatrical run.\n\nGoing into Gods of Egypt I was expecting the worst, given the reputation of the film, however, while the movie is certainly bad I didn't hate the experience while watching it. That may be due in part to the adventure the film takes the viewer on, although it strikes every trope in the book and feels like a culmination of every fantasy adventure story ever, there were moments along the way in which I felt entertained. Some of the visuals the filmmakers tried going for were nice and almost felt atmospheric, however much was held back due to how poor the special effects were. Gods of Egypt relies very heavily on CGI, with almost every scene packed full of effects that do not look too impressive. This overabundance of poor CGI severely hurts the quality of the film, while the effects are not the worst ever, the film's dependence on them really brings it to the forefront and it's noticeable that Gods of Egypt could've spent more time in the oven better developing the effects as to not hurt the quality of the movie and more severely date the film; as this is a movie that will negatively show its age in ten years similar to that of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace a movie that was over-reliant on CGI, however that's only if people even remember Gods of Egypt.\n\nAs I stated earlier, although aspects of the journey can be entertaining, much of the story comes across as a greatest hits in terms of the fantasy adventure genre, resulting in a film that is quite forgettable, at least to me. This left me questioning why this film was even made, it's certainly not the first feature-length to be about Egyptian gods and the whole aesthetic felt like a PG Immortals with worse special effects. It's certainly not going to be a film that will stick with audiences after seeing it nor will it be as entertaining while watching as the filmmakers probably hoped it would be.\n\nGods of Egypt is more or less a messy film, although it was something that I didn't hate as much as I thought I was going to, it undeniably has issues. From the reliance on poor CGI, clich\u00e9 ridden story and long-winded run time make for a film that surely isn't great. Gods of Egypt has its moments of tolerability, however, it definitely isn't a film that I can recommend and for that reason, I am giving Gods of Egypt a 3/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "2016 has been a crazy year for movies for better or for worse. We've had a stunning continuation of both Kung Fu Panda and Star Trek, an onslaught of superhero movies (two of which had the heroes fighting each other), film adaptations of several video games like Warcraft, Disney remakes getting critical praise, and a terrifying return to Japanese cinema by Godzilla. Amongst this plethora of treasured entertainment is one stinking turd under the name \"Gods of Egypt\". Whenever Egypt is brought into American movies or even TV, the focus is usually on just mummies, pyramids, and booby traps and that's about it. This is why I appreciate the filmmakers for doing something different by delving into the actual mythology of this ancient civilization and much of it is quite fascinating. It's just a shame that none of that can make this movie any good.\n\nWhen god of the desert Set (Gerard Butler) murders his brother Osiris and steals the eyes of his nephew, sky god Horus, he begins his ruthless rule of the world with an iron fist, killing anyone who defies him be it man or god. A thief named Bek takes it upon himself to help Horus reclaim his eyes in exchange for resurrecting the woman he loves on an \"epic\" quest to save the world from Set's arrogance and cruel rule.\n\nOn paper, this seems like a fun adventure, but its execution is lackluster. Very few of the characters are the least bit interesting with the exception of the likes of Ra (Geoffrey Rush), the god of light whose whole character and concept is pretty interesting, and Anubis not only has a cool design but is thankfully NOT portrayed as a villain so much as a guy who is simply doing his job managing the afterlife. I can't give the same credit to the rest of the cast as they are all just flat out boring. Seriously, I care for nobody here, especially Set, whose accent is not only distracting here, but the actor seems like he's got nothing invested in his role and the evil plan is clich\u00e9d and full of holes. There's also the issue of \"White-washing\" in an Egyptian setting. I can see why people would be upset by this and I agree with them with the humans, though it's established that the gods can take on any form which is passable at most (still, they could be more ethnically accurate too).\n\nMany of the visuals have some cool designs, but it's all generic CGI. Almost nothing is physically present in front of the camera, not even the water the characters waddle in in one scene. THE FREAKIN' WATER! While not inherently bad itself, CGI is already overused these days and I found myself easily bored by the same illusionary trick within the first quarter of the film. The story is a tad needlessly complicated and too damn long. Somewhere in the middle, I was thinking to myself \"Is this mess gonna end anytime soon?\" The music also sucks as I don't remember a single musical note, which really says something. The action is okay with a couple of nice twists, but nothing truly spectacular. Batman and Superman fighting each other for just eight minutes is much more engaging than all the action \"Gods of Egypt\" had to offer.\n\nThe best way to describe \"Gods of Egypt\" is a waste of time and money. To paraphrase \"The Mummy\": Compared to this, the Ten Plagues were a joy."

Otherwise, I would have missed this striking, action-packed, energetic and flashy movie. I had a blast, and plan to see it again. There was something for everyone; great special effects, romance, action, danger and humor.\n\nWhile it did not adhere particularly closely to Egyptian mythology, that's probably for the best. Some of those myths can get pretty disturbing. What it did do was deliver lots of fun and eye-candy. I did not leave my seat, glance at my phone messages or remember my popcorn, once the movie began. When you stop chewing and forget where you are, you know you're having fun at the movies.\n\nThe characters were enjoyable (especially Horus, who came across as grumpy and hung-over, at first, but eventually got himself sorted). Set was genuinely villainous, and Ra's flat Earth, Sun-towing scene a real treat. I found myself really liking Hathor, as well. The two kids, Bek and Zaya, were cute, reminding me just a little of Aladin and Jasmine. Yu genuinely cared about Zaya, on her journey through the frighteningly bleak Egyptian underworld. About Hathor, too, actually, but I won't spoil things and say why.\n\nPersonally, I rate this movie on par with Avengers: Age of Ultron, and above the last Star Wars movie, which I saw just once. Go see Gods of Egypt. You'll be glad that you did."

Forget about the whole mostly-white-actors-in-a-movie-set-in-Egypt, forget about that.\n\nSomething that irked me, almost more than what I am to talk about later, were the lame, \"witty\" jokes- the comments down the road, the whole trying to take a break from action by pausing a few seconds just to say something \"funny\", even though it was in the midst of the heat of all of it. And the thing is, it was darn corny and stupid! I couldn't even laugh, it was just really distracting!\n\nNow for the main part, I HATED how they progressed so easily, so quickly- NO effort. The problem solving was so straight forward, no struggle at all. This took away the excitement, the thrill- no blood pumping here, just my neck aching from having to drag myself through this movie. The lines the poor actors had to say in this movie, I mean- who wrote this? Seriously? I cringed whenever something dramatic was happening, I would rather hear them do the boring \"journey talk\" they did during some points in the movie. Actually, I cringed over how casually they said anything in the movie, except for epic Gerard Butler, as he was mostly like he was in all his badass movies.\n\nAnd bad fights, like wow, bad. Only visuals saved them from me just shutting off.\n\nEnough ranting now, for short:\n\nGood:\n\n\n\n\n\nBAD:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, I kind of don't like how people give more stars to off- set the bad reviews from other reviewers, JUST because they want to defend it from critique with mostly white actors for characters from Egypt. People can say it had a bad impact on their experience of the movie, since after all- the setting was Egypt and Egyptian gods, hence they can rate it from that point on. But to give it MORE stars to off-set the bad reviews on the non-logical casting of the movie is plain moronic, you ruin the whole rating system because you do not review based on the movie, but on what others have rated it as- and no, I do not care about the white actors at all. Actors are actors, as long as they do great, I don't care!"

But this film ended up being a weird sci-fi/fantasy mashup that involved gods transforming into mechas and had Ra piloting a spaceship around a flat Earth.\n\nGods of Egypt was plotted like a video game where Horus and Osiris went from place to place to get an item or find an ally. The special effects looked more fitting for a PS3 game than a Hollywood film in 2016.\n\nProyas clearly wanted to make Gods of Egypt into a light-hearted adventure with Horus and Bek acting as a buddy duo, and having a lot of humour between the action set pieces.

        "review_detailed_main": "As the opening scenes began, I could not help but sneer at the prospect of the calamity I assumed this film would be from what the trailer left to interpretation. And indeed with the musical score, I could not help but wonder if Gods of Egypt was meant to be an epic disaster of biblical proportions meant to amuse the greats of cinema in the afterlife...\n\nBut at the end of it, I could not help pondering if this could have not been done better with a bit more effort. No, not money - enough was thrown at it - probably a lot to have Gerald Butler to do his usual business of grunting and flexing his biceps and swinging some weapon, no doubt; certainly a substantial part of the budget must have gone to Victoria's Secret to scantily, but tastefully, clad the goddesses on the screen and of course the most impressive chunk (and here we can see a job well done) on the beautification and the glitz that at the end of the movie is meant to seductively lure us under the impression that it was worth spending our budget on the movie ticket rather than on a bigger flower bouquet for mum. Certainly, a humble amount of the film's budget must have been handed over to a poor conservatory student, probably in a back alley transaction, who at the last minute presumably copy-pasted together music from proper epics. Honestly, the score was so severely mismatched at times with the events going on, one had to be left wondering if this film was not meant as a parody. And no expense must have been spared for the poor script.\n\nAlas, the only impressive element of the film remain its visuals. Every single scene, the viewers can expect to feast their eyes on the glittering images of a mythical Egypt, they can maybe feel themselves transposed to those beautifully rendered astral plains and to the vast bleakness of the underworld. The visuals helped convey the mood of a place or of a scene far better than the clearly placid effort of all the eye candy on set. Not meant to be disrespectful, but either for lack of better judgment, or sheer laziness, none of the actors seemed to do more than recite their lines as if in a school play written by the 2nd graders. Maybe they were hoping the CGI would mask their shortcomings? No, the greatest problem was not the acting - nobody would expect Shakespeare to pour into our ear from such a film, but the dialogue was simply atrociously puerile - hence my comparison to a school play. There were clear attempts at humor and grandeur alike - none of which can impress the adult audience Gods of Egypt was meant for. I mean, a few more polysyllabic words could not have hurt.\n\nIt was somewhat captivating, but this was not owed to good storytelling, as much as to seductive visuals. With a proper script, I am certain it would not have been slashed by critics. Had it been made into an animation and intended for a young audience, the producers could have even gotten away with the dialogue and the dull tale. The premise of the film was intriguing enough and there was obviously some didactic purpose to it, but there was not much to go on and the execution was lacking in several aspects. As an animation, it might have even been good and very welcome. But since this is not the case, this film has succeeded only in following along the line of numerous other blockbusters which give the critics pen fodder, which entertain us and remove us for their two hours from our dreary existence and once the experience is over, it's time to move on with business as usual. Gods of Egypt will leave no durable impression on viewers or on cinema in general and it will be forgotten along with all films of its kind.\n\nAll in all, it took itself too seriously when it was supposed to laugh at itself and was too self- deprecating when it should have been serious. Not recommended for cinephiles, for those looking for depth in films or simply for fans of good acting. But if you enjoy escapism or just take a kick out of seeing Gerard Butler grunt and flex, go ahead, you will not be (that) sorry. Oh, and there was a love story in there somewhere... it probably meant to be a star-crossed lovers type of deal, but it was just as uninspired as the rest.\n\nHave a nice viewing!"

Besides, the cast is uneven, many characters come close to the ones seen before in other movies; even talented non-US character actors like Geoffrey Rush or Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are unable to fill the vacuity, the rest are nothing special - or too much \"hidden\" behind flashing environment and covering costumes. Lots of scenes are too long or provide no additional value, repeating obvious issues again and again.\n\nIf it was the 1st movie of a kind, I would probably have rated it higher, but in 2016, it is just a copycat of dozens of myth-based movies of this millennium. Not a total flop, but no more than a mediocre work for those fond of \"nice\" stories where evil is defeated by good."

It was a fine enough mindless diversion with most attempts at humour falling flat, a few hitting. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau channeling his Game of Thrones Jamie character to a minor extent is hard not to approve of. Butler gives a normal day at the office enthusiasm with his Character, he's alright. Rufus Sewell, underused is a silly role. Chadwick (the new Black Panther) given little time for a curious character. Anyway the whole movie was curious and the extensive CGI used simply detracted from the movie. Some of it looked simply bad and not 2016 and equivalent to its budget. Came across as a mediocre 3 year old video game you could only watch. Had me actually pining for Immortals which is I think the movie of this style I've enjoyed most in the past few years."

I have to begin by saying that I am not a huge fan of these types of movies. Never been that big into mythology and the epic BC movies have never really interested me all that much. I'm not sure if that had something to do with this or not but I didn't enjoy this movie at all. The dialog is awful, the story is confusing; mainly because it couldn't decide what it wanted to be. Part of it was mythology, part of it was sci- fi, in one scene Horus gets his eye back...then flies into outer space. The movie was all over the place and really the only reason to watch this is because it looks great and the special effects are pretty impressive, on the other hand if the movie is bad none of that matters. Overall, a movie I wasn't excited to see and turned out worse that I was expecting. I give this a C-."

That's not to say that their creative and technical skills are not appreciable. Indeed, this is a great looking film with some engaging visual effects and quite a decent score, too - but even the cute smile of Brenton Thwaites, the occasional contribution from Geoffrey Rush (with his tongue will implanted into his cheek) and something akin to the cerebral from Chadwick Boseman cannot turn this slowly paced effort that is as derivative of \"The Mummy\" (without any attempt at humour) as it is of \"Clash of the Titans\" (without the monsters) into anything substantial. I suppose to have acted amongst a series of almost entirely green screen scenarios must have been quite difficult - but sadly, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is simply not up to the task, and Gerard Butler - well, what does he think he is doing in this drivel? This could have been so very much better, if someone had taken the time to develop these ancient characters and present us with a storyline that challenged our imagination. As it is, it's little better than a glorified cartoon that I suggest needs to be forgotten."

The tale of Horus avenging the murder of his father Osiris by fighting Set is brought to life.\n\nThe visuals are spectacular dizzying and fantastical. You get some pretty impressive cities temples caves tombs pyramids and the underworld.\n\nThis movie was so far the best action this year. I don't know why people are hating.

A solid spectacular adventure roller coaster from start to finish set in an extremely stylish ancient Egyptian atmosphere with a great cast is what we got!! I really don't get the cynics any more they seem to expect an Oscar winner even in the fun adventure Genre!! Was Indiana Jones ever going to win an Oscar?!! I expect these movies to be reviewed fairly in comparison with others in the same genre and in that regards this movie scores a straight 9/10 for a solid engaging story telling well acted and directed with excellent visual effects and some great costumes that glorifies this period and does justice!! Personally I am an avid move watcher and take great pride in my movie opinion and analysis and this one is certainly a must watch adventure movie if you ask my humble opinion and one of the very best adventure movies ever made about ancient Egypt it is surely miles better than the Mummy series!!\n\nThe movie does a great job bringing the fantasy to life in style and sequence of events that surely will captivate the audience attention throughout. My honest opinion and advise don't listen to critics on this one actually don't listen to them when it comes to these type of movies period as they seem to have a thing or two against them for some strange reason and for that they seem to turn a blind eye towards all the glamour, style and story telling. Go watch it folks and see for yourselves one of the best blockbusters in the last couple of years an extremely amazing and memorable saga that surely will watch it over many times to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "Much like how Clash of the Titans (2010) and Immortals mined Greek mythology to respectable commercial success, Gods of Egypt is an attempt to mine what \"blockbuster potential\" there is to be had from Egyptian mythology. Based in a world where Gods are 12 Feet tall, live among humans, and bleed gold, the film follows Mortal thief Bek and exiled God Prince Horus in their journey to take down usurper Set for differing reasons. The movie does look nice as there's tons of detail with fantastical structures and vivid colors, but then the novelty wears off when everything else fails to engage. Bek and Horus aren't compelling protagonists and the only fun to be had comes from Gerard Butler as Set giving a reasonably entertaining hammy villain performance. The spectacle is beautiful, but if there's nothing engaging you it has about the same entertainment value as a theme park ride, except theme park rides at least have the decency not to be two hours long. If you need your ancient Egyptian trash blockbuster fix, stick with Brendan Fraser's first two Mummy movies or Roland Emmerich's Stargate."

Instead of Old Testament rivals, we get Horus and Get battling for the soul of Egypt. Get is a god of darkness and Horus is the good guy; or god of light. The opening features a fight between the two, which results in the bad guy plucking out the good guys eyeballs. The obligatory mortal hero comes along to assist Horus in regaining Egypt while also attempting to reunite with his one true love. The only recognizable actor is Gerard Butler as Get; in a similar role he did in \"300.\" The script is rather silly but the CGI is spectacular. Gods of Egypt needs to be seen on a big screen. I do not know why the budget was $140 million, as this is, at best, a 4/10."

It's mostly distracting in how clearly fake it looks.\n\nAt times you can tell that there's a green screen behind them, which is distracting along with the bad CGI effects and the bad acting.\n\nIn the fight scenes they cut a lot and it can be hard to see, but mostly they use CG for the action scenes if its something over the top.\n\nThe 3rd act climax is fully bloated and crazy, but it doesn't help how it becomes another cliche final battle. The battle is laughable but you can be entertained.\n\nI think you will have a good laugh at the dialogue, characters, and use of CGI in this movie.

Maybe I don't understand Egyptian mythology well enough to appreciate all the references, but I couldn't make heads or tails of the worldbuilding. I think the humor and technology are egregiously excessive and therefore misplaced. I also think they didn't do any favors to the mythology by trying to provide the humor they did. It kept the story from being taken seriously. Where are the limits to gods' immortality, invulnerability, and power? Where are the real consequences? Very predictable.\n\nThis is going to sound contradictory, but if the story is simply set in a fictional / original (albeit completely analogous) fantasy world, it would work much better. There are many clever ideas and visuals. Traps, monsters, riddles, magic... Think more like D&D, Prince of Persia, etc, and this can work.\n\nAlso, Bek is too OP for a mortal for my liking, unlike...say Perseus in Clash of the Titans, who, was helped by the gods with magical weapons and armor. He is also written with a tremendous amount of hubris and cockiness which appears to go on with little consequence.\n\nI believe Set is unfortunately a boring, one-dimensional villain when I think he could be much more interesting.\n\nIndividually, I think the actors were good. There was some good dialogue moments, but the basic storyline is mostly cliche.\n\nSorry if my review is a bit disorganized, but it's a late-night review. I will leave it there."

The flat earth part in the movie, is indeed very accurate and true. Also the ''Gods'' or aliens at the time, might have been white. Either way, there were multiple races in that period, and this movie portrays them very well. The battles and costumes are not exaggerated, many legends speak of several battles between alien races, their outfit and armament fit the description as well.

It's a mess. So oddly edited together, so much focus on the action which are such bad FX they don't really feel perilous or as cool as they could be.\n\nToo bad.

The unknown cast contains Marvel's Black Panther Chadwick Boseman and Daredevil's Elektra Elodie Young. Both of these two rising stars give great performances and each of their roles seems to be a preview of what they will bring the MCU. The script is flawed but the style and lavish design overcomes the basic redemption movie storyline. It's lots of fun. (3.5 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer"

It unfortunately is brought down by terrible writing that delivers a boring and unengaging story, ugly-looking visuals that often seem unfinished, poorly-crafted action scenes, a cast of boring and generic characters, unexpectedly offensive stereotypes, and TERRIBLE acting from celebrities involved where it's easily noticeable that they JUST DIDN'T CARE about this movie.\n\nIn the case of the recommendation, just don't bother.

The cast has some very big banes in it and as much as all the cast played their roles exceptional the main characters are a stand out with people like Ge3offery Rush, Brenton Thwaites, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Elodie Yung and Gerard Butler to name just a few.\n\nThis is a classic good Vs evil scenario with the Gods of Egypt under siege by the evil Set, but without the help of the mortals, then only can Egypt be taken out of the throes of the evil God Set.\n\nThe screen jumps with magic, it is a movie with no slow parts, no gaps where you are not visually entertained. I think this movie is so go that if the writers, actors, directors etc where to do a prequel or a sequel, it would be also worth watching. This movie is worth watching if you like Sc-Fi. I don't know if every ancient God and Egypt that are portrayed are historically correct but it is not meant to be a documentary but a thrilling and exciting good Vs evil movie that packs a punch visually and with the actor's presence, Fantastic."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a movie of ancient gods, their flaws, greed and motives.\n\nA story for the ages where Egyptian gods, flawed by their humane desires, walk side by side with native mortals. A true Cinderella story where all is normal, then turned into chaos, climaxing with dreadful end of the world type happenings summoning unlikely heroes and ending in a rather ceremonious great resurrection of life and peace. Even with all of the supernatural beings and gods ruling over humans, or mortals as this film says, the story remained within the humane lines of moral dilemmas and relations between admiration and resent, love and hate, greed and generosity and trusting or doubting others. Really, this motion picture is a visually beautiful, often quite remarkable, piece of cinema, sadly, eternally ruined by poorly edited and rushed content. This potential diamond was honestly neglected enough so that it was reprocessed into mere coal. This was noticeable from pretty much the first scenes already. The actors dialogues felt very forced up to the point where I could imagine the director, Alex Proyas, shouting for actors to be quicker and less savoring with their lines. The scenes were too hastily run through and as this progressed throughout the film, the quality of a golden story was turned into a, at most, B-class film. I expected more and thought it could've been a bit slower with the progression of things, instead of rushing into events and lines like some kind of a speed trial. If I could I would choose not to watch it, just to save the thought of a great, action filled, story with gods and mortals. I'm sorry for the actors and the teams behind this movie. For they most certainly did not deserve this kind of a result."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are films that are so bad they're good and then there are films that are so bad they're just bad. Gods of Egypt very much falls into the latter because it really is just an awful film. Weirdly, I'd been anticipating this film for a while and it's finally arrived in the UK, a whole four months after its release across the pond.\n\nAlthough I'd heard nothing but bad things about Gods of Egypt, I was always keen to see for myself whether it was actually that bad. Alex Proyas, the director of this film, came out in defence of his work and described modern day critics as 'diseased vultures pecking at the bones of a dying carcass' back when the film was originally slated by critics who got to see this total mess four months ago.\n\nHere I would normally give a brief rundown of the plot however, due to the scattershot nature of this film's plot, I will try my best to keep it as brief as possible.\n\nBetrayed and exiled by his uncle Set (Gerard Butler), Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is a god who was to be crowned the new King of Egypt. Under Set's reign, Egypt descends into chaos and human Bek (Brenton Thwaites) takes it upon himself to find Horus and persuade him to return and defeat Set to regain his rightful place as the King of Egypt.\n\nI can't stress enough just how embarrassing every aspect of this film is. For starters, there is not one actor who gives anything resembling a good performance, whether it be Gerard Butler as Set or Geoffrey Rush, yes Geoffrey Rush, as Ra. I've never really been majorly impressed with Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau in Game of Thrones and he does nothing that could possibly change my mind in Gods of Egypt.\n\nElodie Young is in the same boat in the way that she never impressed me too much in Daredevil and she's not very good here either. The worst of the bunch though has got to be Brenton Thwaites as Bek, who has more or less the same delivery for every emotion; utterly emotionless.\n\nThen comes the writing...\n\nMatt Sazama and Burk Sharpless are a writing duo who haven't written a well received film yet in their three attempts. This is the only film of theirs I've seen and if this is anything to go by, I will be avoiding Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter. The dialogue is so laughably bad throughout the entire film and the story jumps from scene to scene with no cohesion whatsoever. I don't think I've seen a film where I've laughed at nearly every single line before.\n\nAlex Proyas, judging from his comments about critics, is not a man who can take any criticism lightly. I would be able to describe Proyas as a style over substance director if the visuals were any good but they just aren't. For a film with a $140 million budget, you'd think they'd at least be able to make it look good. It makes me wonder whether they just blew all of the budget on the cast. Gods of Egypt feels like you're watching someone play a shoddy video game rather erratically, particularly during the fight scenes where Peter Menzies Jr.'s cinematography will leave you dizzy and wanting the sick bucket.\n\nAre there any positives I can take from Gods of Egypt? Marco Beltrami's score was probably the best thing about this film and oh, the film did finish eventually which was a bonus. I felt exhausted as I left the cinema because the film is far too long at just over two hours, it becomes a chore to watch, especially when going in to the cinema thinking it was going to be just an hour and a half long.\n\nAs of now, Gods of Egypt has surprisingly made a profit on its budget. Not a profit the studio would be hoping for though, coming in at a measly $2 million. Sounds stupid to say that's a measly amount however, in today's market, that's an amount that could well see careers end."

Thank God, I am not a sheep, meaning I do take into consideration reviews from some critics, IMDb and Rotten T., but still I do take my own decision always regarding movies or TV Series I am about to watch, or I watched. That means that I consider my own rating as alpha and omega. After all it is my personal taste and not of some critic or casual viewer. Enough of philosophy, this movie attracted me no matter low reviews and ratings. So I started to watch and instantly magic happened. I was simply drawn into this world of ancient magic of gods and mortals and right from first minute of movie I was totally immersed into this masterpiece (my humble opinion). I watched movie online so I well used advantage of being able to watch scenes again and again ! This is no soap opera, everything what happens is both ordinary and very deep (depend on how subtle is your perception), action is nothing shallow but merged with strong emotions, powerful energy, very good fighting skills and good effects. Yes effects are really good in this movie and it simply got hold of your attention as everything look so real and authentic that you feel being part of it. Story is very good and not even one second boring, there is no wasting of time here, each and every second of movie is used 100% and truly there is no dull moment, absolutely no soap opera-things are very serious here, no shallow emotions life and death are constantly present like shadow and light, darkness and sun. Yes we even get chance to see personal boat and fighting skills of Sun God Ra Himself ! And that part as all other parts of movie are, is simply magnificent ! I don't know whether I will fire up someone attention to see this movie and hopefully watch it with open mind and not damaged by bad reviews and ratings,thus allow himself to fully experience beauty and greatness of this movie. I am very glad that I did, and I have to tell you that now several days already I am watching again and again scenes from this movie and feel powerful emotions and awe again and again. Allow yourself to watch this movie and forget ratings, if you do it and watch it with your 100% attention I guarantee to you that you will enjoy at least some parts of this movie very much even if is not movie merged with your personal taste. You will still enjoy some parts cause movie is truly well made from beginning till end. PS What is really amazing is that I really wanted to know which animal did represent Seth's main god warrior. I thought it was bull, but after watching one fighting scene he was involved I realized that he was goat ! Quite huge goat but still goat :-) Sorry for my grammar mistakes, I am obviously not UK or USA native, but still - I tried ;-)"

It's a story of Gods fighting Gods, the role of mortals in the grand scheme of the Lands of Egypt and ultimately a love story. The screenplay is gargantuan in its delivery, the soundtrack is almost overwhelming, This is the tale of a family of Gods, Set (Gerard Butler) kills his brother and steals the eyes of Horus forcing him to live in the desert sightless and without power. Set plans to become King and rule the lands with misplaced power and fear. However we are introduced to Bek, a mortal who does not take no for an answer and will go to the ends of this world and into the next to save the girl he loves. In the days before CGI this film would still be awesome, right up there with Ben Hur, Spartacus and all those other biblical epics told over the years with a cast of thousands and stars aplenty. However we can now go further, bigger, badder, louder, and much more grand and the cast of thousands is created with a screen and a mouse. It does not lessen the impact of this film in any way and I enjoyed the delivery from start to finish. It gives the viewer a glimpse into the opulence of ancient Egypt and the costume designer must have been given a complete free rein with absolutely stunning results. A feast for the eyes and the ears. If you like an adventure you'll love this film."

I actually had a pretty good time with this movie, despite the lack of appreciation from the other filmgoers in the theater. All of the action scenes will satisfy the 11 year-old audience because of the ridiculousness, and the adults will be instantly entertained. As for the CGI, it's not too bad actually, most of it looks really cool, but the green-screen is used way too much, which is my one downside that I had while watching it. The Sun God and the villain stole the show for me, they were just too awesome in those epic action sequences. Before you watch this movie, which you should, it's a really good time, see the 3D version, this is the only movie released so far this year that uses it correctly, and it helps the action look slicker and shinier and makes the green-screen look better and make the actors standing in front of it pop out more fluidly. Don't listen to the harsh people- just watch it and enjoy the fresh, crisp action and observe the cool visuals(like I said, see the 3D screening, it adds something to the superb special effects)."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Alex Proyas fantasy film 'Gods of Egypt', which for the first time in a while vilifies the Award-winning actor Gerard Butler as the Egyptian god of War, Set, also elevates seasoned actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (you may recognize him for his role as Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones).\n\nSet in the mythological world of a bountiful Egypt, a place christened as 'heaven on Earth' where the gods have decided to settle among the human race and rule over it, Osiris is handing over his crown and throne to his son Horus (played by Nikolaj), at a profligate ceremony that sees Egyptians from all over the realm come to pay homage and celebrate the millennium of peace they have graciously enjoyed under the incumbent.\n\nThe god of War, Set, who happens to be Osiris' brother, comes to spoil the party for his nephew however, as he forcefully takes over the reigns in what would soon prove to become a blood-thirsty selfish onslaught for power and dominance. We swiftly discover that while the gods may live far longer than humans, there is some mortality to their existence, as they bleed gold amidst their shape- shifting capabilities. Known as 'beast mode', Set and Horus transform in a cataclysmic duel that leaves Set victorious and Horus banished sightless.\n\nThe true champions of the epic fantasy however, amidst all the majesty of a surfeit of powerful beings, happen to be the couple Bek and Zaya (played by Brenton Thwaites and Courtney Eaton respectively). Their love, which literally knows no boundaries, pushes men and gods alike to jettison all fear and restraint, in a battle to save the realms of both beings from total chaos.\n\nAn unlikely pair of Horus (light) and Bek end up journeying through the fantastic world of Egypt, and the realm of the 'creator', the god Ra, as they seek to get back Horus' abilities, as well as his self-worth and belief, in order to mount up a challenge against the increasingly insurmountable Set, who usurps the powers of other gods in his quest for supremacy.\n\nWhile the film may have, and continue to, receive a lot of flak for its lack of casting diversity, which pundits have declared is partly the source of its globally lackluster performance at the Box Office, one cannot take away from it the epic yet sternly successful proportions to which the producers and directors have gone to further the obsession with Egypt and its archaeological and mythological history to produce a stunning film.\n\n'Gods of Egypt' may be laden with a weak script, but it will take you on a pleasurable journey into the majesty envisioned of Egyptian deities, breathtaking landscapes and a plunge into how high (Set's tower not withstanding) the stakes are in the age-old battle of light versus darkness."

        "review_title": "\"Gods of Egypt\" is Above the February Movie Line! But Because of Casting Choices and Over-reliance on CGI, I Give it Stars of Nine.",
        "review_detailed_main": "I discovered \"Gods of Egypt\" when it was suggested by \"The Divergent Series: Allegiant\" trailer. It's very attractive for a fantasy action adventure movie. A story in the ancient Egypt is very refreshing to me, especially featuring gods instead of mummies. February feels like a passive month for movies, where usually romance and drama films dominate. Thankfully, this awesome movie is released.\n\nSet, the god of the desert, has taken over Egypt. Mortal hero Bek joins forces with Horus, god of the sky, to restore peace and order.\n\nIt's a visually stunning movie from start to finish. For a 140 million USD film, this is impressive. Fight scenes are well- choreographed. Music is great. Set pieces and props are intricately detailed. I like the scenes featuring the giant serpents, the goddess of love Hathor, the god of wisdom Thoth, the Sphinx, and the booby traps. There's also a memorable scene where the afterlife is featured, where the dead will offer gold heavier than the white feather to enter the next life. The movie also immerses you into the Egyptian environment.\n\nHowever, I just don't like how the main cast is mostly white. Ancient Egypt is composed of Blacks and Arabs. I understand that the studios are betting on Gerard Butler for his \"300\" and \"Olympus Has Fallen\" movie successes. He's prominently shown in trailers and TV spots, even though he's a villain. Also, some scenes heavily rely on CGI instead of practical effects. The armors of the winged creatures, who are Set and Horus, feel like taken from a video game. A scene where Set is riding a chariot feels CG-dependent. I guess they should have used CG to be the icing and not the cake base.\n\nOn a lighter note, I appreciate Lionsgate and Alex Proyas's separate apologies for the casting choice. Probably Australia's rules for tax incentives and relying on well-known actors are primary factors. They're humble enough to admit their shortcomings. I love the film. I'm actually delighted that this comes out on Feb. 24, just three days after my birthday! It's a gift! If they include a racially diverse cast for a sequel, I'll see it with greater excitement."

Gosh, adults are so spoiled today!!! Remember the kind of movies you used to see when you were a KID??? I wished there were movies like this in my childhood that are so visually stunning, plus thrilling with all those amazing unique characters!!! Didn't you loathe watching the same old movies on TV or in the theater as a kid and you had no choice? I grew up watching over and over, every single year, movies like \"The Thief of Bagdad\", \"Clash of the Titans\", \"Sinbad of the Seven Seas\", \"Moses\", \"Spartacus\", and various versions of Gladiator movies, too. I LOVE TO TAKE MY KIDS TO THE MOVIES ALL THE TIME, AND THEY HAVE SEEN LOTS OF SUMMER MOVIES EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SHOCKING TO ME AS A MOTHER, THAT MY 16 YEARS OLD, 12 YEARS OLD, AND 9 YEARS OLD SONS CLAPPED LOUDLY AT THE END OF THE MOVIE AND SAID THEY LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT. WHY, BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY WERE THE INDIANA JONES IN AN Egypt STORY, A THRILLING JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY ALL THROUGH THIS MOVIE, PLUS FIGHTING UNIQUE VILLAINS, CREATURES, AND GODS, AND THEY LOVED IT MORE THAN THE NEW STAR WARS MOVIE. I love Star Wars, but I grew up with it as a child, while my kids watch too much Star Wars cartoons on cable and seen all the past Star Wars movie. THIS IS AN ULTRA FANTASY MOVIE, SO DIFFERENT FOR MY KIDS EYES THAN TYPICAL STAR TREK, STAR WARS, AND A BUNCH OF OTHERS. MY KIDS GOT TO BECOME VARIOUS DIFFERENT AND THRILLING CHARACTERS ALL THROUGH THIS MOVIE, SO WILL YOURS TOO. I enjoyed this so much more than Clash of the Titans. In this movie, there's hot muscular men for the ladies and drop dead gorgeous model-like ladies for the men. So everybody wins!!! LOL! The only reason it didn't do well is that it should have come out in the summer, NOT after Deadpool, which ROCKS or after Valentine's Day. It's worth the RPX expensive tickets I spent. We had a blast!!! Hope for more positive reviews!!! Definitely, worth watching in the theater, NOT in a few month on your TV. I have a 80\" TV and the theater is still fantastic for these types of action pack movies!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed Gods of Egypt.\n\nWas the CGI bad? Sometimes. Did I care? Not really.\n\nI'm not enough of an expert to say if it does Egyptian mythology entirely right, but I know they got many things right, like Ra dragging the Sun in his chariot, the scales for weighing hearts in the afterlife, Set's murder of Osiris, etc. Things like this it got right, the plot is what deviates from Egyptian mythology.\n\nThe usual \"woke\" social justice warriors whined a lot about the mostly white cast (you'll see some in reviews here) but there are some POC actors in the movie, like Chadwick Boseman as Thoth (best thing in the movie, he was flamboyant & refined R. I. P.) Yaya Deng as Astarte & Elodie Young as Hathor. There were production limitations that prevented Egyptian actors being cast, such as a lack of English speaking Egyptian actors, studio pressure for box office draws that'd been in fantasy blockbusters (Gerard Butler from 300, Coster-Waldau from GoT) & Australian Film Board requirements that most the cast & crew be Aussies. So shut up, it's a fantasy movie about gods, not a documentary.\n\nThe production design is awesome. Great creature designs, awesome costumes reminiscent of Stargate, gold gold GOLD everywhere, it's a beautiful unique movie with lots of flair & originality, fantastical set pieces. And a solid cast that sells the story even though they're likely usually on a green-screen set.\n\nI would give it a 7 because sometimes it looks like a videogame & there's some narrative issues. But I'm giving it a 9 to offset all the unfair reviews. It's something you rarely see nowadays, a big budget movie that's daring & takes chances. I'd compare it to another maligned movie I liked that also took a myth & did something daring by upping the fantasy elements, Darren Aranofsky's 'Noah'. Gods of Egypt however is more of a colorful romp than the much darker Noah. Both are larger than life films & worth a viewing."

A lot of the effects were very obviously CGI but it didn't distract from my enjoyment of them. The main characters weren't bad to look at either. I liked the way they handled the violence. It was more like a video game for kids. It could have been really graphic with eyes being ripped out and put back, (still didn't watch that) but I could tell it was more cartoony than gory, which I appreciated.

Also another reason why I love this mythological references in it as a connoisseur on folklore and myth.\n\nSet in a time in ancient Egypt where the gods live among the humans, vengeful Set killed his brother King Osiris, usurp the throne from his nephew Prince Horus on his coronation and plucked his mystical eyes as well. With that, all of Egypt is enslaved and conquered. Two youngsters Bek and his sweetheart Zaya had managed to steal back one of Horus' eyes. But during their escape, Zaya was shot by an arrow and died. At the tomb where Horus had hid all those years (or months), Bek strikes a bargain with the despondent god: Resurrect Zaya in exchange for the other eye and help to stop Set. That's all I am telling. You folks will have see it for yourself.\n\nOverall, this is an awesome movie. It is very well written and is really cool! The story was perfect, full of suspense and really worth the PG-13 rating. I don't have a favorite scene (I know I had said that many times), because I love the whole film - from beginning to end."

        "review_detailed_main": "No one should come to this film expecting an accurate representation of ancient Egypt or Egyptian mythology. It's completely not that. In all ways, this is a remarkably well-executed 'dumb' movie, in that it's a simple fantasy action epic that focuses on fun and escapism as its core. The critique of whitewashing would be a good critique of the film if it weren't so obviously a fantasy that has no concern with mimesis. Scottish accents? Fine, I don't care. Does he glower and seem like a bad guy in the classic bad guy sense? Sure does, so it works.\n\nJudging this film to see if it's historically or mythologically accurate is the wrong way to go about it because that's not what the film is trying to do. It's trying to be fun, give you a classic Hollywood fantasy story arc, and give you reasonably good effects and performances and let you just enjoy something for two hours. On that level, it works.\n\nMoreover, what it's really trying to is represent not Egypt as it was, but a version of how Egypt understood itself: not as a country on a globe or continent, but a narrow stripe of the 'world' with the life-giving Nile at core and the endless desert around it. Although this isn't true (the Egyptians clearly know about Greece and other areas), it's somewhat close to the vision they had (just as the Greeks thought they were the center of the world). If you approach the film generous to that idea, then you'll enjoy it as long as you enjoy the spectacle of the thing. If you approach it wanting reality and social justice in casting, you're critiquing via the wrong criteria."

It's not likely to win any Oscars, but for once it's not a reboot or a sequel.\n\nThis is pure escapism with good CGI, an enjoyable story and some decent acting. True, the story isn't very complicated, but it depicts a hero's journey very well. Two heroes, a sceptical thief and a defeated god. The fact that they made Gods as separate race of beings, easily over 10 feet tall with golden blood was an added bonus to emphasise that despite their human features, they are anything but.\n\nElodie Young as Hathor was probably one of my favourites. The story resisted the trope portraying her as Egyptian Venus, instead using another one of her roles as the \"Mistress of the West\", welcoming people into the next life. Another very pleasant surprise was the architect played by Rufus Sewell. A minor role, but performed extremely well.\n\nI do wish they spent more time explaining about the afterlife and the role of Apophis.\n\nAll in all, good fun."

The film is a visual feast for the eyes, but the acting is top notch as well, this is not a bimboheaded Marvel or Superhero film. Even though the actors are portrayed as being mostly Caucasian, I do not see that as a detraction as there were different dynasties in Egypt and there have even been found mummies portrayed with blue eyes, so no, Egyptian royalty was never exclusively black, those were the Nubians who were south of Egypt. Anyhow, don't let 'HIStory' get in the way of a great entertaining film. One extra star for the depiction of the flat earth (the probable TRUE NATURE of our world)."

Gods of Egypt is a fun fantasy film that takes the idea of the Egyptian gods and comes up with a whole new story that's full of action, adventure, comedy and romance. Truly an epic movie.\n\nI see a lot of complaints about this movie and I honestly can't understand them. People complaining that the story isn't authentic. Well, that is sort of the point. They're not retelling the myths and legends of Egypt, they're taking the characters out of those stories and making something entirely new out of them. Something fun and original, instead of yet another remake of the same trash we've seen copy and pasted into a thousand different films. Originality, especially when it's so wonderfully presented, should NEVER be stifled.\n\nAs for those complaining that the movie \"looks bad\" or has \"cheesy CGI\", it's clear that they've not been watching the same movie as everyone else. Because this movie is beautiful. The special effects are stunning, the cinematography is beautiful and they just put so much effort into every last detail. I've seen movies with 100 times the budget not look anywhere near this polished.\n\nGods of Egypt is what we need to see Hollywood do more of. A beautiful, entertaining, and most importantly ORIGINAL concept. Something that's just incredibly fun to watch from start to finish. I would love to see more movies of this quality instead of the carbon copy remakes we keep getting."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know much about Egypt's ancient myths, so I was a bit concerned that I want be able to understand much of what is going on in the movie. All that I knew about Ancient Egypt and its gods was from a TV animated series called \"Adventures of Papyrus\". I loved that show as a kid and that's why I decided to give this take on Egyptian mythology a go.\n\nI'm glad I did.\n\nAs mention earlier, I was concerned that I want get much of why this guy looks like that or who is this god again? But the movie, being targeted at the general public that has no idea who these guys are, and knowing it, took it's time to introduce as to the workings of that universe and all the characters and did it flawlessly without taking us away from the story.\n\nThe things I liked- the visuals and landscapes. Some people here say the cgi sucks. Don't listen to them! It's done right. The acting was superb, especially Gerald Buttler's performance as the movie's baddie. The other actors did not disappoint as well. The story itself was pretty decent, too. Going in to watch a fantasy movie/hero's quest is what I can describe it as.\n\nWhat I sort of disliked- as I point out in the title- it started off slow. You really need to be patient with this movie. The first half an hour or so, as not as strong as the rest of the movie. I was really doubting if I will like it at all, but I decided to continue watching. Well, it kept getting better and better as time went by.\n\nSo to recap, if you like fairy tales, fantasy movies with sword fights, heroes on a quest/journey to fulfill their destiny and these kind of stories- you will enjoy this movie no doubt!"

And I must say, I was thoroughly entertained. The story flows from setting the stakes at the beginning, through many battles and twists it reaches a moving conclusion. And the imaginative way of presenting Egypt's mythology was very refreshing. Watching the trailer I thought they had only used the original mythology as a design guide, but they really use much of the myths accurately or well justified.\n\nMuch better than Clash of the Titans, or Percy Jackson in my opinion.\n\nThe obvious problem are the visuals, which vary from bad to mediocre, but many scenes were very nice indeed (like the Sphynx, I loved that one).\n\nOverall I would recommend it to any fan of Egyptian Mythology and popcorn movies."

Set was an intimidating and ruthless villain murdering his way across the world to impose his will upon it, and only Horus has the power to stop him. It dragged in parts but the film makes up for it with its exciting and explosive final showdown.\n\nChildren will love this movie, and adults can appreciate a film that finally explores Egyptian mythology in a big budget story."

But the story does an adequate job of supporting the visuals and their transition from one to the next. The complaints about the ethnicity of the actors was noise in the wind for me. All of the actors were attractive in their roles. This was so much the case I feel obliged to give my compliments to the person responsible for the casting.

The forced humor was misplaced but you can see that the film was paying homage to old-school sword and sandals like Hercules and Jason and the Argonauts. I adored 70s and 80s movies of that type.\n\nElodie Yung shined here and Nikolai was clearly game for the odd role. I was surprised at how Brenton was somewhat wooden in his delivery and came off worst here than his turn in Pirates. My only real complaint was Gerard Butler who can't act and Geoffrey Rush who phoned it in. All in all I enjoyed it more than BvS, MoS and JL COMBINED!"

There is a lot of cgi and some people may not like that. However i feel that the cgi was so beautifully done like the way avatar was that it transports you to another world, which is what movies are supposed to do. To see this in 3d was just breathtaking. The pyramids and architecture was just so monumental and larger than life. The fight scenes were extremely well done. I think the actors did good for the type of movie it is. it easily looks like they spent 250 mil to make it . I give this movie a 10 and i look forward to it coming on Blu-ray."

Then you have Gerard Butler so I knew it wouldn't be a waste of my time. The film was even better than I could have hoped. I think it's more to do with the times we're living in whereby film makers can no longer get away with having two dimensional characters (and still expect a high IMDb rating) or women who just stand there looking pretty, or have an all-white cast with a few token darker-skinned people who get thrown one or two lines...erm...well, there's always going to be 'some' of that (society hasn't progressed that much) but this film at least 'tries' to avoid those clich\u00e9s. The two main women have real personalities and Hathor, a.k.a. the Goddess of Love (Elodie Yung), portrays her sexuality in a refreshingly modern way (no crying about feeling taken advantage of for her own decisions etc.) The action is spectacular, there's a lot of originality in most of the fight scenes, and I liked the storyline. It was predictable but again, they at least explored other possibilities before returning to the road more travelled.\n\nGods of Egypt was a very nice surprise and it deserves a much higher IMDb rating. I'd have given it a 10 if they had stuck to one of the possible less-predictable endings but 9/10 it is."

This reminds me of several Films I enjoyed when younger such as 'Golden Voyage of Sinbad' or 'Clash of the Titans' - movies that are entertaining and can be seen by the whole Family. The leads do a good job, with Coster-Waldau the cynical Horus, having to battle Set, played with bells-on by Gerard Butler as they fight for the throne of Egypt. Thrown in are great VFX of an Ancient Egypt world, a young persons romance and Geoffrey Rush as the Sun God - Ra.\n\nI found the film entertaining and the humour well done. It has great visuals and the production design is excellent. The late Chadwick Boseman makes for an interesting Thoth, while Elodie Yung's goddess of love - Hathor - is a delight.\n\nIf you just want an entertaining, old-fashioned, Family action Film, you could do FAR worse than watch this!"

There are really touching and funny bits here and there in fact the thing about this movie as opposed to let's say Wrath of the Titans no one ever over acts and Alex Proyas maneuvers through this visually beautiful film with the same ease as smoothness of a knife cutting butter gently thoughtfully and it works. You will grow to love Beck, to admire Hathor, without warning you'll find yourself cheering on the hero and it all happens so subtly. A fresh in film in a time of Bombastic loud Super hero movies Alex Proyas there is a third Act to his Directing career and abilities adding a new layer to his talent we have all come to love. No its not Dark City or I Robot but it is bathed in light, love, beauty something unexpected from what he's done Before I like it a lot. The 3D is done with care and restraint but no less impact full when it should be see it."

The special effects were wonderful. And the whole thing on the afterlife was also well done. Not sure how it is going at the box office but I hope it's doing well. It's a shame people go by critics. I too nearly did with batman vs superman. But am glad I went as that turned out to be another good movie well written as well. If movies interest you just go see."

I think we have all forgotten the joy of watching films like this where there is little darkness and evil, except for the baddies, good will triumph, and along the way there will be simple messages of humanity and kindness.\n\nPlease don't stop watching and making films like this, we need some simple pleasures and happiness in our lives."

Before I realize, I'll be zapping between tv stations, do something else on my pc or turn off the dvd. (I don't go to cinema's much.)\n\nThis movie held me in my seat watching. It a has a modern day make-over to a classic old epic movie from back in the day. I loved all the color representing good times, while the bad times are mostly less bathed in bright colors. As for the gods being bigger than mortals, nice touch!, but I do feel that these ancient and almighty gods could have had some more godly powers, I mean what god would walk the desert if he is able to \"think\" himself to his destination...., after all they created everything.\n\nThe story was quite entertaining, the plot was somewhat predictable but it did have some unexpected and pleasant twists. CGI wasn't mindblowing but it fitted in nicely enough to not be annoyingly present. (Meaning bad)\n\nMy conclusion, not a masterpiece but not as bad as critics claim it to be. Despite my ADD I watched it a couple of times now and not once did ai feel bored or felt the need to turn it off. If a movie keeps me in my seat and makes me want to see what happens next, it's a good movie in my opinion.\n\nNote: I like to watch all types of movies, except certain rom-coms, so this review is not written by a person who has a narrow perspective on movies!"

I watched this on a pirated 480p dvdrip on my iphone 4s. The CGI was stunning! The scenery was so authentic I really felt i was in the ancient Egypt. (by the way, did you know Egypt is located in Asia?)\n\nThe main role is played by the handsome Jaime Lannister, and King Leonidas. (How did he get all the way from Sparta to Asia?) I personally believe the actors used method acting, because you could really see the raw emotions portrayed in this masterpiece of a movie. TMZ also reported that Jaime Lannister walked around with a blindfold for a whole year preparing for this movie. Thats what I call dedication! This movie made Egypt great again.\n\nThis movie brings forth so many emotions, and i can personally promise you that when Bek smiles, you will smile too.\n\n10/10 will watch again, instant classic!"

That being said, I just re-watched this flick (again!) and was telling a friend I thought it was maybe one of the best movies ever made... I had to look it up online becuz I couldn't for the life of me remember the director's name, tho I knew he'd done Garage Days as well--another really cool flick, btw--and I was horrified by what I saw written about GoE. I had to actually double-check that it was the same movie. I have no idea where these people could be coming from.\n\nEverything about GoE was good, if not great. I'm not an action- or special fx-driven viewer, but what was presented in that respect was well done too. The attire of the cast was so outstandingly striking that I spent a long time trying to find out who the designer was. So okay, I guess there was one thing lacking in that after reading the credits over and over, the titles given to the wardrobe people still left me with no clue as to who actually designed the clothing (so if anyone reading this can decipher it down to a name for me, I'd really like to know who it was that did such a good job). And that's about all the \"negativity\" you'll get here. Maybe the \"bombing at the box office\" has more to do with cool people opting to watch at home instead of paying $20 to not be able to pause to go to the bathroom or not be able to have a smoke or drink than it has to do with the movie itself, that's the only thing I can figure.\n\nGo watch it if you haven't already, it's such a cool flick."

I miss alot trying to interpret films or books.\n\nBut I did notice that of the hundreds of reviews below, only one tried to mention what this film was about (The myth of Tep Zepi fused with Osiris/Isis myth). I found zero reviews mentioning metaphor. Maybe its a mistake to even try as nobody else seems to be.\n\nAnyway, to me it seemed like one of the key messages was that Horus, God of Air, is noted for keen vision. And if Horus is blind, watch out- because chaos and entropy and all sorts of demons lurk just beyond the realm of the known.\n\nI feel you could go deeper in analyzing, but not with my limited skill. So for me, it is a reasonable action film (that sometimes feels too video gamey), with some deep underlying messages, that we would do well to remember even today.\n\nAn action flick, with a moral? How can you rate that as 5/10!?!"

Never seen anything like this so massive congrats to the makers for pushing the boundaries. The humour was funny and worked well throughout. The casting is spot on - every actor played their part fantastically well. Character development is awesome - I ended up really liking all lead characters. Good job. The special effects are top notch and the pacing is fast - never a dull moment with this movie. If you like the fantasy genre you'll love this - everything you could ask for - believable monsters, exciting fight scenes, epic scale, beautiful backdrops (Egypt is amazing), a bit of magic and some extra stuff that you'll have to watch to find out but works really well and really adds another dimension to the film. I really hope that they make a sequel. The romance is believable and moving - and I'm not usually a big fan of romance in fantasy films. This production really carries you away to another world to enjoy - and that's what I look for in a good flick. There's so many twists, turns, unexpected stunts and unusual story elements - it really is a great story. I don't understand why this is only a 5.5 score because I think it's the best film I've seen all year! Can't praise this film enough - just watch it!"

This movie is full of over the top action and CGI and silly plot stuff, but it was NOT meant to be A Few Good Men or Schindler's List. It's a move that you and your kids can sit down by the fire on Sunday night with a plate full of chocolate chip cookies and HAVE FREAKUN FUN WATCHING MOVIE!! It is exactly what it is supposed to be. It did not win any Oscars. It will NOT be the best movie you have ever seen. But gees people, how many movies actually fall into those categories? This movie is fun. Gerard Butler does a fantastic job as usual. The rest of the actors do ok, but no one is going to win an oscar. You have giant fire breathing cobras, a giant earth eating demon, and a great air dogfight between Set the Egyptian god of Darkness and Horus the Lord of the Air that is pretty dadgum cool. It also features some pretty good acting from Nikolaj Waldau (from Game of Thrones fame), Geoffrey Rush ( a season vet who always does well) and Courtney Eaton of Mad Max Fury Road fame (one of the hottest young female actresses in the known universe). So...quit with the ridiculous critique of this movie. Enjoy it for what it is and what it was meant to be...a fun action movie. If you see it for anything else, then YOU don't deserve the right to critique it. Enjoy the movie and be entertained. Rant over, have a nice day."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gods of Egypt takes place at a time when gods lived on earth among humans. Ra lives on a boat in the sky and has to battle Chaos ever day. His son Osiris rules over the fertile lands of Egypt while his other son Set rules over the desert. It's time for Osiris to cede the throne to his son Horus. During the ceremony, Set shows up, kills Osiris, blinds Horus, takes his girl Hathor--the goddess of love, kills some other gods and takes their power and names himself king of all Egypt. Why gods need to be kings as well, I don't know.\n\nNow Horus is banished somewhere while Set is busy building a giant Obelisk to honor Ra. He also plans on obtaining more power by killing more gods and eventually letting Chaos rule. The story is told through the eyes of two humans, some young hustler named Bek and his gorgeous girlfriend Zaya. Bek doesn't have faith in the gods, Zaya believes that Horus will return and re-take the throne and make everything right again. Set's first decision was to institute payment for those who die and want to enter the afterlife. Those who can't afford it end up in some dark hellish cloud, not sure if they die completely or what. Zaya works for Set's architect who is building the obelisk. Zaya suggests Bek steal Horus's eyes which Set is keeping in one of his buildings since she has access to all the plans. Bek succeeds in recovering one eye but during some battles Zaya is killed. She embarks on her long journey to the afterlife but has nothing to offer once she arrives at the place where \"justice\" is meted out.\n\nBek now searches for and finds Horus and gives him the eye and tries to convince him to retake his rightful place. Hathor also joins them, she feels for Bek who is in love. They offer Bek that they'll bring Zaya back knowing full well it's impossible.\n\nWhat follows then is a series of adventures as these guys try to make it back to the city to confront Set. Ra will also play a role as does Toth, the god of wisdom. It will all resolve in some battles between the gods.\n\nGods of Egypt delivers some fantastic sights. Some of the CGI doesn't convince but a lot looks really great. While most movies like to emphasize darkness and film as much as possible at night, Gods of Egypt thankfully focuses on brightness and daylight. The mythology is fascinating but unfortunately not really the focus of this movie. The humans of course aren't all that interesting. Courtney Eaton though is absolutely stunning. While the cast is strong, acting isn't up to par. Even though we're dealing here with grandiose events, acting is subdued and we get a wide range from the good to the terrible, as in the case of the individual playing the God of Wisdom.\n\nGods of Egypt while not quite as spectacular as it could have been is a good-looking movie with an interesting and unique mythology."

For those of us who are into cultural films, action, empowered women, and deities of ancient religion this movie is legit. I've watched it 4 times in the past 2 weeks.\n\nHathor is definitely my favorite and I learned a lot about Egyptian folklore. The entire movie is nonstop and all of the characters are engaging and keep your attention. After the film I started reading up on Egyptian Gods/Goddesses and this particular tale is derived from actual Egyptian myth.\n\nDefinitely worth a watch, a rent, or a buy because it doesn't look like it did well enough to stay long in theaters to at least hit par with its $150mill budget; however, come on guys n gals we all dig lookin' at Gerard Butler: muscles, leather garb, Scottish accent, and such since the movie The 300. The character playing the powerful Hathor aka Mistress of The West/Goddess of Love is gorgeous, intelligent, and worth a look at further as an actress. I'm not as familiar with her, but her acting and the view is quite good.\n\nEnjoy and Happy Holidays everyone!"

I believe most negative reviews come from the not so convincing performance of Bek who needs more experience but did fairly well, the overly funny God of wisdom who could have been written better, more serious and with a more mystical allure and last but not least with the overly villainous part played by G. Butler who went a little over the edge with his acting here. Still, even so. A love story played on multiple fronts with great characters and a good plot. If only they took longer to characterize everyone and build up the story. 2 hours is not enough. It needed at least three."

        "review_detailed_main": "So I was bored one day and thought \"hey, I remember this cool- looking CGI Egypt movie that was supposed to suck, why not watch it?\" So I did, and I was pleasantly surprised. First of all: YES THE EGYPTIANS IN THIS MOVIE ARE MOSTLY WHITE. Some of them are also about 12 feet tall and can transform into flying robots. If historical accuracy is what you're looking for, this is not the movie for you, but I don't feel that this detracts from the story or the characters or the amazing visuals and had no effect on my overall enjoyment of the film.\n\nI've heard people complain about how its not original or the plot sucks or the script sucks, and maybe this is only because I went in with such low expectations, but I actually found the story pleasant and enjoyable (albeit not very complicated, but that's not necessarily bad), and some of the lines were legitimately funny. Not to mention this is one of those rare movies that isn't based off a book or is a sequel/remake (not that those are necessarily bad either), so the originality argument doesn't make that much sense either. Now, obviously it wasn't a fantastic movie - it was pretty heavy with clich\u00e9s, some of the dialogue did fall flat, a few deus ex machina moments, and the CGI didn't always hold up - but for what it Set out to do (be a fun, action packed, cool-looking movie to not think very hard about) it did a good job. Better than it needed to in fact, because I usually can't stand the main characters in those types of movies but Horus and that mortal guy were actually pretty likable.\n\nIf you were expecting some sort of documentary about Egyptian mythology, stay away from this, and don't bring down its rating with unfair reviews based on your unreasonable expectations."

It works on the comic level too though just made in Sydney Australia with Canadian backing and lacks the USA flag waving. Another of those films that did a lot better internationally than in the US market. Australia's Brenton Thwaites was great as the young mortal and Game of Throne's Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Horus was as good as always. It also included Scotland's Gerard Butler and Australia's Geoffrey Rush, Brian Brown and others.\n\nThis is nothing like the Exodus of last year even though it seems to be similar in theme.

I occasionally read reviews before I see or rent a movie. I'm glad I didn't here. I would've missed out on a truly fun picture. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has heart. Which is not easy to do in an action, fantasy film. I totally enjoyed the two plots, love interests and the actors that played them.

A fun movie that's best seen more than once, I suspect, as we don't know these characters in the West and it's a little hard keeping them straight the first time. (My wife had no trouble.) This is an ambitious, very dense and fast moving fantasy. Some of the women are a little mind-boggling, but they don't seem to know it. The CGI is often annoying but if you just think about the idea they're expressing and forget the shortcomings of its manifestation, it's easy to let it have its say.\n\nNikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Horus is in the central role. He's next to be crowned the King of Egypt, but he's a bit of a wastrel and loses the crown even before he's crowned. He's loved by Hathor, played by the bewitching Elodie Yung. They're two of the many gods inhabiting Egypt along with its many mortals. They're taller than the mortals and can turn into powerful beasts at will. The story revolves around Set, played by Gerard Butler, who wants to rule Egypt, Horus and a human, Bek, played by Brenton Thwaites who shows these gods that we humans can be clever and brave too.\n\nI particularly liked how it's so divorced from the Judeo-Christian mythology, that it's refreshing and a relief. It's no masterpiece, but it's hardly the dud IMDb seems to think it is."

Trying to explain the exact details of how the Egyptian pantheon worked would be beyond the scope of any movie, particularly as it changed over time and would not be entertaining to anyone who wasn't a scholar on the subject anyway. As to the subject of white actors - if you are going to have 10 feet tall gods, boats sailing through space and giant fire breathing worms I think you can give up on that kind of accuracy. Anyway, I enjoyed it. Sort of \"Jason and the Argonauts\" for the 21st century."

It's by no means perfect, and some times the acting comes off as cringe-worthy, but the overall movie is well worth watching, and might just bring a tear or two to your eyes if you're not careful.\n\nThis is the kind of film that can be safely enjoyed in any company, although the angstiest of teenagers might get uncomfortable with all the emotions, both joyful and sad, this movie takes you through. For adults and those young children whose innocence hasn't yet been spoiled by the act-tough teenager culture, this is a journey well worth taking."

The CGI was remarkable overall and who cares when things occasionally look slightly fake. Effects look fake in some classical monster movies, yet they are still great! Also there were some cracking one liners, this movie, is smarter than most. The movie is all about spectacle and, rarely for modern movies, it has a love interest story that is charming and adds to the movie, rather than subtracts. This movie is not taking itself too seriously and it is all about good old fashioned fun. I really recommend it. It's safe to ignore the sniffy critics in this case. A movie like this is 100% more entertaining than crap like Batman vs Superman, or The Mummy with that scientologist fool."

I rented it out of curiosity, because I was really looking for a good ancient Egypt mythology movie and I was so positively surprised by it and was not disappointed at all. I think it definitely helps if you are really into ancient Egyptian mythology or at least interested in it to enjoy this movie a lot more, like me. Because if you are, this movie is absolutely amazing. What I really liked is that you never get bored in this movie, there is so much action and its awesome. There are also so many beautiful shots of the ancient Egyptian landscape and of the ancient Egyptian city with the Nile vibrantly glowing and the pyramids shining and if you fantasize about ancient Egypt and what it looked like, this is what you would imagine it as. I loved the general Visuals of the movie, because of how creative they were. There are also a ton of gods mentioned and seen in this movie for ancient Egypt mythology fans to have fun and put their knowledge to use, which I also love. The reason why Im personally not giving it a 10/10 is because at the beginning the movie felt a bit too fast paced and also in some scenes the CGI could have been better, but then again I think all the action, the amazing creativity, the eye catching visuals and the entertaining characters make up for that. Thats my personal review of the Movie ,,Gods of Egypt\", directed by Alex Proyas."

        "review_detailed_main": "When the credits rolled after having watched this movie with my kids I was perplexed. I knew this movie had not received very great ratings and I had heard rumors that some people had even labelled it the worst movie of the year. However, I had liked watching the movie...a lot!\n\nSure, the script is predictable and certainly wont win any prices for best script anywhere. The acting is adequate but no more. But it is a fun fantasy adventure movie, a simple adventure / action fantasy roller-coaster. Plenty of fairly cool special effects. Some humor, some romance. It is also fairly devoid of politically correct preaching, whining, mentally unstable and self destructive \"heroes\" and all that crap. In short it is the kind of movie I like.\n\nI actually looked up the movies page on Wikipedia and it was pretty much full of nonsense and whining about how the movie was not \"ethnically correct\". What the f...? It is a bloody fantasy adventure movie for Christ sake! It is meant to entertain! Who the hell cares about whether the actors are native Egyptians or something else? Well, I guess Eskimos would look a bit funny in those roles but otherwise...\n\nYes it does take quite a few liberties with Egyptian mythology but again, it is a fantasy movie guys! And Egyptian mythology, like any other mythology, goods etc, is nothing but fantasy and story telling from the start so just live with it. To me they stayed true enough to the core of the mythology and I would actually give the director and script writers bonus points for actually depicting the earth as flat as was the predominant belief in those times. Those scenes with Ra dragging the sun and the flat Earth was quite beautiful actually.\n\nThe rating on IMDb is also on the low side but of those that took the effort to write a review most seems to be quite positive. The mostly negative ones are, of course, the so called \"critics\". No surprise there.\n\nIt is sad to see how a, in my opinion a quite entertaining, movie can be so sabotaged by a bunch of, again in my opinion, loud mouthed, ignorant, intolerant, fanatical SJWs who seems to believe that a movie cannot be allowed to just entertain but has to carry a political message, their political message.\n\nI would recommend anyone into fantasy and adventure movies to check this one out if you should stumble upon it. I certainly do not regret adding it to my collection."

Yes the acting coulds have been better, but there is so much CGI included everywhere to develop the 'gods' side of this world, that it must have been hard to keep in character all the time when you're talking to the air. This will be the single little flaw I saw in this movie. I don't care about Egyptian Gods don't looking Egyptian, after all who knows how they looked like? It's a fantasy setting, and it's obvious that the production staff had a lot of fun adding references to other mythologies and other views of how a world with Gods living among us,would have looked like.\n\nBecause yes, it didn't have to be a perfect carbon copy of what we know about Egyptian mythology.
