Schumachers approach is too comical and Gotham has lost the sinister ora that Burton created, Val Kilmer is OK as the bat, and he certainly helps save the film from total disaster.\n\nAll the other characters are new, Nicole Kidman (Dr. Chase Meridian) brings sex appeal, but her character delivers little more. Chris O'Donnell is introduced as Robin, and his martial arts antics do add something to the film. Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face and as usual his performance is decent, but the star of the show is Jim Carrey as the Riddler; his performance is both camp and eccentric, and it hits the mark brilliantly.\n\nThe problem with the movie, although i did enjoy it, is the total change in style; the backdrop of Gotham city is no longer dark and Gothic and the series is moving away from Batmans comic roots.\n\nThis was the beginning of the end, and it was followed by Batman and Robin. Thank god for Batman Begins.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Some people talk about \"the stick of straw that broke the camel's back\", meaning when something reached the tipping point. So when did the Batman franchise go bad? Well, \"Batman Forever\" was getting silly, but it still had Jim Carrey to steal the show as The Riddler (\"Batman and Robin\" had about as many good qualities as a barrel of toxic waste). Personally, I don't know why they had to have Batman (Val Kilmer) going through therapy; remove that and he still would have been a cool superhero with neat gadgets. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't bad as Two-Face. Nicole Kidman and Chris O'Donnell, as Dr. Chase Meridian and Robin, respectively, didn't really add anything.\n\nOverall, the point is that when Joel Schumacher took over directing, the franchise went downhill. Part of the problem was that while Tim Burton created an eerie Gotham City that looked like New York in the 1940s, Joel Schumacher created a Gotham City that looked like it was trying too hard to be \"Blade Runner\".\n\nSo, the franchise starting getting stale with this one, but Jim Carrey kept the movie from being unwatchable. As Edward Nygma, one of Bruce Wayne's employees, he had some great lines. In the movie, Nygma proposes a device that rests atop TV sets and reads peoples' minds, but Wayne rejects it, considering it too dangerous. Thus, Nygma becomes The Riddler, and he's the best character in the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "What I can say about Batman Forever is that it is getting too much hate. It is definitely not a good movie but it just isn't as bad as everyone is saying.\n\nOne of the things that ruins this movie is the awful script. While the plot is not that bad, the script is just plain awful. It's filled with unfunny and dumb jokes and poorly written dialogues. I'm aware that this movie is comic based and so I shouldn't expect much from it but this horrible script makes it look more like a parody.\n\nThe casting was also not very good. Val Kilmer as Batman was ok (if compared to Michael Keaton), Jim Carrey also did a quite good job as the Riddler. But Tommy Lee Jones's portrayal of Two Face was terrible. Two Face is a character that suffers from split personality, but the movie didn't show that. Tommy Lee Jones was playing a role that was closer to the Joker. All these \"insane acts\" that he was doing throughout the movie made me think that this is actually the Joker who for some reason got half of his face burnt.\n\nOf course there are many reasons why you might enjoy this movie. The plot is not bad and even interesting at some points. If you are a fan of Jim Carrey movies you'll surely like Batman Forever not only because of the unique performance that only Jim Carrey can give but also because this movie is way more colorful than other Batman movies.\n\nFor conclusion I can say that Batman Forever is a kid friendly movie that is excellent if you have time to waste. It is definitely not a good movie but still doesn't deserve to be called the worst"

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman Forever may be the most unfairly criticzed super-hero film ever made. It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat. Schumacher just added more color and neon which honestly is a welcome change from the stark art deco gothic flavor present in Returns. Nothing wrong with that flavor in Returns, it's just that Burton went all in and we didn't necessarily need more of the same. Batman Returns actually has considerably different art direction from Batman 1989 yet you rarely hear fans complain about that difference or even acknowledge it.\n\nNicole Kidman is perfectly cast as Chase Meridian and I like Chris O'Donnell as Robin even though he was probably a tad old. Everyone criticizes Val Kilmer for being too bland compared to Keaton but honestly the latter wouldn't have worked at all in the film the way it was done. Since Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are both such strong personalities a more stoic Kilmer contrasts that well. Batman Forever really is Jim Carrey's vehicle though. You watch Batman Forever for Jim Carrey the same way you watch Batman 1989 for Jack Nicholson."

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman Forever is the third installment for Warner Bros. Batman franchise, only Tim Burton and Michael Keaton decided to jump ship, so now we're stuck with Joel Schumacher, Val Kilmer and writing so campy it'll make you want to pitch a tent and make some s'mores. What we see in this film is a systematic destruction of absolutely everything that made the first two Batman films so popular.\n\nKidman and Kilmer have been great in other films like \"Moulin Rouge\" and \"Tombstone,\" but Joel is simply incapable of getting any good performances out of his actors. Don't believe me? There's a scene where Kidman's character tells Batman to meet her at her place at midnight. Even though she's expecting company, she decides to sleep in the nude before he shows up. I can understand her character trying to seduce Batman, but why go to bed and fall asleep while you're expecting company? Just listen to her character's inner conflict when she says \"I can't believe it. I've imagined this moment since I first saw you... and now I have you and... guess a girl has to grow up sometime.\" I guess I can't blame Kidman on doing the best with the crap she was given. Someone needs to fire Mr. Script Writer.\n\nJoel, in the tradition of Burton's previous Batman film, decided to use two villains at once: the Riddler and Two-Face. Personally, I wonder why the director would want to use two villains when he can't get one character right.\n\nIn previous Batman films, the villains were layered characters. The Joker was back-stabbed in a set up, Catwoman was in a mid-life crisis and sick of being taken advantage of, and the Penguin was a social outcast playing the sympathy card so he could get revenge on Gotham. While these character motives are little more than \"I want revenge\" at least it's something. Joel enjoys making the villains of his Batman films silly cardboard cutouts which don't make any sense at all.\n\nJoel turned Harvey Two-Face, a steely, no-nonsense crime boss, into a laughing idiot that hops up and down whenever he blows something up. There's a quick twenty second explanation of how Harvey Dent had acid thrown on him during a trial, so he swore revenge on Batman... what? Batman didn't throw the acid. Two-Face is pretty much Tommy Lee Jones copying Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker, except with different makeup, and the Riddler isn't far behind. Jim Carrey was acting like... well... Jim Carrey. As \"good\" as Carrey's performance might be, there's really no room for non-sequitur dance sequences and goofy voices to be thrown into the middle of a scene-- but that's what Jim is good at doing, I guess. As for Edward Nigma, they briefly explained how he became the Ridler (he was fired from his job, I know that tends to make people become super-villains), but never explained why he likes making riddles. His master plan: become the smartest man alive by reading the minds of Gotham's citizens and then... and then... uh... well, it doesn't matter because we all know Batman will save the day.\n\nAs if a poorly done treatment for Two-Face and the Riddler, and a poorly done romance subplot added into the mix weren't enough, we have another poorly done subplot thrown in: Robin! The most hated side-kick in the world. Joel introduce Robin as a character who wants revenge on Two-Face and offers absolutely nothing else significant to the story. There's not much to say about Robin, except that he kicks ass at doing laundry. He's just eye-candy so the ladies (and Joel) have someone to swoon over in this poor excuse for an action film.\n\nThe biggest crime in Gotham was how Joel rebuilt the city. He demolished Burton's Gothic atmosphere and added colored lights and large bronze statues to turn the desolate wasteland of a city into a sparkling Las Vegas wonderland. He also introduced the phosperhous gang, a group of guys who glow in the dark and play heavy metal music... drug trafficking never looked so fabulous! Big naked man statues, face-painting gangs, and rubber nipples summarize everything that Joel has added to the franchise.\n\nI've heard some arguments standing up on Joel's defense, claiming that the movie would've been better with the deleted scenes put back in. Namely, two scenes: one which shows TwoFace escaping from Arkham, writing some sort of anti-Bat message in a victim's blood, and other scene where Bruce gets amnesia and has to remember why he's Batman. The first scene was supposedly cut for being too scary for kids, but I can safely say that it was filmed and edited to fit into the rest of this crap fest perfectly. And the amnesia scene was utter crap. Honestly: AMNESIA. As if a bullet grazing Bruce's forehead and causing amnesia isn't far fetched enough, how about the fact that he cures it in under five minutes? That scene wasn't cut for being too dark, or too slow, it was cut for being too stupid.\n\nIt could be worse. You could be watching the next installment \"Batman and Robin.\" At least the plot for Batman Forever wasn't as poorly juggled as that movie. The worst you get with this movie is a bunch of clich\u00e9s, poor acting, nonsensical moments (as in \"why would only thirty or so members of the circus audience slowly form a circle to look at the the dead trapeze artists?\"), and an undoing everything dark and dramatic that made the first two films good. What we're left with is a campy, kid-friendly movie that anyone with a brain can tell is just a cheap knock off of the first two Batman films."

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved the first two Batman movies, and honestly would have loved to see Burton go on to direct more entries in the series, but Joel Shumacher's Batman Forever is not at all an unwelcome change. I think some people recollect this film and automatically associate it with Shumacher's awful second Batman attempt, Batman & Robin. That is the bad movie. This is not. People also seem to forget how big of a hit it was. Artistically, there were things it got wrong and didn't do as well as the others, but there were things it did so much better, too. For one thing, this is the only 'Batman' with a decent soundtrack to its name (including 2 great songs by U2 and Seal).\n\nIn some ways you can look at this as a transition from the dark, tortured Batman to a Batman who has finally conquered his personal demons and gone on to be happier in being a man who fights crime in the night dressed up in rubber. For this one it was good, 'cause that's essentially how it ends, but the result of this led to the campy and just plain boring 4th episode.\n\nBut I really was surprised at how psychological of a movie Batman Forever is. I'm not saying it's particularly deep, but when you look at Edward Nygma's obsession with Bruce Wayne (stalking him, to imitating him right down to the mole), Harvey Dent's schizophrenia as Two-Face, and the fact that both Bruce Wayne AND Batman end up romancing the same psychologist is all enormously amusing. The romance isn't to be taken that lightly, though. I thought out of all 5 films Chase Meridian was Bruce's best girlfriend. The whole Vicky Vale relationship was pretty stale if you cut out all of the conflict with the Joker, and obviously Selina Kyle didn't work out so well for Bruce. Having this woman who could understand the mind of the tortured Bruce Wayne was a great idea, and I don't need to tell you that the gorgeous and talented Nicole Kidman pulled it off well.\n\nSomething I liked (and would have liked to have seen more of) was the competitive relationship between Bruce Wayne and Edward Nygma. They're enemies as Batman and The Riddler but also as regular people in everyday life. Take that scene at the Nygmatec Ball when Edward gloats about how well off he is, but Bruce is totally unflinching. Jim Carrey does a great job with a character that is so obsessed with this person; who idolizes him but hates him at the same time and is generally evil, but still can make us fall on the floor laughing.\n\nThis is a rousing and dynamic picture. It's basically the lighter side of being Batman. It was exciting with some great action sequences: I loved the end where both Robin and Chase are dropped and he saves them both. That piece of Elliot Goldenthal music when Batman finally grasps Robin's arm is excellent.\n\nI liked Burton's 2 films and obviously Batman Begins better than Forever, but when you're in the right mood for it, it really is a fantastic movie that, if nothing else, thoroughly entertains.\n\nMy rating: 7/10"

Tom Lee Jones stars in his second movie featuring him as a psycho and U2 on the soundtrack. He guffaws, he sneers, he sobs, he smiles manically and gives as physical as a performance as his aging body allows.\n\nPity, then, that he fades completely in every scene Jim Carrey is in, or every scene where we expect him to enter soon, which are all of Lee's scenes. And it's no wonder. Jim Carrey is his usual wacko character, grimacing and silly-walking his way through the movie. While that's usually fun to watch, Joel Schumachers tilting direction makes it all slightly nauseating.\n\nHe does have some of the best lines, and there's nothing wrong with his performance. I stress 'his', cause there was plenty of wrong with the others. Chris O'Donnel juts his jaw and strains his face, throwing lines left and right without the slightest fore-thought. Nicole Kidman stands around looking sassy and gets some of the worst lines.\n\nVal Kilmer is totally bland, and were it not for \"Heat\" I would not be able to recall how he looked. And we covered Tom Lee Jones. There are a few other roles, all of them filled with people busting to top Jim Carreys performance. The only one we can trust is old Michael Gough, the butler.\n\nThere are plenty of phony-looking gun fights and explosions, large sets that actually give you the unusual gut feeling that the money could have been used to build that house in Gambia or Etiopia, and more innuendo than you can stand, ranging from the obvious(closeup of the Batbutt with a mysterious zipper) to the slightly more sublime(Alfred calling Robin \"Master Dick\").\n\nUnless you're a Jim Carrey fan or like camp-noir movies, then there's nothing for you to see here. Move along."

Jim Carrey is a scene-stealer and dead on as The Riddler, and Val Kilmer is the perfect Bruce Wayne and Batman. Tommy Lee Jones does a great turn as Two-Face, unfortunately he isn't given enough to do and therefore comes across too cartoony, minus the angst of the character in the comics. One other big complaint is the new score - gone are Danny Elfman's orchestrations. Elliot Goldenthal's music would have been fine if not for his predecessor. Most people tend to lump this one in the 'lousy' section, it seems, but it was one of the biggest movies of '95 and a very faithful adaption overall. Now if they'd only release the director's cut"

Well, I decided to revisit it and finally see Batman and Robin in the past week and well, this movie still has absolutely no redeeming values.\n\nWe can't even get a minute into the film when we are introduced to Val Kilmer as Batman in the batcave as the corporate sell out. \"I'll get drive thru\" he responds to Alfred after he had offered him a sandwich to go (I remember the stupid McD's tie-in commercial). Good to know the filmmakers are straight with us and let us know there is no integrity in this bat-world.\n\nKilmer is a robot as Bruce Wayne AND as Batman. Some lines almost sound as if they can't even get out because he is just so incredibly rigid. The dialogue is of course, idiotic, but then what did we expect. Joel Schumacher began his deconstruction of the franchise with non-stop MTV cuts and completely gratuitous dutch angles, not to mention every damned shot has every color in the spectrum represented in it! That's not art, that's a bad excuse for not having a visual style.\n\nThe villains - ugghhh!!! It was such a bad idea to combine two villains that are basically identical. They are both totally 100% insane. They don't compliment each other at all, instead they annihilate you with a never-ending barrage of craziness and bad over-acting. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were two of the five most in-demand actors at the time and they got top billing, but Carrey is simply the wrong choice for the Riddler and worse, the character of the Riddler is now a scientist!!!??? Two-Face is a poor man's version of the Joker without the grandeur and presence of Nicholson's great madness.\n\nDrew Barrymore is utterly wasted in a nothing role. Chris O'Donnell is given the thankless role of Robin and gets to be the sidekick to the robot, Batman. I don't even remember seeing Commissioner Gordon; his role was so useless. Nicole Kidman looking so beautiful is actually the single thing that got me through the film.\n\nI could go on and on, but ultimately this film is really responsible for killing the Batman franchise. The series lost its' soul, as we no longer followed Batman the character. In this film there are weak attempts to copy the first film by showing Bruce Wayne contemplating over his parents' deaths again. This is pointless because we've tread down this path before. We don't get anything new.\n\nBatman Forever actually launched this modern style we are stuck in with tons of ridiculous effects and ignoring the great story and artistic style that made the first two Batman films good. Most recent films such as Van Helsing are carbon copies of this empty film. Glitzy colors, cuts and famous actors - no script or care for characters and no care to create a plausible world within the realm of fantasy.\n\n***BTW - Worst moment - Batman avoiding getting trapped in the alley by Two-Face's gang and then driving the Batmobile up the wall. And then they cut to the next scene as if we naturally can figure out where the hell he drove next after heading skyward. Or how about the capsule with acid that gets pulled out by the helicopter and then released by Batman and it just naturally swings right back into the hole it came from. Please!"

The film isn't as good or as dark as the first two films, but it is a huge improvement over Batman and Robin, the less said about that film the better. Anyway, this film is quite possibly the fastest and the funniest of the series, but despite all this there are some hit and miss elements. Chris O'Donnell is annoying and lifeless as Robin, the script has its weak spots despite some terrific lines from Jim Carrey and while Nicole Kidman was bearable, her character could have been written better. However, it is stylishly filmed with Oscar-nominated photography and excellent special effects, the direction is surprisingly more efficient and the action hurls along at an exciting and breakneck pace. The acting is good on the most part with Val Kilmer brooding as Batman and Michael Gough perfect as Alfred. The villains steal the show though, while Tommy Lee Jones is excellent as usual as Two Face Jim Carrey is the one with the best lines and delivery as the Riddler. Overall, hit and miss but a decent entry in the Batman franchise. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

Flirtatious Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) is an expert in abnormal psychology. Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey) works for Bruce Wayne creating a machine to transmit directly into the brain. Bruce disapproves of brainwave manipulation. Nygma decides to test it on himself and discovers it sucks up the intelligence of his victims. Nygma turns into the Riddler. Two-Face attacks the circus leaving acrobat Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell) an orphan. He wants revenge but gets talked into staying in Wayne Mansion. He discovers the bat-cave and becomes Batman's partner Robin.\n\nJoel Schumacher takes over and turns the Batman franchise into a neon colored cartoon. Jim Carrey is a perfect fit for the Riddler. He is great fun and I love the idiot box machine. Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face like the Joker and feels too close to Carrey. It would have been better for him to play to his strength being tough and hard. Val Kilmer is solid as Batman/Bruce Wayne although Chris O'Donnell is a little annoying. The neon color overload really bothers me. I might like this if Schumacher could calm down the color palette."

        "review_detailed_main": "An uneven follow-up to blockbuster fantasy epic that renewed Hollywood's faith in media blitzing. In this sequel, Batman goes into action, containing a lot of surprises, thrills, chills and dazzling settings. The caped crusader is back in Gotham City, where even the criminals are afraid to walk the streets alone and he must battle former district attorney Harvey Dent, who is now Two-Face. There's a new breed of criminals in Gotham City led by two scene-stealing sinister villians, Harvey Two-Faces (wasted Tommy Lee Jones) and Riddler (Jim Carrey) who seek to rule over Gotham City, plus the love interest , shrink Dr Meridian (Nicole Kidman) and some riddles ain't nothing for the Knight. Batman gets help from a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin (Chris O'Donnell). 'The Boy Wonder' also makes a first-appearance in the bulked-up form , a street-smart Robin with vendetta in his mind. The perfunctory plot concerns the Riddler's mass-marketing of a televisual brain drain. In a chaotic Time, Justice wears a mask !. Courage Now, Truth Always, Batman Forever!. From the Sewers of Gotham, and New Villain Emerges !. From the Rooftops of Gotham, the Purrrfect Enemy Comes to Life !. And the Only One Who Can Save this City, is a Creature of the Night. While She Craves a Romance She can Sink Her Claws Into, He Plots a Fowl Reign of Destruction, Above Gotham, Looms Its Greatest Hero.\n\nThe second sequel to Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster makes its predecessors show up models of subtlety and coherence. In theory the movie marks a new lease of life for the caped crusader with new faces, new director, in practice everything feels some stale, artificial and self-conscious. Val Kilmer is a more sensual Bruce Wayne than Michael Keaton, but if anything his remodelled body-tight Batsuit proven even more of a straitjacket. Naturally, the villians still steal the show in the personas of maniacal Jim Carrey and the sartorially spendid Tommy Lee Jones. Rounding out this charismatic cast is the amorous interest Kidman as a slinky psychologist who's eager to find the man inside the Bat and who can blame her.\n\nThis is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie. Full of action , it's complemented by colorful images, thriller and attractive scenes with overwhelming fights and traditional FX along with a lot of computer generator special effects. The dark story is made believable and the script has more color and visual effects to it than former Batman films. The picture relies on terrific flying sequences, struggles, black humor, swift pursuits, and the overacting from the two main baddies: Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones. More of the same from director Joel Schumacher with Batman more of a supporting role overshadowed by provocative villains.\n\nThe motion picture was professionally but unevenly directed by Joel Schumacher. At its opening weekend weekend was a boxoffice, breaking the 'Jurassik Park' record, testimony to the power of aggressive marketing. Being preceded by \u00a8Batman\u00a8 (1989) by Tim Burton with Michael Keaton , Michael Gough, Jack Nicholson , Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Tracey Walter, Pat Ingle , Jack Palance. Followed by \u00a8Batman Returns\u00a8 (1992) by Tim Burton with Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, a grandiose sequel with three splendid roles: the Bat, the Cat and the Penguin. Followed by \u00a8Batman and Robin\u00a8 (1997) by Joel Schumacher with Val Kilmer, Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone , Michael Gough , Arnie, Pat Ingle , John Glover. And \u00a8Batman Forever\u00a8 (1995) by Joel Schumacher with George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Jim Carrey , Nicole Kidman , Drew Barrymore , Deby Mazar , Don Dragon Wilson, among others ."

        "review_detailed_main": "STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Can't Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs\n\nBruce Wayne (a.k.a. Batman) has a new nemesis in the shape of Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) a homicidal psychopath who was once a noble lawyer, only for his face and mind to be hideously deformed after a substance was thrown over him in a courtroom. But he's soon to be joined by another: The Riddler (Jim Carrey) who was a former scientist at Wayne Enterprises and had his ideas rejected by those in power. Whilst dealing with all of this, he entertains a romance with the beautiful psychologist Dr Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) and takes a boy acrobat under his wing whose family were murdered in a hesit by Two-Face, who will come to be known as Robin, the fateful sidekick...\n\nIn my Batman Begins review, I stated how it was 'Batman for a new generation.' Yet ten years ago I suppose you could say the same thing was happening to the Batman franchise. It was a whole new Batman, with a lighter, sillier, more family friendly appeal to it, with a new actor playing Batman in the shape of Val Kilmer and a new hack director in the shape of Joel Schumacher, after Tim Burton had left to pursue greater things such as The Nightmare Before Christmas (although he does take over producing duties here.) I suppose it is all really a question of whether you prefer the dark or the light versions of Batman. But I know which camp I'm settled in.\n\nThere is a lot of light and flashy effects in this one, but it is completely empty. The story is uninvolving, the characters naff and the acting poor. For starters, there's the impossibly wooden O' Donnell, who wouldn't go on to improve in any of his future projects and is at his worst here, and also in one scene zooms down a road in the Batmobile (which he's souped up!) to which a flock of girls crowd round it, which I think played a part in kick-starting the whole vacuous 'chav' craze, as well as Batman's subliminal messaging at the beginning with the line 'it's the car, right, chicks dig the car', when in fact ten years later, a whole string of Brian Harvey-alikes would be 'digging' the car. In the villain roles, Carrey can either make you laugh with his manic performances or he can severely get on your nerves, and that's definitely the case here and Jones can play a great villain and is trying his best here, but it's all just wasted on him. Kidman is very sexy as the love interest, but doesn't manage to contribute anything other than that. As Batman, I suppose Kilmer doesn't do anything Keaton didn't do but, like I said, I'll stay a Keaton man...\n\nI suppose a lot of it really depends on whether you're a dark Batman fan or a light Batman fan and I suppose Returns might just hold a bit of sentimental value for me, but, all the same, hats off to this, my personal least favourite of the series. **"

He cranks the dial up so far it breaks off, and for a guy who's normally stone serious, it's a rare treat.\n\nDespite that, they really push Carrey as The Riddler really, really hard, where he cavorts around more like The Joker 2.0 than anyone else. He might get more screen time here than Batman does. And compared to that guy's career, this is just another Jim Carrey role, the same as Ace Ventura or Doctor Robotnik or The Mask or whatever. He's here to bounce off the walls, make quips, and mug for the camera like a real-life Daffy Duck.\n\nThe rest of the movie is pretty bad, but kind of enjoyably so. It's cheesy and dumb in all the ways a too-big-to-fail 90's era summer blockbuster can be. Bare minimum, I can at least have nostalgia for that, and nostalgia can sometimes be a decent enough substitute for enjoyment."

A bad film, Val Kilmer was absolutely horrible in his role as Bruce Wayne, going through each scene like he had better things to do. Also, Jim Carrey's over the top view of The Riddler was far too annoying, making his character mostly unnecessary. Sadly, Tommy Lee Jones graced this horrible film, leaving a dark spot on his resume.

It does my heart good to see that, with the passage of time, people are finally realizing that the much-maligned \"Batman Returns\" eats this turkey for breakfast.\n\nThere's so much to hate about this movie. Carrey is just awful as the Riddler; his crotch-hugging costume is tacky, his shouting grates on the nerves, and you know what? He doesn't even come up with too many riddles. Tommy Lee Jones is equally awful as Two-Face, as he mugs and hollers in a vain attempt to keep pace with his insane co-star. His character is poorly written, too; Two-Face always abides by the decision his coin makes, and he would never flip and re-flip it to get a certain result, as he does in this movie. Believe it or not, that little sequence changes - and ruins - the entire character. The plot stinks, too, as the Riddler is apparently trying to control everyone's minds with what appears to be a big blender.\n\nComplete with garish costumes, neon lights, and bombastic music, \"Batman Forever\" is certainly the best headache-inducer out there, but it's not a good comic book movie even though it struggles valiantly to capture the right \"feel.\" Joel Schumacher, who also directed the equally tacky \"Phone Booth,\" is rightfully lambasted for ruining the Batman franchise after two pretty strong initial entries.

I would have loved to see the return, or at the very least a cameo, of Catwoman to explain her mysterious final appearance at the end of Batman Returns, which I'm sure Burton would have included. Furthermore, did we forget about Harvey Dent who was played by Billy Dee Williams in the first film? Why on earth was his character replaced by not only another actor, but another actor of a completely different race....? According to my research, Billy Dee Williams had a contract stating that he would reprise his role as Harvey Dent/Two Face if there were to ever be a sequel created including his character. But apparently his contract had to be bought out JUST so Tommy Lee Jones could be recast as Two Face..... Evidently Warner Brothers would rather spend MORE money to replace an actor than to simply call back an actor and remain true to the character and connected to the previous films. CONTINUITY PEOPLE. Stick to it. You get more fans with continuity than you do families with cool-looking graphics. Idiots.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was the 20 second explanation to Harvey Dent's transformation into Two Face on a news broadcast, which could easily be missed if you have to lean over to scratch your knee. Unlike the other 2 films, Batman Forever took literally no time in explaining the background of its villains. They were thrown in there with no depth to their characters, wearing silly suits just to entertain the kiddies.\n\nI'm the sure the film was great in the moment and appealed greatly to 11-year-olds with flavor-of-the-year actors such as Jim Carrey replacing originally cast actor Robin Williams as The Riddler, but never will Batman Forever be looked back on as a decent film of it's time, or a legacy such as the two blockbusters preceding it."

Val Kilmer tried to be good as Batman / Bruce Wayne, but Michael Keaton and Christian Bale's Batman / Bruce Wayne versions are both satisfying and amazing. Nicole Kidman was also as the love interest. Tommy Lee Jones is good as Two-Face, but Aaron Eckhart in THE DARK KNIGHT as Harvey Dent / Two-Face is really dark and great. The rest of the cast is really good.\n\nThe pacing is a little crazy, but really cool and fantastic and I love the film as much as I like the other films, with the exception of BATMAN & ROBIN. The music is really amazing and fantastic, but could have been a little bit better.\n\nOverall, I love this film and it is so amazing, but very confusing. 6/10."

It doesn't matter how good the the props, sets, and special effects are and how talented the actors are if there is no quality script to work with. That's the biggest reason for Batman Forever's shortcomings. Another huge negative in my mind is the interpretation of Two-Face Tommy Lee Jones was asked to give. I know there has to be flexibility in translating from the comic page to the screen but Two-Face is more like the Joker than Two-Face in this film. Val Kilmer, Nicole Kidman, and Chris O'Donnell (what happened to him?) are serviceable in their roles. In my opinion the best thing about Batman Forever is Jim Carrey. He might be slightly over the top once in a while, but boy what a talent. His physicality, his facial expressions, his impressions, his flexible voice, my goodness he is gifted. He is the reason I give this film a 6 and not a 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "After Tim Burton, it is Joel Schumacher's turn to take over to shot the third chapter of the adventures of Batman. This change of director deals a serious blow to the quality of the whole in the way it marks a sharp regression in comparison with the two previous Batman movies.\n\nWe can say that to write this third opus, the authors have made a minimum of effort. The screenplay is largely inspired of Tim Burton's movies. In \"Batman Returns\" (1992), the Penguin and Catwoman joined forces to fight the hero of Gotham City. Here, the Mystery Man and Mr Heads or Tails dare to pit themselves against Batman. Then, Schumacher tried to find room in the script to focus on Bruce Wayne's personality and his psychology strongly echoes to the type of character developed by Burton in the first movie. We knew that Bruce Wayne was an ambiguous character, haunted by bad memories (his parents' death). Here, we learn that it is this tragic event that made him want to create a second identity for himself in order to fight evil and make justice triumph. But we could have guessed this intention from the first movie. As a matter of fact, Schumacher openly shows what we thought about the reasons that drive Wayne to become Batman. So the sequences during which we see Val Kilmer anguished by seeing certain objects only constitute a pointless digression in the long run. It is only of minor interest.\n\n\"Batman Forever\" also contains a simplistic and thin plot which the director does his best to highlight it by opting for the spectacular. There are action sequences which run well but sometimes they nearly verge on the ludicrous.\n\nOn another hand, the darkness that shrouded Gotham City has vanished. So, the threatening aspect of the city has virtually disappeared.\n\nAbout the cast, it alternates the best and the worst. Val Kilmer puts on quite easily the Batman outfit (Michael Keaton turned down the role in spite of an attractive price) but Chris O'Donnell beside him is rather colorless. About the wicked, well Jim Carrey was the most appropriate actor to act the Mystery Man and so he fulfilled well his part. But I found Tommy Lee Jones unbearable.\n\nA quite indigestible film where Schumacher unlike Tim Burton shows his inability in developing his own vision of Batman and contents himself with making a tailor-made movie for the top of the box-office."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having Batman go from Tim Burton to Joel Schumacher is like going from black licorice to Skittles. In other words, Burton's overtly weird and gothic style is an acquired taste for some, but it is unquestionably a much more suitable tone for the character of Batman. Whereas Schumacher's sugary sweet and obnoxiously campy tone makes this Batman film look like a toy commercial that was filmed inside a laser tag arena.\n\nEven as a kid, the Schumacher Batman films were not my favorite, but because it was Batman I still watched them. I've watched the Burton Batman movies pretty consistently throughout the years but I haven't seen either Batman Forever or Batman & Robin since I was like 8 years old. So has my feelings changed on Batman Forever? Well, kind of.\n\nThe very first thing that struck me while watching the film again was Val Kilmer's performance as Bruce Wayne. I thought it was rather good. The sharp contrast between Bruce's personal struggles with his past and the really annoying scenes with Two-Face and The Riddler are so conflicting that it feels like I'm watching two completely different movies. Anytime this movie focuses on Bruce's past and his new partnership with Dick Grayson, the film feels oddly mature and thoughtful. But then it takes a sharp turn the second Jim Carrey or Tommy Lee Jones shows up on the screen.\n\nI can't really be mad at Jim Carrey's performance because, at the end of the day, it's just Jim Carrey being Jim Carrey. But Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Two-Face is quite frankly an abomination. It's just as terrible as Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze. Nicole Kidman's character, Dr. Chase Meridian shifts from being a hot chick who is super horny for Batman to an intelligent psychologist who is falling for Bruce Wayne, her performance is kind of the embodiment of this entire movie in terms of its conflicting tones.\n\nI've heard people trying to defend this movie in more recent years, don't bother. Yes, the film does have a few glimpses of good scenes, all of which are exclusively around Val Kilmer's Bruce Wayne. But the second Kilmer puts on his Batsuit that has nipples on it and jumps into his giant Hot Wheels car to fight the annoying Two-Face and Riddler, it all goes right down the toilet.\n\nBatman Forever is not a good Batman movie. And it's a shame because if the film had a different director and writing team involved, then I think Val Kilmer could've been an excellent Batman and Bruce Wayne."

Referring to Bruce watching over Richard. 7) Too many explosions. 8) Jim Carrey's exaggerated overacting at times.\n\nWhat I did like about the film: The comic book look and colours - I dig on that.

        "review_detailed_main": "This third installment of The Caped Crusader (Val Kilmer) battling new villains Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler (Jim Carrey) has many changes from the first two Batman films. First a new director Joel Schumacher and he does take a new direction it is the total opposite of Tim Burton. Gone is Burton's mysterious and dark moody direction you have Schumacher make Batman more dull and ordinary and the sets in Batman Forever have lost the realism and the graphic art touch if you've noticed the buildings look fake just like a toy and every scene on the set looks unreal. Schumacher has plenty of action in this Batman though to keep our heart pumping. The real negatives on Batman Forever are many I know that Jim Carrey gives a good performance as The Riddler but I would have rather had Robin Williams play the part. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face was fantastic but still these villains were no match for the legends and most liked Batman villains The Joker (Jack Nicholson) and The Penguin (Danny DeVito). Not only does the performance of Nicholson and DeVito thrill us but both were just right for their parts I can't say the same for Carrey and Jones. Plus The Joker and Penguin are more dangerous criminals that are liked at the same time due to their wit. One of the best things of Batman Forever is Nicole Kidman she adds much needed sex appeal. Even most agree that her character Dr. Chase Meridian is out of place it just doesn't fit the Batman story as good as Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) or The Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) but Kidman provides the best sex appeal of the three. The addition of Robin (Chris O'Donnell) doesn't help that much I just never felt Robin was an important part of the Batman saga. Now the main character himself Batman (Val Kilmer) is very stiff and seems uncommon as Batman it's like he's been programmed to be a robot what was Warner Bros. thinking pay Michael Keaton his worth! Anyway the action of Batman Forever makes it very memorable and watch when you desire but a drop-off of good villain characters and most of all the absence of the dark moody direction of Tim Burton makes Batman Forever a drop-off."

Tim Burton's idea of what Batman should be, took me by surprise as probably the most refreshing Batman film ever. The sequel, Batman Returns, wasn't as good, and so Burton was booted off the bat-franchise. Enter Joel Schumacher, who would direct the third film in the series, Batman Forever.\n\nThis film certainly isn't the best, but it ain't the worst. It's got hit and miss moments some of which are shown more clearly than others. However, I find it to be a very entertaining film. The colours are a lot more bright, which definitely eliminates the darkness, but Val Kilmer as batman is probably one of my favourites. He delivers straight up and makes you feel like although Michael Keaton isn't in the film, it doesn't seem to do any damage. The villains are silly and quite frankly, over the top. Jim Carrey acted like...Jim Carrey and didn't quite pull off a believable performance as the Riddler. Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is also very silly, and isn't what you would expect. Overall, this film is OK, and I recommend it to people who don't watch these films for realism, but rather entertainment, and a good weekend movie. Check it out."

Jim Carrey is good as the Riddler but isn't given enough to do. Tommy Lee Jones does absolutely nothing apart from stand around. And the appearance of Robin is like rubbing lemon-juice into a thousand paper cuts. Robin was the absolute worst thing about the original series (something this film feels a lot like) so why on Earth they decided to have him in this is beyond me.\n\nA lot of footage was cut from this film. I don't think it was have improved it much though. They could have lined this film in gold and it's still wouldn't be worth it's weight. The footage lost was a bizarre confrontation between young Bruce and a huge bat and footage of Two-Face escaping from Arkham asylum.

Where Batman Forever succeeds for me though is in its sense of scale. There is never any doubt that this is a comic book movie, it isn't trying to mimic more serious genres, just having fun being big, colourful, and inherently stupid.\n\nVal Kilmer does fine as the tortured hero, but the film gets completely stolen by the outrageous leads. Jim Carrey is off the wall at all times, utterly revelling in bringing his wacky brand of magic to the screen and Tommy Lee Jones certainly seems to have had fun too, doing well to match Carrey's energy.\n\nWhat people truly hated about this film was that it didn't feel like a continuation of what had come before. This was a whole new interpretation and one aimed squarely at a younger audience. I will admit to not liking this film for a long time but I've certainly mellowed a bit and can now take it for what it was always intended as.\n\nI certainly don't think this film is as bad as what came next. If you're an adult and like Batman, its probably not going to be for you, but it doesn't have to be now we have multiple interpretations of Batman on screen. As a cinematic Batman film to show a child though, this would still be a great choice. They aren't going to notice all the things that annoy older fans and can just enjoy an entertaining and colourful take on the character."

What a bad movie choice for Val Kilmer, Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jim Carrey! They could've chosen better!

        "review_detailed_main": "It's 1995 Batman has already become a big screen money maker thanks to the work of Tim Burton on Batman 89 and Batman Returns. Taking a leap of faith in a different direction the studio decided to go in a new direction rather than complete the Burton trilogy. Whether you agree with this is not you can't deny that this film had a completely different style, although it keep some of the gothic zest that brought us to the dance in the first place. Suiting up for the first time as the Batman and doing an admirable job was Val Kilmer, however it has been said that more importantly who is playing Bruce Wayne? This is considered just as important if not more. Not many were happy with Burtons choice of Michael Keaton nowadays many believe him to be the only true Batman.\n\nJoel Schumacher has had a lot of criticism for his vision, his interpretation of the Batman, yet admittedly Burtons first two movies were a difficult act to follow. Schumacher had the courage to take on the third instalment which has to be admired in itself. The studio wanted a more family friendly product so they could sell more merchandise to the younger audience members, which was probably the audience they originally intended to cater to. When Batman Returns had apparently 'overstepped the mark' being deemed too disturbing or scary parents had wrote letters to Warner Brothers complaining. The times have changed a lot since then making Batman Returns seem pretty mild in comparison to what is accepted by audiences of today. So Schumacher was brought in to lighten up the tone whilst displaying a more comical element, not quite Adam West but a step closer in that direction. Credit must be giving to Joel Schumacher and his team for some of the shots and lighting on this movie as for the time they are pretty magical. This follows a more cartoonish Gotham alongside a more comical script. Yes it is corny or cheesy, doubt many would dispute that it is probably what Bob Kane envisioned when he developed his comic strip into Batman and Robin. Before Robin, Batman appeared in detective comics solo trying to solve crimes. Bob Kane had admitted he often believed Batman to be in the shadows stalking his prey through fear. This interpretation has way more colourful environments from what I preferred or had come to expect from a Batman movie, still I consider the tone to be different whenever Robin is introduced to the narrative. I have yet to see a darker story involving Robin except for the death of a family which essentially kills off the Jason Todd version.\n\nThe script of this particular Batman film isn't overly exciting with more style over substance. The detective work of both Batman and Bruce are required to do is pretty basic when it comes to solving the riddles. Harvey Dent doesn't seem to have an overly complex narrative neither as he is accidentally scarred with acid in a battle maroni in court during Batman's presence. This ultimately leads him to the objective to kill Batman throughout the movie. Often Harvey is seen causing chaos trying to lore the Batman into a trap whilst he tries to protect innocent civilians. Harvey Dent is played by (Tommy Lee Jones) who once again is on form as a caricatured cartoonish Two Face. Tommy Lee Jones seems to get the balance spot on for the type of film Schumacher is trying to create. (Jim Carey) The Riddler aka Edward Nigma is okay however I do feel he goes overboard losing sight of the character he is portraying and inadvertently giving us another Jim Carrey persona. Edward Nigma is an intelligent character appearing less flamboyant or camp than Carrey shows. Although he is narcissistic, often wanting to be centre of attention alongside outsmarting everybody along the way. Dr Chase Meridian is the love interest played by (Nicole Kidman) having the alluring sex appeal cleverly combined with the smart psychology which works well considering the nemesis is the riddler. Nicole brings a memorable performance alongside Val in my opinion, undecided between Bruce or Batman yet becoming the glue that holds him together when he needs it most. For me Nicole Kidman alongside Val Kilmer portray the most real scenes in the film able to lift themselves out of the comic book world. Chris O' Donnell has the bulk of the background story in becoming the much loved sidekick of Batman none other than Robin. Some say he was too old for the part, I don't see this as a major issue long as he performs it well and brings Robin to life in a way that works well in Schumachers version. O' Donnell gave a well balanced performance between playing Dick Grayson and Robin in a way that complimented the film.\n\nTo conclude Batman Forever brought something different to the table, the pacing was good it wasn't overly long like many films of todays times and brought in a younger audience which Batman was originally intended for. Each character had a simple objective which remained consistent throughout. Bruce was trying to figure out why he had become Batman in the first place often leading him back to memories of his parents death. Dick Grayson wanted revenge on the loss of his family helping the duo connect on a deeper level. Harvey Dent blamed Batman for his scarred face and also wanted to exact revenge. Edward Nigma wanted to be respected for his intention and Chase Meridian wanted not just a friend, a partner, but was undecided with a man that is one in the same. It's simplistic, yet it worked as a family film. I doubt it would be successful today as audiences would expect much more from a Batman movie. One last thing Joel, did we really need nipples on the bat suit? Next up on the menu Batgirl, oh wait, with or without nipples!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If Tom Rothman, Chairman of Fox Studios is reading this, take note: this was when the decline of the original Batman franchise started. The reason was because of Warner Brothers believing that Batman Return did not make enough money and thereby turned away from Tim Burton's dark (even though I don't think its as dark as some others think) and gone back to the 60s model of Batman, which was the worst version of Batman possible. A family friendly version of a dark superhero doesn't work and studio interference goes too far. That's what makes me worry about Tom Rothman's idea with the Wolverine film.\n\nTim Burton was ditched, but remained as a producer and Joel Schumacher replaced him. Michael Keaton also left the role of Batman and Val Kilmer (one of the most bland actors around) replaced him. The film also introduce Robin to the franchise and Batman faces Two-Face and the Riddler in this flick. The basic plot is Two-Face and the Riddler team up to drain the intelligence of Gotham, using a special device on television sets. Dick Grayson aka Robin, whole family is murdered by Two-Face and Bruce Wayne takes him in. At the Wayne mansion Dick discovery's who Bruce really is and become Batman's sidekick. Bruce is also falling for psychologist Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), who herself is interested in Batman.\n\nThe first problem is that this film is aimed at kids: this is just wrong for Batman fans because we all know that he is a very dark character. The plot is very thin and completely over the top. It is easy to compare it to Christoper Nolan's version which was darker, more down too earth and takes the most realistic road possible. The casting was not very good either. I do not rate Val Kilmer as an actor, a big mistake for Chris O'Donnell, Tommy Lee Jones couldn't be bothered, Jim Carrey was not under control and Nicole Kidman was still finding her feet when it came to acting. There was no depth to the film. When it comes to more modern superhero films they was at least some ideas coming to suffer. Just look at the first two X-Men films, the Nolan Batmans and even in Spiderman there was psychological and personal issues. All those films were taken seriously: Batman Forever wasn't. The director by Schumacher, whilst not terrible, is nothing to write home about. He does not have the vision of Burton or Nolan and he should stick to tout films. When I was younger I did enjoy this film: but you give a 10-year-old a Batman film starting Jim Carrey they are bound to like.\n\nBatman Forever and Batman and Robin are great models on how not to make a superhero and producers should take note that too much interference will ruin a film!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I just sat down to watch the 1995 movie \"Batman Forever\" for what I guess is the third time watching it since 1995. It wasn't because I am a huge Batman fan, nor found this movie particularly enjoyable. However, I had forgotten about most of the storyline in the movie, so I opted to revisit it.\n\nThe storyline in \"Batman Forever\" feels a bit lacking in comparison to the 1989 \"Batman\" movie and the 1992 \"Batman Returns\" movie. But still, it does make for an adequate viewing experience. Nothing grand or extraordinary though. But I am sure that diehard fans of Batman did and still do get a kick out of this movie. Writers Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman just didn't manage to deliver a script as wholesome and thoroughly conceived as the previous two movies, and that makes director Joel Schumacher's 1995 foray into the Batman franchise a somewhat mediocre one.\n\nSure, you have the introduction of Robin, Two-Face and The Riddler to the newer movies, but honestly I always had problems with Jim Carrey landing this role, because he was so poorly cast for the role of The Riddler. It just became too much of a goof and a spoof, and not so much of a clever braniac with a knack for riddles. And Jim Carrey just pales in comparison to the performance of The Riddler put on by Frank Gorshin in the 1960s TV series.\n\nThe acting performances in \"Batman Forever\" were good. Val Kilmer did a fair enough job as Bruce Wayne/Batman, but he is not up to par with Michael Keaton. Tommy Lee Jones was nicely cast for the role of Harvey Dent/Two-Face and he put on a good performance. As for Chris O'Donnell as Robin, well, it was what it was. Nice to see Michael Gough returning to reprise the role of Albert, just as Pat Hingle returned for reprising the role of Comissioner Gordon. I must admit that it was a surprise to see Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar in the movie, I had fully and wholly forgotten about them being in the movie.\n\nVisually then \"Batman Forever\" is quite good, things look good on the screen, both special effects, props, sets and costumes. And it is a drastic change from the previous two movies, as the sort of gothic-inspired Tim Burton approach to the presentation is not seen in \"Batman Forever\". Not that it was a bad chance of scenery, though.\n\nWatchable, for sure, but not an outstanding foray into Gotham and the DC universe of Batman.\n\nMy rating of \"Batman Forever\" lands on a five out of ten stars."

Two Face was an irritating Joker knock off, and Carrey seemed to be playing the Mask all over again, except more ridiculous and less intelligently - ironic really, given the films plot. Ah well at least there was plenty of Kidman cleavage and legs, so it's not all bad. Just mostly bad..."

About the villain, Jim Carrey as the Riddler becomes a classic, but Two-Face has all his potential wasted in this script. Some references to Adam West's Batman TV series and Dick Grayson appearance made it fun to watch. The change of tone is also very odd, I believe that's a reason why the fans of the first two movies didn't like that one."

        "review_detailed_main": "In my opinion, this is the worst Batman movie.\n\nI'll start out with some of the positives...\n\nVal Kilmer, in many ways, is a suitable replacement for Michael Keaton. He does well as the intelligent billionaire Bruce Wayne and succeeds with a somewhat dark tone as Batman, even employing the low raspy voice in a similar manner as Keaton. Chris O'Donnell isn't a bad Robin, and in fact, made me actually like the character somewhat. Rather than being the annoying, child-like, \"boy wonder\" of the comics, he brings a sense of coolness and a rebel without a cause-like approach to the character, and it works. And he and Val work well off one another. Michael Gough returning as Alfred is also a plus.\n\nOkay, that's all the good things I have to say about it. Not much, right? The Bad...\n\nLet's discuss the villains. I can't grieve enough over Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones. I like both actors in general, but I can't stand either of them in this film. It's as if they didn't even do any character research. This is the only Batman film I've seen where the villains bare hardly any resemblance to their traditional portrayals. Jim Carrey is really just being himself. He seems more like Ace Ventura dressed in green tights, while Tommy Lee Jones gives us his best Joker impression. He is a hyper-active, laughing maniac, always making a joke out of everything. Again, that's what the Joker does. Who knows? Maybe Jones would've made a convincing Joker, but it's completely unsuitable for Two-Face, who is traditionally a much more conflicted character, absent of sense of humor, cold and dark.\n\nI think the issue with the villains was derived more from this film's over-the-top approach in general. Everything is needlessly exaggerated, from the glowing batmobile to Two-Face's lair and Riddler's outer space-like gadgetry. It just doesn't seem to fit in the Batman universe.\n\nOverall, this movie has a hint of entertainment value but fails to live up to creativity and fun of it's two predecessors."

        "review_detailed_main": "This really isn't such a terrible movie, but it has some serious flaws which make the overall product stagnate.\n\nTommy Lee Jones would have been better with adequate scripting and direction, but unfortunately his performance of Two-Face is deplorably one-dimensional. He rants and raves and cries and throws violent tantrums and never calmly assesses anything. Yet, like the Riddler originally was in the comics, Two-Face is supposed to be a very intelligent, sociable member of upper-class society whose psyche has become irreparably damaged. His educated, influential background is what makes him all the more dangerous when he is tormented by his chaotic, violent half. But because the character portraits and histories are so marginalized, the villains here are unmemorable and have little in common with the villains from the comic franchise.\n\nBizarrely enough, the only background on Two-Face we get is that some mob boss threw acid on his face in a courtroom during a trial (we see a video of this from CNN, showing us how Two-Face used to be Harvey Dent, the Gotham District Attorney). Yes, somehow the mob boss brought acid into the courtroom, onto the witness stand, and managed to throw it at the DA's face without any interference. In the movie, the CNN reporter is like, \"although Batman tried to save him, he was unable to \u0085\" and you see Batman jumping out from the courtroom audience in full batsuit as Harvey Dent/Two-Face tries to use paper to shield his face from the acid. Seriously? Even if we buy that weird scenario, why does Two-Face hate Batman so much?\n\nNay, in Batman Forever we get Robin's background instead. Kind of a bizarre direction to go when you consider Robin isn't a strong lead character, particularly in the hands of Chris O'Donnell (or maybe he's adequately annoying). Hell, Robin's not a very strong character at all (supposedly Tim Burton really hated Robin as a character). It's weird that we get a lot of background on Robin and the Riddler, even though Two-Face is the character that Batman and Robin have serious emotional ties to.\n\nJim Carrey's performance is fine, if typical of this period in his career, but I wonder why he was never tagged to play the Joker or the Scarecrow. The Riddler, as he is mistakenly portrayed here by Carrey, is an over-the-top trickster basket-case. But in the old Batman comics, the guy was an overly intellectual, scheming, almost aristocratic foe. The kind of guy Bruce Wayne could talk to at a dinner party for a while before noticing how malicious he is.\n\nNicole Kidman's role is laughable. It's almost like she's a caricature of a damsel-in-distress from some '50s adventure flick. I surmise she was cast intentionally for her bad acting. But of course, the script is not much to work with.\n\nAnyway... the whole movie itself is not terrible. It has a unique look and feel: lots of purples and greens, a Gotham nightlife that has the aesthetic look of a rave, some interesting sets (particularly the finale), and violent scenes that are unique for their goofy sense of humor. The acting is capable, but the cast is not given proper material to work with and the movie's pacing is not stitched together properly. There is a good idea in here somewhere, but nothing is strong enough to make it memorable. In other words, it's not a real shame that there will be another Batman movie with the same villains."

Both actors are well over the top in their performances and are aided by very explosive special effects.

Joel Shumacher stepped into the chair after 2 brilliant outings from the Gothic and talented mind of Tim Burton, and lost the plot a little.\n\nThis film pits Batman (Val Kilmer) against The Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), and has Robin (Chris O'Donell as his eager sidekick. It follows a predictable, childish and unconvincing path as Batman confronts his camp OTT enemies whilst uttering corny lines. The way it is executed forces me to think it is aimed at purely pre-teen Americans, and would be suitable for Saturday morning TV alongside other shallow, 2 dimensional films. Schumacher seems to have misunderstood what Batman is about, who he is, and turned a good concept into a brightly coloured mess.\n\nI saw the first 10 or so minutes of this the other night on TV, and after many years without seeing it, I soon realised just how daft, cheesy and comical it is, through and through. The lines are wooden and clich\u00e9d, the acting is questionable, and actors like Mr Lee Jones are totally wasted despite their valiant efforts to save this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've decided to give you mine opinion on all the old Batman movies. Starting with Batman from 1989 and ending with Batman & Robin.\n\nAfter Burton left the franchisee Joel Schumacher got to direct the third movie. Gone is Keaton as Batman and he has been replaced by Val Kilmer. The villains of this new movie are Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, a very scary character. While in the comics he is a tormented soul fighting with his dark personality here is a totally mind blowing evil villain. Jim Carrey as the Riddler is a great performance. Gone is the boring suit and instead he wears a real villain costume. Batman also get's some help from Dick Grayson, aka Robin. Played brilliant by Chris O'Donnell. Schumacher version of Batman is more action and one of the greatest comic book movies ever made.\n\nAnd for those of you who didn't realize it I was being sarcastic.\n\nTwo-Face is one of Batmans best villain, but here he is nothing but a lousy clown. Gone is the tormented Harvey Dent that blindly obeys his coins every decision and instead we get corny bad guy who doesn't take anything serious. The other character Joel destroys is Riddler. Carrey runs around being very annoying. Sure, he gets a few laughs here and there but I think Jim went over the top with this one. Oh, and I forgot the worst part: He is wearing a f-cking pajamas. Neither Two-Face nor Riddler seem like a threat to Batman so there is no need for him to have Robin by his side. Who is, by the way, awful. Read Jeph Loebs \"Dark Victory\" or watch the animated series episode Robin's Reconning instead. There is a good origin story for Dick Grayson. And now we'll have a look at what Joel did to our beloved Batman. Let's see. He put nipples on the batsuit. Further words are a waste of time.\n\nSchumacher shouldn't be allowed near Batman for any reason at all. This movie isn't worth your money or your time. During it's better moments it's like watching the old Batman series (with Adam West), just as ridiculous. A sad excuse for a movie. Still, it could be worse. It could be \"Batman & Robin\"."

Screenwriters head directly into territory staked out by the campy Batman television show of the mid-Sixties. The film's saving graces are Jones and Carrey, as villains are wont to be in this sort of adolescent exercise. Jones does his best to keep up, but it's Carrey's show all the way. The film bogs down in Kilmer's bland surfer-boy good looks, Kidman's preposterous (and offensive) sexual high jinks."

Jim Carrey. Yes he was goofy but that's okay. He wasn't funny through the entire performance but at some times he was, and he plays an excellent psychopath without being funny if you think about it. And I like the fact that he is the leading villain.\n\nNow on to the things I don't like: Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, too goofy and wacky; Tim Burton did not direct this; Danny Elfman did not compose the music, they didn't even use the old theme of his which was classic and brilliant; not dark and Gothic like the first two; and of course Michael Keaton is not playing Batman again which is total bullshit!\n\nAll in all, I liked it but it could have been better.

Nicole Kidman was also as the love interest. Tommy Lee Jones is good as Two-Face, but Aaron Eckhart in THE DARK KNIGHT as Harvey Dent / Two-Face is really dark and great. The rest of the cast is really good.\n\nThe pacing is a little crazy, but really cool and fantastic and I love the film as much as I like the other films, with the exception of BATMAN & ROBIN.

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of people claim that it was Batman Forever which proved to be the beginning of the end of the original Batman film franchise...they base this assumption on the fact that Joel Schumacher, who directed the God-awful Batman & Robin (the REAL culprit in this matter) also directed this film... Having seen this film a couple of times, I can say with confidence that this isn't a great epic film by any means; but its certainly not a piece of crap loaded with stupid cheesy one-liners and twisted ridiculous plot either. In fact, this had the potential to become possibly the most serious and the best Batman film, if it weren't for a few flaws that kind off dumbed it down... The major flaw with this movie is the portrayal of the villains; not necessarily the acting (Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones both did brilliant work on that) but the way the characters must have been written. Both Riddler and Two Face are portrayed as deluded cackling psychopaths, in short, they are pretty much Joker under different names. Sure, the gimmicks of the villains are faithfully adapted from the comics; Riddler's riddles and Two Face's coin toss and obsession with duality; but their personalities are totally ignored or rather covered up in evil laughter most of the time. The whole idea of the Brain Box was a bit too contrived, and a bit too sci-fi for the Riddler, or hell for a Batman film in general. And Two Face's obsession with destroying Batman and Riddlers obsession with Bruce Wayne hardly comes across as well as it was meant to. Basically, we are left with campy villains straight out of a 60's comic book...definitely not a great idea, especially given that this film was made at a time when the Batman mythos were seriously darkening in tone... There are a few things I really liked about this movie though...the first is Robin's origin, which was really done well. Having Two Face kill his parents isn't true too the comics, but it fits in well with the rest of the film and gives Dick a solid personal motive to go after Two Face by becoming Robin. I also liked the way they show Dick's heroic side even before he puts on the cape, by saving the circus from the bomb. Then there was the depiction of Batman's origin, which I think was done with a lot of depth and was actually better then the origin we were given in the first film...we're finally told clearly exactly how his parents death led to Bruce choosing to fight injustice and how he was inspired to strike terror into the minds of criminals by becoming a bat...until Nolan came along, this was the best depiction of the origin on screen. I also liked the way the movie depicts a constant parallel between Batman and Robin's origins, which further links the two together. Then there was Val Kilmer's portrayal of Bruce Wayne. Again, until Christian Bale, this was the best portrayal of Wayne we've seen. Kilmer portrays Bruce Wayne and Batman as two sides of the same coin, with Batman having a real split personality and facing a conflict between his two identities. Bruce Wayne here is not just a cover for Batman, he is an individual in his own right. This contrasts strongly with Michael Keaton's portrayal which makes it evident to all that Bruce is just a cover for Batman. And lastly, there is Bruce's romance with Chase Meridian, which is quite natural and adds a lot of depth to Bruce Wayne/Batman as well(the aforementioned 'origin scenes' for instance). All in all, this could have been the best Batman film, if not for the screw-up with the villains and some stupid unnecessary dialogue."

I think it just gets a lot of residual hatred from Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which was really awful, mostly because of Schwarzenegger. It does depend on how much tolerance you have for '90s Jim Carrey, because if your tolerance level is low, I can understand why you'd hate this one, too. I think, visually, this movie is about as good as Batman Returns. I like the fact that it's actually colorful, instead of just black and blue like the previous two installments. There's a lot of green from The Riddler, of course, but there are a lot of reds and purples, too, and it's just very pretty. The production design and costuming are great throughout. If there's a big problem with this one it's Val Kilmer. I don't like Keaton all that much as Batman, to be honest, but he made a great Bruce Wayne. Kilmer is pretty boring as both. And the less said about Chris O'Donnell's Robin, the better (I had honestly thought he didn't even appear until the fourth movie). I personally like Carrey's depiction of The Riddler, and I also find Tommy Lee Jones a lot of fun as two face. It's all very campy, but in a lot of ways I prefer that to the grim darkness of the first two films. After all, my favorite Batman movie is still the '66 one, and this film really hearkens back to the '60s Batman series."

        "review_detailed_main": "More than ten years, and this probably still hurts like a chemical burn, in the hearts and minds of fans of the dark knight. Perhaps they had just gotten over the 60's series, too... and that one at least had the excuse that Batman hadn't really been done before that point. This follows a good film, and one that came close to being that, and, well, from the first lines, you can tell that this can by no means be considered as proper an approach as either of those. This film answered a once big question; would you rather never see your hero, your idol, in a film, or only see him or her done right? Burton got out of the director's chair when he found that his dark, and far more fitting, style of doing these films was not what the studio intended for future entries, and, presumably because he's cheap and easy to rely on for the producers, not making a fuss, Joel Schumacher was brought in. Everything proceeds to disintegrate. The bleak Gotham gains bright, tawdry neon, oh how the production team who created the architecture of the city in the first two must feel. The characterization is turned into superficial moments and lines of dialog. It's clear that Schumacher neither understands nor respects the medium of comic books; S1m0ne, by Andrew Niccol, goes too far in trying to make us laugh at celebrities and those at home who love them, but at least his production does hold truth and satire. We fans, we read comic books, is what we need really more people telling us how stupid they think that is? The presentation of the villains further illustrates it. Two-Face is essentially the Joker, just with only half a face of make-up. Where Nicholson was haunting and grotesque, Lee, in spite of being a very talented actor who I like and respect, and enjoy the work of, merely comes off as a nuisance, not a real threat. A cartoon. The utter lack of respect for the source material is seen in one brief part, mentioned in the Trivia section, where the character does something that not only is inconsistent, but downright goes straight against the very *core* of the personality of him! The Riddler is possibly even worse. I like Carrey, too... he's the very reason I initially watched it. Heck, these actors are almost all talented, only you wouldn't know it from watching this. The acting is overdone. Heck, everything is! Sequences are pushed to the extremes, with far too many colors and too much going on at once. The once well-written dialog is replaced with pitiful one-liners and such. Robin is introduced to this series of Batman, and he's made hip. See the earring? And just look at him hanging up the laundry! What were they *thinking*? The nipples on the suits even bothered Bob Kane himself. The action isn't even particularly exciting. It's such a shame that this actually had potential; there's back-story, motivation and explanation behind the title character, and the original plot(described elsewhere, it might spoil stuff in the film to reveal it here) sounds interesting. The worst may be that on the surface, this doesn't look anywhere near as awful as it is... it is a technically speaking fairly well-done film. Camera, editing and sound are by no means inspiring, but we *are* talking about Schumacher, here. They get the job done, he gets the job done, that's why the producers like him, that's why he keeps getting work. The effects vary, but many are good. There are a few references that aren't bad. I recommend this only to those who aren't fans. I don't know that I would have made it all the way through this and it's even worse follow-up had I been. As for who will enjoy it... that is a good question. If you're looking for parody, Black Scorpion is really better. 5/10"

It's good that they showed the origin of Robin but the costume design for both Batman and Robin were gay. Why show nipples and penis while it could be much cooler flat looking like the costume from 1989 one. This film is Childish, it really is. The director went beyond the real heroic theme.

Gone is the dark undertone from Tim Burton's visions, and the tight action sequences that marked Burton's debut out as a genuine genre piece of work, in their place comes sexy campery and ropey action set pieces. The casting of both Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnell as Robin is a big mistake, Kilmer easily being the most boring actor to don the suit out of all of them, whilst O'Donnell simply can't act outside of Robin's cartoonery bravado. Nicole Kidman looks positively gorgeous as Chase Meridian, but that's all that is brought to the party, it's a waste of the very talented Kidman's ability and a waste of the audience's time.\n\nIt's not all bad tho, a comic book adaptation is only as good as its villains, and here we get a perfectly cast Jim Carrey as The Riddler, and a wildly over the top Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Carrey steals every scene he is in, it's almost too much, but as maniacal and exuberant as it is, it is the films highlight and actually the films saving grace {Tommy Lee Jones was reportedly unhappy from having his thunder stolen in the movie by Carrey}. The script does work enough to make the story accessible to all ages, and there are enough crash bangs and wallops to entertain in that brain at the door kind of way.\n\nThis was the biggest hit of 1995, so the paying public lapped it up and paved the way for another Schumacher film in the franchise, but with all that star power wasted, and nipples on the rubber suits, it's hard to see why it was so popular now. 5/10"

This movie I thought had a great flow was targeted for 11-21 year olds and with that in mind it was successful. The successor was just over the top with three villains and batgirl. Overall in terms of DC you have the Nolan Trilogy and the 1978 Superman and the first Wonderwoman unlike Blunder Woman 84...or Justice league garbage etc..."

        "review_detailed_main": "The idea behind Batman has always been quite dark; however, seeing as comic books were being marketed towards kids, they had to make Batman goofy and campy (an image further emphasized by Adam West's TV serial). By the 80's, they started backing up the dark side of the character; Tim Burton's 'Batman' being a much needed deviation towards creating this new image.\n\nThe third film of Batman's franchise, 'Batman Forever' saw Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer enter the fray to replace Tim Burton and Michael Keaton as director and star respectively. However, Schumacher took the franchise in the entire opposite direction Burton was doing: he reenacted the old silly, campy and idiotic vision of Batman.\n\nWhereas Burton created a fascinating city, Schumacher creates a mere dulled-down and neon-filled version of his world. The special effects try to be flashy, but are merely dull and even outdated. Schumacher's tries to add wit and something akin to slapstick comedy end up making it work not like he expected, but as a witless 'so bad it is kinda funny' kind of film. Heck, the plot is ludicrous even for a comic book story.\n\nThe cast might seem good in theory but, in the end, is totally out of chemistry and misplayed.\n\nTommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey try to play mere copycats of Jack Nicholson's Joker. By the end, not only do they contradict everything said of their characters by doing so (and also make every comic fan cringe), they end up doing little more than an exercise in overacting and buffoonery; TLJ makes a complete joke of himself as Two-Face while Carrey, one of my favorite modern comedians, is way too hit-or-miss as the Riddler.\n\nVal Kilmer is far too feminine in comparison to Keaton, and while he is somewhat passable as Bruce Wayne he holds no sense of menace or mystery as Batman; Chris O'Donnell manages to be even worse, and actually ends up as a clich\u00e8d troubled teenager. Nicole Kidman is very ill-suited as a femme fatale, and Drew Barrymore is pretty much a cameo (I didn't even know she was there the first time I watched). Even Michael Gough is worse here than he was on Burton's films.\n\nNicole Kidman and Val Kilmer, the main couple, seem to be doing completely different scenes at all when together and their expressions never match; that's how good the chemistry and acting is here.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the entire idiocy that was 'Batman Forever' (and there was a lot, from the battles with Two-Face to the attack on Wayne Manor), Schumacher somehow got permission to further destroy the franchise with an even worse sequel.\n\nMy only guess is that, being gay, Schumacher was a believer of the Batman/Robin innuendos and/or identified himself with Adam West's campy version and decided to try and turn Batman back into the campy hero he loved and/or identified with.\n\nWhich would explain Batman's nipples in the sequel..."

The only thing I like about this movie (as I am a collector and admirer of the BATMAN comic-books) are the melancholic and darker undertones in the scenes with Nicole Kidman and Val Kilmer.\n\nVal Kilmer is in my opinion the second-best Bruce Wayne/Batman after Christian Bale. His and Nicole Kidman's performances make the movie worth watching.\n\nWhat nearly made me cry, were the totally silly performances of Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey as Two-Face and the Riddler. I think their (or the director's) approach is an offense to everyone who seriously reads the comic books (and as I have nearly everything that was released in Germany in the last 30 years, I count myself in)!!! I will go as far to say, that Jim Carrey played the Riddler as a totally stupid and laughable character which could also be felt in the following years of appearances of the Riddler in the comic-books. Because of this film no one could take the riddler serious any more.\n\nSo, if you are a kid, who likes to watch the animated series and collect the related comic-books - this is a movie for you. But if you are into the realistic Batman-Comics (DC/BATMAN/LOTDK/SOTB...) you will despise great parts of this movie and only like a few scenes!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Batman Forever\" was a deliberate change from the Gothic films from Tim Burton. The above film is a lot more light-hearted, is brightly lit, has a good pace and good action scenes. Val Kilmer is absolutely terrible in the title role - he is that wooden, I thought someone would have knocked some nails into him! He displays no depth and no ability whatever. Goodness knows why he was cast. He is very much a forgotten name these days. Nicole Kidman is bloody irritating most of the time in this film. Her attempts at being seductive and at being an intelligent psychiatrist are woeful. I remember thinking that when I was at the cinema. She's just another dumb blonde in films. Chris O' Donnell is ok as Robin but Michael J. Fox would have been better. Pat Hingle and Michael Gough are on hand to provide their usual solid support but neither has much to do. A pity. Out of the two villains, I much prefer the performance of Tommy Lee Jones. It disappoints me when he is written out for a lengthy period but his larger than life acting is the right approach for \"Batman Forever.\" Jim Carrey is way too poofy as the Riddler. He makes Frank Gorshin's effort seem laid back and subtle in comparison. He should have been reined in a bit more by Joel Schumacher. The fight scenes are very good, with some crisp choreography. I liked the bit when Chris O' Donnell takes on those street punks in the alley way. The violence has certainly been toned down here. The photography is an asset, even though most of the film was filmed on sound stages. This is a fair film to be honest. \"Batman and Robin\" is the one that was ruining it for everyone."

Nearly $90m less in fact and although $160M was still a respectable gross those greedy bean counters plotted to dump the secret of their success and his Gothic, expressionist aesthetic and replace it with something a little more friendly for the those baby-bats who need to be able to enjoy the flick in order to buy the accompanying Burger King meal. Not so much Batman Forever then, more Batman and his ancillary markets and thus we have this second sequel which is the end of the road as far as serious Bat-Adventures are concerned.Schumacher's interpretation of the studios remit is a Gotham in which Batman is Val Kilmer and the tone is an uneasy straddle between the camp, fantasy approach of the 60's T.V series and the Looney Tunes, just without the jokes. Elfman is gone too, his melancholic, sometimes haunting contribution replaced by Elliot Goldenthal's shrill, ear bleeding circus tunes. It tries marginally harder than its successor, the ungodly ...and Robin but only just. Jim Carrey as the Riddler is a suitably sadistic, over the top combination of gurning, infantilism and spite - probably the most interesting character in an otherwise wasted cast but really stupidity personified. That he could get paid $20M for this nonsense is the only genuinely funny thing about his performance. So despite the odd visual flourish this has nothing to recommend it to serious fans of the caped crusader and come of think of it, not much to attract the casual viewer. So what, you may ask, is Batman Forever for? Its back to those Burger King meals I'm afraid..."

Course the only downer is that Micheal Keaton isn't back as BatMan and Tim Burton is only producer for this one.\n\nHear are my thoughts on it: BatMan Forever introduces 2 new threats in Gotham City. First one is 2-Face who was originally Harvey, with a split personality where he's sometimes the regular good guy and the other half is where he looses his temper. Either way he determines his decision by flipping a coin that has a good side and a bad side on it.\n\nThe other one is Riddler, a geeky scientist who invented a new way of viewing TV. His boss describes him as a nut and won't improved on the idea. This drove him mad, like a madman. He's so determined to know more knowledge and wants to be where the Fat Cats are. Which give him the opportunity to sell his product that's a connection with a generator that gives him more knowledge than an average human being. All this knowledge gives him advantage over the crime wave with the power of \"riddles\" These 2 insane characters will be BatMan's most difficult challenge yet. And with a new girl friend(who has the hots for BatMan) and giving a teenager a home(who has nowhere to go) will be quite a twist.\n\nThis BatMan movie is good but not as perfect as the first 2. If Tim Burton was director of this movie then we'd see this 3rd one to have the same charm as the first 2 did. It has some good actors in it. If it weren't for Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey's performances as the main villains then this movie would of suck.\n\nVal Kilmer was as good as Micheal Keaton's role as BatMan but not better. I prefer one of those 2 actor instead of Christen Bale who I dislike as BatMan.\n\nI recommend it to the die-hard BatMan fan as well as the Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey fans. Tim Burton fans might just rent it and see it for yourselves."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had to lie about my age to see this movie in a German movie theater when it first came out. After seeing it, I couldn't understand why a child would not be allowed to see something like that, and now, later in life, I understand it even less, because Batman Forever is clearly a kid's movie.\n\nThis third Batman film was when Joel Schumacher took over from Burton and brought a flamboyant style, full of color, texture and motion. On top of that, Jim Carrey was brought on board, and gave his signature Jim Carrey performance, which is like a clown at a children's party.\n\nVivid characters with wild expressionist acting in this live-action comic book are more than capable at keeping the attention of a kid. Add to it some violence, a hot Nicole Kidman, songs from Seal and U2 and I was sold.\n\nVal Kilmer is an acceptable Batman. The thing about the character of Batman is that he is just an emotionless gruff canvas onto which the colourful villains are painted and Val Kilmer suffices for that role. The performance by Tommy Lee as Two Face is entertaining, but the problem is that he is going full throttle, as if he's trying to outdo Jim Carrey. It would've been far better to have him be more grounded to act as a contrast to Carrey. As for Jim Carrey, he is just being his crazy self and no one can outdo him at his shtick. Nicole Kidman...Look, I make a conscious effort to try and assess female actresses for their acting skills first and foremost, but they put Nicole on such a sexual display in this film, that I am having a hard time seeing her as an actress. Plus this was my original childhood celebrity crush. Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin, on the other hand, is annoying. This may be a very subjective impression, but his character is snooping around, getting into trouble (despite clearly being an adult and not a teenager) and his facial expression makes me want to punch him. But at least his performance provides some contrast to the stoic Batman.\n\nThe glitzy style of Batman Forever can be seen as a positive or as a negative, depending on your preference. At the time of its release, Batman Forever caught a lot of flak for being so different from its predecessors. Burton had Burtonified the previous two Batman movies, meaning they were dark and gothic. It can be argued whether the quirky gothic direction was the right one for Batman, but those movies were well received and gained a large following. Schumacher's version is the polar opposite of that. Both movies are quite sexual, but we go from an S&M dungeon to a gay party, and this upset some people.\n\nHowever, even outside the context of the Burton movies, it is easy to see how the over-the-top act, full of dumb jokes and epileptic acting may be a little much for an adult.\n\nOne concrete example where the fun style of this film doesn't quite mix with the subject matter is the Batmobile. Fans have grown accustomed to Batman's mutually beneficial relationship with darkness. He is supposed to be a bat coming out of a dark cave to intimidate criminals. The Batmobile in Batman Forever has a bunch of slits with blue light coming out of them, like a pimped up PC rig, in addition to the already really large flame coming from its jet engine. The fins on this thing are huge. With other words, you can see it from far away and it's calling attention to itself.\n\nStill, there are quite a few good-looking scenes in Batman Forever. Say what you want about the cartoonish style, but the water bubbles, neon lights, costumes, rays of lights and the contrast between light and dark make for some nice eye candy. This movie looks especially good in the dark in a movie theater while you're chewing on some popcorn. Elliot Goldenthal's musical score adds to the film's cooky atmosphere while bearing some resemblance to Danny Elfman's theme from the previous movies.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this movie. It's hard for an adult to sit through, but at the same time looks interesting and has a few good actors providing an insane performance. And, as crazy as it is, this film is not nearly as cartoonish and ridiculous as Schumacher's Batman and Robin. Batman Forever strikes a good balance."

Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit.\n\nIn Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler.\n\nTommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input.\n\nIf your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tim Burton's 1989 adaptation of the popular comic book superhero spawned a craze of \"Batmania\" that continued well into the early 90s. It could be argued that the wildly successful blockbuster gave birth to the modern superhero film genre that is ever so popular today, with Marvel Comics following suit in the form of their own \"Spider-Man\" film trilogy and \"X-Men\" series in the early 2000s, as well as DC rebooting the \"Batman\" franchise itself with the critically acclaimed \"Dark Knight Trilogy\", all of which in turn influenced the creation and sheer box office dominance of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One might point to the Christopher Reeves \"Superman\" series, but I like to think of that film as more of an attempt to cash off of the space opera craze that \"Star Wars\" ignited in movie goers.\n\nLittle talked about are that first 1989 film's series of sequels. Occasionally one might refer to \"Batman Returns\", as director Tim Burton and Batman actor Michael Keaton return to the edgy film noir and gothic inspired interpretation of Gotham City. The mixed reception and box office performance of the darker sequel prompted producers and executives to tone down the violence and make a more lighthearted and family friendly version of the Caped Crusader.\n\n1997's critically panned \"Batman and Robin\" also dominates much of the talk, with many pointing to it as one of the worst superhero movies of all time. Ridiculously cheesy and campy, with a plot that's all over the place and performances, puns, and one-liners that muddy everything; that film certainly deserves the bad rap that it gets.\n\nSandwiched in between those two sequels, however, is a movie that often gets misunderstood and is absent from many a \"Batman\" movie discussion; one that certainly has issues of its own but often gets thrown in a pile with its successor film as an over-the-top piece of 90s action movie schlock. In my opinion, there are elements of this film that do shine through, and I see it more as an earnest, yet flawed, attempt at marrying the darker side of Batman with the lighter.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the colorful 1960s TV series starring Adam West, Joel Schmacher made the wise decision to introduce some of the lighter elements of the \"Batman\" mythos in this installment. The character Robin (Chris O'Donnell) is often maligned by fans of the grittier Dark Knight, but I believe that his inclusion in this film serves its purpose of giving Batman (Val Kilmer) inspiration for continuing his life-long goal of ridding Gotham of its criminal underworld. Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler (Jim Carrey) absolutely steal whatever scenes they're in, especially when they are paired together, taunting the Bat.\n\nThe main problem with this movie isn't so much the fact that it contains so many tones within. The aforementioned \"Star Wars\" has its moments of light-hearted humor and serious bravado and heroics and dramatic emotion. The awkward shifts in tone are what hurts this movie. There will be a dramatic scene that will honestly serve a very thematic purpose (the theme of \"Batman Forever\" being the question of whether Bruce Wayne will be able to continue living the double life he lives despite the chaos it brings to the ones he cares about), and that scene will be completely ruined with the inclusion of a cringeworthy pun or joke. A few script re-writes and some honest critical review of the dialogue easily could have bumped the score up to a 7 in my mind.\n\nNonetheless, as a two hour piece of entertainment or a piece of a \"Batman\" movie marathon, this one will offer up its big-hitting moments in satisfying ways. I won't say that it's some \"misunderstood masterpiece\", but I do think it has its moments and that it doesn't deserve to be scoffed at as much by fans of the character. It definitely isn't required viewing by any means, but for those wondering if it will at least be a halfway decent action movie to spend an afternoon watching, the answer is yes."

He is probably a big fan of the Adam West TV series and believes that is how Batman should be portrayed: as a joke. Career low-point for Tommy Lee Jones. Little kids might like it more than grown-ups. One thing you can say about the film is that it never stops moving. It doesn't dare!"

The story wasn't especially well written but that's OK because it's mostly about style and letting a great cast ham it up to the max...and they do. I'm not a huge Jim Carrey fan but he made a fun Riddler. The movie does take quite a while to really hit its stride but the second half is a fun ride. Every single scene with Nicole Kidman in it sizzles. She and Kilmer have good chemistry together. Tommy Lee's last line before he \"dies\" is really cool. He delivered it so perfectly and in character. I loved that part. Batman makes several great entrances, I especially liked the one at the Riddler's big party towards the end of the show. I don't consider myself a huge fan of the Batman films(this is actually the first one I've seen), however I was entertained and this is absolutely a don't miss for Nicloe Kidman fans. There is a scene with her in bed covered by only a silk sheet and WOW! The 2.99 I paid at goodwill for this VHS rewarded me handsomely with that scene alone!...cheers"

I can't help but think that if another actor had taken on the role, my enjoyment of the movie would have tanked.\n\nWhile it may not hold up to the darker (and more accurate) interpretations of the characters and world, \"Batman Forever\" was an entertaining, but flawed, addition to the series that offers a more comical take on Gotham."

        "review_detailed_main": "Much like the villain Riddler, 'Batman Forever' is an enigma. As much as I want to hate it, I just can't, but as much as I want to like it, I can't do that either. 'Batman Forever' has its strengths, but it also has great weaknesses. I blame Joel Schumacher. You're a very bad man, Joel Schumacher.\n\nGotham City now has more neon lights than Tokyo and Hong Kong combined, but the insane criminals are still hanging around. The origin-less and insane Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) is intent on killing Batman (Val Kilmer), and spends most of the movie trying to do this. Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey) is also quite insane, a former employee of Wayne Enterprises, Nygma takes up the life of a super-villain and becomes the Riddler. As both Two-Face and Riddler are insane, and intent on taking out Batman, they form a partnership that sees them spending the movie trying to kill Batman, crashing parties, and generally being insane.\n\nIts funny: I thought 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' could have been better if they focused more on Batman. Well, 'Batman Forever' is all about Batman, but unfortunately at the expense of every other character. Val Kilmer is good as Batman, and he could have been better if he had not had some of the ridiculous lines that he did. The problem is the villains: Portrayed perfectly in the first two movies, they are now just around for the sake of needing villains. Tommy Lee Jones was not playing Two-Face as much as he was playing a second-rate rip-off of Joker. Nearly all of Nicole Kidman's screen time as Dr Chase Meridian was just cringe-worthy. Jim Carrey was much better at playing The Riddler, even if he was essentially playing an evil version of himself. In fact, he wasn't even that intimidating. He seemed like the kind of villain who needed only a hug to mend his wicked ways.\n\nWhat was Schumacher trying to achieve with this? A balance of dark Batman and campy 60s Batman? Val Kilmer would have been great as Batman, but then Schumacher has to give him nipples on the Bat-Suit and some really stupid lines. Not to mention that Gotham City has gone from being dark and imposing to a very computer generated neon light-show. While Val Kilmer is the Dark Knight, Joel Schumacher is setting everything up nicely for 'Batman and Robin', and you thought Tim Burton had a twisted vision. Joel Schumacher, you are a very bad man.\n\n'Batman Forever' is not a terrible film, its just not good either. I'd give it a 5, but taking into consideration that it allowed for Schumacher to move onto 'Batman and Robin', it get's a lowly 4/10 from me. Joel Schumacher, you are a very bad man."

He strikes a rhythm with his role and it combined with the entertainment of a drama that feels real, makes the movie go at a nice pace. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. There are fisticuffs back and forth between those who claim to work for justice. It gives a picture of a backwards society that diminishes reality, where culminating incidents brought by suffered individuals show the truth. Here you will find a bit of realism existing in a delusional world."

Or perhaps \"Batman gets exposed for all time and this film ruins all Batman continuity\"? I don't know what the hell they were thinking with this one.\n\nYes, giving Tim Burton too much control in Batman Returns went well off the rails, but handing the reins over to Joel Schumacher was a disaster. Well, they wanted a silly, kid-friendly Batman, and I guess they sort of got it, except for Nicole Kidman absolutely sexing-up the screen throughout the film (easily the best thing about the movie).\n\nWe need to talk about Robin. Whoever was ultimately responsible for casting a 25 year old Chris O'Donnell (who looks 25-30 here) as a minor who needs to be in the care of an adult should be shot, dragged out into the street, shot again, and trampled by a horde of ravenous gorillas. That person is too stupid to be allowed to live in the same world as the rest of us, infecting it with his/her stupidity. This goes WAY beyond the typical high school full of 20-somethings playing teenagers.\n\nSo what else? The plot is dumb, the action is weak, the good guys' and bad guys' acting is like they're in completely different films: Kilmer, Kidman, and O'Donnell trying to be serious like they're in 1989 Batman, and Carey and Jones and most of the supporting cast going full 1960's Adam West camp-Batman. I don't blame the actors for this, it's clearly on the half-assed director, but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that Chris O'Donnell can't act to save his life. He was clearly shoehorned into a role he was way too old for simply to try to appeal to teenage girls.\n\nOh, and writing a plot where 100% of the bad guys and all their henchmen HAVE TO DIE (or lose their minds) or Batman's secret is exposed forever? And then the henchmen DON'T all die? So basically, Batman is hosed? Yeah, welcome to Terrible Writing 101.\n\nSo yeah, it's bad, despite the fact that I love Val Kilmer and Nicole Kidman. I understand this was a dream-role turned-nightmare for Kilmer, but I wonder if he realizes it was a nightmare for the audience as well?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Joel Schumacher takes the Batman series into a very different direction to Tim Burton with mixed results, in this 1995 blockbuster that temporarily revived the Batman film franchise.\n\nVal Kilmer takes over the reigns as Batman, but don't let that effect your viewing, he is pretty much a background character in this one. Like the original Batman, this one bases its story around the superstar playing its main villain, and unfortunately for the viewers, Jim Carrey is no Jack Nicholson. Carrey stars as Edward Nigma, a harmless nut with dangerous ideas until those dangerous ideas drive him crazy and he becomes The Riddler.\n\nThe Riddler teams up with Two Face, who is also left in the background in spite of being played by a far better actor (Tommy Lee Jones) and being a far more interesting character than Carrey's Riddler. It is Two Face who seems to find a similar tone to the Joker in the original, rather than the Riddler who is basically Ace Ventura playing a Batman villain. This one also introduces Robin, (Chris O'Donnell killing his career stone dead) a circus trapeze artist trying to avenge the death of his father. There is an interesting back story waiting to get out with the Robin character, but we don't see it here.\n\nNicole Kidman, around the time she was temporarily a minor sex symbol due to a string of seductive roles in To Die For, Eyes Wide Shut, and frankly here, as a therapist love interest who is deeply in need of therapy herself, and spends a good chunk of the movie trying to get Bruce Wayne into bed.\n\nThere were two big hit songs that came from this movie: Kiss From a Rose by Seal and Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me by U2. The former is infinitely more memorable than anything else from this movie.\n\nBatman Forever is inoffensive nonsense made for the whole family. It's not a terrible film, but isn't good either. If you don't feel like watching Carrey act over the top for two hours, give it a miss. And certainly avoid if you were a fan of the Tim Burton films. If you were into the 1960s show, you may like this, if you can stand Carrey. Maybe How the Grinch stole Gotham would have been a better title?"

Obsessive Wayne Enterprises researcher Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey) develops a new box capable of creating immersive 3D entertainment through the manipulation of brain waves, but following the rejection of his project by Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer), Nygma continues on with his experiments and discovers the box has the added benefit of allowing him to tap into the minds of its users which sets him on a course to teaming up with Two Face under the guise of puzzle/riddle based villain The Riddler. As Bruce Wayne continues his masked crusade as Batman against Gotham's criminal element both Batman and Bruce Wayne find themselves the subject of fascination with Psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) who is fascinated by the duality of Batman. When Two Face ends up holding a charity circus hostage, the event results in the death of acrobat Dick Grayson's (Chris O'Donnell) parents and older brother. Bruce takes in Grayson where before long he discovers Bruce's secret identity as Batman and wishes to seek revenge on Two Face with Bruce's help but Bruce tries to dissuade him from the path of vengeance.\n\nWhile Batman Returns generated enough revenue and ancillaries to justify continuation of the series, executives were none too happy about the dip in box office gross Batman Returns saw in comparison to Batman. Executives deciding the dark tone of Returns was responsible for the box office dip previous films' director Tim Burton was asked to step aside to a producer role while a different director approached the material. Following considerations of Sam Raimi and Die Hard's John McTiernan, Joel Schumacher was eventually selected after working with Warner Bros. On the John Grisham adaptation of The Client and the selection was signed off by Burton. Michael Keaton had originally been in favor of reprising his role as Batman, but following the change in direction of pandering to the \"MTV Generation\" with full merchandising appeal, Keaton jumped ship even refusing a $15 million payday leading to a search for a replacement which lead to Val Kilmer after several other names were considered. The movie featured a strong cast for the time with Val Kilmer at arguably the height of his career following his role in Tombstone and coming out the same year as Michael Mann's Heat, Tommy Lee Jones fresh off his Oscar win for portraying Sam Gerard in The Fugitive, and of course up and coming comedy star Jim Carrey who scored three back-to-back hits in 1994 with The Mask, Dumb & Dumber, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective respectively. Batman Forever was a big hit in June 1995 and earned $60 million more than Batman Returns and managed to score those much envied McDonald's marketing tie-ins that were lost in 1992 as well as scoring ancillaries from video games, toys, and other assorted merchandise. Despite being a big hit when released, Batman Forever today is seen as a rather forgettable entry in the Batman series, not matching the dark gritty tone of the first two but also not going into full blown camp like Batman & Robin.\n\nVal Kilmer steps into the role of Batman/ Bruce Wayne and Kilmer just does not feel at home in this role. He plays the Batman and Bruce Wayne parts very flatly with no real authority for Batman and not much charm or charisma for Bruce. Kilmer is a strong actor if given the right material as seen in Tombstone and Heat, but he doesn't feel like he really fits this character and plays the role without much presence. Tommy Lee Jones is obnoxiously over the top as Harvey \"Two Face\" Dent with his constant laughing and mugging becoming rather grating as the movie goes on. The make-up on Two Face is also rather underwhelming as Two Face looks more like a half finished Ivan Ooze from Power Rangers: The Movie rather than two face from the comic or the Animated Series. Jim Carrey on the other hand is a lot of fun playing The Riddler. While I'm not a fan of his very Pajama like costumes (especially a white unitard with green question marks) he feels like he does tap into the character of Riddler as the egotistical know it all who looks down on the perceived simpletons he's surrounded by. Par for the course for Jim Carrey's mid-90s work they do work in much of Carrey's trademark exaggerated deliveries and comic flailing but with his very Frank Gorshin like take on the character it can't be denied that it fits.\n\nNicole Kidman is pretty much a non-entity as Dr. Chase Meridian and maybe one of the most pointless love interests I've seen in a blockbuster. With her very exaggerated and hokey delivery that tries to be funny but comes pretty stilted and with the equally stilted delivery from Kilmer the two's chemistry never takes off the way Vicki Vale or Selina Kyle did in the previous films. Then we have Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin. On paper it's a solid introduction and set-up for the character but as most people have noted O'Donnell comes across like a petulant child in the film and it's because O'Donnell was 25 when he made this movie and the character feels like it was written to be at most a 15 year old. If someone like Elijah Wood or even Edward Furlong played this character it probably would've worked, but when you have lines like \"You saved me a lot of time with social services\" coming from the mouth of a 25 year old man it has a tendency to call attention to itself and not in a good way.\n\nJoel Schumacher certainly knows how to give a sense of grandeur and scope to his films and you certainly get that with Forever's take on Gotham City, but the noirish Art Deco cityscapes have been replaced by garish Vegas-esque neons and hot pinks that don't feel like a world that's been created and instead feel more like a stage show. The movie retains some of the aesthetic and artistic choices of the previous Burton films, but they often clash with the more loud and exaggerated additions that I assume were there to be A) Toyetic and B) to appeal to the marketing coveted MTV Generation. There are moments where Schumacher taps into the pathos of the original films such as Bruce Wayne dealing with his repressed memories of his parents funeral or even trying to rectify problems with the original films like Bruce addressing his revenge on Jack Napier/The Joker never resolved his anger and only made it worse when trying to persuade Dick not to go down the same path he did. But Two Face is really just a chaos engine and is not interesting with the Jekyll/Hyde duality so diluted it may as well not even be there, and while I enjoy Jim Carrey's take on The Riddler you can find plenty of holes to poke in the plan and its execution.\n\nBatman Forever is a very middle of the road movie. With a lackluster Batman and love interest and a pretty egregiously miscast Robin the movie feels like it doesn't buy into its core concept in the same way Batman and Batman Returns did. Jim Carrey is entertaining as Edward Nygma/The Riddler and the production design can occasionally be impressive when it's not overpowering with neon lights and glow-in-the-dark paint, but once you're beneath the surface of Forever's glossy sheen there's not much going on. Batman Forever is a pretty movie with bright colors and lots of movement and there's that lingering air that the film is trying to sell you something especially with the oft quoted \"Drive-thru\" line that predictably made it into all the McDonald's tie-in marketing."

        "review_title": "The decline of the first \"Batman\" series, but still not a bad entry...",
        "review_detailed_main": "In just eight short years, the initial \"Batman\" film series went from the dark, poetic sophistication of Tim Burton's \"Batman\" (1989) and \"Batman Returns\" (1992), to becoming a bloated, neon-colored parody of itself with the late Joel Schumacher's final two entries \"Batman Forever\" (1995) and \"Batman & Robin\" (1997).\n\nBurton's first two movies were the best, with \"Batman\" being my favorite and my number-seven movie of all time. Schumacher's first take on the Dark Knight, \"Batman Forever\" represented the decline of the series. I remember watching \"Batman Forever\" almost non-stop when I was a nine- or ten-year-old kid back in the mid '90s after the film had been released on home video. It was a childhood favorite, but as I got older, I began to see a lot of the film's problems, the most obvious of which, was the drastic change in tone from Burton's first two movies.\n\nIn moving away from the film- and detective-noir-inspired moods borrowed from Bob Kane's earliest DC Comics \"Batman\" comic book stories and had suffused \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns,\" Schumacher instead leans on the Dick Sprang era of the character, and the camp that nearly ruined Batman back in the '50s and '60s.\n\n(Of course, this was done as a response to parents who complained that Burton's \"Batman Returns\" was too dark and scary for young children, and Burton himself is now in a producer role on this film.)\n\nTo a degree, Schumacher succeeds in introducing an interesting new take on Batman, with the neon-colored Gotham City (which is, admittedly, quite impressive and makes the film a visual marvel). The other good aspect of the film is the inspired casting: \"Batman Forever\" is often said to have the best cast of the initial film series - but still, the Caped Crusader (now played by Val Kilmer, whom I had the honor of meeting at a comic book convention three years ago, and has replaced Michael Keaton from Burton's earlier two films and is my favorite Batman), who in my opinion is bland almost by definition, plays second fiddle to the baddies, who are far more interesting.\n\nKilmer was an interesting choice, as physically, he looks a lot like a Bruce Wayne from the original comics, and carries himself quite well when in the Batsuit. He also offers the most psychologically complex portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman, as well, which allows this film to build on a key theme from \"Batman Returns,\" which was the theme of duality. A famed criminal psychologist, Dr. Chase Meridian (sultry Nicole Kidman), has a deep psychosexual fascination - let's just call it what it is, a fetish - with Batman but shows little interest in Bruce Wayne, setting up a heady discussion between the two about being in love with the fantasy and not the reality.\n\nIn trying to lighten up the series, \"Batman Forever\" introduces two classic villains who are way too over-the-top and cartoonish to be considered truly dangerous (but nonetheless, they fit in perfectly with Schumacher's colorful new take on Batman). One of them is Harvey Dent/Harvey Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), a former district attorney whose face has been horribly scarred by acid and he now carries a murderous personal vendetta against Batman for causing his disfigurement. The other is Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey, in a role that he was born to play), a disgruntled inventor who starts calling himself \"The Riddler\" after he creates a device that allows him to manipulate people's brainwaves and he teams up with Two-Face on a crime spree to gain funding for his invention and, ultimately, uncover Batman's true identity. (Honestly, with Jim Carrey all over the place as The Riddler, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the character - even if he turns The Riddler into a stand-up comedian.)\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle in making the series more \"family-friendly\" was the long-awaited debut of Boy Wonder himself, orphaned circus acrobat Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell, also perfectly cast), who eventually becomes Batman's sidekick, Robin. O'Donnell's Dick Grayson/Robin is more or less your typical teenage rebel with an attitude and a motorcycle, and he becomes Bruce Wayne's ward after Harvey Two-Face murders his family; Wayne, of course, later turns into a surrogate father figure as the two share the pain of having lost their families to violent, psychologically unhinged criminals.\n\nIn watching the film again today, there's surprisingly very little about \"Batman Forever\" that feels especially dated; maybe it's all the neon lights and casual use of CGI effects (which still hold up). I don't know. But the film does represent the first step in the steep decline of the series - especially in terms of artistic creativity, psychological complexity, and maturity. The cast is formidable, even if they're forced to act in what is essentially a live-action cartoon - something that Tim Burton and producer/comics historian Michael E. Uslan had struggled so hard to prevent from happening, which is why the first two \"Batman\" movies were made in the first place.\n\nI guess that was inevitable, when true artistic talent gets in the way of the egotistical, profit-driven powers-that-be in Hollywood.\n\nTim Burton and Michael Keaton are sorely missed by this viewer.\n\n6/10."

Meanwhile in his alter ego Bruce Wayne, Batman must deal with an employee who thinks he is the wave of the electronics future. Bruce turns down his idea and he completely flips, turning him eventually into the Riddler (Carrey), after murdering his supervisor. If this isn't enough for Bruce to deal with he now accepts police chief Gordon's request for him to take in the newly orphaned Dick Grayson who will eventually uncover the Batcave and become Robin (O'Donnell). Ruining Gotham, which is supposed to be Gothic, with neon lights was their 1st bad idea. Then having flashback's to his Bruce's traumatic childhood, which was already explained to us in part one was around 20 minutes of boredom. Batman leaping from impossible heights and landing flawlessly was kind of corny. But it does have a pretty good ending which I will not spoil in case you haven't watched it.

        "review_detailed_main": "Third film in the new-fangled \"Batman\" cycle which started in 1989 with Tim Burton's \"Batman\" starring Michael Keaton. New director Joel Schumacher doesn't have any of Burton's style or panache--he directs like a music video/TV commercial no-name--but the talented cast holds their own. Val Kilmer was a good choice for the lead (it was his one and only turn as the superhero) and Jim Carrey is a very fine Riddler. Unfortunately, Schumacher seems to delight in being a piffle-maker extraordinaire--how else to explain the jokey exchanges and cartoony costumes which look like leftovers from an S&M sex shop. The plot has Batman challenged by the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (whose modus operandi is never made quite clear). Chris O'Donnell adds some dry humor as would-be prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Robin, but Nicole Kidman's role as a psychologist/love-interest is tepid. The movie creaks and groans with empty camp, while whole sequences seem oddly under-directed and yet over-nourished (Riddler holds an outdoor press-conference which probably took an entire day to set up and yet the scene runs about 15 seconds and looks tacky to boot!). Schumacher followed with \"Batman & Robin\" in 1997. Three Oscar nominations: Best Cinematography for Stephen Goldblatt, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects Editing. One Golden Globe nomination: for the song \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\" composed by members of the band U2. ** from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman Forever's reputation has been unfairly tarnished by Batman & Robin. Overall, BF is actually a fun action movie with a few good elements of drama. Schumacher was told to make a more family friendly Batman movie, and he delivered. It would have been better if he did not have to take out certain scenes that were vital to Bruce Wayne's character development. These scenes are available in the deleted scenes feature on the most recent DVD release.\n\nBF has a typical superhero movie plot. Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is obsessed with killing Batman. Jim Carrey plays Edward Nygma, a man who idolizes Bruce Wayne and literally wants to be him. But when Bruce Wayne turns down his invention, a machine that would connect human minds to their televisions, Nygma embarks on a quest for revenge. He learns that his machine can actually make him smarter. As the Riddler, he teams up with Two-Face to kill Batman and become the smartest man in the world.\n\nBruce Wayne (Val Kilmer) has his own personal problems. He is haunted by his parent's death, and somehow feels responsible. On top of that, he falls in love with a psychologist named Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), but she is obsessed with Batman. Wayne adopts Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell), a circus performer whose parents were killed by Two-Face. Grayson has a thirst for revenge, much like Bruce Wayne did in Batman (1989).\n\nVal Kilmer makes a decent Batman and an even better Bruce Wayne. I still place him below Keaton because his voice was monotonous, whereas Keaton managed to be creepy with his whispers. Chris O'Donnell and Michael Gough both gave good performances too. What really makes the movie work is the relationship between these characters. Dick Grayson is almost a mirror image of Bruce Wayne. I must also give props to Schumacher and Kilmer for how they handled Bruce's flashbacks to his parent's death. They presented a truly tortured man. Chase Meridian's romance with Bruce Wayne, while not extraordinary, is much more tolerable than the love stories in some of the more recent comic book movies. Dare I say, Batman Forever has the best action scenes of all the Batman movies too.\n\nSo far, my review has been mostly positive, but I have plenty of problems with this movie. My criticisms of Batman Forever are really just creative differences. One sentence can sum it up: I prefer a darker Batman. Ultimately, this movie is just too goofy. For one thing, Gotham City is too bright; neon lights and Gotham City just don't mix. Gotham should be dark and gloomy. Tommy Lee Jones' performance as Two-Face is so clownish it's a travesty. Jones did not understand the character. The scene where he flips the coin until he gets the response he wants is completely out of character. He is essentially reduced to the Riddler's lackey. While Jim Carrey's performance was a good tribute to Frank Gorshin, I prefer the Riddler from Batman: The Animated Series, who was sinister in a subtler way. Carrey, like Jones, is just too goofy for me.\n\nI know this criticism has been done to death, but I have to bring it up. The most infamous aspect of Schumacher's legacy is the bat nipples. Let me tell you, the nipples didn't phase me as much as the close up shots of Batman's butt. I mean really, what was the point? For me, all of these goofy/comedic elements almost negate what is good about the movie, which is why I can only give it a 6."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1989 Batman was released and showed a much more darker tone than the 1960's Adam West Batman TV show and movie which was camp, Tim Burton's Batman remains to be the highest grossing Batman movie to date. Batman was followed by a sequel in 1992 which was more darker than the first film although the movie was criticised for being a little bit too dark and depressing, Tim Burton once again was the director and Michael Keaton was once again Batman/ Bruce Wayne. Batman Returns was a box office success but wasn't has successful has the first Batman film. Years later Warner Brothers decided to make a third Batman movie, this time instead of being dark and gritty like the previous two films it returned to the campy style of the 1960's Batman show. Tim Burton was producer but replaced has director by Joel Schumacher who had previously made the 1980's horror cult classic The Lost Boys, Michael Keaton who had previously played Batman was replaced by Val Kilmer. Jim Carry was cast to give the movie a more kid friendly tone, Tommy Lee Jones was cast as the other villain Two Face, Nichole Kidman was cast has Batman's love interest and Chris O'Donnel was cast as Batman's sidekick Robin. With this big cast Batman Forever was hyped to be the best out the series and of course Batman Forever was a box office success although it did receive mixed reviews from critics. Batman Forever was the Batman movie Warner Brothers wanted, it was safe and profitable. This however wasn't the same with Batman & Robin.\n\nAnyway on with my review. I remember hearing about Batman Forever and being sicked to see it, I saw Batman Forever in the cinemas with my parents and brothers and was completely disappointed with it. I was five years old and I preferred the dark style of the original two Tim Burton Batman films, we actually walked out of the cinemas after the first half hour of the film. Years later I watched the movie again, being older I watched it with a open mind. I must admit it's not has bad as I remembered it but it's still not the best Batman movie, it's just a little bit better than Batman & Robin. The one problem with this movie is that it's lost the dark style of the first two films for a more campy kid friendly style, while the first two were dark and bleak this one is bright and colourful. Another problem with this film is that it does seem a bit too silly, the Riddler acts too zany and Two Face acts like a campy villain. Another thing is Val Kimler's performance has Batman and Bruce Wayne, he's no replacement for Michael Keaton. He doesn't have that same presence Michael Keaton had. That said Batman Forever did have it's good points such has the costumes, they did look pretty cool. The Vechiles were also good and the action although a bit more over the top was okay. The good thing is that now the Batman movies have returned to the dark and gritty style with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.\n\nBatman Forever does have it's moments but it's not has good as Batman and Batman Returns, younger viewers may like this film more than the older viewers.\n\nFans of Batman may want to check this film out but don't expect it to be like the darker Batman films."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's face it: I'm young. I didn't grow up watching the corny \"Bam!Pow! To the Batcave, Robin!\" Batman of yesteryears, and I could care less for them. Doesn't any one think that Adam West is just a little too \"normal\" to be playing a tights-wearing vigilante who does it because his parents were murdered in a dark alley before his eyes (if this isn't the true origins of the original Batman, anyone, feel free to e-mail me)?\n\nTim Burton's Batman was awesome. He was dark, and he did what any person in that Batman's shoes would do: relentlessly hunt criminals, no matter what the cost. I'm not a big Keaton fan, but I must say: Michael Keaton performed the part flawlessly and best yet, looked the parts he was actually playing. While the suit does most of the acting as Batman, he looked like a Bruce Wayne, a person whose innocence was totally crushed at a young age and thus didn't grow up a pretty boy millionaire. This is the fault in picking Val Kilmer. While he does a decent job (he's better in The Saint, in my opinion), he just doesn't look the part. On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones does a good job as Two-Face, though a little overboard in spots in my opinion, but how come Harvey Dent has become so conspicuously white, wasn't he black in the first film, with Billy Dee Williams filling the shoes? Jim Carrey plays an excellent psychopath, but Nigma was more than that, he was also rather ingenious, and that doesn't come across in the flick.\n\nThe other main problem is the lack of any consistency between the first two movies and the new ones. The old Gotham was dark, dreary and seemed like the perfect den for criminals like Joker and the others. The Gotham of Adam West was too bright. Abnormal criminals like Joker don't come from normal little towns. These were bizarre demented human minds. Less to say: it was unrealistic, and Tim Burton made it something believable, how these events and people came about. Joel Schumacher, on the other hand, turned Gotham into a Vegas wannabe, what with the behemoth statues bearing highways that seems to stand miles above ground and the hundreds of neon lights constantly surging about. Who was he trying to appeal to? There was already a new fan base with the first two movies that was expecting the same old shadowiness, NOT Las Vegas on the east coast.\n\nNot aforementioned is Robin: let's face it. Do we really need a Boy Wonder? Not only do I find Chris O'Donnell repulsive in this film, and in most of his others, the Robin character does not fit into this universe at all, or at least, it wasn't introduced very properly.\n\nIn fact, the entire setting of this movie is just wrong. While I've already ranted on about Gotham, it's also everything else that just seems so blatantly wrong. Everything: the over-blown usage of Two-Face's split personalities to Nigma's home quarters. The first two films pushed the envelope on certain aspects of believability, but Forever just blows it so far out of proportion that it all goes to crap.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't get better after this one. Sorry, Arnold! And who thought of casting Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy?! Bring back Tim Burton and Denise di Novi. Their Batman is the best. Over Adam West, and certainly over Kilmer and Clooney. And for God's sake, someone put Schumacher out of his misery. It's time for that horse to go to pasture for the last time."

This movie is almost a comical farce compared to the gems Burton had produced with the previous two films. Gone is the dark tone and in with some sort of lighthearted tone which Batman does NOT need! This is a dark story, not a fun romp through the field. Why were Batman fans cursed with Schumacher's input I'll never know.\n\nWhile Kilmer's performance was not up to Keaton's, it does serve as a poor man's alternative. Nicole Kidman does her part well with no real blemishes, which only makes me feel more sympathy for her, as she's stuck in a movie like this. Chris O'Donnell's motivation was probably to look pretty for the ladies, as he puts on a attitude reserved for high school students.\n\nTommy Lee as Two-Face was the best of the two villains in the movie and probably the best of all the performances, although his character not only contradicts what was set in the first film (Harvey Dent in the original was played by Billy Dee Williams) but also how Two-Face acts in the comic (Two-Face does NOT use third person when talking about himself in the comics). Although the award for worst villain in the movie and possibly the whole series (Arnold and Uma at the top of the list) would have to be Carrey's annoying portrayal of The Riddler. While Carrey's comic attitude and animated performance would go well in another movie, they do NOT belong in a Batman movie. His whole outlook on this film in general is one big game. When he appeared and spoke for the first time, I knew that this film was doomed. Carrey simply does not belong in a movie like this.\n\nSchumacher's 'dream' was every Batman fan's nightmare. Anatomically correct Batman and Robin suits, cheesy special effects, annoying characters leave many people wondering why Schumacher was allowed to direct this film at all. The film doesn't totally disappoint, as is does make an okay way for you to waste two hours. The costumes are top notch (sans the nipples) and the young ladies get Chris O'Donnell. Yay. Hopefully the upcoming Batman: Year One will put this series back on track. In the meantime, stay away from Schumacher's steaming piles of crap in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. They belong in a dumpster, immolated and made into paperweights. Burton should've directed this one. One wonders why he didn't step in to save this film.\n\nRating: 5/10"

        "review_title": "Nice dark atmosphere",
        "review_detailed_main": "... but nothing more . Joel Schumacher did a great job by mixing the dark Gothism with colourful neon lighting . I cannot understand why the critics disliked it and said that Burton 's dark touch was gone . I will have to remind you that Batman the Animated Series has this mixed dark / coloured atmosphere and was brilliant . After the dark like hell Batman Returns the producers themselves could not do anything but add a little colour to attract the audience . Even if Burton directed it he would not have another choice especially considering that one of the villains (the Riddler) is dressed in striking green and has red hair. The atmosphere is very good but unfortunately the action scenes are dumb : some contrived bad shot car chases . The finale didn 't have the tension of Batman Returns . And the villains ... oh the villains\n\nthey are a huge disappointment. Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) was simply decorative . Jones made a bad \"wild \" performance . If only could they realise how deep Two-Face 's character is . The cartoon series gave successfully his background : a D.A. with hidden aggressiveness and semipsychotic episodes of violence until the acid on his face disfigured his looks and his mind irrepairably . If they had some scenes about\n\nHarvey Dent 's predicament we could have made a better movie. And the Riddler , oh the Riddler ... I cannot dispute that Jim Carrey was not enjoyable but he was simply miscast . I managed to download the final draft of Akiva Goldsman 's screenplay . The Riddler had hilarious impersonations and witty puns , but unfortunately it was clear that the role was destined for Robin Williams who would be perfect to deliver these lines . Unfortunately Schumacher ignored them and gave Carrey freedom to reduce the role to a wild pantomime . The only joke of these which survived was \" He may have to settle with the bronze !! \" . Another letdown was the absence of witty riddles and it is natural since Akiva Goldsman washed his hands of this task . The Riddler is witty and there had to be a sublot with a puzzled mystery just like in the comics , witty and mind intriguing . The final draft also consisted of many successful references to the 2 prequels which gave more succesful motives to Bruce Wayne 's acts . Unfortunately once again Schumacher chose to ignore them or shot these scenes and edited them out ( I hope that eventually a director 's cut will be released ) The only reference which survived was the subtext about Catwoman as an 'inproper' woman for Batman .\n\nSometimes I believe that the lacklustre villains were intentional in order to prevent another couple of scene stealers after the Penguin and Catwoman . This was successful since Val Kilmer as Batman manages finally to be the center of the film . Kilmer gave if not the best , the most balanced performance . His predecessor Michael Keaton sometimes was very miserable and dark and his successor George Clooney lacked totally the dark . Kilmer had a perfect mix of dark psyche with problematic background and humanistic emotions . After all he DOES seek for psychiatric help which is a very positive sign . He is trying to redeem himself from a dark avengeful murderer to a server of society who does not fight crime simply to fill in his personal void . The psychiatrist Chase Meridian is performed quite well by Nicole Kidman. Although this \"love triangle\" story is contrived and silly the seduction scene is a cult . Kilmer and Kidman have a beautiful chemistry (just like Keaton & Pfeiffer in Batman Returns) . The best part of the entire film is definitely the psychoanalysis scenes where Chase tries to explain Batman 's motives or trying to heal Bruce 's traumatic past . The professional terms used are brilliant and give a realistic approach to this fantasy film . As for the addition of Dick Grayson in the saga simply could not be made in a better way . Chris O' Donnell gives a very satisfying performance . I will have to warn you though that Robin is \"born\" only in the finale . Overall an enjoyable film . Don 't expect great action or powerful bad guys . This has to be the weakest entry in the quartet. See it for the comic atmosphere and Val Kilmer&Nicole Kidman.\n\nBATMAN FOREVER 7.5 / 10"

Batman gets ready, that scene was okay, and then we see the coin of Two-Face flip in Thea air in slow motion. SECOND BEST PART OF THE FILM. Then, we see Two-Face's full face. I liked it, but when I saw what he's really supposed to look like, I was disappointed. Then, it got corny. There were some bad action sequences, and then we meet Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey). He is one of the greatest characters of the film. Later, he kills his boss(excellent scene), and then things begin to heat up again. Eventually, Bruce takes Chase Meridian to the circus. Some corny moments, but good. Then, Two-Face takes over the circus. Perfect! His thugs take out machine guns, close up the place, and the Grayson family makes a plan, while two-Face starts a bomb. The bomb stunk, but it was a great sequence. Robin's parents die, a very good moment. Batman takes him in. Then, the movie seems to become slow-moving, until Edward becomes the Riddler. Very good! He meets up with Two-Face. This is one of the best scenes of the film ,and then it drops again, with some stupid robberies, and some more action scenes. Soon, the Riddler makes an invention(which I loved), and it begins to heat up again. Soon, Robin joins Batman, and it becomes great from this point on. The showdown is the best of the entire Batman series, and Two-Face's death is perfect. Then, the Riddler sees the bat from Bruce's nightmares. The music stops, and he screams. BEST PART OF THE FILM. Then, Chse leaves Batman, and leaves to Arkham, where she talks to Edward. This scene is a classic, and is great. Soon, the movie ends. It could've been a great film. It had spectacular moments and just some stupid moments. There's a part when Edward destroys the Batcave(awesome), and his first Riddle drop-off as it zooms in is a classic moment. It was a weak film, barely supported by Jim Carrey. Had Jim Carrey not been in the film, the movie would be worse than its sequel."

Throw in Kidman, Jones and Carrey, this was a young movie-goers dream.\n\nNot a lot to sink your teeth into but it's just dark and funny enough to be delightfully entertaining. It's not been treated well over the years and I've watched the rating drop a bit. It's worth a re-watch now and again - I plan to do that again on my VHS copy!"

All these years later, \"Batman Forever\" is pretty good. The action scenes are capably handled, Tommy Lee Jones is an excellent villain as Harvey \"Two-Face\" Dent and Michael Gough and Pat Hingle reprise their respective roles. Val Kilmer is absolutely wooden as both Bruce Wayne and Batman (no doubt he was too busy thinking about his paycheck). He displays no depth and little emotion. He is very much a star from yesteryear. Nicole Kidman is the same - bland and irritating. Jim Carrey is OK as the Riddler but my word, he takes it a bit far at times! Chris O' Donnell is better than I thought as Robin. The photography and style are both complete opposites to Tim Burton's two films. In \"Batman Forever,\" everything is much more bright and colourful. The pace is pretty good.

This is a sad state of affairs drowned in a horrible city covered in crappy neon lights.\n\nThis movie = epic fail"

Story is all right, it is interesting and holds attention. Characters are two-dimensional, which is flaw, but not too big considering that it's superhero comic adaptation. But this is Batman, so there should be a bit more depth. Weakest spot of this movie, in my opinion, is cast. I really have nothing against Kilmer, but he is bad choice for this role, especially Bruce Wayne part of it. Riddler is supposed to be comic relief, I presume, but he has too much space in this flick and takes over position of main villain, and for that he is too ridiculous. Carrey simply should not be in Batman movie. His overacting and mop and mow is simply too much. It's terribly irritating and it spoiled overall impression of the movie. That kind of clowning is acceptable in Mask and similar comedies, but Batman is not and should not be a comedy. At the other hand, Jones, who should be main villain and whose character has dark depth, here it's not shown serious enough and he stays in shadow of the Riddler. Highlights are Chris O'Donnell, whose character is well written and performed, and Nicole Kidman, who's always welcome spice in any movie. I'm not disappointed, but it could have been done much much better.\n\n7/10"

Chris O'Donnell as Robin, well, did an okay job. The villains of the movie were absurd. Joel Schmuck-er tried what Jack Nicholson/The Joker has set as precedence for villainy and ruined it. Why was the Riddler a maniac? Why did they let Jim Carrey dig into his bag of tricks so much? This isn't the Riddler. I can understand that's Carrey's paycheck right there, his physical antics, but less of it please for crying out loud. I mean how many times can you shape and twist your face into inhuman expressions in a movie? This isn't a blasted comedy. Well holy dogsh**, I guess Joel said it is a comedy. Two-Face is Two-Face because Tommy Lee Jones plays it. WTF? Does that mean good-bye script? I guess the only directing tip to Mr. Lee Jones was, forget the real history of Batman and his foes, here's your chance to be zany!\n\nBatman Returns became silly with awkward moments. Batman Forever took it a step further by giving sillier one-liners and transforming Gotham City from the city it was to the Las Vegas it will be. Change is good but not for the worst. This film is an okay to watch for entertainemnt value simply because we're being thrust at with new if not corny ideas from Joel's little mind and thats where it scores decent.

        "review_detailed_main": "When it seemed everyone and their mother complained of the adult material in Batman Returns, it's dark tone, the sexual references, the grossness, (both box office and nature), Warners were quick to change direction of the Batman franchise. When Burton dropped out into a producer role, (how much impact he had on the final film I do not know), Joel Schumacher was brought in as replacement, with the task to make it more easily accessible to kids, and more light hearted. Upon hearing this Michael Keaton also dropped out, meaning the new director needed to sought out a new Batman. In steps Val Kilmer into the cape and cowl. A decent actor, and more in line with the physicality of Bruce Wayne, would seem on paper to be a deft replacement. But it's what was actually on paper, that let his performance down. Everything about this film is a direct contrast to the earlier entries. No longer adopting a broody dark atmosphere, it instead adopts a lighter, more \"heroic\" approach. Gothic architecture also scrapped, in its place a neon drenched super city, utilising far more special and visual effects than maybe the first two films combined. It suffers from this however, the city never feels lived in anymore, just vast and bright, empty. It also looks computer-y in some scenes, namely the exterior of the circus shot, which doesn't help in drawing people into that world. Everything about this film is weaker than the earlier entries, which is mainly down to the script. It's widely known there is a darker cut of the film with 40 minutes extra, and it is known to have a darker first draft script, probably when Burton and Keaton were both still attached. I NEED to see this directors cut. I feel it would completely change the film's legacy and reputation. But the shooting script is somewhat disappointing. Making a great actor in Tommy Lee Jones, (replacing Billy Dee Williams), perform as a mixture of the Joker and channeling his co-star Jim Carrey. (There is a well known serious conflict of personalities between the two during filming.) I feel if the character were more true to its comic origins, Jones would have been an excellent Two-Face. Clearly Carrey has been cast to just be Jim Carrey with his Riddler, I feel he is one of the highlights of the film however, although he quite have easily, and more effectively, been a good choice for a darker take on the character also. Nicole Kidman is the sexed up love interest, Chase Meridian. She spends much of the film in a permanent state of lust, and doesn't actually bring anything to the film other than her insane attractiveness, and that's it. Chris O'Donnell is brought in as Dick Grayson/Robin, but his age does suspend belief in the majority of his scenes where he's clearly supposed to be someone of college age. Again it's mainly the writing and the crafting of the character, as opposed to his performance, that drags it down. Interesting to think how Burton would have tackled the character. Danny Elfman is also absent, in his place is Elliot Goldenthal, whose score doesn't compare with Elfman's even remotely. But it's solid enough for the film, and does feel more light and heroic. More kid friendly. Which is what the film succeeds in. It's far more kid friendly, in every aspect, but it pays a terrible price for it which drags the film down. There are elements of a good Batman film in there, but it's not enough to even be compared to its two brilliant predecessors. It doesn't even feel like it belongs in the same universe as them, could easily be seen as a reboot. It's an entertaining film, definitely. The plot, as daft as it gets sometimes, moves quickly, and the whole film works, as a film. As a Batman film, it doesn't even hold a candle to the first two. What this film led to two years later is catastrophically worse, and although the cracks started showing in this entry, at least it never got to to the levels of Batman & Robin..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Introduction:\n\nBatman Forever is an okay superhero film. Many might hate it, but I think the hate is so undeserved. It's silly, I agree. Tommy Lee Jones is awful, I agree. It's not as good as some other Batman films, I agree. But I still like it, it's kind of like my love for the Raimi Spider-Man trilogy, it knows it's dumb. And it decides to embrace the silliness.\n\nWhy I Like It:\n\nI always found it hypocritical that people love the Adam West series, even though it's just as silly as this movie. And, am I the only one that likes the silliness? It establishes itself as silly from the first line, in the infamous moments, where Alfred asks Bruce as he's about go out for a night of crime fighting. \"May I interest you in a sandwich?\" and Batman says, \"I'll get drive-thru.\" People rage over this moment. But when it's done in the Dark Knight, with Batman saying a witty line, no one cares. And while I love the Dark Knight, if people are gonna criticize Batman Forever, for something the Dark Knight did as well. I have to point that out. And even the, Batman Forever still has dark imagery, people always forget about those. But the film does have silly imagery for kids, and dark imagery for adults.\n\nI also hate that Joel Schumacher gets so much hate for this film. When he made Phone Booth and The Lost Boys, two great films, possibly even some of the greatest of all time.\n\nI also like all the characters, as they feel like they were perfectly adapted from the comic book. The Riddler, even though he wasn't a perfect adaptation, was based on a version from the comics. Something many people might not know. And I just love the over the top performance from Jim Carry, who really injects new life into the character. While I don't think he's as good as the version in the show Gotham. Gotham is my favorite Batman adaptation, so it's pretty stiff competition. I also think Chris O'Donnell's Robin is underrated. Even though he's miscast, as he was a 20 year old man, playing a teenager. But that doesn't mean the performance was bad, and it doesn't mean he wasn't written well. Robin was interesting, as his world was turned upside down after the death of his parents. And you really have an understanding of the character's struggle.\n\nHowever, it's not all perfect. Val Kilmer is rather a little bland as Batman. He's alright, he just doesn't compare to other versions. But the elephant in the room is Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. I think the over the top performance doesn't fit the character. Two-Face should a little more calm and calculative than this.\n\nI also believe the look of the film, is very comic book accurate. And while Gotham is often depicted as a dark, Gothic looking place. There are versions that are a little more colorful. And even the dark looking ones, have color. And this city has so much character to it. Vibrant colors, and excellent sets. What can I say? I think Gotham City looks great.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSo, this only brings up the question, why is it so hated? I think that people hate this film, because it's in the shadow of Batman & Robin. And because that film is so bad, people hate this one as well. I mean, do people remember Batman Forever? You probably don't. and that probably brings up a question. How come I still hate Batman & Robin? Well, because Batman & Robin is too silly, and makes no sense. The two villains want to do entirely different things. One wants to freeze over the Earth, the other wants to cover it in plants. That makes no sense, and those plans contradict each other. Regardless, I think Batman Forever is a good movie, it's an unpopular opinion. But who says I have to agree with what the majority say?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series.\n\nBefore Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age.\n\nThe film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money.\n\nBatman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles.\n\nDirector Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return.\n\nThe script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects.\n\nThe film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films.\n\nBatman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right.\n\nEssentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well.\n\nThere was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success.\n\nIf you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill."

It would get a lot worse with Batman and Robin and make this look a masterpiece by comparison.\n\nAnyway this is where ir started going downhill though because Warner Bros wanted to make it appeal to younger children. They introduced some overly-campy humour. Most of it comes from the films two lead villains, Two-Face and the Riddler. Two-Face is meant to be a tragic and confused character with multiple personalities whereas the Riddler is meant to be an reclusive evil eccentric. Here they behave like naughty little schoolboys. The plotline is ok but a little cheesy.\n\nThe plot involves Batman/Bruce Wayne (Kilmer) struggle with his identities and seeking therapy from beautiful Dr Chase Meridian (Kidman)\n\nAs this occurs, three members of a family of acrobats are murdered by the newly escaped Two-Face, leaving their youngest son Dick Grayson (O' Donnell, who isn't too bad actually) to survive. As a result Bruce takes Dick in and Dick soon finds out who Bruce is. Whilst this is occurring, one of Bruce Waynes disgruntled ex-employees Edward Nygma is creating a successful bussiness of his own and has invented an invention that makes t.v. Programmes become reality for the viewers whilst secretly sucking out bits about peoples private lives from their minds whilst they are in their hypnotic trance.\n\nThe acting is mixed. Val Kilmer makes a good Bruce Wayne but isn't too scary as Batman. Nicole Kidman is rather wooden. Chris O'Donnell is okay as the grieving and vengeful Dick Grayson. Jim Carrey is his usual manic self and Tommy Lee Jones is way too over the top as Two Face.\n\nIt's okay but not great."

What we saw as absurd fights staged like batuzi dance contest, he saw it as a continuation of the \"BOOM\" and \"POW\" fights of the originals.\n\nBesides, his colour palette, highly distracting, has been nominated for visual awards. He got big names for this, including Nicole Kidman (who looks quite out of place in this teenish flick). Why were the critics so cold?\n\nMaybe that was because his movie was a follow-up to 'Batman Returns', which was the one Batman movie that striked the perfect balance between noir and fantasy."

Director Tim Burton was replaced by a significant downgrade in Joel Schumacher, a man best known as the guy who ruined the 90's Batman series. This, however, is not the low point of the series. It is clunky and contains some huge gaffs but ultimately isn't too disappointing.\n\nVal Kilmer replaced Michael Keaton as Batman. His Batman is tougher and with less personality. His Bruce Wayne is the same. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd have been much happier not recasting or changing the title character between movies.\n\nThe clunkiness of this movie is what is going to turn off most people. The problems with it are massive. From Batman cracking a safe with a hearing aid in a bank vault filling with acid (why acid?), to a nonsensical Batman diving across a courtroom in a brief TV flashback, to bat nipples, to a random shot of Batman's butt, the movie's problems are often laughable.\n\nIt is Jim Carrey's Riddler that keeps it watchable. His over the top comedic acting fits the role perfectly. In fact I can't quite be sure if Carrey was perfect for the role or if Carrey made the role perfect for him. Either way he was highly enjoyable, and one of the few things I think this previous series has over the newer Batman series. They never would have been able to pull off such a silly villain the way that Batman Forever does.\n\nIf you want to laugh at Jim Carrey, and to laugh at a dozen other huge problems with the movie, go see Batman Forever. Though you might consider fast forwarding through the stuff with Dr. Meridian."

This decision was made basically so they could market the movie as being suitable for a younger audience thus selling more children's toys and action figures. The movie even starts with a scene that was shot as part of a McDonald's commercial in which Batman tells his Butler Alfred that he will get drive through for dinner which in the commercial promoted kids Happy Meals with a Batman Forever toy inside this instantly sets the tone for the movie when the very first line out of Batmans mouth is \"No thanks Alfred I'll get drive through\" after that line you just knew that this was a Batman movie not to be taken seriously.\n\nThe movie stars (Val Kilmer) as Batman who is somewhat okay in the role but he never really added anything of value to the character his performance is still better than (George Clooneys) but then again Kilmer didn't set the bar very high in this movie. The movie also stars (Jim Carrey) as The Riddler. Carreys performance as Riddler is just crazy and whacky as Carrey brings his unique blend of funny voices and physical comedy to the role making for a funny and entertaining Riddler. Also starring in the movie is (Tommy Lee Jones) as Harvey Dent aka Two-Face now before this movie I always saw Jones as a serious actor in movies like The Fugitive and Under Seige but in Batman Forever he's just as crazy and funny as his Co-Star (Jim Carrey) his performance as Two-Face is so over the top and hilarious that you just can't take him seriously even when he's holding people at gunpoint he's cracking jokes it would have been interesting seeing Jones play The Joker in a Batman movie.\n\nBatman Forever was directed by Joel Schumacher but was also produced by the previous Batman movies director Tim Burton who also had a small cameo in the movie. The movie was a financial success making more than Batman Returns at the box office but overall it failed to impress both fans and critics but because the movie was technically a financial success a forth Batman movie was greenlit by Warner Bros again directed by Joel Schumacher the infamously bad Batman & Robin (1997) which almost killed the Batman franchise for good.\n\nI highly recommend watching Batman Forever not because it's a good Batman movie because it really isn't but simply because of how entertaining and whacky this movie is after watching this interpretation of Batman you will begin to appreciate just how good modern day Batman movies are even the bad ones like Batman V Superman."

So why bother, other than an excuse to put an attractive female lead in a movie? Jim Carrey was a corny, Riddler. I just wish they'd gone for homicidal rather than zany. Tommy Lee Jones...did some one forget to tell him that he wasn't playing the Joker? Did he research the part at all? Chris O'Donnell's Robin was just annoying. As you've probably already guessed, my main problem with this movie was bad characterizations (maybe if it had been just Two-Face or the Riddler instead of both it might have had a chance).

Anyway, Batman Forever is a cool, dark but only so-so film that has plenty of action and drama to go around, and enough campiness to choke a horse. There is some drama and chemistry between Val Kilmer as the Bruce Wayne/Batman and Nicole Kidman as the love interest. Plot involves The riddler (Jim Carrey is terrific) who wants to rule the world with brainwaves. He goes to Harvey Dent/Two-face (Tommy Lee Jones) and become a powerful duo. But this time, Batman is not alone. He has the assistance of Chris O'Donnell (yikes) as Robin, but adds drama in the 'will-he-won't-he' manner of agreement to being ready to have a partner. This and other interesting things (i.e. sound-track) make this well done in some respects (least in comparison to the 97 film), but in retrospect from how I saw it as a kid it's... not as good."

But the problems of this film are quite different: the scenography used by Tim Burton was beautiful, here Schumacher opts for a digital, which also for 1995 could be considered horrendous, the plot is rather banal, the script is terrible and disgusting, the Lighting during the scenes is ridiculous, the special effects bad and Val Kilmer is perhaps the most annoyed Batman I've ever seen. Almost nothing is used by the performances of Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey, who, however good, do not help save this poor film. I do not recommend this film to anyone, especially to fans of films directed by Tim Burton. A movie too childish and full of errors, which will touch the bottom in its sequel: Batman & Robin, but of the latter we will talk about in a future review.\n\nMany Greetings."

He was actually an alright Bruce Wayne, and wasn't that bad as Batman. I didn't think Chris O'Donnell was that terrible as Robin, his character was just a little lame. I'm sure Batman fans never wanted to see a movie where a character plays Extreme Laundry. He was just given some really corny lines that just didn't belong. Although I'll admit, I liked some of them. One of the reason I enjoy this movie is the presence of Jim Carrey... who I am a huge fan of. He has a lot of great lines and basically makes the movie a whole lot of fun. Two Face could have been worse, but he also could have been better. As before you won't mind if you are not a Batman fan. Tommy Lee Jones' performance in the movie was not his best.\n\nThis movie fairly camp. Nowhere near as much as Batman and Robin though. This still retains some dark aspects similar to the Burton movies. It's part of what keeps it from becoming awful. I'll give the film some credit in the way it tries to give Bruce some character growth, for example the fact that he is having nightmares about his past, and trying to get therapy over it, and also the fact that he has suddenly become responsible for a rebellious teenage boy. Of course he is also given a love interest, played by Nicole Kidman, who sort of has a Lois Lane story going on.\n\nThe special effects aren't really anything amazing, but far from awful. Basically just standard stuff for 1995. All in all this movie isn't great, but it certainly is not completely without its charms. Worth a watch. It's not faithful to the source, but if you can get past that you may be able to enjoy it.\n\n6.5/10"

Batman is tasked in stopping the crazed genius Edward Nygma from extrapolating brainwaves from individuals who purchased his new television technology, becoming the \"smartest carbon life form in Gotham\".

Its goofiness and absence of thematic purpose harks back to the early comic books where Batman would just simply stop the villain from taking over the world. There is a slight commentary on the increased usage of televisions and how susceptible audiences are, but this is merely an inadvertent afterthought.\n\nWhere I do take issue is how the story is executed. Schumacher is unable to balance all of the characters into one cohesive film. The Riddler and Two-Face are developed enough, with their partnership coming from a mutual agreement. Conversely, Batman and his new found Robin were not developed at all. The chemistry was non-existent and whenever the story is focused on Dick's stupid shenanigans, the pace comes to a halt. It's never interesting.\n\nThere were also a few miscellaneous scenes that made me exclaim how dumb the screenplay was. Riddle me this, Batman. How is it that you couldn't work out who was sending you all those riddles until the very last minute, yet the excessive use of green matched the sudden rise of Nygmatech? I mean, I'm no detective, but it was painfully obvious. A simple revelation, yet badly executed.\n\nNot as bad as some the performances though. Kidman acting as Batman's love interest and O'Donnell as his sidekick were excruciatingly horrendous, with the former having no expressive emotions and the latter just unable to act. Kilmer as the titular superhero has the unfortunate outcome of being half decent. As Batman, his physical prowess within the bulky suit was pretty decent. As Bruce Wayne? Yikes! Terrible in every sense. Again, emotionless right from the start, even with his line delivery. Jones as Two-Face was infectiously enjoyable, just nice to see him not play the typical grumpy sheriff. Carrey provides much of the film's memorability and laughs as The Riddler. However, his portrayal of this villain was ridiculously goofy, and unfortunately all I saw was Jim Carrey instead of The Riddler. Should've been more restrained and less exhausting. Although seeing him in a tight sparkly leotard with pink hair was a sight to behold!\n\nSchumacher's direction is something of an enigma itself. I shan't list all of the issues, otherwise we would be here all day. It's worth mentioning how many angled shots there were. Directors who excessively use this technique, usually don't know what they are doing and attempt to masquerade their downfalls with \"artsy\" Dutch angles. In actual fact, it's nauseating and loses the grand aesthetic appeal from the production design. I mean, Gotham looks absolutely fantastic. But you have to tilt your head constantly to truly take it all in. Be warned, you may get neck pains. The final showdown was a letdown and the stakes weren't really boiling, only just simmering.\n\nBatman Forever may not be the \"punny\" mess that its sequel would become, but you can clearly see the substantial downward step from previous instalments. It's camp, goofy and enjoyably bad. Yet it is just that, bad. A conundrum that not even The Riddler could solve."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has singlehandedly destroyed the Batman movie franchise for any serious fan. Tim Burton's films retained the intrinsic darkness and Gothic setting that Batman needs to make any sense. The film is cartoony; perhaps suitable for a lighter movie on a character such as Superman or Wonder Woman but completely wrong for Batman.\n\nDeconstructing Batman/Bruce Wayne psychologically makes no sense when all that epitomised Batman has been removed. The villains are ridiculously overplayed as the kind of dancing villain you might see in a kiddie's TV show. Two-Face (played by a woefully miscast Tommy Lee Jones) is so departed from his comic-book character as to be unrecognisable. He flips the coin until he gets the result he wants instead of following blindly the coin's \"decision\". Batman is now Val Kilmer, who doesn't nearly fill Michael Keaton's armoured boots. The plot is so contrived as to be ridiculous.\n\nThe Riddler (played wonderfully by Jim Carrey) is perhaps the only good thing about this film but that's not saying much. When you consider that we have seen Jack Nicholson's maniacal Joker, Danny DeVito's calculating Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's sultry Catwoman, you see that the calibre of villains has taken as much of a nosedive as the setting and the scripts.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy this film as light entertainment not intended to provoke any kind of thought in the viewer (what can I say, I'm easily pleased) but cannot bring myself to call it a good film. As a fan of the comic-book Batman I simply can't imagine how Schumacher managed to get away with this travesty.\n\nFor someone who knows nothing of Batman and enjoys a film with action, bright costumes and hammed-up villains, this film is perfect. To anyone else, especially anyone who knows anything of Batman or enjoyed the first two films, STAY AWAY."

        "review_detailed_main": "You may notice that my summary and my score contradict each other as my summary may sound very nasty. But what I mean is that I don't want this character to be Batman forever. The movie by itself is fairly entertaining. Its extremely loud with cheesy action and stuffs that could make an intellectual's brain go crazy.\n\nBut I may pass this movie for its loud action and somewhat entertaining performance by Jim Carrey. But I felt that his character was flamboyant and positively gay. I know that the director was a homosexual himself but that doesn't mean that he'll have to add a lot of homophobic rubbish content in a superhero movie. Its Batman,a straight superhero movie.\n\nI felt that the red hair and the exotic clothes were over-the-top and rather meant for the director's fantasies. I did not find it in Batman and Robin (by the way, that's a horrible movie) but I could spot it in this. Tommy Lee Jones gave an embarrassing performance as Two- face. I also felt that he shared a somewhat homophobic relation with Jim Carrey, you know, the way in which they talked and were close to one another. Tommy Lee Jones was, according to me, a very silly villain and not at all intimidating like Joker played by Jack Nicholson.\n\nVal something was wooden faced. I think the statues in the film would have more expression than him. But as batman, he managed to pull off in this movie. Though I feel that there should be no other movie with him. Again over here, I'd like to tell about the director's hidden homo content : The scene in which they take a close-up of his backside when he tries the Batman suit.\n\nNicole Kidman is wasted. She too tries her best to be wooden along with Val. But at least, Val did not seem to be wasted. She was unnecessary, though charming to look at. I cannot believe she won an Oscar for some movie, on the basis of this movie.\n\nRobin is one of the worst characters in any films. His stupid affinity towards Alfred and cars and bikes Blah, Blah, Blah. I felt that he too should have died in the circus. His pathetic laundry martial arts scene and silly way to make off with the Bat mobile just too woo women seeming like hookers was extremely unnecessary.\n\nWhat this movie lacks in acting department, it makes up with all its action and performance by Carrey, which is very loud and over-the-top, like I said before. I'm going with a 5 for this movie. Its a fairly good action movie to cut your vacation time."

        "review_detailed_main": "After \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns\" made over half a billion dollars combined at the box office, it was clear it wouldn't be long before Warner Bros. green lit a third installment to the Batman franchise. After Tim Burton was released as director...due to the sexuality and violence of \"Returns\" not being marketable enough for big sponsors like McDonalds, Joel Schumacher of \"The Client\" and \"The Lost Boys\" was given a shot at the directors chair. Schumacher was hired primarily for his unique style and ability to balance the light and dark in a film. Michael Keaton decided not to take the reigns as star for a 3rd time around, so he was replaced by Val \"Iceman\" Kilmer. And Robin finally gets his first appearance as batman's sidekick. Here played by Chris O'Donnell, respectively. While the film may be flawed in terms of a few plot holes and a bit of overacting, it stresses a larger point to the Batman legacy, as did \"Batman Begins\". \"Begins\" teaches us why Batman is, and \"Forever\" teaches why Batman will always be.\n\nThe film begins with our hero (Val Kilmer) hunting after his prison-escaped nemesis, Harvey Two-Face (Academy Award Winner Tommy Lee Jones), the once crime fighting D.A. Harvey Dent. After failing to bring Two-Face to justice, Batman faces another challenge in the forms of Dr. Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is week in the knees for bad boys, and Edward Nygma, a maniacal employee of Wayne Enterprises. After Nygma proposes a new device that can allow the viewer of any television program to become one with the show, Wayne refuses, denouncing the idea of mind manipulation. Nygma, now rejected, vows vengeance. After receiving several disturbing letters in the form of riddles, Bruce Wayne engages the help of Dr. Meridian. Bruce, infatuated by Chase, asks her to join him at a Grand Circus, featuring all of Gotham's \"well-to-do\". Whilst there, Two-Face crashes the party, armed with 200 sticks of TNT. Threatening to leave the place in ruins unless Batman's identity is given up, the acrobatic stars of the circus, the Graysons, attempt to stop the bomb. In their gallant attempt, Two-Face executes them. The only surviving son, Dick Grayson, managed to escape that very fate to dismantle the T.N.T. Dick, now alone and orphaned, is taken in by Bruce. Having gone through a similar situation with the murder of his parents, Bruce takes Dick under his wing (forgive the pun). Eventually, Nygma transforms into an alter ego known as The Riddler, and joins forces with Two-Face. After establishing himself as a brilliant tycoon as Edward Nygma with the release of his 3-D Box, he takes advantage of all the images and information being sucked out of Gotham's brainwaves. He would eventually devise a way to read men's minds. Between the Riddler and Two-Face discovering his identity, Chase's infatuation with Batman, Bruce's true love for Chase, and Dick Grayson's wanting to exact vengeance on Two-Face, Batman has his hands full. These conflicts all culminate in a raid on Wayne Manor and then a final battle on the Riddler's Claw island fortress, in which Robin makes his first venture in heroism.\n\nBetween the dazzling special effects, the newly written musical score by Elliott Goldenthal (no where near as effective as Danny Elfman's haunting score, but still damn good), and the new and fresh performance as the Dark Knight/Bruce Wayne by Val Kilmer, this film is sure to please anyone who was disappointed with \"Batman & Robin\" or \"Batman Returns\". My final comments will go to the cast. While Kilmer was effective as Batman, giving us something both new and something we have seen in Michael Keaton's portrayal, I was surprised to see how well he fit into the role. His voice, his body movements, and especially his billionaire, corporate C.E.O. version of Bruce Wayne that Keaton had not shown us, are all pluses for his performance. Tommy Lee Jones was only given one side of the personality of Two-Face. Thus giving us a wildly over the top, hot headed, but ultimately cool Two-Face. From the first shot we see him to the final confrontation between he and the dynamic duo; Jones gives to Two-Face what Nicholson gave to the Joker, an unrelenting dose of delicious evil. Jim Carrey was the ultimate choice for the Riddler. His tall, thin structure and extraordinarily comical body movements gave the Riddler what Frank Gorshin had done in the 60s with the same character. From the twirling of his golden , question-mark-topped-cane, and the skin tight green suit encumbered with jet black question marks, Carrey proves one of the best of Batman's on screen adversaries. Kidman was sexy and refreshing. But, if people think Two-Face is over the top, try a criminal psychiatrist who is turned on by \"the wrong kind of man\". I kind of buy it, but over all I thought the best part of her character was when she decided to grow up and fall for a normal man (if you consider Bruce normal). Chris O'Donnell did hear what he should have followed up in \"Batman & Robin\". And that is to keep the bad boy image going, and abandon any Burt Ward impersonation. Luckily enough, Burt Ward is no where to be found in this film. This film shows us why Batman will always be, as \"Batman Begins\" showed us why he is. Wayne in \"Begins\" confronts what he must become, as Wayne in this, must confront why he must continue. Overall a good chapter in the series.\n\n7.5/10"

He abandoned Tim Burton's Gothic metropolis for a Las Vega-ish carnival with bright, flashing lights. Val Kilmer is, I admit, awful in this movie. He seemed completely dead in his performance. Chris O'Donnel actually puts in a good performance as Robin. (\"Holey rusted metal, Batman!\") While Tommy Lee Jones was just too over the top. He played out more like a Joker. Jim Carrey is funny AND over the top, as usual. He is one of the movies very, very few saving graces. His costume was a tad bit over the top in the finale. Despite their best efforts, they have created a movie that will be shunned forever, by moviegoers everywhere."

        "review_detailed_main": "The third Batman film begins very quickly as the caped crusader (Val Kilmer trying his hardest to fill Michael Keaton's shoes), is called in to save the life of a security guard from the clutches of Harvey \"Two Face\" Dent (Tommy Lee Jones), who is bent on destroying Batman. Batman foils Dent's plans, and enrages Dent even further, so Dent attacks a few more times and during the annual Gotham City Circus, Dent kills the family of a young acrobat, Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell giving us a new kind of Robin). Dick decides he wants revenge. And after becoming Bruce Wayne's ward, he discovers Wayne's secret, and decides that the best way to get his revenge is to become Batman's partner.\n\nMeanwhile, an eccentric inventor (Jim Carrey), who has a hatred for Wayne, goes a little crazy with one of his inventions, and becomes the Riddler. He joins forces with Dent and they plot to reveal Batman's true identity. The original Alfred (Michael Gough) and the original Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle), from the Tim Burton movies, return for this one, with a new love interest for Wayne, Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman).\n\nThe film is visually fantastic. The stunts, the action, the colors and the cinematography are all done quite well. Tommy Lee Jones is good, but a little bit over the top. Val Kilmer does the best he can, considering the circumstances, which didn't totally work. Jim Carrey does make a good Riddler. I was never really worried about that. The film does have a good comic book feel to it and it is great to see a Robin who is not a post-comics code goofball. The chemistry between Wayne and Meridian is good, which compensates for the lackluster Batman performance (mostly from script issues, not really Kilmer himself). Michael Gough, again, is a really good Alfred. Jones' Two-Face and O'Donnell's Robin, even-though portrayed well, had a feeling of wastefulness. They were only used to tie up the loose ends in the film, that the main two characters couldn't finish. There is a finality to Two-Face, that is clearly felt, early on, in the film. You also could tell that O'Donnell's Robin had an enjoyable ceiling, that ended with this film.\n\nThe bat-mobile design for this film was a joke and I missed the old Burton design, because Burton's mobile looked more like a car. The film didn't really grab your emotions and by the time the credits were done, I had all but forgotten the film. When I left the theater after the first two movies, they were all I could talk about for weeks. It was so bad for this one, that I went back to see it a second time, because I thought I missed something. This film also lacked the comic relief moments that broke up the first two films nicely.\n\nI miss Burton's apocalyptic touch to the Batman mythos, because that gave the film an almost electrical charge, which gripped the audience. New director, Joel Schumacher, played up the Adam West look with a cavalcade of colors and shapes, that, to a point, looked really cool, but was bringing down the energy level for what Batman represents, darkness. We are lucky that Burton hung around as a producer for this film, because in some of the scenes we do see some Burton influenced imagery that saved the film from being a loss. The first two films had an emotion to them. They were pieces of artwork, that Burton put his heart and soul into and it would shine on the screen.\n\nWarner Brothers paid too much attention to the movie-going audience, after Batman Returns (1992), left theaters. They were afraid of Burton's dark, apocalyptical vision of the bat. They tried to bring in too much of the Adam West Batman into this film. We have to remember that, the Adam West Batman is gone and has been replaced with a much darker, more modern, vigilante, in the form of the dark knight. Remember, that Gotham City is supposed to be that gothic place where you will find glimpses of the apocalypse. I will recommend this film, because of the fun, action and the amazing visuals, but in respect to the other two films I think it is the worst of the three to this point.\n\n6.3 (D+ MyGrade) = 6 IMDB."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, so Burton was butted out for being too melancholic and dark to the extend that the audience could no longer identify with the characters, so in comes Joel Schumacher, a directer of questionable skill, to bring a more lively feel to the franchise. Well, he succeeded but he also started the beginning of the end for the original Batman franchise. His campier approach to the source material is indeed fun to watch (at least in this installment) and for what it is worth really quite entertaining. You do get the feeling, however, that he had been curbed just a bit so as not to make the franchise succumb into camp and silly one-liners. Too bad the producers didn't continue to hold him back because I, for one quite enjoyed this installment into the Batman series.\n\nMichael Keaton chose not to return as Batman because he wanted to prove that he had the versatility to play something else than Batman. Val Kilmer was cast as the lead instead and wanted to play the character in the same vein as Keaton, with a great measure of seriousness (much to Schumacher's dismay who already wanted to go all out camp) and for what it is worth I actually think Kilmer managed to pull of a reasonable Batman. I don't think he holds a candle to Keaton but an adequate performance. He balances Bruce Wayne out quite a bit and never becomes as manic or as brooding as Keaton was. In light of the obvious return to the camp values of the 60's series Robin was introduced. Not so much to lighten the tone (hardly necessary) but more to give the Bruce Wayne character some new interesting challenge. Chris O'Donnel got the part (ahead of Christian Bale, how weird is that?!) and while not the most talented of actors he is kind of fitting as a sidekick. As the new love interest Nicole Kidman was introduced and she is smoking hot. Her character is really kind of pointless but she serves her purpose as eye candy perfectly. Two new villains are introduced, Two-Face and The Riddler in the forms of Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey is a riot to watch. Not really faithful to the original character but fun, fun, fun. His performance is much in key with what he was known for at the time. Overacting wildly and while he pulls it off, the other villain is not so lucky. Tommy Lee Jones is painful to watch. While Carrey pulls the overacting off Tommy Lee only aggravates and annoys. While Carrey was not really faithful to the original character he still stayed within the limits. Tommy Lee (not really his fault I suppose) completely goes against everything the character stands for in one little scene where he repeatedly flips his coin to get the outcome he wants. Something he stated earlier to be the only true justice. This kind of alteration to the character is just not acceptable.\n\nThe soundtrack is not nearly as catchy as the one in the two previous movies. I guess they really wanted to distance themselves from the original movies and that means that instead of Danny Elfman's brilliant notes we have to settle for mediocre Elliot Goldenthal's only acceptable score. The score is bombastic like Elfman's but it has no charm and is not a score you will hum to yourself once you've seen the movie. Much in key with the soundtrack the sets have been revamped into a neon-filled neo-noir style which is appropriate given to tone of the film but it is just not as interesting to watch as Burton's Gothic version. The neon lights are used excessively in one scene in particular which just comes off as ridiculous.\n\nThe action is decent, not as tense as in the original movies but fairly entertaining. The action was dumbed down quite a bit and some more or less ridiculous sound effects were added but they were fun to watch. Now I'm not saying that Michael Keaton had the perfect physique to play Batman but they film makers had the good sense not to let him show of his torso in full screen. They do this in one scene where you can quite obviously tell that Kilmer's physique was inferior to Chris O'Donnel's. I'm not a film maker myself but I'm pretty sure something like that will ruin the credibility of a man who is supposed to be able to fight something like fifty people when his sidekick is stronger than him.\n\nAll in all Batman Forever is not an excellent let alone even a good film. The direction is lacking and some of the characters were obviously miscast. But somehow I cannot bring myself to hate this movie (like I hate Batman & Robin - worst movie, no wait, worst thing mankind has ever created) because it is so much fun and make no pretension of being otherwise. Val Kilmer is solid and one half of the villains is fun to watch. I did/do, however, dislike the general direction the franchise took with this movie and its sequel proved to be everything a movie is NOT supposed to be.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Where to start with this trainwreck? It was so awful. Tim Burton made 2 enjoyable Batman movies that had the right balance of being serious and being pulpy. WB got greedy and didn't like the more dark style Burton infused his movies with despite it suiting the property well. It wasn't really too dark but it wasn't as easy to sell toys with either. So they decided to fire Burton because he refused to make a garish and overly campy piece of trash like this so they brought that hack Joel Schumacher in to make movies that had the top priority of selling toys over being anything resembling good Batman movies. This was an utter farce and is practically unwatchable anymore. Val Kilmer was robotic and stiff and wasn't good as Batman or Bruce Wayne. Michael Keaton was WAY BETTER. I don't blame him for quitting. I'd probably rather quit than star in an utter travesty like Forever. Jim Carrey was playing Jim Carrey in an utterly ridiculous spandex onesie with ? Marks emblazoned all over it in case you forgot he was the riddler and Tommy Lee Jones was bad as Two Face. He was imitating Jack Nicholson's Joker rather than playing Two Face and the rubber prosthetic was extremely embarrassing. Robin in this movie was grating and made an already terrible movie worse with his incessant whining and stuck up attitude. The pacing of this movie was glacial and the storyline was stupid and boring. This movie and Batman And Robin are among the worst superhero movies ever made and are an total insult to the Batman series. WB should've been ashamed for these 2 utter embarrassments."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK I am writing this in retrospective, but this movie is still the best of the Batman series. We have now had 4 different Batmans (Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney and Bale) and 6 movies. This movie was the complete package, solid story, plenty of action and brilliant bad guys.\n\nBe honest before you rate my review\u0085in EVERY Batman movie we have rated it by the quality of the villain. And Jim Carrey as Riddler was the best rendition of a comic book villain. (The Joker movies had impressive acting but took Joker way out of scope) As a bonus they threw in a good performance from Tommy Lee Jones and nice little parts for Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar. Kilmer does a low key job as Wayne and Batman, which is what Batman is SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. Hey even Chris O'Donnell as robin only added to the comic color pages. Top it off with the best song in any of the batman movies, U2 \u2013 Hold me thrill me kiss me.\n\nAction is fantastic, filming is rich and colorful (not just looking like it was filmed in a basement). Batmans toys were used and seen when needed\u0085not just talked about like in other movies.\n\nOf all the Batman movies this is the one I find myself watching the most. It also has fantastic action without seeming wimped down. It is still safe for kids 10 and older. Well worth owning."

        "review_detailed_main": "When Heath Ledger died, Jack Nicholson said he \"warned him\" this would happen and then made up a lie about how playing the Joker takes you to dark places and does things to your mind. Now just seeing his flat out stupid performance as a thing named The Joker in Batman 1989 and knowing Mark Hamill turned out just fine, you'd know that's a load of bs. Even more so if you know anything about acting.\n\nIf I were to believe ANY role could have possibly broken the mind of the actor playing it, though, I'd say it was Jim Carey's Riddler in this movie.\n\nI don't even know how to put in words how much this movie was a constant assault to all of the senses. I'm not just talking about Aristotle's five. I mean. Every. Sense. Or how over the top crazy it is from start to finish. Or how even though I've hated this movie for my entire life, rewatching it made me realize I didn't hate it enough.\n\nBut,\n\nBut\n\nI also realized something more unsettling than anything else. There were some actually really good parts. Val Kilmer, I hate to admit, did a really good job and probably deserves an oscar for that feat. Furthermore, there's this really powerful scene in The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel where there's a flashback of young Bruce Wayne falling into the bat cave for the first time and seeing the bat fly toward him and feeling as though he was just chosen by some massive force or eternal deity. And there's a shot-for-shot line-for-line perfect recreation of that scene in this movie. FOR NO REASON! It has no right to be that good! The animated adaptation of TDKR didn't even do that. Tim Burton sure as heck couldn't do that. But Joel Shumacher did it in his worst movie and I'm furious."

The results however are anything less than stellar. The worst aspect is the script as the characters are only barley developed with the love story between Bruce Wayne and chase meridian coming across as a couple of teenagers flirting at a party. The motivation of two face is also very weak as we do not really understand why he wants to kill batman and he is given no other goal making him seem more of an excuse for a villain until Jim carrey shows up. The Riddler is slightly better as he is at least given a slightly interesting. His obsession with Bruce Wayne almost makes him seem like a gay rapist. This potentially could be interesting but unfortunately it is only given a few minutes of screen time before he becomes essentially ace Ventura in green spandex. The acting is also poor Val Kilmer Chris O'Donnell and Nicole Kidman all look board whilst Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones both embrace themselves with ridiculously over the top performances. The direction is also poor with an overuse of neon and Dutch angles making the film feel like a disco. The accompanying music and sound effects coupled with the visuals creates an obnoxious style that even Michael bay would object to. The CGI also has aged poorly and as a result makes a the film feel almost fake. However the film is awful in an enjoyable way with the Jim Carrey scenes in particular being so ridiculous that they will likely get a laugh out of the viewers. Overall the film is laughably bad and it is weird to think that a major studio released the film as given the seriousness of modern batman movies it is a wonder why anyone ever see this film as being a legitimate batman film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like Warhol's famous \"fifteen seconds of fame for everyone\" remark, eventually, all Hollywood actors will play Batman. In this film it is Val Kilmer's turn. This time he gets a new girlfriend and a new sidekick, Dick Grayson (played by an ever so wooden Chris O'Donnell). Actually, I am probably being a bit unfair on O'Donnell who does turn in an acrobatic and workmanlike performance \u0096 but he is just a bit bland.\n\nAfter all the Gothic doom and surreal gloom of Burton's take on the Batman character this film is definitely lighter in tone, with some nice touches of humour and a bit of colour. Batman has acquired a new girlfriend as well; Dr. Chase Meridian played with sultry effectiveness by the ever-beautiful Nicole Kidman. Kidman's character is a psychiatrist who is an expert in split personalities \u0096 which is handy given that both villains suffer from that very disorder.\n\nAnd the film's principle strength is the two villains for the price of one: Jim Carrey as Edward Nygma \u0096 the Riddler (e-nygma \u0096 geddit??) and Tommy Lee Jones as the deranged Two-Face. Both performances are wildly over the top with huge amounts of scenery chomping going on but they are good value for money. The \"riddles\" hark back to the heady days of Frank Gorshin's take on the character in the 60's TV series\n\nI am not going into the plot here \u0096 it's almost throw away; needless to say that both dastardly villains want Batman dead for different reasons. The story flits about and there are plenty of strands to keep you occupied but the direction is solid and linear and there some nice romantic triangles in which to indulge yourself involving the Bruce/Batman/Chase relationships.\n\nSchumacher's directorial take is a very different one to Tim Burton's and, as I previously mentioned, he has brought a lighter tone to Gotham. It feels more like a real city than the dark fantasy world of the previous films. As far as Kilmer is concerned; he makes a better Bruce Wayne than Keaton but under the cloak and mask \u0096 it could be anyone.\n\nA 7 rating for an entertaining couple of hours."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tim Burton had great success with his first Batman film. Then came Batman Returns and many people, not without reason, complained the movie was too dark. The studio agreed and decided that going forward they wanted a more family-friendly Batman film franchise. Exit Burton, enter Joel Schumacher. The result? Disaster. Batman Forever is as abominably awful as movies get. It's like the campy television series. Except the TV show was fun because everyone involved in making it knew it was a joke and was in on the joke. Schumacher is actually serious with this pile of film excrement. This really is his vision of what Batman should be. It would be impossible for that vision to have been any more misguided.\n\nMichael Keaton had the good sense to walk away when Burton left the director's chair so we've got a new guy in the Batsuit. A Batsuit now complete with Bat-nipples by the way. Seriously, Joel? Nipples? Anyhow Val Kilmer's the new Batman and he's actually not bad. Unfortunately he's overshadowed by the actors playing the two villains. There's Jim Carrey as Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Carrey and Jones spend the entire movie engaging in a competition to see who can overact the most. This is a competition in which there are no winners, only losers with us unfortunate audience members the biggest losers of all. You sign up Carrey to play Riddler you know you're going to get an absurdly over the top performance, that's who Carrey is. But Tommy Lee Jones what on Earth were you thinking? When right at the film's start you see Two-Face hopping up and down and giggling like a schoolgirl when he thinks he's killed Batman you know this character and this movie are headed to some truly awful places. Two-Face isn't menacing, he's a joke and an unfunny joke at that. OK, the studio wanted a more family-friendly movie but come on now this is ridiculous. Oh by the way, if this movie wasn't cheesy enough I have one word for you. Robin. Everything about this character fails so miserably I don't even know where to begin so I'll just ignore him best I can and move on.\n\nThe dark and gloomy Gotham we saw in the first two movies Schumacher has turned into some kind of Day-Glo amusement park attraction. Schumacher's Gotham comes complete with a band of face-painted, neon-wearing toughs whose weapons of choice are apparently glow sticks. The look of the movie is so completely wrong. The tone of it misses the mark entirely. The story is absurd and not at all compelling. Some of the acting is as bad as any you will ever see. Carrey and Jones are terrible but a special mention too for Joe Grifasi who in playing a bank guard taken hostage in the opening scene delivers one of the most cringe-inducing performances you will ever see. He plays the damsel in distress part wonderfully. Only problem is he's not a damsel. Impossible not to laugh at this guy. Will Batman save him? Who cares? Give Kilmer credit for if nothing else coming through this movie with his dignity intact, no small feat with all the nonsense around him. Nicole Kidman's not bad playing the requisite love interest and Michael Gough is always a treat as Alfred. Everyone else involved in making this movie should hang their heads in shame. There are so many awful things about Joel Schumacher's Batman movie. Perhaps the most awful thing of all? They let him make another one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman Forever stars Val Kilmer, Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jim Carrey and is directed by Joel Schumacher. After Michael Keaton and Tim Burton left the project with Tim Burton still staying on as producer Joel Schumacher took up the reins. And Joel Schumacher has directed some great films like Flatliners, Falling Down, and the Lost Boys. And his new vision of Batman feels like your going on some weird acid trip that's very colorful, campy, and flamboyant. Its like Joel Schumacher took inspiration from the 1960s Batman and decided to make it his own, but he didn't take it seriously as the 1960s Batman did. Granted the 1960s Batman was campy and cheesy when it first came out, but even that took Batman and the villains seriously than this confusing movie. I will say that Val Kilmer was the perfect choice for Bruce Wayne as Batman, but they need to work on his dialogue as well as his portrayal instead of making him into a lovesick puppy. Your Bruce Wayne you can get any girl your heart desires don't make Nicole Kidman your own and only love when you had Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle. We also have Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face and Jim Carrey as the Riddler. Even their portrayal and costume design needs some work as the costumes look like someone in the costume department couldn't afford the costumes they were going for so they ran to the nearest Party City or Hot Topic and threw it on almost anything in the movie without a second thought. And both Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey felt like one big competition of who could act more crazy, zany, and insane where the winner is clearly Jim Carrey and if you get into a competition with Jim Carrey you're going to lose. Jim Carrey was the perfect choice as the Riddler, but I wish Joel Schumacher took inspiration from the animated series or the 1960s Batman instead of Jim Carrey acting like Ace Ventura on speed and offer smart intellectual riddles instead of riddles that a monkey could figure them out. So in the end I would say Batman Forever is a guilt pleasure in the Batman franchise that is enjoyable to watch, but needs some work in the costume and the screenplay department."

Bats also finds the time to acquire a new love interest in Chase Merdian, played by the lovely Nicole Kidman.\n\nThis film has a bad reputation thanks to it's immediate sequel but the truth is, the film is not horrible but it certainly is a step down from the first two films. Kilmer is alright but seems a little lost as Batman. Tommy Lee Jones is bland while Jim Carrey does a typical fine job. My only wish is that Jones had played straight man to Carrey, that would have been a nice contrast between the two villains.\n\nThe visuals and cinematography is impressive but the score is a tad too whimsical. Danny Elfman's score was sorely missed for me personally. I also wish there had been more of an emotional connection between the audience and the characters which had been done so well in the second film but wasn't done at all here.\n\nOverall, \"Batman Forever\" is entertaining but nothing special."

Val Kilmer just seems like he should be on a beach somewhere with the frat boys. I just didn't think he was right from the start.\n\nBatman and Robin was even worst. The script should have been burned right after it was written. Although have you ever placed an actor in a role someone else did and thought he would have been a good choice. George Clooney is this guy. Had he played in the first two I think he would have been great. Clooney plays a great dark character role, ie Dusk til' Dawn, and Tim Burton would have brought that out.\n\nBatman Begins is a different story. At first I felt like I was watching the Last Samurai, I guess because of the way it was filmed compared to the earlier versions of Batmans, that seem like they took the comic book and put it on the screen.\n\nChristen Bale's Batman has a cockiness and swagger about him that shows to much. With Keaton it was a feeling, he didn't really show it, but he knew it and the audience knew it also. But I will have to say I did like Bales performance.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Batman Begins was, if not better than the first, better than the second to me."

The Caped Crusader (now played by Val Kilmer) tries to defeat his enemy Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones). Later on, he tries to defeat the Riddler (Jim Carrey); he defeats the Riddler because of knowing that he is the man he worked with named Edward, who could read your mind with his brain waves device. Bruce even falls in love with Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman)--though, he also realizes (near the end) that a circus performer (Chris O' Donnell) is going to become his new partner named Robin."

        "review_detailed_main": "But I consider this to be the best Batman movie. Well, to tell you the truth it was the very first one I watched, as I wasn't much of a Batman fan before. But when I learned Jim Carrey was playing the Riddler, I knew I had to see it. But I'm not just a fan now just because of Carrey, because overall this is a good super hero flick! Sure, the new Nolan movies are pretty good since they're expressing Batman in the dark nature he's supposed to be presented in, but you can't blame Schumacher for wanting to have a little fun with Batman (although I will admit he took it too far with Batman & Robin. What was the deal with that Bat credit card?). Val Kilmer, although not Michael Keaton at all, is still better than Clooney as Bruce Wayne/Batman (Clooney was just the guy from ER in a Bat suit, that's all!), does what he can with the role, and does pretty well. Although I've never been a fan of Robin, Chris O'Donnell presents the role very well, making me actually care about him. But the villains steal the show here. Carrey as the Riddler? Just plain rocks, that's all I can say. Tommy Lee Jones is normally a serious actor while the character of Two Face is normally a serious one, but Tommy has a lot of fun portraying this character and so do I!\n\nAnd the other thing I enjoy about this is how well it balances the darkness and the humor. Batman should always be dark, (OK, we'll cut the Adam West show some slack) as he became that way because of the murder of his parents and same way with Robin. The scene where Bruce stands in front of the picture of his parents with the flashbacks of their deaths really stands out. And same way with Dick Grayson, with his wanting revenge on Two Face (what happened in the next movie, Chris?). Schumacher is pretty damn good when it comes to mixing these elements together (Lost Boys, anybody?)\n\nSo while it is not Batman Begins (or the Dark Knight, which I know will be awesome), give it a break since it's not Batman & Robin"

Poor Tommy Lee Jones, as Harvey Two-Face with the acid-enhanced complexion, is completely overshadowed by Jim Carrey's dizzy Riddler. Val Kilmer slips into Michael Keaton's batsuit, complete with nipples, without causing any major ripples. He has a little more sex appeal, so the scenes with Nicole Kidman, as the come-hither psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian, have some resonance. She calls it as she sees it when she says \"I could write quite a paper on a grown man who dresses like a rodent.\" He still calls women \"chicks\" too, Doctor. Batman finally gets his Robin this time out in the person of Chris O'Donnell. Robin is a high-flying trapeze artist who is orphaned when his entire family hits the circus floor without a net, thanks to Two-Face. He wants revenge, certainly, but wouldn't turn down a chance to drive the Batmobile as the designated sidekick. There's little homoerotic subtext, though one critic sniped that, with his haircut and pierced ear, Robin looks as if he's on his way to an Act-Up meeting. What about the Riddler, who could be on his way to Wigstock in his glittery, clingy bodysuit topped off with a diamond tiara? Carrey mugs it up and is over the top as usual, but still manages to make us laugh. Loved Michael Gough as Alfred the unflappable bat-butler, but Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar, as the two \"chicks\" Sugar and Spice, tend to get lost in the elaborate set decoration. Batman Forever does deliver your money's worth."

        "review_title": "Batman Forever is one giant riddle!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The most famous line from this Batman movie in my opinion would have to be when the Riddler says `Riddle me this, riddle me that, who is afraid of the big black bat?' In fact, this movie is full of one liners such as this and can be bagged for doing so. But why dwell on the bad things in a movie full of fun and mischief.\n\nIn Batman Forever, the Caped Crusader battles a devious duo in Two-Face and The Riddler, while attempting to resist the advances of sexy psychologist, Chase Meridian. Former circus acrobat Dick Grayson, his family killed by Two-Face, becomes Wayne's ward and Batman's new partner, Robin the Boy Wonder.\n\nAgain the baddies in this film make a huge impact on the audience. They did on me. Jim Carrey was brilliant as the crazy prankster, The Riddler. His wit and true genius came through in this role. This role was not unlike the role he portrayed in the 1994 smash, The Mask. I loved that film. Considering this film was made one year after the Mask, Carrey steps out of one movie and into another no trouble at all. The films that Carrey has done later on in his career have made more people in the movie industry stand up and take notice. Man On The Moon and The Truman Show showed us the true talent of Carrey. But other people might have the opinion that Carrey was over the top in his role of the Riddler in Batman 3. Like Jack Nicholson as the Joker in Batman, Carrey steals the show. So who is the main character in the Batman films? Batman? I don't believe so!\n\nThe other baddie in Batman Forever is Tommy Lee Jones. Jones took on the role of the scarred and evil Two-Face, aka Harvey Dent. Jones portrayed this character very well. The start of the film was pretty good, with Two-Face causing havoc in Gotham. I say this role could have been better if the audience could have seen more into what happened to Dent as the Gotham District Attorney and how he turned into the evil man he was. Jones has done some impressive films in his time. Films like Men In Black, Us Marshals and Volcano were all favourites of mine, thanks mainly to Tommy Lee Jones. One of his latest films which I did enjoy was Rules Of Engagement, a terrific courtroom drama movie co-starring Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nTaking on the role of Batman in third film was Val Kilmer. I have nothing against Kilmer as I feel he is a good actor, but he is not as good as Michael Keaton. Then again it would be a hard role to find the correct actor for. Every time I watch this film, I hope to find Keaton jump onto the screen as the Dark Knight. But Batman's partner Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell, was casted perfectly in this role. After watching the first Batman movie, I heard that the role of Robin could be going to Michael J. Fox. As good as Fox would have been, I'm glad O'Donnell was given the chance to do this role. The Aussie taste in this film was good to see. Of course I am talking about Australian actress, Nicole Kidman, who was Dr Chase Meridian. I loved the relationship that the beautiful doctor first has with Bruce Wayne, then with Batman. I want to say that I feel sorry for Kidman and former Husband Tom Cruise. The pressure that must be placed on a relationship in this kind of industry must be harsh. I hope that everything works out in the end for both parties.\n\nThis film was directed not by Tim Burton, but Joel Schumacher this time around. As spectacular as this film looks, I believe Burton gave us a better feel to what Batman should be. Dark and Gothic. Yet, Schumacher made this film too light and colourful. Gotham City was nowhere near what it was meant to look like in my view. Schumacher turned the Dark Knight into what I would say is the 'Bright Knight!'. Schumacher overall did a good job, but he didn't capture what Batman is all about.\n\nOne part of this film which I did enjoy was the soundtrack. With performers such as Seal, U2 and The Offspring making quite a CD. My favourite song on it would have to be Seal's 'Kiss from a rose'. The vehicles in this film were very impressive. The new Batmobile (which I have seen up close) was magnificent. Also the Batwing, Batboat and Batsub all look good in this film. The Batcave was ok, but has nothing on the caves in the first two films. I must say that the storyline with the Riddler blowing up the Batcave was alright.\n\nI was on holidays in 1995 when I got to see Batman Forever in the Cinema. My first impressions of this film were that it was well done. One day on this holiday, I happened to be on a bus and the driver said he had watched this film and pointed out a fact which I never considered, that Batman never kills any of his enemies. This film is a prime example of that. I don't know which way to go on Batman Three. The storyline is at times very corny, yet it also has some excellent fighting and robbery scenes, with the brilliant Carrey stealing the limelight. But the Batman franchise was starting to get thin by 1995. These movie reviewers don't agree though:\n\n`A Stunning Extravaganza' - Dave Kehr, New York Daily News\n\n`The Best 'Batman' yet.' - Pat Collins, WWOR-TV\n\nRating: 4 Stars or 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "And so the franchise machines goes on. The studio didn't want Tim Burton back to continue infecting their movies about an orphaned child who grew up to beat up criminals in costume with gothic darkness, so they brought in Joel Schumacher to lighten up the affair. The leaving of Burton caused the departure of Michael Keaton as well, and Val Kilmer was cast in his place. So, what did Warner Brothers manage to get produced here? Essentially a confused toy commercial because the merchandizing scene from Spaceballs was pretty much how studio executives learned to think through the 80s and 90s.\n\nI'll say this upfront: I do not dislike this film because its visual palate is more colorful and its tone less serious. I dislike this movie because its script is a complete hodgepodge of nonsense while the end result film is edited together to make things that shouldn't go together stand right next to each other. I would be very open to a Batman film that took the world and story less seriously with an emphasis on crazier villains for our hero to fight. I don't need my Batman movies to be somber and serious explorations of duality, loneliness, and vigilantism. I could do well with a film that is just another in a series of Batman adventures where he has to put weird villains in Arkham Asylum. That is not actually what Joel Schumacher achieved in Batman Forever.\n\nThe film starts with an audacious action scene where Harvey Dent/Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) sets a trap for Batman in a bank high up on a tower at the center of Gotham. Using lots of neon colors in garish ways, we get our new view of the city in which the Dark Knight stalks. It's an expansion on the gothic designs Burton had put forward in the first two films with huge statues of Greek god-like figures holding up buildings. It's garish, but I can dig it.\n\nThe scene sets for a couple of things. The first is that Two Face wants to kill Batman as his motivation for the film. The second is the presence of Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), a psychologist brought in by the police department to analyze Two Face (she never really does beyond a quick diagnosis in this scene) who develops a quick infatuation with Batman when they briefly meet. The action itself is big, bold, largely nonsensical, and entertaining. I'm okay with this. It's a thin way to start a film, perhaps trying to replicate a certain James Bond-esque action opening in a continuing adventure, but it's fun enough.\n\nThe film makes it obvious that it's a complete mishmash when it introduces Jim Carrey's Edward Nigma. Carrey approaches the part from the start like a maniac, giving him no place to go in terms of his performance. Nigma has developed a new technology that enhances television signals for the viewer. As an employee of Wayne Enterprises, he wants Bruce Wayne, visiting on an inspection, to promise further funding of the project over the objections of his immediate supervisor. Wayne refuses because of the unanswered questions (get it?) about the device's effect on brainwaves. Nigma takes it badly, forces his boss into a human trial that ends with a side effect of Nigma absorbing his brainwaves, making him smarter (how this manifests is never really clear). He kills his boss, fakes the evidence to make it look like a suicide, and then leaves the company.\n\nTwo Face attacks a charity circus where Bruce Wayne has taken Chase on a date, and at this circus are the Graysons, a family of acrobats who work together to move the bomb that Two Face brings (and attaches to a wire that ascends to the ceiling where the Graysons can do it while never bothering to try and leave the building that's about to blow up himself), and the youngest, Dick, is the only to survive when the rest fall to their deaths. Nigma watches this on television and becomes enthralled with the idea of becoming his own supervillain.\n\nNigma figures out where Two Face's hidden base is, somehow, through the use of the Box, his television device. He appears and says that these things on a side table showed him where the place was, but it doesn't seem like anyone's used them yet. Anyway, they decide to team up with the Riddler using his technology to try and figure out who Batman is and then humiliate him before Two Face gets the chance to kill him. The Riddler's motivation is thin, essentially amounting to hating Wayne because Wayne wouldn't fund his research. It works well enough.\n\nAt the same time, there's the only element that feels like it's supposed to be a direct follow up to what came before in Batman Returns, the relationship between Wayne and Chase. Wayne is confronting the ideas from the last movie about having two sides of his life, and he ends up deciding by the end that he can live with both because he chooses to. This supposedly happens through his relationship with Chase, but the stuff is so lost in the noise surrounding it that almost none of it registers. This is a sign of a script driven by executive notes over artistic intent.\n\nThe plot resolves with the Riddler figuring out that Bruce Wayne is Batman, kidnapping Chase, and having a big showdown on his island fortress. It really does feel like a modified concept from a Moore era Bond picture. Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell who looks like he's thirty) gets taken in by Bruce, figures out his secret identity, and then gets a highly custom Robin suit seemingly out of nowhere to help Batman fight. The showdown is as garish and over the top as anything else in the film with knowing nods to the 60s Batman show. It's big and loud and thinly entertaining as spectacle, but what's come before has been so overstuffed with characters, events that never mattered, and plot movements that it's hard to see how there's supposed to be any relief beyond the purely sensory when it all winds down.\n\nSpeaking of random events that don't matter, there's an action scene relatively early that could literally be hard cut out of the film, saving 6 minutes or so, and the film would suffer none at all. Batman is driving around, Two Face and his men approach in cars with guns blazing, Batman gets away. That's it. That's the scene. It includes a bit where Batman uses the Batmobile to climb up the side of a building (in another supposed nod to the television show), but how he ends up getting down is never explained. It's just there, and it doesn't change anything from beginning to end. I'm sure it stayed in because it was expensive, but it really could have just been hard cut and no one would have noticed. In another sequence, the attack on Wayne Mansion that leads to the kidnapping of Chase, the scene is cut and scored in a way to demonstrate danger, but Schumacher let Carrey be Carrey. So, when the Riddler is blowing up the Batcave, everything stops so that Carrey can do a bit pretending that one of his little bat bombs is a baseball and he's a pitcher, complete with sound effects.\n\nAnother thing is that this leaves so much on the table in terms of ideas. At one point, pretty much out of nowhere, Bruce decides that he's done being Batman, telling Dick that he can't do it anymore (it supposedly has something to do with his relationship with Chase), and then the Riddler destroys the Batcave. Is there any contemplation about how Batman is necessary? No, it just continues with hidden toys (I mean, prototypes) as though this were just another adventure story. You don't include the idea of Batman hanging up his cape and cowl if it's just another adventure story.\n\nLike the first two films, this was a victim of executive meddling at an extreme scale in the scriptwriting stage. Several different ideas from different drafts got thrown together without any real concern for what actually worked for the story. There was an effort to appeal more to children and sell toys that overrode everything else. However, you can still make essentially a two-hour long toy commercial that feels of a piece, and this isn't it. I don't know how much to lay at the feet of Schumacher, he was essentially a hired hand to fulfil the wishes of metaphorical children with loaded guns, but it still feels like a Schumacher film through and through. I don't like it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Batman Forever\" represents a shift out of the overdone night world of Tim Burton, ultimately needed. Val Kilmer is a bit better as Bruce Wayne than is Michael Keaton, and as Batman he is more mysterious, a bit more low key, in a positive way (altho still with annoying monotone). This mixes well with the less-overdone darkness, as does the continued theme of a vulnerable Batman, with shrink. Nicole Kidman is a good love focus. Overall, Batman's presence still seems slightly understated.\n\nIt was nice to have Robin included this time, of course. But the introduction of Chris O'Donnell has to be strong, and thus, the show is somewhat stolen from Batman, as it is in various ways in all the Batman movies from 1989 onward. O'Donnell does well, and actually has a more macho presence than Keaton or George Clooney, although Kilmer arguably matches him. Robin is still a youth, like Burt Ward, but a real manly one, and we know the ladies like him.\n\nWhereas Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face is basically solid, no particular comments from me, Jim Carrey as the Riddler was both better and worse. Harlequin, Pantomime. But no, certainly not really the latter, for boy, does he talk! The most full-of-himself Batman villain, far exceeding Jack Nicholson's Joker. Pompous, campy. In fact, as for the latter word, I can think of no villain on the TV series (certainly not Frank Gorshin) that outdid Carrey in that category. Not in either loudness or effeminateness. Clearly, Carrey's performance is strong -- he acts well, he overacts. What am I stating, am I being confusing? Let me put it this way: the acting performance, what Carrey accomplishes, the talent he shows, is great. But as for the effect on the viewer, it gets yecchy, and not just in too much, but too often. Perhaps a metaphor for the problem, and certainly a problem in itself, is the lack of riddles. Give me a break, we need more than a couple of riddles. Instead of more riddles, we get too much of Carrey.\n\n\"Batman Forever\" is livelier than the first two Batmans, and far surpasses the unpleasant Batman II. Batman I is best represented by the great role of The Joker and overall humor that matches or exceeds that of \"Forever,\" but I give \"Forever\" a slight edge."

On the contrary, I have a great soft spot for exaggerated stylization (which, for my taste, is still moderate here compared to the following film)... But here we have a hell of a problem: the script doesn't have any head or tail. Dynamic/chemistry between all the characters is almost non-existent. Val Kilmer doesn't seem like a mentor nor partner next to Chris O'Donnell and isn't at all horny next to Nicole Kidman (btw, I almost forgot she was in the movie), plus Two-Face and The Riddler don't complement each other at all... And then we have the logic/motivation of the characters: It's not clear at all, why should the Riddler be the Riddler and wanted to give any riddles. Apart from the minor annoyance for Batman, who is solving them with ease anyway, they are really not very important. The quiz finale is a spectacular concept, but it's not very well used and nothing really leads up to it. But Two-Face turned out to be the most undeveloped of the whole squad (except for the useless Kidman. I would forget about her again): the script didn't give him any motivation for what he's doing, but it didn't even give him any personality of his own (quite a shortage for a schizophrenic) and it made him just a worse imitation of the Joker and he's only there to give Robin a motivation (not to mention Harvey's ignored relationship with Batman)... Batman & Robin simply has a far more well-rounded script and you can hate the movie all you want. The only thing going for this movie is that it is a tad bit darker and more focused around the bat. So if that's what matters to you... But what a great soundtrack Goldenthal put together. The greatest score of any leathery vigilante movie, imho. Elfman writes great melodies, but Goldenthal writes great music. Plus, I probably like his Batman theme a bit better anyway."

From Jim Carrey's hilarious/insane portrayal of The Riddler, to Tommy Lee Jones portrayal as Two Face.\n\nBatman Forever is a Comic book lovers dream come true. From a lineup of Val Kilmer, Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones, Nichole Kidman. This was the most star studded Batman Film for its time. With a show stealing performance from Jim Carrey, those that were kids in the 90s truly had much merchandise of this Joel Schumacher classic!\n\nWhat's there not to love? Ok. Val Kilmer as Batman is a bit melodramatic. But? Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones simply comes through with some of the best villain work ever in Batman films! You have to admit. This film. Like The Riddlers brain waves. Sucks you in from start to finish! 76/100."

HOWEVER, there are some definite problems, particularly with casting choices and editing. I personally think Val Kilmer does an amazing job as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. I feel Tommy Lee Jones was a terrible choice, and Jim Carrey was questionable at best. Jim Carrey does a good job with what he's given though. Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face as if he's John Larroquette playing the Joker playing Two-Face. I think with a little tighter editing and perhaps pulling some of the film's campier punches, this would have been much more well-respected as an installment in the Batman cinematic multiverse.\n\nI do want to mention Michael Gough plays an EXCELLENT Alfred.\n\nYou would think that a movie introducing ROBIN would be a perfect time to use the title Batman & ROBIN and the FOURTH (and final) in the series would be better titled Batman FORever, but apparently not."

        "review_title": "It's not the best, but it's got Bob's favorite Batman",
        "review_detailed_main": "Of the six actors to play Batman - Lewis Wilson, Robert Lowery, Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney - Val Kilmer was always Bob Kane's favorite. Or at least, Bob Kane, creator of Batman, said that he thought Val was the best choice out of the bunch.\n\nWell, Val Kilmer's Batman has his work cut out for him as he does battle with Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face and Jim Carrey's Riddler. While not battling the two maniacs he's either hitting on - or being hit on by - Nicole Kidman's psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian, or he's trying to persuade Chris O'Donnell's Dick Grayson/Robin that a life of crime fighting is really no life at all (because really he doesn't want other people to suffer through what he suffers).\n\nVal Kilmer is a capable Batman, but given his past performances in \"The Doors\" (which wasn't very good, to be honest) and \"Tombstone\" (which was good) he should have been better, but he does what he can to weigh down this CGI-powered, light hearted romp. Doubtlessly, after \"Batman Returns\" and the creation of the Batman animated series Warner Brothers probably wanted to tone things down a bit, but how they could have gone this far is beyond me. Kilmer's not bad as it is, but if he'd been working with Tim Burton he probably would have been even better.\n\nIt's all a shame really, because this film actually tried to shift focus to Batman as opposed to letting the villains have the lime light. If the film hadn't been so goofy it might have worked, but the film IS goofy and it can't seem to decide if it wants to be serious or self-parody. Without Kilmer in \"Batman & Robin\" it looked even worse.\n\nThe other actors are fine. Jones seems to be having fun in a change of pace role, Kidman is a more believable love interest with a more believable relationship to Bruce Wayne than Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale and O'Donnell is a decent Robin, and of course, Michael Gough as the loveable Alfred. The real disappointment is actually Jim Carrey as the Riddler. It basically feels like he's doing Ace Ventura only as a villain, but it's hard to take him seriously as a villain because, well, he's Jim. Some have complained about the Riddler's flamboyancy in this film, as his behavior occasionally suggests borderline latent homosexuality, and since this was supposed to be a \"kid friendly\" superhero film, that might make some parents question it. Speaking of sexual overtones, how about Nicole getting friendly with Batman (not to mention the scene where she appears naked except for her silken white blanket?).\n\nWell, if you're looking a no brainer, look no further."

        "review_title": "Defending - an underrated favorite comic book superhero of mine science fiction - action of 90's",
        "review_detailed_main": "Why this movie get so much hate? I don't get it and I am going to defend it. Fanboys likes Batman Returns and Batman Begins more I don't, I love Batman Forever to death. This is Joel Schumacher diferent version more action, ligther tone. Better villians than in Returns. It is better portrayed by comic books than Batman Returns is. It is new style by Joel Schumacher in comparison to Tim Burton. Instead of a dark and grey-shadow heavy tone, you will get a variety of color across the board. Batman Forever is my fourth personal favorite Batman film of all time.\n\nYou will see this (literally) when Robin takes the Batmobile out through the city in Chapter 16, a scene which leads to an ally-attack by people who glow-in-the-dark. I am defending this film against haters. To me this better than Returns or The Dark Night Rises.\n\n\"I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?\"\n\nPrevious films show almost no color or the people of Gotham, here the mean-streets come to life under the neon lights. That's the type of color palette will echo again and again, not only in Riddler's orange hair and bright green wardrobe, but with Two-Face, his two-tone suits and purple make-up on his scarred-side of his face. It is an action sci-fi fantasy Rated PG-13 for strong stylized action. Gotham City is lighter now, but it is still a fantasy world so I like it. At least dosen't look like New York like looks in The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nVal Kilmer in my opinion did an excellent job as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He has a lot to do in here, I love his performence as an actor. He is not better than Michael Keaton but he does his job prefessionaly and he acts serious believable. Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian is the best hot sexy babe in this movie. I had crush on her for years. She is MILES way better than Kim Basinger yes I love Kim. I love Vicky Vale a lot but I Love Nicole more. Love Chase Meridian more as batman's love interest. Nicole Kidman is better than Michelle Pfeiffer or Anne Hathaway. Been a huge fan of Nicole Kidman. Jim Carrey as The Riddler was goofy but excellent he really performed professionaly by comic books Edward Nygma. Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent/ Two-Face was a bad-ass, he was the best bad guy I saw. Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson did an excellent performance I love his martial arts style. He was good as Robin, I like him. We have Drew Barrymore as Spice and Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson as the gang leader in here. When you see O'Donnell beating a gang leader that is Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson kickboxing champion. He was payed to get hit by O'Donnell but still a good choreography. Excellent stunts no CGI in here.\n\nThe movie gets hate because it has lighter tone, humor and it is difrent version from Schumacher. I don't care! When this movie come out in 1995 I wanted to see this movie in the movie teather, but my abusive strick father did not want to buy me a ticket or drive me to teather to see this movie, it was my wish and he did not care. So my mom bought me a Sticker Album instead and I collect Stickers. My mom also bought me comic book diferent version from this movie. I still have them both. I read them both every night in my room. 4 years later my parents give the money so that i could rent this movie in the video store on VHS. I loved it than and I enjoy it and love it now. I always enjoyed Batman (1989) and Batman Forever (1995) before Nolan movies come out. Even before Zack Snyder destroyed Batman story arc.\n\nThis time around the fight scenes are much better chorographed for Batman he kicks a lot of asses. The has movie tone's of action. Like Two-Face try's to kill Batman and Batmobil drives on the wall. It has a lot of explosions. Two-Face goons are using automatic machine guns on Batman. Two-Face henchmans weren't goofy like Penquins in Batman Returns. Great visual effects and stunts. Awesome costums for Two-Face, The Riddler and Batman. The movie meantions The Dark Knight it is reference to Batman. Maroney did scare Harvey Dent for life, like in the comic book. Arkham Asylium is also shown in the finale. Batman saves a security guard in the opening sequence. He crashes on Nygma party kicks Two-Face goons asses. He saves those people held been hostages. Batman throws Batarang and destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device. Batman defeats both Two-Face and The Riddler all alone by him self. Saves Dr. Chase Meridian. Batman does a lot more in this movie than he did in Returns. I love that this movie is not set during winter on Christmas Eve like Returns was, it is set on Halloween I prefer fall over winter.\n\nWarner Bros. decide not hire Tim Burton as the director again they hired Joel Schumacher instead and Burton quit this movie. But Schumacher convince him to stay as a producer so Tim did. Michael Keaton wanted to come back the third time, but when he heard Tim Burton is not the director he drop out. The part of Dr. Chase Meridian got Rene Russo from Lethal Weapon 3, but since Keaton left the project Rene Russo was fired because producers felt she is too old for a younger actor and Nicole Kidman got the part and i am glad she did. Nicole Kidman is MILES way times better than Rene Russo. Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones did not get a long. Lee Jones said to Carrey that he hated his movies. I read that Schumacher did not get a long almost with any of the cast except Jim Carrey and yes I have a respeact thowards Jim Carrey he was professional.\n\nThe Dark Knight of Gotham City confronts a dastardly duo: Two-Face and the Riddler. Formerly District Attorney Harvey Dent, Two-Face incorrectly believes Batman caused the courtroom accident which left him disfigured on one side; he has unleashed a reign of terror on the good people of Gotham. Edward Nygma, computer-genius and former employee of millionaire Bruce Wayne, is out to get the philanthropist; as The Riddler he perfects a device for draining information from all the brains in Gotham, including Bruce Wayne's knowledge of his other identity. Batman/Wayne is/are the love focus of Dr. Chase Meridan. Former circus acrobat Dick Grayson, his family killed by Two-Face, becomes Wayne's ward and Batman's new partner Robin the Boy Wonder.\n\nI love the songs in this movie: Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me by U2, Kiss From A Rose by Seal and Smash It Up by The Offspring.\n\nBatman Forever is my fourth favorite film in the franchise I prefer The Dark Knight over this movie, but Batman Forever has special place in my heart I love this movie death it is from my childhood."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw Batman Forever during its opening weekend at the Sony (now AMC Loews) Wayne 8 plex in NJ, I had a great time enjoying it with my dad and stepmom. I even bought the terrible video game and thought how hard it was to beat it despite having mortal kombat moves and graphics from the same developer and publisher. This movie was a big hit during the summer, only to be surpassed by Toy Story at the end of the year. The casting is perfect, with Val Kilmer in his only role as the Dark Knight, with Chris O'Donnell as Robin, who would go on to become Robin again in Batman and Robin, along with Nicole Kidman as Chase Merdian, as well as the guy who played the butler Alfred from the previous two batman movies. As for the bad guys, Jim Carrey is the Riddler and delivers an amazing performance, along with Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, the character of which makes a grand intro in The Dark Knight. Drew Barrymore also plays a role as one of the femme fatales. As for the pacing, it's pretty quick and easy yet a bit campy compared to the darkness of the 1989 batman and its sequel, Batman returns. The soundtrack is pretty good, with u2 and seal providing great songs at the end of the movie. The movie also was one of the first to have a website."

        "review_title": "My eyes! The goggles do nothing.",
        "review_detailed_main": "In terms of production design and cinematography, Tim Burton's adaptation of Batman (1989) is easily one of my favourite films because its combination of gothic, industrial and mobster imagery is absolutely brilliant. The sequel (Batman Returns, 1991) was also a Burton film and despite shortcomings in its plot, it thankfully retained a similar style to the original which helped it immensely. Joel Schumacher took over the series at this point, helming Batman Forever (1995) and its appalling sequel Batman and Robin (1997). With these additions to the series, Schumacher all but spits in Burton's face, blowing off the brilliant visual style of the first two films, and replacing it with ridiculously over-the-top techno sets and a dreadful lighting design that places far too much emphasis on neon lights.\n\nBatman Forever does to some extent retain the dark look of the earlier films - after all, Batman is well known as 'The Dark Knight' and to shoot him in entirely bright surrounds would not be effective. However, as though feeling the need to differentiate his Batman efforts from Burton's, Schumacher turns away from the style mentioned above and creates his own 'New Gotham', featuring outrageous sets that are almost always lit with fluorescent lights and bright colours. Not even the new Batmobile (with it's dodgy-looking dorsal wing that wobbles and bends) is immune to the neon insanity. The style on display here is not nearly as effective as that of the first two films and does not serve the narrative as effectively as Burton's brilliant vision of Gotham.\n\nIt's hard to say whether Val Kilmer is worse in the title role than George Clooney in Batman and Robin; it's a very close call. He gives the gruff Batman dialogue with enough cool toughness to make him an appealing caped crusader, but his portrayal of Bruce Wayne is rotten. His delivery of dialogue is too stiff, and while its obvious he was going for 'Upper-class with a Dignified Air', he instead manages merely 'Dull and Wooden' - he fails miserably in comparison with Keaton. Likewise Keaton's agony over telling Vicki Vale of his double identity in Batman was excellent and beautifully sincere, while Kilmer's similar angst is brushed over briefly by director Schumacher and lacks the sense of fear and anxiety that should be associated with Wayne letting anyone in on his secret.\n\nWhen looking solely at the scripts for the four Batman films, Bruce Wayne is at his most tortured in Forever, and the audience comes closer to understanding his motives, his torture and his misery than ever before. Unfortunately Schumacher's direction mostly fails to give these scenes the sufficiently gentle, yet dark touch they require, and Kilmer's acting serves only to bring them down further. This is an opportunity sorely lost, as it held an opportunity for some wonderful emotive scenes that could have at least dragged the film up to the level of Batman Returns. Still, these scenes are easily one of the film's highlights because they bring more of the Batman/Bruce Wayne conflict to the screen than was managed in any of the other three films. Wayne's relationship with Dick Grayson, who's personal dilemma mirror's Wayne's own is dealt with surprisingly well and is another of the film's strongest elements. O'Donnell puts in a solid performance as Grayson.\n\nNicole Kidman has very little to work with in her role, and the two villains are pretty silly (as if Danny DeVito and his army of rocket-armed penguins in Batman Returns wasn't silly enough) and feature some colourless and uninteresting back-stories. Thankfully, Two Face and The Riddler don't reach the point of becoming absolutely ridiculous - Schumacher was holding that ace up his sleeve for his sequel. Tommy Lee Jones is reasonable as Two Face, but he's got nothing on The Joker (a very similar character) in terms of being a psychotic, bloodthirsty villain. Carrey's Riddler seems a little too much like his zany character in The Mask (1994) and while his screen presence is strong and his delivery of dialogue generally appealing, the character is too over the top. Like Nicholson's Joker he is insane and outrageous, but unfortunately he is also not even remotely believable, and his plot to steal the brain waves of Gotham's residents is just plain stupid.\n\nThe same goes for the set action pieces which, while I'm sure are looking to emulate a comic book's style of unbelievable situations overcome by the hero's power, come across mostly as stupid and contrived. You're looking at the likes of the Batmobile driving up a wall in this film - all up it's pretty dumb. Indeed, Batman Forever is studio film making at its most gross and negligent. \"Here we have two films that did well at the box office, let's make them bigger and flashier with more ridiculous set action pieces and a well known hunk actor and the audiences will come in flocks. Who cares if we're making films that are absolute crap?\" I do, for one. The set action pieces, poor script and casting and new visual style really hurt Batman Forever. Long after my first viewing, my most dominant memories of the film were the overwhelming and off-putting use of bright colours and the stupidity of the brainwaves plot. Not exactly the way directors hope their work is remembered.\n\nPeople often remember the 1980's as a decade that was responsible for many crimes against fashion, particularly for the garish colours that made their mark on the fashion of the time. It's as if the films of the Batman series found themselves in a strange time warp, and the Burton films, a product of the 80's, were stylistically brilliant, while the Schumacher films, a 90's product, found themselves unfortunate victims of 1980's excess and unsightliness."

Why is everything ridiculous? Why can't I believe Val Kilmer is Batman?\n\nThe answer is simple: this is NOT Kane's Batman. It's West's Batman, the Batman that was so corny he was ridiculous, the one with the \"Boom!\" and \"Slap!\" written all over the screen. While Jim Carrey does fit this description, it is such a shame that Mr. Schumacher couldn't quite make up his mind about a couple of things.\n\n1) If you are going to make a \"campy\" movie: forget about the protective suits and get everyone in spandex. Just like the Riddler. 2) If you are going to make a \"campy\" movie: forget every trace of reality. Make the heroes completely invincible, and let them stage uproars on the set. Don't constrain them! (the characters had to be constrained because of the earlier pictures' dramas). 3) If you are going to make a \"campy\" movie: at least make it funny.\n\nThis movie walks the fine line between \"reality\" (whatever that means in a movie\" and foolishness.

        "review_detailed_main": "After Batman Returns got mixed reviews and complaints for being too dark Burton left making a third movie due to Warner Bros. wanting a more family friendly image for Batman. Enter Joel Schumacher who did a whole 180 to look, characters, and overall appeal to the series.\n\nThe story starts with Batman(now played by Val Kilmer) foiling a bank heist planned by former District Attorney Harvey Dent(now played by Tommy Lee Jones) who, after a recent accident involving acid thrown in his face, has renamed himself Two-Face.\n\nAlong with Two-Face, former Wayne Enterprises employee, Edward Nigma(played by Jim Carrey) has turned to crime and given himself the identity of The Riddler.\n\nBut Batman is joined by a new partner himself. After Two-Face killed his family, Dick Grayson(Chris O'Donnell) joins the caped crusader as Robin. Together they must stop Riddler and Two-Face's plans to take over the minds of Gotham.\n\nAnd now let's cut to the chase. While the visual look of the film is interesting sometimes it seems like whoever was in charge of lighting got a little carried away with the red and green. Plus the camera is sometimes shot at an angle and those shots can be good sometimes but when it's overused it's jarring.\n\nThe acting for the most part is good. I liked Val Kilmer as Batman and Bruce Wayne well enough and his love interest Chase Meridian(Nicole Kidman) is all right. But the ones that seemed to either overact or underact were Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O'Donnell. Jones is a good actor usually but with this it felt like he was trying to copy Jack Nicholson's Joker and Two-Face is as far from Joker as you can get. He's tortured and has to deal with two personalities that are the polar opposites of each other. I didn't get that from his performance. Chris O'Donnell for the first part of the film just whined constantly and didn't do much to the plot. He got better by the climax but the first part almost ruined the character for me.\n\nJim Carrey was an up and coming star by this point and acted more like Jim Carrey playing the Riddler than the actual Riddler. He seemed to be more emulating Frank Gorshin's performance from the old series but there were times when I thought it would've been better if he went in a different direction.\n\nBut overall the film isn't terrible and is at least worth a watch. There's some interesting scenes involving Bruce Wayne's back story and there's a pretty funny reference to the Adam West TV show near the end. Not a bad movie but not the best Batman movie.\n\n6.5/10"

For one thing, they made the movie way too kid friendly and campy for the character and that did diminish the emotional turmoil and darkness of the Batman mythos. Another bizarre thing about this film is the design of Gotham City, which was a dark, brooding cesspool of crime and decadence; here it's trying too hard to be like that critically acclaimed sci-fi flick by Ridley Scott. And there was way too much neon. TOO MUCH!!! How can they dilute the Gothic atmosphere of such an iconic, fictional landscape? HOW!?!?! I know it's no use crying over spilled milk but the point still stands. I would've been much happier had Tim Burton been brought back on board as director but Warner Bros, in their quest for dollar signs, decided to make it kid-friendly, sacrificing not only the darkness and complex character emotions from the first two films, but also its artistic merit. The result is a film that has been drained of it's truly compelling qualities for the sake of profit that does nothing for the collective conscience of the intelligence of it's audience.\n\nAll that amounts to what is really wrong with this film. As I look back on it, I realize it's not a good film. Too over the top, cartoonish, colorful, and just plain silly. It's not just the nipples on the Batsuit that plagues this film, it's the writing and screenplay that goes borderline inane and in-cohesive. There's no actual story here; it's just a mash-up of action scenes and quiet moments that try to hammer into the audience that there's' a story, but really it isn't. In conclusion, I'm very GRATEFUL for Christopher Nolan and co for digging the Batman franchise out of it's neon, homo-erotic grave. Batman Forever is a clear departure from the visionary world of Burton's films. Nolan has done much better than what came before."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Batman Forever\" might not be the best movie ever made, but I found it super entertaining and really enjoyed it. Sure, it has its flaws, but there's something about it that keeps me coming back.\n\nFirst off, Val Kilmer as Batman is pretty solid. He brings a different vibe to the character than Michael Keaton did, and I liked his take. And who can forget Jim Carrey as the Riddler? He's over-the-top and crazy, but that's what makes his performance so memorable. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face is also pretty wild, and their combined antics make for a fun, if chaotic, experience.\n\nThe movie's visuals are bright and colorful, which is a big change from the darker tones of the previous films. Some might say it looks too much like a comic book, but I think that's part of the charm. The costumes, the sets, the gadgets - they all have this larger-than-life quality that's just plain fun to watch.\n\nThe storyline is pretty basic and a bit all over the place, but it keeps things moving at a good pace. There's plenty of action, and the fight scenes are exciting. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. I mean, who doesn't get pumped up when they hear \"Kiss from a Rose\" by Seal?\n\nYes, the movie has its cheesy moments and some of the dialogue is kind of corny, but that just adds to its appeal for me. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and sometimes, that's exactly what you need from a superhero movie.\n\nIn the end, \"Batman Forever\" might not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's a lot of fun. It's the kind of movie you can watch with friends, laugh at the over-the-top parts, and just have a good time. I really liked it and would definitely watch it again."

It's kinda nice to see Batman with two enemies not just one, 'cause if there's more than one. There is a lot of suspense, you just never know what will happen, if those two villains will be in the same thing or just go their separate ways but still one goal which is to kill Batman. Unlike the two previous movies, this time he's got a partner. Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell. They picked the right person to play Robin. The acrobats he did is really cool. Tommy Lee Jones did a wonderful job being the TWO FACE guy. The question mark person/the whacko one, Jim Carrey is really funny. He's a great actor who can play the good or the bad guy and still his funny side has never disappeared. He is one of my favorite actors and he really is unique. Drew Barrymore didn't do a lot of stuff in this movie but that still made the movie more better. The more stars in it, the more people will watch it. Nicole Kidman's part is a little boring but that's okay I don't really care. The special effects were great, the crew did a wonderful job and I hope they make another movie \"Batman & Robin\". For all Batman fans, this movie should be on your list. Buy it or rent it, it's worth it. I give this movie a perfect 10."

        "review_title": "Batman for box-office potential, more than anything; which in turn opens up some problems linked to villains and love interests.",
        "review_detailed_main": "One thing Batman Forever might act as a wonderful example of, is how different directors can take what is essentially the same source material and transform it; or make it 'their own', when it comes to putting it up there on a screen. But this is the only time anyone should apply the word 'wonderful' when talking of Batman Forever as in this case, the translation is one that is certainly a lot more colourful, but in equal regard \u2013 one that is certainly more dull. The translation isn't quite limited to expressionistic-inspired sets and mise-en-scene, or lack of, but additionally the attitudes towards the female characters and the focus on the villains being of a variety that leads them to become scarred and deranged, rather than naturally so.\n\nI still maintain that Burton's 'Returns' in the best Batman film; a film that balances a struggling lead with a naturally deformed and deranged villain whom is placed on a career ladder that will ultimately lead to power by way of politics. The film systematically taps into what is a public obsession for a 'hero' of the tragic variety, or a celebrity figure in which to lead them out of, what they perceive to be, a mire of some sort that they're in. Batman Forever's villains are of your bog-standard, sadistic, fast-tracked sort that are scarred in a physical sense but require everything to be rosy before they almost instantly turn to homicidal behaviour. You'll remember that Returns' chief antagonist, The Penguin, was initially embraced by the people of Gotham in what was a calm and methodical approach to a superhero film on Burton's behalf as this creature mingled with the inhabitants; grew more powerful in the process and thus established a position of power of our hero Batman. In Forever, the bad-guys are practically screaming and shouting from the off \u2013 promising noise, carnage and mayhem wherever and whenever possible in what is a tired display.\n\nThe film has a certain compulsion to it; a certain and distracting sense of the obligatory. We never really feel as if our leads will be hurt, or are in much peril and there's never really a sense Batman could be injured or killed; the antagonists, at least one of them, is going for the very basic goal of control, manipulation and possession of the people in the city before eyeing the actual city itself as one big prize. So there's nothing new there and for all the glitz, colour and energy, it's actually quite sad to see the film eventually delve into a final act that sees a damsel in distress, quite literally locked in a tower, require rescuing from her (dark) knight in (shining?) armour.\n\nIn regards to the woman of the piece, the supposed love interest for Batman, it is Nicole Kidman that plays Chase Meridian, a doctor: an educated and somewhat prestigious person whom embodies, or should embody, intellect and independence. Her strong and independent character is, early on, demonstrated in her office as she boxes a punch-bag, thus establishing a degree of 'hard-bodiedness' to her character. The trouble is, she doesn't. She's one of the loosest female psychologists that's probably ever been put to screen, and comes complete with some terrible, flirtatious lines of dialogue that wouldn't be out of place in a low-rent, erotic thriller. Upon meeting her for the first time, Jim Carrey's Edward Nygma exclaims what a 'pursuit' she must be, poking fun at her name 'Chase', but that's exactly the problem; she's nothing more than a chase; a 'pursuit'; a prize; ultimately, a trophy partner.\n\nIf Selena Kyle, in the previous entry, went from rounded; plain and somewhat submissive secretary in the male-driven world of business, enterprising and globalisation, to the lone; independent; dominant and powerful Catwoman, then Chase goes in the opposite direction. She begins somewhat smart, before gradually falling to the level in which she exists purely so that she can look good and be rescued. There is one point, very early on, in which Chase references Catwoman in a dialogue exchange with Batman. She states that perhaps he'd take to her more if she were dressed in vinyl and came equipped with a whip, in what is a clear homage. The trouble is, Catwoman's utilisation of these aspects of mise-en-scene, in her costume and props respectively, helped define both her identity and characteristics; with Chase Meridian in Batman Forever; it's a leery, sexually-driven and somewhat pathetic suggestion which serves as nothing, bar a means to 'satisfy' the man she's got her eye on.\n\nThe film details Nygma's disgruntled descent into madness within a capitalist driven and increasingly high pressured lifestyle reasonably well; taking time to document his growing interest in homicidal activity as he gleefully observes the circus hijack-come-massacre on partner-in-crime-to-be Two Face's (Lee-Jones) behalf, while balancing the invention he's made that might double up as an allegory for what happens when advanced and powerful weapons fall into the wrong hands.\n\nBut everything is punctuated by annoying tidbits of this and that. Remember in 2008's The Dark Knight when Michael Caine, playing Alfred, states some clap-trap about how, years ago, when he was in the army and based in Burma, he once had to destroy a large patch of vegetation purely to catch a jewel thief; enforcing the ideology that in order to stop destruction and wrong-doing, sometimes caution must thrown to the wind in the process. Well, these sorts of annoying moral-boosting-speeches-come-pit-stops seem to have been around longer than I thought, as we learn in Batman Forever that \"Broken wings mend\" and that \"Robin will fly again\" following near-death experiences at the hands of Two Face, and everyone needs geeing up. The series went on to hit a critical all-time low before branching out into a box-office all-time high. In regards to the franchise, I'll stick with my 'Returns' and let everyone else get on with what they feel as if they're supposed to enjoy."

The film has a pretty solid storyline with good music and effects.\n\nCons:\n\nGotham City changes from a gothic-dangerous metropolis to a neon-art deco 90s music video. The films villains are highly over the top. Carey (Riddler) and Jones (Two-Face) would have suited a more serious version of their characters. The film has wacky and corny writing. Lastly, Dr Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) is used as a love interest for Batman and Bruce Wayne with no personality and is a very one dimensional character."

        "review_detailed_main": "The mid-90's was clearly when comic book movies turned into the butt of jokes that still make some people look down on them as mindless trash to this day, and that was because of one big reason. Studios went from producing dark, plausible, serious and character driven superhero movies like the first two Superman movies, Tim Burton's Batman movies and The Crow to making OTT garbage like Judge Dredd, Steel and of course Joel Schumacher's two Batman sequels.\n\nBatman Forever and it's successor are time capsules to everything wrong with comic book movies in this time period.\n\nNot only do bright, flashy colours replace the eerie and darkly atmospheric Gotham of the Burton films, but Michael Keaton is gone as well, replaced by Val Kilmer. Kilmer, to his credit, is OK in the role. However, he certainly misses the energy Keaton previously brought to the role. Nicole Kidman, like Kim Basinger before her, is sexy as hell, but also bland and forgettable as the love interest. Chris O'Donnell is miscast and borderline terrible as Robin. None of this is the fault of the actors however as the script really doesn't give their characters much to work with except for the \"identity\" story arc that Bruce/Batman goes through. And no, Robin doesn't count, as his only character traits are \"mah parents died\" and \"I love motorcycles\".\n\nMeanwhile, we have the villains. And BOY does this film stumble in that area. On the positive side, Jim Carrey gives a brilliant performance as the Riddler and almost carries the movie on his own. But this isn't the Riddler! Carrey simply plays a OTT wacko lune who has invented something insane and dangerous (also silly and implausible). Oh, and he leaves riddles. Well isn't that interesting. I would compare it to DeVito as Penguin in Batman Returns, but at least that different version of Penguin was a GOOD character.\n\nAnd what in the HELL did they do to Two-Face?! Tommy Lee-Jones' portrayal is an absolute butchering of the character and everything good about him. First of all, Lee-Jones hams up his performance to 11, which completely contrasts with his tragic backstory in terms of tone. Not to mention the insulting character assassination of having Two-Face not care about the result of his coin flip and just flip it again. THEN WHY HAVE THE DAMNED COIN IN THE FIRST PLACE?! And why in the bluest of blue hell is he played by a white guy when Dent was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the first movie? Out of all the villains in the series, Two-Face is the worst, even counting Arnold's Mr. Freeze.....oh hang on I forgot about Bane. OK, second worst.\n\nDespite all the issues with the plot and characters, is Batman Forever a bad movie? No. It is actually entertaining to watch most of the time, Jim Carrey is a delight, the soundtrack from U2 is awesome and it's clearly written with some thought and effort with its themes of double lives and identity.\n\nUnfortunately at the end of the day it's a tonal mess with silliness ramped up to 11 and undoing the great characterisation and atmosphere of the Burton films."

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman Forever represented a major change in style for Batman films at that point. After complaints about the dark and grim feel of Batman Returns, it was decided that it was time to tone things down and this led to Forever's lighter approach. Joel Schumacher replaced Burton and Val Kilmer stepped in as the dark knight. What we get is a film that feels very different and very loose, but it was a big success and actually has some very good elements. It is the Batman film people call bland and forgettable, but I think that there is something interesting trying to break through the surface and that it is better than Returns.\n\nStory: Well there are two distinct stories going on here. The main one involving the villains' scheme is daft and makes little sense, while the one concentrating on Bruce and Dick is very well-told. The Riddler, a disgruntled Wayne Enterprises worker, creates a device that can drain brainwaves which can be used to make him smarter and he teams up with Two-Face to fund his scheme. This whole plan is like something from the 60's TV show and is just used to get the villains on screen together because it makes little sense. Elsewhere, acrobat Dick Grayson's parents are killed by Two-Face and Bruce tries to steer him away from a life of revenge. Now this story is great, the relationship seems genuine and the themes of revenge are handled excellently. We also get a greater look at the psychology of Bruce Wayne, giving us more insight than either of the two previous films.\n\nBatman/Bruce Wayne: Here's a contentious point, I think Val Kilmer is a really good Batman. I think that he balances out both aspects better than anyone else has. His Wayne is believable as a suave, good- looking playboy while having that haunted edge. His Batman is mysterious and more heroic than any other on-screen version. He looks the part in and out of the suit too. With better writing he could have been the definitive Batman and it's a shame he only got one shot at it.\n\nVillains: All I can say is that Tommy Lee Jones butchers Two-Face. He's Two-Face for about 30 seconds, as soon as he say's ''luck'' he goes off the deep end and never looks back. Face is basically a Joker knock- off as all he does is run around laughing manically and no aspects of his duality are played up. It's not only a massive waste of a great character, but of Jones as well as he could have been perfect for the part. Jim Carrey is\u0085.well Jim Carrey with a hint of Frank Gorshin. He is very entertaining and clearly trying his best so I'll give him that, but his Riddler is just too crazed and holds none of the menace the character should. It was too tailored towards his acting and written differently I think the role could have been pulled it off well.\n\nSupport: Nicole Kidman is forgettable as psychiatrist Dr. Meridian. To be fair the character is just there for Bruce to be interested in and is given almost nothing to do but look pretty. Chris O'Donnell does a good job as Grayson, even if he looks a bit old. He handles the weighty material well and has chemistry with Kilmer. Michael Gough is excellent once again as a gentler Alfred, while Pat Hingle is dull as Gordon and has little to do throughout.\n\nAction: The fight scenes here are a lot better than those in the Burton films. Batman frequently fights many foes using a variety of methods and gadgets which broadens his abilities nicely. The entire opening battle with Two-Face is fantastic and the fight at the party is enjoyable too.\n\nMusic: Elliot Goldenthal comes in for the music and, though it's not as good as Elfman's scores, he does a rather good job. His main theme is a good replacement.\n\nProduction: First off, the film does look fantastic. It really does look like a comic book come to life and the use of colour as well as lighting is spectacular. Gotham City also feels less set bound than before and some of the ambitious locations used look great, especially for the time. One problem is some of the writing, which can come off as clunky and awkward. Batman saying things like ''Chicks love the car'' is just ridiculous and so out of character. The Riddler's dialogue is mostly jokes, but then again that is Jim Carrey, and Two-Face adds nothing of interest. Yet when the writing does concentrate on Bruce it can be really good and, as said, we get a more in-depth look at Bruce which is great. The costumes are well made, the Bat suit is probably the best on-screen one and Robin's suit looks really good as well. The villain costumes are a bit over-the-top, Carrey in a spandex is just weird, but they serve a purpose.\n\nConclusion: Batman Forever is much mangled, but is nowhere near as bad as most people say. Of course it has problems as said some of the writing is daft, the villains are overblown and it is heading into a campy direction which would be turned up to eleven in Batman & Robin. But it does have a lot of good things that many overlook. Val Kilmer is a great lead, the Robin arch is done well, it looks at Bruce Wayne a lot more and the action is enjoyably big. I see it as a sort of guilty pleasure in a way, there's problems with it but there's also some really good stuff that is worth watching the silly moments for. Overall it's not as strange or nonsensical as Returns and it's not as mind-blowingly camp as Batman & Robin, it has just the right balance."

No. But it's not all that good either. Batman Forever has become a widely forgotten-about blockbuster because of how inoffensive it was.

Two face is awful. It feels like the actor just wanted to out perform Jim Carey as he never feels threatening or does anything except act super hyper and over the top. The plot is actually really interesting, the riddlers plan sucks and is stupid as hell but the batman side of things is super interesting it's about him overcoming his trauma and about him adopting robin, the problem? Batmans trauma is resolved way too quickly and the writing is nowhere near good enough for that plot and the Robin is played by someone who looks like they're in their 30s and Batmans hesitation to let him become Robin is resolved way too easily and quickly. The comedy in this movie is really cringey and pathetic, I never laughed at any of the jokes unless it was about how badly made the movie is, and even then this movie is so boring at times that I wasn't even laughing at it that much. The biggest issue is this movie tries to appeal to kids so much that it removed the gorgeous and dark burton atmosphere, removes all the decent jokes and slightly edgy storytelling and removes any level of care or intrigue. The only positive I can ever say about this is they at least had interesting ideas and it at least focused on Batman."

I think Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face and Carrey as The Riddler work well together...two bad guys who share a connection and almost make the viewer want to root for them...\n\nOn another note, I think the music, theme, scenery, and overall look of the film has a great combination of flash and substance. Kilmer does a more than adequate job playing the Dark Knight, but I have to admit that I'm not too fond of Chris O'Donnell's character.\n\nI give this film an 8/10, and consider it my second favorite Batman movie behind the original. Don't watch at it as a sequel to a franchise, expecting gloom and doom...watch it as a flashy, action packed comic book movie that packs humor and drama all into one.\n\nP.S. - The part where Bruce Wayne has the flashback to the bat flying at him in the cave is awesome...nice touch. Check out this movie if you haven't already, it's solid all the way around."

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman forever could be called a thrill ride but it's not even worthy of standing next to the first two movies. Batman and Batman returns gave us complex villains who had a reason for doing what they did e.g. the Joker a psychotic criminal being deformed after having fallen in acid takes his anger out on the city of Gotham. What does Harvey two face have against Gotham apart from his grudge with Batman? But of course, lets give the audience some action and they'll forget all about the plot hole.\n\nSecondly Joel has been called a visual director but oh! brother what did Gotham city ever do to him to make him turn it into a wonderland? The colors added to the city are not at all atmospheric neither do they correspond to the Batman legacy. Gotham is supposed to be a city ravaged by crime that needs Batman. Where does a theme park look fit into all this?\n\nThe characters are not better of. In the first few minutes we are introduced to probably the horniest or most desperate kind of female character I've ever seen depicted on screen: Dr Chase Meridian. \"Hot entrance\" she says with a dropping jaw and Batman (no offense but the bat suit turns out to be too big for Val!)responds! How about that! Suddenly it's I am out to fight some bad guys but I'll look around for some dames too. Recall a similar scene from Batman returns: Catwoman saying something like the great Batman we meet at last?. Batman does not answer he simply walks away. He is a masked crusader without a love life.That's Bruce Wayne's area. It's amazing how one little line can spoil something so much.\n\nThe Robin character and the Riddler are equally badly and shallowly written. If the studio was aiming for a lighter Batman then I am all for it but for God's sake do not turn it into a popcorn trashy entertainment piece of junk.A good and deep story will always be appreciated a lot more than a bunch of colors cool cars and battles.\n\nFinally I feel that I need to congratulate Joel for topping his bad Batman movie with an even worse one answering to the name of Batman and Robin. Critics thought that Batman forever was a fatal blow to the franchise but oh boy they had another thing coming!"

        "review_detailed_main": "After watching just the first few minutes of this film by Joel Schumacher, it immediately becomes clear that this is nothing like the original two movies...and not in a good way.\n\nWhile the first two films were true to the interpretation of the Batman character as dark, brooding, and rather violent in nature (not at all like Superman, for example), Schumacher opts for a flashy, James Bond-like approach to the franchise, where every prop is equipped with flashing or glowing lights, bat-gadgets are used at a frenetic pace, and one-line quips are common fare. While good for a few shallow laughs, this approach to the Batman character marked the beginning of the end (until Christopher Nolan's \"Batman Begins\") for the Batman franchise. Essentially, Batman can only survive with a \"good guy\" interpretation for so long before he strays too far from his original character intent.\n\nWhat makes this movie still a very watchable film, however, is the acting of Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The Riddler. Though Two-Face's background is hardly touched on at all (a major mistake), he is still an interesting character, as Jones hams up his dual personality at every opportunity. The same goes for the insanely funny Jim Carrey...The Riddler's backstory exists but is rather dumb, but Carrey still provides a hilarious character out of almost nothing to work with.\n\nFinally, the introduction of Robin onto the scene also works in this film, as an emotional backstory (essential for any Batman movie character) is included for him.\n\nOverall, this film strays the Batman franchise down the wrong path, but ultimately ends up watchable due to its tremendous acting. If only the succeeding film could have been so lucky..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gotham City's crime fighter Batman (Kilmer) is in trouble as his past catches up with him in his nightmares. As he desperately tries to solve his past, villains Two Face and the Riddler cause havoc in the city.\n\nBatman Forever has one of those openings that you either love or hate. Two Face is causing trouble in Gotham and when we see Batman arrive in a typical hero shot, the tone for a hero driven film is set. Having never seen this film when it was first released, I am unable to comment on its reception and how it shaped the generation. Now with the wonderful darkness and mystery in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and Dark Knight there is a feeling of convention and normality in the superhero genre in Forever.\n\nFilled with predictability and a normality that will have you turning away, Forever doesn't add much extra to the tone that was set by Tim Burton in the previous couple of films. The car, cave and other tools in the Batman's Arsenal were already set and are simply repeated here.\n\nDespite the normality, there is still a sense of interest and excitement and hardcore fans won't be let down by the testament to the comics.\n\nThis third Batman film also has some great performances. Jim Carrey (The Truman Show) has created a wonderful villain in the Riddler.\n\nFilled with madness and creativity, the Riddler is more entertaining than the Mask and creates that wonderful charisma that very few can pull off and plaudits must be aimed at Carrey who is the star of the show. Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal as Two Face is disappointing when juxtaposed next to Carrey's Riddler. Harvey Dent / Two Face feels very ordinary, with the coin flipping and the silly screams if Batman foils him makes him foolish and a lesser figure because of it. To be fair the writing wasn't the best for Two face, as it was more focused on cementing the background for The Riddler. The two work well together and create some dramatic and exciting action sequences and is worth the wait come the end of the film.\n\nThere is plenty of hero clich\u00e9s thrown in for Kilmer's Batman, such as the overcoming of difficulties, just in time moments and cheesy lines.\n\nGive Kilmer praise for outshining Keaton as his portrayal of the crime fighter is dark but also more relaxed and enjoyable. Kidman makes an intriguing protagonist but Chris O'Donnell's Robin feels like the ultimate action clich\u00e9.\n\nDespite the terrible use of hero clich\u00e9s, Carrey and Kilmer make the film ultimately light hearted and enjoyable in good action fantasy."

The worst parts are Carrey as his comic self, here called The Riddler, and the cheesy entry of Nicole Kidman as a love interest of both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Tommy Lee Jones is good with what he's given as Two-Face but of course, Carrey tries to steal the show with his goofy humor. After halfway thru the film, you get used to Kilmer as Batman but then the movie is halfway over. It does get interesting at this point with Robin(Dick Grayson) entering the scene but everything goes much farther than it should as the enemies enter and destroy the batcave. Dr. Chase Meridian finds out more than she is supposed to and the lure of the Batman is much too revealed. The filmmakers try to skip out of this at the end but, I think, too much information is \"too much\" information for this superhero because there is nothing more to be revealed yet, of course, another film comes along, and for what reason?"

Meanwhile, two other people come into Batman's life with the first being a pretty psychiatrist named \"Chase Meridian\" (Nicole Kidman) who is infatuated with him and the other being a young circus performer by the name of \"Dick Grayson\" (Chris O'Donnell) who has just witnessed the death of his family at the hands of Two-Face and wants to avenge them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a rather odd continuation of the Batman franchise due in large part to the many attempts at humor which tended to obscure the overall plot. The fact that much of the humor wasn't especially funny certainly didn't help either. That being said, while I don't consider this to be a bad movie necessarily, it wasn't as good as its predecessors and didn't meet my expectations. Because of that, I have rated this film accordingly.

Did Burton make good Batman movies? Sure, I enjoyed Batman plenty, and Batman Returns had to grow on, me, but I came to greatly appreciate its great tension.\n\nWhat doesn't get acknowledged is that Batman Forever addressed aspects of Batman that were previously ignored. Burton admittedly cast Keaton, knowing that he didn't look anything like a supreme athlete Batman is known for being. I enjoyed Keaton as the Bat, but had so much more appreciation for the physicality getting priority in this case. Kilmer looks more athletic (and I imagine would have looked even better if he had time to beef up for the role. He got the part when the film was at the zero hour), and showed plenty of emotion as a tormented individual marred by loss. The martial arts were more akin to Batman with better stunt work, coupled with incredible moves.\n\nBatman had stronger relationships with Gordon and with Alfred here. Bruce Wayne was more the public figure we know him as. I still think that the definitive live action Bat-flick is yet to be made (thus far, Mask of the Phantasm has covered that area above all). Hopefully that will be the prospective Year One. but for now, this will be the best for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman Forever is a movie that had a lot right, but just as much wrong. This movie gives a new meaning to campy. Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Two Face is odd, to say the least. Although he does look much like the character is portrayed in the comic books, rather than a gritty more realistic version as seen in the Nolan films, the performance does not seem to match the character much. He needed a grittier side, maybe not to the extent that Aaron Eckhart took it, but more than what was shown in the movie. Jim Carrey was the real two face, showing both great potential for his portrayal as Edward Nigma, as well as something that the character is not. At certain parts, Carrey gives a performance that really captures the character, an obsessive person who constantly wants to prove that he is smarter than anyone, most importantly the Bat. But on the other side of the coin, he shows a performance that is resembled more closely to the Joker. Another problem with portrayals was Robin. While I enjoyed the presentation of him, true to his comic book origins, except a few parts, the casting should have been a younger person. O'Donnell would be a great Nightwing, but seeing a grown man run around in green and red tights as Robin was a little off putting for the character. Val Kilmer however, makes a decent Batman, and an especially great Bruce Wayne. While most would probably disagree with this, others might see it as I do. He looks the part, first of all. If he gained a little more weight and toned his physique, he'd be even better. The other aspect is the voice. He had a natural sounding voice, not the raspy growl that Bale did (not that Bale was bad, quite the opposite),but more closely resembling Michael Keaton's Bat Voice. A good portrayal of Batman comes down to choice, an opinion. Quickly looking at the plot, there isn't too much here. It's as simple as it gets, giving minimal back-story to the villains, the movie is pretty much on rails the entire time. Nothing impressive, but not utter garbage . To wrap this up, The movie does an interesting thing, just like its predecessors, in showing the extreme villains that Batman must face. Some odd portrayals of characters and questionable casting along with a few cheesy moments and a mediocre plot do hurt this movie. But overall, its amount of campy over the top moments gives it a certain charm, making it a decently fun movie to watch now and then."

        "review_detailed_main": "So after Batman Returns, I wasn't exactly anticipating another Batman movie. However, when I heard that Tim Burton had been given the boot as director, and that they were taking the series in a new direction, my interest was somewhat piqued. Now don't get me wrong I like Tim Burton, When he's good, he's great, but when he's bad, he's awful. Apparently, many other people agreed with my opinion that Batman Returns was a dud, including Warner Brothers. Joel Schumacher was hired to replace Tim Burton, and Val Kilmer was chosen to replace Michael Keaton. Keaton reportedly did not like the new direction the series was heading, and decided not to reprise his role. Although I respect his decision, I was disappointed that he wouldn't be returning. The character of Robin finally makes his appearance in the series, which I really liked. Robin has always been one of my favorite characters in the Batman comics, and I thought Chris O'Donnell played the role rather well, and I give the screenwriter credit for putting characteristics of all three Robins from the comics into this film's robin. But in the film, he's not given much to do. Jim Carrey portrays The Riddler, and he's the highlight of film! He's fun to watch, and you can tell he's enjoying every minute of the experience! Val Kilmer portrays The Dark Knight this time around, and while he does very well with the character of Bruce Wayne, he doesn't bring anything new to the character of Batman. Then, there's Tommy Lee Jones as Two-face. He's one of my favorite villains from the comics, so I was excited to see him in the film, but Jones doesn't even come close to capturing the character's essence or complexity. However, I can't put the blame all on him, Schumacher seems to only understand the bare minimum of the character. He's scarred on one half of his face, he wears clothes with two different colors, and he flips a two headed coin that's scratched on one side. This film's Two-face just sucks! What really kills the film for me, is that the film feels incomplete and uneven. Several scenes were cut from the film that shouldn't have been. These scenes elaborated on Bruce's interior struggle, and supposedly delved deep into the psychology of Batman. From what I understand, this was the film's intended goal. I hope one day we'll see a director's cut of the film. Maybe then, we can finally see Schumacher's original vision, But as the film is, it's just so-so. In my last review, I said that going from Batman to Batman Returns was like chasing champagne with sewer water. Now we've gone from sewer water to diet soda, it's much better than sewer water, but it's definitely not champagne."

Burton's Batman movies gave the comic book character the needed respect its deserved. Joel Blueblocker turned Batman into a clown show.\n\nPlot: Two-Face(played by Tommy Lee Jones) is bent on trying to kill Batman. Edward Nygma(played by Jim Carrey) is bent on making Bruce Wayne suffer for refusing to back up his brain drain machine. In the middle of all this Bruce Wayne/Batman(played by Val Kilmer) has to deal with Chase Meridian(played by Nicole Kidman), a psychiatrist, whose high school crush on Batman is nothing short of frustrating.\n\nOpinion: The positives of this movie: The special effects aren't half bad and it has some decent action sequences. The negatives: The dialog is painfully juvenile. I like Val Kilmer but not as Batman. He's basically sleepwalking through the whole movie. Nicole Kidman, a great actress, is wooden as a pine tree while she spouts corny one-liners and laughable psychological rhetoric throughout the movie. Tommy Lee Jones, another great actor, is terrible as Two-Face. He was more over-the-top here than he was as that psychotic warden in Natural Born Killers! Jim Carrey is excruciating as Riddler! He was still doing that stupid a** Ace Ventura shtick throughout the movie plus Edward Nygma's obsession with making Bruce Wayne pay for ignoring him is akin to a jilted girlfriend making her ex-boyfriend pay for cheating on her. If that wasn't bad enough you have deal with overtly campy dialog peppered throughout the duration of the movie and when Batman walked away from Chase with a smile on his face? Talk about pure cheese! That scene will remain in movie cheese history along with Keanu Reeves flipping off the devil in Constantine and the bat card in Batman & Robin. While this movie is not as terrible as the monstrosity that comes after it(Batman and Robin) it was preview of the nail in the coffin for one of the best superhero movie series of all time."

Out of all four movies predating Batman Begins, which is my favorite Batman movie ever, this is my favorite. Fine, a lot of people hate Schumacher's Batman movies and often associate them with bad comic book films, but truly BF is far superior to B&R which sadly was a train wreck.\n\nSure, both of them share a lot of things that made them so hated, such as the nippled rubber costumes and the over-use of neon.

I have trouble understanding why so many dislike Goldenthal's operatic score, but then I am much of a drama geek myself so I'm probably a bit biased.\n\nSome say Val Kilmer has not much of an acting range but as I see it he plays a very cold and tormented Bruce Wayne, a lot better than George Clooney did. The Robin story is played off very well, but I must say I would've survived without the love story between Bruce and Chase. The villains are great, especially Jim Carrey's Riddler, while it's too bad Two-Face doesn't get to do as much even though Tommy Lee Jones succeeds in playing a homicidal psycho. I've even heard Carrey was intimidated by him on the set and if another actor can make him feel uncomfortable he can't be all that bad. Sure, they're both very over-the-top but remember that these characters have existed in Batman's universe ever since the 40's.\n\nAs I watched the DVD features it hit me that all of the filmmakers got inspiration from their own experiences with Batman, e.g. Schumacher who said he grew up with the old campy comic books. Even if you don't have to like the final result you can't say that their personal views of Batman is wrong, since they're fans just like everyone else.\n\nAfter watching the deleted scenes I wish they would release a director's cut with them included. I especially think of Two-Face escaping Arkham, Bruce's discussion with Dick at the gym and the confrontation with the giant bat in the cave, with some proper editing done to the latter one.\n\nLong story short, Batman Forever isn't perfect but still quite entertaining. Many of the mistakes done in this or rather Batman & Robin still haunt a lot of fans, but the way I see it many lessons were learned from that, which is why we got Batman Begins, a portrayal truly worthy of the Dark Knight."

        "review_detailed_main": "How the mighty have fallen!\n\nThere's a lot of changes between Batman Returns and Batman Forever, and most of them are horribly negative. We lost Michael Keaton, who chose not to take part in this project after being dissatisfied with the creative direction it was taking (good choice), Tim Burton stepped down from the director's chair and into the role of producer, and Joel Schumacher stepped in as the director. Batman was recast by Val Kilmer (who, to be fair, was acceptable in the role, although not as good as Keaton was).\n\nThis movie isn't good. The change in director brought with it an entirely different style that just doesn't mesh well with the previous two at all. This film doesn't have the distinctly stylized gothic elements that are Tim Burton's trademarks, and the pacing in this film is nothing short of dull. The characters who, while fleshed out (in the case of Batman, at least) over the course of two movies by Tim Burton, manage to be two-dimensional and boring. Everything Burton set up in his films is ruined in this one; the \"Superhero Series for People Who Don't Like Superhero Movies\" becomes just another superhero movie with this entry, and it's dreadful.\n\nIt could've been so much better. Jim Carrey gave a fantastic performance as The Riddler (as Jim always does), but his character suffers from a major lack of screen time that would otherwise have made the film much more interesting. He is the only character in the movie that has any really distinct, distinguishable personality, largely in part to Jim's own manic-comedic delivery.\n\nThis movie is a boring shell of what Tim Burton created in the first two Batman films. It should've been left in the manuscript stage for another 2 or 3 treatments before it was ever even pitched to Warner Bros., and Tim Burton should've had the opportunity to work with Michael Keaton to further realize the vision he was working on instead of this mess.\n\nA major let-down after those that came before it."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a lot to like in Joel Schumacher's first Batman film. Schumacher manages to combine the darkness of Tim Burton's preceding films with the camp comedy of the 1960's TV series. There are a couple of moments where the sly in-jokes fall flat, but in the main, \"Batman Forever\" is good old-fashioned popcorn entertainment.\n\nVal Kilmer cuts an impressive dash as the Caped Crusader and Chris O'Donnell manages well with introducing the character of Robin. Nicole Kidman plays a v.sexy psychiatrist and the villain of the piece is well represented by Jim Carrey as the vain and insecure Riddler. Poor old Tommy Lee Jones has so little to do in the movie that he can hardly be classed as a proper villain. Jones is never given a chance to show the dual nature of his character \"Two-Face\", which is a real waste of the man's talent.\n\nThere ARE elements of this movie that presage the toe-curling awfulness of Schumacher's self-indulgent \"Batman and Robin\". The BatMobile becomes a plastic toy, all neon lights and wobbly fins. The tight shot of Kilmer's equally tight rubber-clad butt as he dresses in his Batman costume is gratuitous. Overall, there is the creeping feeling that perhaps we have seen all this \"City In Terror/Dark Knight In Turmoil\" formulaic shtick before.\n\nJoel Schumacher IS a good director and I admit that I'm viewing \"Batman Forever\" with hindsight. It's a much better film than \"Batman and Robin\" and should really be seen as a creditable effort to carry the Batman torch that Tim Burton rekindled in 1989."

Of course, here come some new villians (not really new-just recreated), Two-Faced and the Riddler. This really could have been titled, \"THE VILLIANS OF GOTHAM...oh...and Batman, TOO.\"\n\nTommy Lee Jones chews (and chews) up the scenes, and develops a ferocious caricature of a portrayal. Jim Carrey has the physical comedy prowess, yet noticeably lacks the malevolence. (Paging Frank Gorshin...).\n\nThe plot doesn't aim for intricacy, and opts off for sheer simplicity. While Batman/Bruce Wayne has limited screen time, Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle- a favorite character actor of mine from way back) and Alfred the butler (Michael Gough) are essentially reduced to cameos. These elements, plus Nicole Kidman as Batman's shrink, and introducing Dick Grayson into the mix, and what you get is simply too many anvils in the fire.\n\nWhile leagues ahead of BATMAN RETURNS, the overall effect leaves one weary from keeping track of loose thread subplots. One really gets close to thinking this formula has about ran dry."

In rewatching the Batman films, showing them to my son for the first time, I've come to think that even with that lukewarm review, I was being overly generous.\n\nDisfigured former District Attorney Harvey Dent (Tommy Lee Jones) escapes from Arkham and begins a crimewave, eventually teaming with \"The Riddler\" (Jim Carrey) a former Wayne-Tech employee with a grudge against Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer). The pair use \"the box\" a device in peoples homes providing them with 3D entertainment, but syphoning off their brainwaves, to determine that Wayne is Batman. Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell) comes to live with Wayne after Dent kills his parents at a charity circus event. He swears vengeance but when he learns Wayne's secret life, sees the opportunity partner with Batman.\n\nIt should be said that this Batman film is a reaction, a reaction to the fact that the darkness of \"Batman Returns\" had alienated some advertisers. This is not dark in any sense, be it the lurid luminous paint work, the hazy greens and pinks replacing Burton's Blacks and Whites or the regular comedic beats and manic over the top performances from the two villains. I think it's those performances that leave me most annoyed with the film now, I remember liking Carrey's Riddler when I was younger but his incessant prattling gets on my nerves now.\n\nMaybe I just hate this more now for what it isn't than what it is. Gotham is certainly bigger than it's appeared in the Burton films and that makes for some interesting sets, but it also looks a lot phonier. I don't have Val Kilmer's performance and, whilst way too old to have worry about moving in with a old rich guy when his parents are killed, I don't think Chris O'Donnell does that bad either.\n\nPerhaps the best thing I can say about the movie is that it's not as bad as the next one though sadly, that is still to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whilst this third instalment in the series may not be up to the high standards of the previous offerings, this entry still offers enough fun to be a satisfying and at times completely hilarious movie. I think what really helps when looking at Batman Forever is how you look at the movie- 1. If you look at it as a continuation of the previous noir offerings, it lacks... 2. Compare it to the seriousness of Christopher Nolan's entries, it comes across as shallow and tacky... 3. However, look at it as a partner piece to the gloriously camp and fun TV series and it comes across as a fun and enjoyable movie! Robin's Holey Rusted Metal Batman! is a classic in movie quotes!\n\nThe multicoloured palette of colour on show in Joel Schumacher's Gotham is a welcome departure from the greys of the original and give the film an energy and panache which really benefits the story. Helped by the garish green of the Riddler, and the carnival feeling to many of the scenes, this is one of the film's main strengths.\n\nUndoubtedly, Kilmer's performance shows just what an underrated actor he is- after Michael Keaton was overshadowed by his foes, Kilmer brings Batman back to the forefront of the films as he should be. Similarly, Carrey epitomises The Riddler in all his gleeful maniacal persona however the real weakness of the film is Tommy Lee Jones' character of Two-Face. Whilst Carrey benefits from a real set-up and character beginning, Two-Face is rushed out in an aside. Notice that in the VG Batman Arkham Asylum, whilst Joker is the chief catalyst Riddler is seen but not heard. Reason being, two larger than life characters (Two Face and Riddler) inevitable clash and one has to come across as weaker.\n\nSome have criticised Nicole Kidman as the love interest, and this is quite a thankless role- Drew Barrymore's Sugar is a lot more memorable. I think in hindsight, Kidman's strengths have been shown so much in films such as Dogville and Birth that it's a surprise seeing her in such a sketchy role, but she acquits herself well! Similarly, Chris O'Donnell as Robin could have come across as just another teen angst on screen but with a well executed back story and some surprising martial arts moves, he adds another welcome dimension to the film.\n\nTo sum up, Batman and Batman Returns may be more beloved however don't discount Forever as just another Godfather 3 because there's a lot more to it than that!"

Recently I decided to watch the movie again and was surprised to find myself reasonably happy with what I saw. It is most probably down to the last two Batman movies 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' that my opinion has changed a little because I\n\nprefer the darker tones of those movies. So maybe it is my fault that this movie is now downgraded slightly as it was a movie of it's time and I genuinely did used to rate it highly. But where I once found the comic book look of the film to be very effective, perhaps it was overdone.\n\nAs Bruce Wayne/Batman, Val Kilmer is a bit dull in the role and doesn't seem to be particularly enjoying it. Jim Carrey is fine as The Riddler but he is a little bit too over the top at times. It is the most convincing portrayal in this movie though. Tommy Lee Jones looks uncomfortable as Two Face and he is played more like The Joker in retrospect. Nicole Kidman is wasted as Chase as she is supposed to be a tough psychologist but comes across as a lovestruck teenager. Chris O' Donnell is OK as Robin and I can understand why Robin was part of this story.\n\nIt is a reasonably entertaining film with some fabulous sets. I have always thought that the music for this film was very good and that hasn't changed. I now feel I have to drop it's overall score down to 7 and that is mainly because of the later movies. Maybe that isn't fair and I may be fickle but this is an honest reassessment of a film that has slipped, but only a little in my humble opinion."

It's big and it's bold. I love the colors and the set design in this movie. It's never really clear what time period the movie takes place in.

        "review_detailed_main": "1995. And I remember it was a dark, cold night... And I couldn't wait to see Batman Forever! Me, little kid back then, very thrilled, anything could please me! I remember waiting in front of the cinema, Bat-bliss. Then it goes... lights out, it's warm. Me and my family, thrilling Eliot Goldenthal's score, powerful intro credits... and then goes a wild action, neon lights, lively characters, hot lady, annoying partner, explosions, two hot chicks and new kind of image of dark knight. Wow! I was happy and excited, and thinking to myself... what a cool film.\n\nThen... You grow up. And you start to have thoughts... you start to think more rationally. And the world around you is real and different to you...\n\n2011. Saw this film again, well I have seen it several times before, since I have it in my film collection. And I am still thinking to myself, being a Batman fan... what a hell did I just watch? Tim Burton, the man who set this wonderful franchise for us, he gave us an amazing image of Batman. Wonderfully set as the new live action adaptation. Just that Joel Schumacher can ruin it for us! I don't know if Joel ever read any of the comic books, but it seems that he just took characters and put them in this terrible world of neon lights. In this horrific colored world. This terrible looking Gotham City, perhaps the worst design of Gotham City I have ever seen. Too much lights! This film was meant for kids! Joel was obviously inspired by the old Adam West show. And, for sure, tried to test it in 1995. And, it went bad! Schumacher ruined everything about Batman, about the character, comic book and the franchise. Lee Batchler, who wrote the story, he did put any effort in it. Nothing intriguing. This was the most childish story ever! Akiva Goldsman, who wrote the script, just decided to keep things more light and merry. While, Batman should be more darker and serious.\n\nLet's begin with the characters and actors. Val Kilmer - visually not Bruce Wayne at all, he is good actor, but not good as Bruce Wayne or Batman. His lips didn't match with the proportions of the mask. It was weird. But, his voice was cool. Tommy Lee Jones is an amazing actor. And he really did good, over the top acting here. He amused me from time to time. But he missed the character! His performance looked like he based it upon Jack Nicholson's Joker. Two- Face is supposed be calm, psychotic and cold bringer of death.A real life grim reaper with a coin instead of a scythe. Jones ruined this character forever. Jim Carey as Riddler. I was never sure about this choice. Carey was definitively cast because he was a big comedian star back then. And yet, just like Jones, he ruined the character. Played it amusingly funny and over the top. Riddler is supposed to be calm, calculating, until someone prove to be more intelligent than him, then he is a raging psycho. But, keep it in mind that's it is not always an actors fault. Nicole Kidman was not that special, nor developed. She was there to be hot blonde and love interest to Batman. And of course Chris O'Donell. I always thought that Robin was unnecessary. O'Donell looked like he had a ball with his part. But the writers give him a little to work with. And I think that he could have been better. Now, for some other things. we have pretty weird, so called neon gangs. Since when is that a good, creative idea for Gotham City gang? It's just doesn't fit in Batman universe. The Batmobile design is little bit changes, not for the worse, but that blue engine light is terrible. The only thing I like about this film is Eliot Goldenthal's score. The guy is brilliant. No matter how the music sounds, I think he is the only one who was serious during this film. A fine replacement for Danny Elfman. And of course - Alfred. I think that Michael Gough was one of the best Alfreds. He has this old, gentleman posture, astringent eyes, but resonant and soft voice.\n\nAnd for the end, one more thing. Why is everybody so traumatized with nipples on Batman's costume?! Yes, they were too much and too funny. Joel Schumacher, being \"openly gay\", he stated that the movie costume designers wanted to give more anatomic look to the costume. Interesting idea, but turned out ridiculous. Schumacher, liked it, perhaps for personal reasons. The things is that so many people were so bothered with that, that they don't notice more important things in the film. Like, crucial things - characters, character development, script, story, music score, directing... but, no! Let's talk nipples.\n\nOverall, this movie is recommended for little kids. And for the adults who want to have a good time. It's pretty much harmless fun. But if you are a big Batman fan who wants more darker story, then avoid this."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first two Batman films are some of the best superhero films out there, this one isn't on that level, I don't think it's terrible but there is a notable drop in quality. The music in the first two, brilliant. The music in this film? It's fine but no where near as good. Every aspect just feels slightly worse.\n\nVal Kilmer is a fine Batman if somewhat wooden, I'd say the same for Chris O'Donnell as well. I quite liked the villains. Jim Carrey is doing his usual thing and while Tommy Lee Jones was a weird choice for Two Face I thought he was fun while hamming it up. Nicole Kidman is a great actress but so underutilized here, just a damsel in distress. I still enjoyed the film, I never felt bored but the story felt slapped together, as if it was just being made up as they went along. My last issue was that they used CGI for a few scenes and it was pretty weak. There were scenes where CGI wasn't needed but they decided on it anyway and it looked weak, still it's not as bad as Batman & Robin so that's a plus."

But this movie I thought was a clunker, and the one after this (Batman and Robin) is a complete disaster.\n\nYou'll enjoy the series if you stop after the second one, when Tim Burton and Michael Keaton both left the series.

        "review_detailed_main": "Seriously, have you seen the poster? Gorgeous! The cinematography is also pretty well done with a lot of visual appeal. (That gate to the insane asylum in the rain!) Very Halloweenish. But I had high hopes for this film and it's a massive letdown!\n\nNicole Kidman: I thought that was Alicia Silverstone! Same crooked mouth, same blonde (don't they all look alike?!) but does she always have to have the one MAJOR EVIL FACE that she pulls? I'm talking about the expression in her eyes. That broad's eyes betray she has no soul and she is more evil and more demented than any criminal ever locked up. Seriously, how many skeletons must be in her closet?! Can't stand her, she creeps me out!\n\nChris O'Donnell looked spectacular in his suit. He's an excellent actor. Always on point, always in character. He gets all the marks here. He always has the right emotion when needed. (And if he didn't, kudos to the editors for picking his best takes.)\n\nRene Auberjonois: creepily handsome. Perfect mad scientist hair. He only had a couple lines and a few seconds at the end, but I don't recall him ever looking this good. Great addition to the cast.\n\nDrew Barrymore? Could never stand her. She did the best with her brief part (doesn't appear until some 55 mins in) and showed up in all white with platinum hair... Can we say Jean Harlow look-alike?! Jean Harlow was no looker herself, this much is true, even worse before all her plastic surgeries, but she was fun to watch in action. Drew might just have been \"born to\" play her. Same style, satin white gown, platinum hair, white boa, similar face... HOW did she not get cast in a Jean Harlow biopic after this?! It baffles the mind!\n\nJim Carrey is annoying as usual. He's overacting all his E. Nygma lines. He is more tolerable when in Riddler costume. The guy can't act (as seen in a Liar Liar outtake when a woman yells at him \"OVERACTOR!\" but it's more than that: he's totally inept and can never play straight roles. In the green ? Costume he simply becomes The Mask. In a: nutshell he always plays the same character! Campy is the only thing he can do. This was a cartoon character, so we'll give the jerk a pass.\n\nThe butler man was just fine. He played his part well.\n\nDebi Mazar boring to the Max and Tommy Lee Jones: an equally boring performance. Was he miscast or what?! Anyway, both very forgettable. Now, saving (sadly), the very worst for last:\n\nVal Kilmer is a terrible, awful actor. Wooden to the max. (And some say this of Keanu Reeves? No! KR acts circles around VK!) I had never realized how bad and stilted his acting is! He really can't act. The only thing he can do is look good, move to his mark and speak his lines. There is absolutely nothing behind those blue eyes of his. NOTHING AT ALL! Hello MacFly, the lights are on and nobody's home.\n\nI'm trying to think where have I seen him before, other than TV interviews, and I can't think of any of his films. Was he already this terrible in Top Gun? It's the only thing I must have seen him in.\n\nNow, it really pains me to say the above, but I have to be truthful. I really had high hope for his batman: I loathe Tom Clooney (or Jim Clooney?! Whatever his face is, Rosemary's nephew: hate him!) I can't stand Michael Keaton or Ben Affleck. I had no opinion on Val Kilmer except \"what an Adonis!\" Surely he must have nailed it, yeah? No! Zero chemistry with the witch he had to kiss. You'd think he'd bring it on, turn on the charm, or the danger factor, or the arrogance, the \"I'm too sexy for you!\" thought process but nope. He gave nothing at all to the cameras and it shows. Their kiss was the most cringeworthy ever: sloppy, badly filmed, unsexy, smacking noises that make your skin crawl, UGH!\n\nBasically, Val Kilmer had the body and face of the perfect hunk, a Greek god, an Adonis, but a statue is what his acting turns him into. (Is he like that in real life, too?!) Or did he never go to acting class? Acting is like riding a bicycle: very puzzling and impossible...until you know the tricks. Or even like singing, except a lot easier! But my god. Kilmer hits his mark and says his line and, especially in the first hour, you can see his thinking process: he is nervous, he is VERY INSECURE and he's thinking \"I didn't deliver that line quite right!\" \"Dang how many more words does she need to speak until it's my turn to talk again?!\" It's awkward to watch him, HE is so awkward an actor! Even when he's reminiscing about his tragic childhood he brings nothing to the table except Val Kilmer thought-process of being nervous in front ot the cameras and thinking: \"Is it lunchtime yet?\" \"Did I say my line right?\" and \"what's my next line?\" Zero character emotion or thought process.\n\nI did find him spectacular in the Batman costume...and then I remembered: it's a suit and it's a stand-in or a stuntman. Oops. Still, I don't dislike this dude. He doesn't annoy nor aggravate me like the 3 aforementioned clowns do. I know nothing of him, his life, his loves, his politics. Nothing at all. Haven't ever searched him. He is the man you'd want to look like (more so than Brad Pitt or etc) but he has 0 charisma, 0 sex appeal and 0 acting ability. It boggles my mind that he didnt get along with the director and Joel still said he was the best Batman?! Weird.\n\nBut I'll tell you this much: I'd rather look at him than the other Batmen. As long as he keeps his mouth shut. I don't know what his problem is. Is he shy? Did someone put a gun to his/his relatives head and say \"ACT LIKE BATMAN OR THE TEDDY BEAR GETS IT?!\" because that's what it looks like.\n\nThe one good thing? He didn't look like he thought he was too good for you and was doing you a favor to pose as Batman. Nope. The poor guy looked out of his depth. And for that, I don't dislike him, in fact I wanna give him another chance and see when did he ever bring it?! Where did he go wrong? Surely he has to have ONE movie where he's good, yeah? What a waste of devastatingly good looks. Well, he had that, so a lot more than most of us here typing smack against him. You go, boy. I mean bat! 6/10 because they tried to make a good movie for us and I feel bad to leave the 5/10 it truly deserves."

        "review_detailed_main": "I admit that when the Batman film franchise shifted from the gifted,visionary claws of Tim Burton to the \"new wave\" obsessed flippers of Joel Schumacher, it eventually went down hill. But the third(and I wish it was the final installment although Batman Begins(2005)was fantastic and virtually reinvented the concept)Batman film has been called the last straw in the downwardly spiraling reign of Schumacher. I partly agree with this because I fell that the fourth movie(Batman and Robin)is terrible and not worth your time. I also think the Batman box set would sell better if it was not included. But Batman Forever is a great film, definitely not because of it's director (or Chris O'Donnell) but because of it's great acting and half decent portrayal of Batman. Val Kilmer played batman respectively and believably while still holding on to the haunted and dark image that Michael Keaton engineered. Nicole Kidman adds the perfect film noir character to the scheme and although she has been ridiculed as having a \"useless\" role in Batman Forever,I can't imagine watching it without her( she definitely gave more to this film than Chris O'Donnell). If Tommy Lee Jones is involved in a film then you know it's going to be good and Tommy Lee does not disappoint. Intelligently given the role of a Harvey Two-face, Jones gives us a scathing portrayal of one of Gotham's most dangerous criminals and what makes him tick. Jim Carrey's performance as The Riddler is arguably what saved this movie and this role truly revealed his chameleon acting abilities to the rest of the world. Most of the trouble that accompanied this film spurred from the fact that it had to follow up Batman Returns which was Burton's very personal and romantically dark view of Gotham city. It was an artistic masterpiece and the most controversial Batman film. Jiel Schumacher told the public that for his first swing at a batman film he wanted to sway away from Burton's dark and romantic Gotham world (a very,very bad idea) and create a more \"new an hip\" Batman. His world is more corny and modernized which is not where Tim Burton visualized his story going. Schmacher's possible disaster is saved by brilliant casting decisions, even better acting, and Jim Carrey. THis film is altogether worth watching especially because it focuses on the concept of duality. The best way to look at Batman returns is to see it as a separate franchise from the first two and ignore Batman and Robin altogether."

This movie does not hold a candle to the Batman Begins series. Save your time and watch the new series."

        "review_detailed_main": "What this is, is a very slight sequel to Tim Burton's \"Batman Returns\" but it's mostly a reboot. It has few of the same actors from the previous Batman movies such as for Commissioner Gordon and Alred. But this movie takes place in a more modernized version of Gotham city and doesn't have that Tim Burton vibe to it anymore. When I first saw this movie as a kid at a mall when it first came out in theaters with my older cousins. I thought this movie was great and found it entertaining. So for when it came out it was probably a decent movie for youths, but watching it now as an adult there is just way too many flaws with this flick. Joel Schumacher just doesn't know Batman all that much. And it clearly shows with the villains, they are just wacky and just way over the top. It was like they both were trying there best to impersonate Jack Nicholson's Joker. All the actors and actress in this were in there prime when this flick came out but they just didn't know the Batman universe all that well. I mean it doesn't have to stick very close to the comics but it sometimes didn't seem like a Batman movie cause certain things are off. You probably won't notice certain flaws in this as a kid but as and adult you pick up on certain things. Jim Carrey had potential to be a good Edward Nigma aka The Riddler but he just didn't act like the Riddler all that much. His portrayal was just too over the top and he seemed to be trying way too much to stand out, only it just didn't work. Yeah he has obsession with riddles and puzzles in this but seem to lack logic and didn't have that cool mischievous and mysterious element to him. Instead he is a very obnoxious character that is bonkers and jumping off the wall. It's basically just Jim Carrey being over the top and acting like Jim Carrey in a lot of his movies. Yeah there are version of the Riddler that is just acts plain crazy, not as much as this one though. But the methodical and yet mischievous representation of the Riddler is still the best one in my opinion. Which was in the comic books and even in the animated series. That is what the Riddler is a methodical villain that really really does his planning and scheming. Tommy Lee Jones version of Harvey Dent aka Two Face was the worst though. Besides the half melted face and a coin the guy was nothing like two face. Tommy Lee Jones probably didn't know Two Face but he sure didn't do his research either. He just comes off as another Joker impersonator, Cesar Romero's version of Joker to be exact. But the director didn't know the demeanor and essence of certain comic book characters so not everything is to blame for these actors. Val Kilmer however is passable as Bruce Wayne and looked the part as well. Micheal Keaton is still the better Batman though. I liked how they didn't portray Batman and Bruce Wayne as a boyscout cause he isn't and Val Kilmer did this well with his cold and serious and yet charismatic portrayal of Bruce Wayne. This is probably the first movie I seen with Nicole Kidman and she sure was in her prime in this as well. Not talking about her acting wise but when it comes to her look anyways. Even if her role isn't major to the story at least there was some eye candy that didn't really add or necessarily take away from this movie. She is basically a more forward version of Vicki Vale(Kim Basinger). And has two love interest, well it can be one as well. Finally when it comes to Robin played by Chris O'Donnell, he was decent but I wasn't a big Robin fan but his presence in this is alright. Kinda gets annoying sometimes but this portrayal of Dick Grayson aka Robin but sorta spot on. Nothing outstanding but it was good. No Robin from \"Teen Titans\" that is for sure. All the actors in this movie had potential with the roles they were given, but just didn't know how to portray these comic book characters. Anyways this movie seem to be going in a pop-culture style or commercial direction for Batman that Tim Burton claim to not be a part of for his version of Batman. The action in this movie is just silly like your watching a Saturday morning cartoon. I still give this movie a 6, maybe I am being a bit unfair but this movie had a part during my childhood. Not a big one but a part of it and it's still sort of nostalgic. Probably because this might be the first live action superhero movie I have ever seen. Also the theme song to this is no Danny Elfman's theme song to Batman but this one is still good. Not memorable but it fits well as a Batman theme song.\n\n5.5/10"

        "review_title": "Severely underrated",
        "review_detailed_main": "I really don't understand the criticism that this movie receives. Some people compare it to Batman & Robin, a truly awful movie, but Batman Forever actually accomplishes what it set out to do quite well. The actors (big names like Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones, Val Kilmer, Chris O'Donnell, and Nicole Kidman) fit well into their roles. The plot is quite simple: Batman vs. the duo (or should I say trio!) of Two-Face and the Riddler.\n\nNow for a little more about the casting: Jim Carrey is a funny man, and I think that no one else would have been as fun to watch. Sure, he acts the same way in every movie, but you have to like it. How could you not? Chris O'Donnell was likable as Robin. I think the casting directors and screen writers made a wise choice in picking an actor older than the Robin character is supposed to be. I know that this a complaint among fans, but it made a lot more sense and actually helped the film. Two-Face was not portrayed in this movie like he is in the comics, but I still liked Tommy Lee Jones in the role. Nicole Kidman adds to this movie as well. She had the right look. She reminds me of a living comic book character, even though she was not in the Batman comics.\n\nVal Kilmer gets his own paragraph because he's a bad ass. I think that he was perfect for the character. He was actually believable as Bruce Wayne, which I think Michael Keaton had a harder time with. Though I probably like Michael Keaton's Batman better, I like Val's Bruce Wayne better. Val has such a low voice. Specifically when he is yelling at Robin in the bat cave. Val Kilmer is so cool! He can do no wrong!\n\nI think the reason that this movie is set apart from other movies is the unique look that it has. Many people hate the colors, but I think that they makes it look like a living, breathing comic book. There is still a gritty sense of darkness in Gotham, but it is a unique world that you cannot figure out. It's surreal.\n\nWatching this movie is a feast for the eyes. I actually like to pause this movie at points and just stare at the scene. Some shots are just so beautiful. There is one scene in particular that sticks in my mind. It is when Batman and Dr. Chase Meridian are talking next to the bat signal on top of the building. I love the colors behind them. The look is unbelievable! This alone makes the movie worth a watch.\n\nAnyone who tries to take this movie too seriously is going to be disappointed because Batman Forever is not meant to be dark, tortured, or sad. It's supposed to be triumphant, a little over-dramatic, and somewhat loony. Despite all of this, I don't think that you can say that this is a kids movie. It can be enjoyed by all ages. It has a mass appeal that the other Batman movies were not able to capture. If you ask hardcore Batman fans what their favorite movie is, they'll most likely say either Batman 89, Batman Returns, or Batman Begins. However, if you ask any random person on the street which one they like the most, they are most likely to say Batman Forever.\n\nThe moral of this story is that people who are huge fans of the Batman character don't immediately gravitate towards this movie, but the general public appreciates it more. I think that sums up the movie. It is a piece of pop culture that has style as well as edge-of-your-seat action. But don't immediately write-off Batman Forever as a dime-a-dozen action film, because there is so much more to be enjoyed. For example, the costumes, sets, and props are top notch.\n\nIf nothing more, this movie is an entertaining way to spend two hours. I've seen it at least fifteen times, and it is still as good as the first time I saw it back in 1995."

Although the movie seems to be a masterpiece at first glance, there are many flaws, such as the overall rapiness of the movie. One of the memorable quotes from Jim Carrey's 'The Riddler' was \"You were supposed to understand... I will make you understand\", which made it seem like he will sexually assault Bruce Wayne. Furthermore in another scene Jim Carrey states \"See you soon\" in a gay rapey manner. The issue with this is that it seems to support the view from feminists that there is currently a rape culture. The costume design was also phenomenal... for a 5 year old. In addition to this it looked like a two year painted the side of two-faces head and at times Tommy Lee-Jones 'Two-Face' acted like a gay stripper. Nevertheless the script was almost perfect, the acting of Val Kilmer and Nicole Kidman is flawless, in which Kidman's superb role in the movie made the misogynists watching the movie want to gouge their own eyes out, and the immersiveness of Gotham City is exquisite. I have other problems with the movie, I believe Alfred may have sexually abused Master Dick and there is instance of misogyny where Bruce Wayne sighs and says \"Women\", the feminists have highly criticised this part of the script. The emotional shown by Chris O'Donnell who portrayed Robin was quite simply breathtaking and he should have won an academy award for his role in the movie. Overall the acting in this movie is quite astoshing and the effects had set the precedent for the future. The audio used was phenomenal and matches the likes of Hans Zimmer and Ennio Morricone. Even the movie had its flaws, it had became an instant classic and Joel Schumacher had made an incredible contribution to the movie industry. So the movie is basically crap but funny because of how stupid and bad it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman may last forever, but this particular movie franchise being enjoyable sadly doesn't. Batman Forever has given a massive downgrade from the first two movies. I'll give the movie that it does try with some of the stunts being stunning and The Ridder being an enjoyable villain especially coming from the performance of Jim Carey. But because of the different direction from before, that would result the movie to have a predictable story that doesn't have a good connection of the first two, visuals that don't stand out from before, and some of the acting that can be just considered under acting. Even as a Batman fan, I would best recommend to just stick with the first two films since they have Tim Burton as the director and did a much better job doing a movie of the superhero. I wish that there could've been a proper follow up to the previous two and something that can truly stand out from the predecessors. But by watching this movie, all it did was make me wish to watch a better Batman movie. I know the next film will be worse, but this is just the beginning of the franchise's downfall."

        "review_title": "This film is a riddle and has two faces!",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film came out in 1995, the third sequel in the successful Batman series. Tim Burton is now just a footnote given a producer credit and Joel Schumacher is now the director. Why? Because Returns was not a beloved film and its box office gross, though high, still was regarded as a disappointment. So this one opened and there was fanfare aplenty. In fact, this one was considered much better than Returns, a fun film! Over the years though, it and Returns have switched places as now Returns is considered a very good Batman film and even the best of the original four by some and this one is seen as the one that was a precursor to the nightmare that was the fourth movie of the series. I think that Returns is the better film, but not by all that much. Both films, when I look back on them kind of missed the mark. This one just distracts you from the fact it missed the mark by adding bright colors and over the top performances.\n\nThe story has Two-Face escaping Arkham Asylum and obsessed with killing Batman. Unfortunately, the scene depicting his escape was left out of the final cut that hit theaters. Batman comes to stop Harvey Dent and a criminal psychologist named Dr. Chase Meridian is on the scene to offer insight. Batman and Two-Face clash and soon we are introduced to Edward Nygma, an employee for Wayne Enterprises who idolizes Bruce Wayne, but goes insane when his hero rejects him. He soon dons the persona of the Riddler and teams up with Two-Face in an attempt to increase his knowledge and uncover the identity of Batman. Fortunately for Batman he will not have to face these two madmen alone as he will uncover an unlikely partner in Dick Grayson, soon to be known as Robin. First, though Batman is going to have to come to terms with his own near split persona.\n\nSome of the principal cast members from the previous two movies are back as Pat Hingle reprises his Commissioner Gordan and Michael Gough returns as Alfred. They are about the only thing linking Joel Schumacher's Batman films with Burton along with a few subtle nods to the original two films. For the most part though all four films stand on their own and you do not have to watch them in any particular order to make sense of anything. Val Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton, and he looks more the part than did Keaton, but he just does not play the part all that well. I think he was a bit better than George Clooney, but that is because Clooney was not acting at all in Batman and Robin. It seems he was just directed to be himself. Though from what I hear both Val Kilmer and Tommy Lee Jones were a terror to not only the director, but to Jim Carey as well.\n\nThe villains on display are Two-Face and The Riddler. Both at times are done rather well, and at other times just seem a bit to frenetic. Two-Face is supposed to have two halves to his persona, one good and the other twisted and evil. He decides things with a flip of the coin. Here though he often repeatedly flips his coin until he gets the desired outcome which suggests that he is not dual natured, but more like 75 percent evil and maybe 25 good. Tommy Lee Jones at times does a good time as Two-Face and at other times he is just a bit to campy. He is usually too campy in the scenes he is in with Jim Carey. Then there is Jim Carey as the Riddler, and look no further than Frank Gorshin's portrayal of the character and that is pretty much what Carey does. I find it funny and over the top, but it sort of carried the movie at times too.\n\nThis film would end up making perhaps 50 more million dollars than Returns, though if you factor in the cost of the film only about 30 million more, but it was considered a huge success. I still cannot quite figure why. The studio thought it was such a hit they brought Joel Schumacher back for the fourth film and they seemed to want to make the film even more colorful and zany than this one. They apparently thought that was the reason this one outperformed Returns, but I do believe the real reason is they got Carey and Jones when both were very high and they kind of generated some buzz. Carey came out of nowhere to have three successive hits at the box office and Jones was an Oscar winner for the Fugitive. However, the people who made the film apparently thought it was not this that made the film a success (though not all that much more than Returns and still way behind the initial film) and added more and more to Batman and Robin.\n\nSo in the end, this film had its moments, but was not quite the film it was believed to be. It mainly benefited from a couple of good casting calls and buzz. I liked it initially, but when I watch it now I do not remember why I enjoyed it so much. I hated the bat mobile, the bat suit was bland compared to Burton's and overall it just did not leave me wanting for more, much less a lot more comedy that would be presented in the next film. We already had that in the 60's! Still, with just a bit of work it could have been the winner everyone thought it was at the time."

The drastic change in style between \"Batman Returns\" and this film is indeed jarring, the plot does have some several large holes and the set design is atrocious.\n\nHowever, Kilmer is impressive, having the charm and intelligence to play Bruce Wayne, alongside the imposing build and \"growl\" to be Batman. Jim Carrey more or less plays himself, and while towards the end his performance grates, I did enjoy seeing him take his energetic acting to the character of the Riddler. Chris O'Donnell and Nicole Kidman are given little to do, although I suspect a lot of their scenes were cut from the film. (What happened to the thing about the diary, guys?) Sadly, the extensive amount of screen time given to Carrey puts Two-Face (my favorite Batman villain) and Tommy Lee Jones (a superb actor) firmly in the shade.\n\n\"Forever\" is a flawed film, but certainly not a bad one. Hopefully we will see an SE DVD one day, fixing many of the plot holes.\n\nFinal Score: 6.5/10"

If it wasn't for Carrey, who was great as The Riddler(perfect madman), and Jones, who was quite good as Two-Face. O'Donnell was good as Robin, as well. But in the end the writing surrounding Bruce/Batman, was just laughable as being passed off as realistic in any way. The effects were pretty good and the stunts were impressive. How does it match up with the others? It's not the worst, but it's not the best either."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's sad to see a series wither away. First there was \"Batman,\" a fun film with a good director at the helm who portrayed Gotham City with just the right tone of darkness, ignoring the camp qualities of the aptly named television show of the 1960s that starred Adam West, and had also betrayed the comic's tone to go for full-out laughs.\n\nThen there came \"Batman Returns,\" an over-the-top sequel that had too many quirky qualities and dark traits for my own personal enjoyment.\n\nThen Michael Keaton and Tim Burton left the series so that Val Kilmer and Joel Schumacher could step in (Burton produced the third film but ignored the fourth altogether; WB is smart, the new Special Edition DVDs coming out exclude \"Batman and Robin,\" too). This essentially marked the downfall of a series many refer to as one of the most disappointing and \"in-between\" of all time.\n\nVal Kilmer is a good Batman, and I think everyone has to admit this. He is arguably the best Batman of them all--as much as I like Michael Keaton as an actor, many people were dissatisfied with his portrayal of Bruce Wayne on the whole, and George Clooney was just George Clooney in the fourth film.\n\nKilmer displays a sort of repressed anger and rage and hatred for crime that is vital to the Batman character in the first place. He looks as though his mind is heavy and his soul depressed with the mess of the world--too bad the material can't support the depths of Bruce Wayne in this one.\n\nAfter Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) emerges from the underground of Gotham City and threatens peace in his own extravagant way, Bruce Wayne (Kilmer) puts on his cape and defends his beloved city--much to the chagrin of a new villain, The Riddler (Jim Carrey), who teams up with Two-Face and decides to hatch an elaborate plan to brainwash America using small TV boxes. (Symbolism? A bad matter for a film like \"Batman Forever\" to try and tackle.)\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) tries to unearth the mystery of Batman, and a recently orphaned acrobat named Dick (Chris O'Donnell) comes to live with Bruce and vows to seek vengeance against his family's murderer: Two-Face. This is, as far as I know, pretty close to the comic books--but the outcome is at times quite disastrous.\n\nChris O'Donnell, as Robin, is the film's weak link in terms of acting--he brings nothing memorable to his character and merely stumbles through the movie like a walking plank made of wood. His family of acrobats, clothed with the same design of Robin from the cult TV series, takes a plummet a few stories up after trying to save the day. He gets mad. But O'Donnell is too smarmy and smart-alecky to like. Please, get rid of this guy.\n\nThanks to Joel Schumacher, this stands as one of the wackiest films of all time. I looked forward to it quite enthusiastically back in 1995, when the top-notch cast and extreme word-of-mouth seemed to hype up the film to a maximum extreme. The result was discouraging, and to this day the entire circus sequence is ingrained in my memory as one of the most OTT of all time.\n\nIn some respects this could be called one of the worst films of all time. It's over-the-top, ridiculously extravagant and horribly directed by Schumacher--whose films are hit (\"Falling Down,\" \"Phone Booth\") or miss (his second \"Batman\" movie). Here he's somewhere in between. The acting by Kilmer, Lee Jones, Kidman, and even Carrey is fine. The movie itself is just bad--and that's where it fails. But in terms of entertainment, this is easier to digest than the second movie. I prefer it, despite its flaws. And it isn't half as bad as \"Batman and Robin.\"\n\nTrivia note: Michael Keaton was originally attached to this project with Rene Russo as his love interest. However, after meeting Schumacher and disagreeing with his vision for the series, he left the project and Russo was deemed \"too old\" for Kilmer."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Batman Forever\" is another film in the series, created in 1995 by the famous director Joel Schumacher, who brings a fresh look at the familiar world of the superhero Batman. One of the most striking changes made by Schumacher in this film was the transformation of Gotham, a once dark and Gothic city created in previous films by Tim Burton, into a place flooded with bright neon and various lighting effects.\n\nParadoxically, this change suits the plot of the film and the entertainment of its scenes. The new Gotham is a frightening combination of underground jazz clubs and dirty alleys, tall buildings and scary slums, and it all looks amazing on the screen. The abundance of neon brilliance and the gloomy atmosphere of Gotham creates a visually fascinating picture that attracts attention and immerses in the unique world of the city covered with secrets and dangers.\n\nOne of the memorable aspects of the film is the acting. In particular, it is worth noting the incredibly grim, vulgar and eccentric role of Jim Carrey. The actor demonstrates the Riddler to the world in such a manner that even avid fans of comics are unlikely to be able to say that the Ridler existed as such before. The character's performance is very specific. It shows the viewer a recognizable funny Jim Carrey, but at the same time demonstrates that his villain is incredibly dangerous and unpredictable. Kerry seems to take the viewer into a frenzy of manic energy and black humor. The actor is convincing in this role, charismatic and at the same time absurd, he seems to make it clear - \"I can exist, but only within the framework of such a movie.\"\n\nIn addition, \"Batman Forever\" impresses with an abundance of characters from the DC universe. Here we meet such classic heroes as Robin, Two-Face and many others. The story of the film describes interesting twists and turns in Batman's life, his struggle with dark memories from the past and the search for inner strength for his mission to protect Gotham. All this adds depth and sharpness to the film, making it more intense and exciting.\n\nBut not only the characters make this film excellent - a good story is another reason why the picture deserves high praise. Complex relationships of the characters, internal conflicts of the characters and unexpected plot twists make the film fascinating and keep the viewer in suspense. In combination with a high-quality vivid picture and impressive visual effects, the story of the film becomes fascinating and memorable.\n\n\"Batman Forever\" is a good quality continuation of the series about the adventures of Batman, offering viewers a new and exciting look at the iconic city of Gotham. Thanks to bright visual solutions, masterful acting, an interesting story and an abundance of characters, the film leaves a pleasant impression. Yes, this is not the same world that we saw in Burton's paintings. Gotham has changed, as have the heroes of the city, but it seems that this updated version from Schumacher turned out to be quite beautiful, becoming a good heir.\n\n8 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I like Val Kilmer, but he was the worst choice as Batman in the series if you ask me. The villains, The Riddler and Two Face, yes they look appealing, interesting, but both, Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were exaggerating, I mean their performances and characters both. Tommy Lee Jones is one of my all time favorite actors and I like Jim Carrey, but in this movie, they become unbearable, especially Carrey. Lee Jones also recalls Warden Dwight McClusky, he is as mad as him! (in a negative way) The personalities of the villains are perky in contrast with the original characters. By the way, Nolan's Two Face did not impress me either, but because of screen time problem, not the character. Some critics claim that the relationships in the movie are obscure. They say Two Face and The Riddler have a sexual relationship, so do Batman and Robin. I see such kind of things in the forums either. Mostly, it seems me malicious. Last year, while searching Batman on the internet, I found a picture that Batman and Robin kiss each other. No comment! And please don't charge me with being homophobic or something. Yes, The Riddler in the movie was a bit effeminate, but it does not mean that he sleeps with Two Face! May be this is their fantasy, who knows. They did the same thing for Batman and Robin either. Anyway,there is a love story between Bruce Wayne and Dr. Meridian, it was dull and makes the movie mediocre. A doctor and her patient fall in love. It is not original like the love affair between Bruce Wayne and Selina. Batman Forever is one of the most noisy movies ever made like Stephen Sommers movies, I don't say this as a good thing or bad thing, even if sometimes it was overblown to me. My favorite part is the part which Two Face and his gang chase Batman. As for the final part, it was very weak. In addition, sometimes it is too dark, a disturbing darkness and the expected clash between Batman & Robin and The Riddler % Two Face does not happen. I said it is the only rotten apple, because personally I think that Batman and Robin is much better than this one. May be the only thing I liked about this movie is the first conversation between Batman and Alfred. ''I suppose I could not convince you to take along a sandwich.'' ''I'll get drive-thru.''"

Jim Carrey's perfomance as Riddler is terrible, incredibly force and silly, the same goes to Tommy Lee Jones Two-Face, that acts exactly like The Riddler, it would be better if there was some difference, Two-Face being the serious guy that compromises, even being a madman with a multiple personality disorder, and Riddler being the goofy one, not the best take, but it would make sense. I cringed hard when they interacted, it was awful and ridiculous. And there's Chase as well, poor Nicole Kidman, she deserved more than a character that looks like it was written by a horny 16-years old, and that comes from a 16-yo. A guy said that this film is not afraid in being a comic book film, and I bet he never read one comic book. I'm not the fan who expects extreme fidelity in adaptations, so I really don't care about some differences, but this is not a truly comic book film, like the Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Spiderverse, Ragnarok, Watchmen, and many others of different tones than this childish comedy.\n\nI know it's not Schumacher fault, I even liked the directing here, unfortunetely there's so much scenes and dialogue that I remember, and not in a good way. If there's something I enjoyed here, it was the relationship of Bruce and Dick, how they are alike, the whole vendetta, the Waynes murder appears here again, but I thought it was necessary, and improved Bruce's character to me. Both Val Kilmer and Chris O'Donnel did fine as their respective characters, I didn't expected nothing great, but it was good.\n\nWell, there we have a FLAWED movie, and I mean it, but still enjoyable somehow, cringy sometimes, but is still watchable and there's worse movies out there to see."

In total contrast, the witty one-liners are a welcome relief after the ever-darker first two films.\n\nJim Carrey manages to outdo Jack Nicholson in over-acting as the villain, and, despite some reviews, there is 'light and shade' in the film, with quieter moments interspersing the more manic ones.\n\nBut there is also a lot wrong. Two-Face really has nothing going for him compared to the Riddler - just flipping a coin is hardly fascinating. Val Kilmer is totally miscast as Batman (and Bruce Wayne), and makes the role uninteresting.\n\nNicole Kidman is brilliant as usual, but has to act within the limitations she is set - the greatest being that she somehow has to avoid realising Bruce and Batman are one and the same: a common flaw in superhero/secret identity tales.\n\nAll in all, good escapist entertainment - but it could have been so much better!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is a continuation of the two \"Batman\" movies previously made and directed by Tim Burton at the turn of the eighties to the nineties. This time, who directs the freak-show is Joel Schumacher, with the participation of Val Kilmer (in the lead role), Tommy Lee Jones (Two-Face), Nicole Kidman (Dr. Chase) and Jim Carrey (Riddler).\n\nIf Burton's movies exaggerated the inability to show reality, the films directed by Schumacher show a reality that seems drenched in ecstasy and amphetamines. But the fault is not only the director, decidedly outdated, but also the absolutely miserable script, an abominable patchwork written by different hands. In fact, the actors cannot be blamed for the waste that this movie is. They had already given (and continued to give) evidences of their great talent in other films, and I'm sure they gave the best of themselves in this one too. As used to say a Portuguese actor named Nicolau Breyner (totally unknown to those who have never seen Portuguese cinema), \"is not because the work is bad that no longer deserves my total commitment.\" Unfortunately for the actors in this film, the work was bad. Lack of realism, scenery and costumes coming out of the imagination of a user of psychedelics, use and abuse of stereotypes are just some of the mistakes that the film will commit, frame after frame. Did it have something good? Yes. The first is that the film has an end; the second is the light social criticism made with the character Riddle, who uses television as a mass mental control, a maneuver that almost approximates with our reality, of current mass media.\n\nSo, Batman fans, beware: stay prudently far away from this film."

Now that I am older and have seen all of the Batman's several times I realize that Batman Forever while still decent was a major letdown from the previous two. Val Kilmer comes in and manages to pull off Batman but Bruce Wayne not so much. The chemistry with Nicole Kidman, wait a minute there was no chemistry. Nicole Kidman was awful in this movie and really was not needed. The best acting came from Jim Carrey who portrayed the insane and obsessive Edward Nygma/The Riddler but was a little over the top. Tommy Lee Jones was way over the top with his portrayal of Harvey Two Face. The show was much more lighter and humorous than the previous two but most likely because of a different directorial interpretation of Joel S. I still watch it from time to time and it keeps me entertained. Much more substance than story but still an OK watch.\n\n**1/2"

While watchable initially, his act quickly becomes boring and he's not good enough to convey any real depth to his character. Schumacher's Gotham is bright and colorful, and much more family friendly than Burton's vision. There are loud explosions and numerous set-pieces, some of which are well put together.\n\nBottomline: 7/10 Competent entry to the series, though Carrey annoys"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good: Maybe I'm crazy, but I feel like the fandom has warmed considerably on this movie. On rewatch, I have to admit I have as well. Asked me 10 years ago and I would have scoffed at the idea of this silly, brightly coloured mess of a movie. Now? I can't see a Batman movie like this coming out of Hollywood for at least another decade or so. I think back then, there was a sense that Batman should be taken seriously and (let's be honest) a bit of middle aged nerd gate keeping that made any praise for this movie basically impossible in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nNow though? After Batman has been (to some extent, rightfully) typecast as the \"dark, gritty\" superhero, Batman Forever is REFRESHING. It's so blatantly obvious Schumacher was trying to have fun with this one and, as people in the 90s were obsessed with the 1960s, it's appropriate that this movie feels as campy as the Adam West era Batman. I get why comic book fans would have wanted a more serious take on the character, but that interpretation of the character is pretty banal nowadays. Which is why I think a lot of people are expressing fondness for this movie.\n\nAnd it's not like this movie is a cheap downgrade either; it looks and feels expensive. The sets are incredible, the camera swoops around, there are hundreds of people in some of these scenes. The This is the third Batman movie in a row that I personally feel depicts Gotham City quite well. And yes, the musical score is excellent AGAIN. (The Batman movies seem the most consistent in this regard)\n\nVal Kilmer is a legitimately awesome Bruce Wayne; I love how he manages to come off as someone very damaged, yet he embodies the playboy billionaire that Wayne is kind of supposed to be. I like how this movie explores his inner pain and the reason he became Batman. Yes, his depiction of the Caped Crusader is totally comfortable with saying \"chicks dig the car,\" and it's silly as hell, but I kind of buy it. I can honestly see why many people think Kilmer was the best of the pre-Bale Batmans.\n\nBatman Forever was 1995's highest grossing movie and if you want to observe cinematic trends of the decade coming into their own, I'd suggest giving this a watch. Gaudy, soap opera style lighting? Music video style fog machines? Star studded cast? Lots of colour and booming music? Characters written in just the right way to appeal to all demographics? Check, check, and check. I always give extra points to time capsule movies.\n\nThe Bad: However, I can't pretend like there aren't issues here. This movie is very poorly paced and gets a bit repetitive; Batman goes to place, Two Face attacks. Rinse and repeat. By the end of the movie, I felt like I'd seen Two Face and the Riddler's zany schemes so many times, I stopped paying attention.\n\nSpeaking of the Riddler...yikes. Jim Carrey sold me for the first quarter of his performance, but honestly, he becomes extremely grating by the end of the movie. He's barely the Riddler too...\"riddles\" play absolutely no role in his plans. Tommy Lee Jones - save for his awesome lair - is mostly forgettable, unfortunately. Nicole Kidman is stunning and obviously having a blast, but she's again, nothing to write home about.\n\nRobin is the main problem of all of these additional characters. I don't think it was a bad idea to have him in this movie (it kind of makes sense given the two villains and from a character growth perspective). But Chris O' Donnell was not the right person for this role. He's way too old to be Robin and acts like a teenager despite looking like he's 25 with this faux tough guy vibe that feels obnoxious.\n\nThe Ugly: Batman Forever is about as good as a campy, silly Batman movie could have realistically been in the 1990s (we know that for certain, ahem). I don't think a live action Batman movie with this tone will come out in the foreseeable future, so I'm happy this movie exists."

        "review_detailed_main": "If any of you seen my YouTube channel, you know that I think this movie is pretty bad, and it is. Compared to the previous two, it's too campy and lacking good story. Let's start with the positives:\n\nJim Carrey does an amazing job as Riddler, I do believe he is my favorite Riddler. Because he's played characters like the Mask and Ace Ventura, he was the ideal pick for this role. Schumacher at least did that right. As well as his cool costume.\n\nChris O' Donnell is my favorite Robin so far. His origin story is touching and I love how his backstory parallels Batman's. His family was murdered by a psychopath and he wants to take his revenge. Also, the Robin costume is cool, too bad Robin didn't have much action sequences. But I loved the fight between him and Two-Face. I also loved that Two-Face was his archenemy.\n\nNow to the negatives:\n\nTommy Lee Jones' Two-Face is awful. He's way to manic and not calm and collected like the real Two-Face is. That's what made the real Two-Face scary. Is that he's cool and you don't know what his attitude is at that moment.\n\nVal Kilmer's Batman was pretty bad too. I don't understand how he can be considered Batman when all he wants to do is satisfy his sexual desires with Chase Meridian. She's the reason he gave up being Batman.\n\nFinally, the worst part of the movie. Chase Meridian. I know most of you are thinking: \"What are you talking about? She was the best part! She was soo sexy!\" To Be Honest, If the only reason why anyone likes her is because of her sex appeal, they have a real problem. The old Batman comics were never about liking women because of their bodies. We have to endure over forty minutes of Chase harassing Batman. On the rooftop, at a party, and even in her own bedroom. Which I'm wondering why would Batman even agree to meet her at her apartment? Superheroes probably get hit on by a lot of groupies, and he's going to let one woman ruin his career because he thinks she's hot??\n\nBesides that, we go through her rejecting Bruce and then Batman over and over again. How are we expected to cheer for them when on her first scenes with Batman she hits on him like a drunkard.\n\nSo yeah, the movie is that bad. If you must see it. See it for Carrey, but if you don't. You're not missing much."

        "review_detailed_main": "If people could accept the eccentricities of Tim Burton in other countries, why couldn't they accept it in Batman Returns in the states? \"Batman Forever\" is the third Batman movie but the first in the Joel Schumacher Bat-flicks that would be the last of entertainment before Batman and Robin made bat droppings.\n\nVal Kilmer does what he can to portray Batman while playing a daunted Bruce Wayne where we get to see flashbacks of his parents burial giving a hint on how he became Batman. He's not as mysterious like Michael Keaton in the first two installments of Tim Burton's bat franchise, but he does what he can. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are the villains in the movie for which Jones plays Two-Face, a criminal mastermind who makes his decision by flipping a coin and wants Batman dead; Carrey plays Edward Nygma, an eccentric genius who considers Bruce Wayne his idol but is rejected by Bruce and his boss (Ed Begley Jr. in a cameo) after his experiment of tampering with people's brainwaves isn't considered a good idea. Nicole Kidman plays the damsel in distress/psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian, who isn't as tempting as Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in \"Returns\", but isn't weak unlike Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) in \"Batman.\" While she falls for Batman, she's trying to help Bruce Wayne with his troubles before discovering some deep dark secrets. Chris O'Donnell is Dick Grayson/Robin, who is taken into Bruce's custody once Two-Face kills his parents and wants revenge on the criminal.\n\nWhat makes this film less attracted than the first two live action installments from Tim Burton or the animated masterpiece \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,\" is the loss of darkness from those three films where after the Batman Returns incident with millions of people petitioning all fast-food places from McDonalds to Burger King to get rid of the toys after seeing scenes of grotesque that could frighten children. (It was rated PG-13 you buffoons! Read the label!) Batman Forever is faithful to the campy 1960's TV show where some of the goofiness will leave some Bat fans walking out on the film or changing the channel. However, I do applaud the cinematographer for bringing in vibrant colors within this film as if it were a comic book.\n\nIt's not as dark and brilliant, but it has his moments as a good piece of entertainment."

Jim Carrey at times really over did the campy, circus like jokes. But he has some impressive acting moments in the movie. Nicole Kidman is beautiful and charismatic. However, Tommy Lee Jones was insufferable for me and annoying. His Harvey Dent/Two-face is unacceptable. Which is why at times The Riddler takes over him. Pleasant surprise to find U2 at the ending. I really do not understand the hate the movie gets. No comparison between this and the Chris Nolan trilogy."

Tommy Lee Jones is just as good as Two-Face, with some truly wicked moments.\n\nVal Kilmer and Chris O'Donnell were a problem. They're too close in age and look; unfortunately, Kilmer was the better actor while O'Donnell was the closer match to the character.

Val Kilmer is not very convincing in the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman and Nicole Kidman is wasted in this movie and is merely a very pretty face. Robin was actually better handled than he could have been. Robin is not what ruined this movie. The neon lights are not what ruined this movie either. Heck even the bat nipples on the costume didn't even ruin this movie. the overall generic plot that had the potential to be interesting is what ruined this movie. instead of exploring the villains they devour the screen with their over the top silliness. Jim Carry plays the riddler like every other film he has ever been in like the mask. Jim Carry is cool but his over the top performance becomes tedious and annoying. I hated Tommy lee Jones as Two-face in this movie. More like the Joker than Harvey dent. All he does is laugh the entire time he is on screen. what a waste of a good actor.

Character choices lack justification, only satisfying the script's cliche mold. Villains are flat with flimsy motivations, the romance is cringey, and the hero partnership is incompatible. Few scenes build characters or chemistry because the movie is preoccupied with predictable plot points and clumsy action. Thus, Batman Forever has nothing to connect with. It's an empty husk of a formulaic story structure, void of real thought or emotion. Furthermore, while some acting is forgivable, Carrey is annoying and O'Donnell is awkward.\n\nMeanwhile, the filmmaking of Batman Forever is misguided and cheap. The production has a theoretical style, but in actuality, it's muddled, hollow, and ugly. Sets look incomplete, lacking the details to be convincing. The cinematography has skillful moments, but that's outweighed by choppy orientation and cluttered composition. Plus, the editing is jagged, the sound is obnoxious, and the special effects are hideous. The music is competent, but doesn't fit with the film's erratic tone. Clearly, Schumacher wanted something campy, but he produced a grating, unsightly experience. Overall, Batman Forever is embarrassing. It's not fun and viewers should stay away.\n\nWriting: 2/10 Direction: 1/10 Cinematography: 3/10 Acting: 3/10 Editing: 2/10 Sound: 3/10 Score/Soundtrack: 5/10 Production Design: 2/10 Casting: 8/10 Effects: 3/10\n\nOverall Score: 3.2/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "What the Jesus happened here!?\n\nWhat started as a brilliant movie franchise went down the toilet quicker than you can say \"I'll get drive thru\". Literally everything went downhill: The acting, the directing, the sets, the plot, the score the... well as i've already said EVERYTHING.\n\nFirst lets start with the acting.\n\nVal Kilmer is as wooden as the contents of a Pine furniture store, seriously i've seen more life in corpses before. Chris o Donnell's acting shouldn't really be commented on as he was probably only put in the film so Schumacher could drool over him. Nicole Kidman looks hot as Chase Meridian (what kind of a stupid ass name is that) but that's about all. Most of the dialogue they give her is terrible anyway. Jim Carrey goes way overboard as the Riddler, but the sad thing is he's the best thing in this movie. But the icing on the Sh!t cake is Tommy Lee Jones as Two-face. In the comics Two face is a very complex character, but here he's played as a bad Joker rip off.\n\nJoel Schumacher is an awful director and nothing changes here.\n\nThe sets are also a step in the wrong direction. They make Gotham look like Las Vegas. The gorgeous, dark and artistic sets seen in Burtons movies are replaced with garish neon lights. They make me feel sick, heck even the Batmobile is made to look like a Mobile disco machine. Even a short sited villain could see Batman coming a mile off.\n\nThe plot left me confused, apparently the Riddler wants to read peoples minds or something...and..well...oh i don't know it's probably rubbish anyway. One thing though, at least it had Riddles in it. This hints that they may have glanced at a Batman comic before.\n\nThe score actually isn't that bad. But i loved Elfmans one so much that to me, this one hardly compares.\n\nIf you want to see decent Batman movies check out Batman (1989), Batman Returns, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight (i haven't seen it yet but i can already tell it's going to be awesome). This and it's sequel, *shudders* Batman and Robin should be avoided as if they were the plague. But you already knew that, didn't you?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman Forever (1995) is a movie that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Bruce Wayne finding a young man who loses his parents one night during a circus performance. Bruce Wayne was there when his family was lost and adopts the young boy, who of course becomes his side kick, Robin. We see the team development process while two villains are emerging - Two-Face and The Riddler. Does the new team stand a chance against these super villains?\n\nThis movie was directed by Joel Schumacher (Falling Down) and stars Val Kilmer (Tombstone), Jim Carrey (Ace Venture: Pet Detective), Tommy Lee Jones (Men in Black), Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut), Chris O'Donnell (The Three Musketeers), Drew Barrymore (50 First Dates) and Debi Mazar (Empire Records).\n\nThe storyline, dialogue and character writing for this was so bad. I felt bad for the cast which was impressive in capability versus what they were asked to deliver. I felt like Kilmer was too rigid, Kidman didn't feel natural, Carrey needed to be reeled in a bit and Jones needed more consistency in his delivery. The entire film felt off. This was a huge step down from the Burton films.\n\nOverall this is worth watching for Batman fans but has little entertainment value for non-diehard fans of the character. This movie is a huge disappointment that I would score a 3.5-4/10 and recommend skipping."

        "review_title": "Riddle me this, what is the expected outcome of a production with a lack of realism and endless stupidity?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Considering the indisputable disappointment of the unpromising \"Batman Returns\" the absence of Tim Burton as director of this reboot certainly would have created an optimistic atmosphere, as instead Burton returns as one of two producers. However with Burton's absence Joel Schumacher does nothing to amend the previous films mistakes and instead further plunges the Batman saga into disarray and failure, as \"Batman Forever\" not only provides little justice to the comics or the original 1989 \"Batman\", but somehow manages to offer a production even more unsatisfying and inadequate than its insufficient predecessor.\n\nWith the potential to deliver an at least enjoyable plot, the prolonged absurd events that transpire throughout result in an unthinkable and preposterous narrative in place of a previously optimistic outlook. In this appalling reboot Batman is forced to do battle with both The Riddler and Two Face, as their criminal agendas leave Gotham City in potential Peril. Unable to take down his villainous adversaries alone, The Caped Crusader has no choice but to converge with an inexperienced and irrational sidekick, \"Robin\". The plot simply fails to offer any suspense or tension due to an undesired collection of ludicrous events that have transformed Batman into something of a comical nightmare.At the centre of the plot, the Riddler's grand scheme to outdo the Caped Crusader along side his criminal accomplice offers little in terms realism and is utterly preposterous, as the dark tone that Burton set within the plot of his original Batman production has been utterly diminished. With a constant feeling of stupidity and thoughtlessness from the start to the thankful finish the inclusion of Robin was a risky decision that unsurprisingly failed to pay off, as his inferior and irritable figure in popular culture transfers over to this painful production and only serves to worsen it extensively.\n\nSchumacher's mistakes continue with the disappointing disregard for Burton's original lighting style. Tim Burton's iconic choice of lighting and colour pallet previously had allowed Gotham to be viewed as a hellish and criminally diseased city in chaos, yet with Schumacher's arrival this lighting associated master piece is disregarded along with any potentially realistic and pragmatic events. Instead Schumacher creates a disturbingly luminous and artificial appearance for Gotham City, as nothing in terms of the setting seems genuine as it only serves to add to the lack of realism that is a reoccurring issue throughout.\n\nThe casting choices do little to amend the films endless failures within its visuals and plot, as the performances from this collection of poorly represented characters fall short of satisfactory quality. Val Kilmer, a casting as surprising as any arrives as the 3rd actor to play Batman and with high standards set by Michael Keaton this only adds further to the second rate performance the viewers are subjected to. Kilmer's performance much like the deteriorated visuals purely lacks authenticity, as despite a satisfactory performance as the masked vigilante his portrayal of Bruce Wayne are where the true faults lie. His dialogue at times seems lifeless, yet the main issue is in his appearance as Kilmer just doesn't strike you as the alter ego leading billionaire which is not surprising when attaching himself to the most unsuited pair of ancient glasses that are constantly at his disposal. The second of the films heroes Chris O'Donnell as Robin delivers everything you would expect of the second class hero, unfortunately not in a positive way. Standing as inferior to Batman, his irrational and narrow minded attitude is undesired to say the least as this leads to Robin being a severely irritable and unlikable character. His dialogue in particular results in disastrous on screen line deliverance that both heroes are equally responsible for. Evenmoreso Nicole Kidman's role as Dr. Chase Meridian is equally as disappointing and fault ridden. The performance simply is unpolished, as her dialogue at times as well as her prematurely developed focus point in the narrative (her role as a psychologist) needed a lot more crucial attention.\n\nSurprisingly the villains in retrospect succeed in only just outshining their heroic adversaries. Jim Carrey manages to steal the spotlight in his portrayal of the Riddler, yet despite lacking the initial intellectual side seen in the comics (although it is somewhat attempted), the wacky lunatic approach Carrey adopts at times is certainly comical, not to mention the inclusion of a very creative costume design and dialogue is one of the films guilty pleasures. This performance allows him to stand as the figure head for the style Schumacher has created, despite this being a most likely unwanted title. His villainous counterpart Two Face however lacks this likability as Tommy Lee Jones' performance is a huge factor in branding Batman Forever as an anti climax title. Although Jones' employs a welcoming aggressive style for his portrayal of the coin wielding criminal as well as engaging in a fairly impressive on screen chemistry with Jim Carrey in at least a comical manner, a lot of extensive symbolism ruins a potentially accomplished performance. Not to mention the poor make up design of Two Face is not only inaccurate but visually idiotic. A considerable amount of failure surrounds Jones' performance due to Two Face's absence in the original 1989 \"Batman\". His absence in Burton's first production in terms of Dent's criminal persona evidently caused a high level of anticipation in light of his appearance in this shameful production, as Jones' performance simply didn't live up to expectations set by eager fans.\n\nAfter high hopes were initially set after the failures surrounding Tim Burton's previous instalment, nothing is improved on in its shameful predecessor thanks to Schumacher's unwelcoming style.It is clear that absence of both Tim Burton and Michael Keaton damaged the film extensively, as Gotham City now stands as an artificial wasteland worsened extensively by poor performances and a disastrous plot, as Schumacher's overly imaginative style has ensured Batman Forever's reputation as an utter failure to successfully reboot a deteriorating franchise."

I don't like the world created by the director at all. It is true that this was done according to the comics, but too many color palettes scream from every scene. It looks like a cartoon, but not a good one. A lot of things in the film are mediocre or bad, and nothing thrilled me. On paper this is a great cast and it was supposed to be a really good movie. The two main villains are strong acting names that I normally like, but they are completely safe here. Tommy Lee Jones plays a pure lunatic with no motive, and Jim Carrey is distinctly over the top and de facto plays himself, which he has done several times in various films very successfully, but here it looks bad. Dialogues are also often out of place, sometimes very weird and provoking face palms and cringes, which you by no means want in a Batman movie. Robin is not bad to some degree, although he could have been much better. Val Kilmer in the lead role is the least bad of all, so it turns out great. Nicole Kidman is also wasted in the role of a psychiatrist who is crazy about Batman. In the end, the memory of this film is much better than the current impression. Bad movie, weird vision, colorful set design, weird movie title, crazy bad guys and bad script."

This time though Batman is not taking these 2 miscreants on alone and gets some help from his well-known sidekick...\n\nIt seems that the production executives at Warner Bros decided on a lighter tone than the previous 2 films that were directed by Burton (allegedly Joel Schumacher wanted to keep the dark tone adopted by Burton) hence the rather drastically different feel that we have here with Batman Forever. To be totally honest I don't mind a lighter fun tone with superhero movies if the narrative and dialogue are strong; good one-liners and tongue-in-cheek humour are staple ingredients if you're going to adopt this approach, but you don't get any of that here.\n\nWhilst the narrative is more straight-forward in this film (just plain old revenge is the driver here) it's still not particularly engaging and the goofy tone to the film means that it is less action-orientated than the first 2 films and as a result is more dull. Things are not helped by ridiculous performances from both Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey; they make Jack Nicholson's hammy turn as the joker in Batman look restrained in comparison. Every time Jones and Carrey were on screen together it was almost like they were trying to out act each other and their performances are more embarrassing than funny. It's not really that surprising to see Carrey overacting as that has been his trademark in many of his films, but in quite a few of his comedy films this overacting is offset slightly by his material being funny which sadly it isn't here. Jones is more of a surprise though as he can be very good, but I guess the execs preferred a cartoonish performance rather than a fearsome one; this is something else that lets the film down in that the villains are not intimidating in Batman Forever; at least the Joker and Penguin had some menace about them. Val Kilmer has often got stick for his portrayal as Batman and whilst he isn't quite as good as Keaton, Kilmer in no way disgraces himself unlike some of his colleagues.\n\nPerhaps part of the film's failings lie with the fact that Joel Schumacher didn't want to make the film that the execs wanted him to make; that would at least explain why Batman Forever is so ridiculous. Maybe Schumacher simply didn't care?\n\nBut then again if he didn't care then why should we?"
