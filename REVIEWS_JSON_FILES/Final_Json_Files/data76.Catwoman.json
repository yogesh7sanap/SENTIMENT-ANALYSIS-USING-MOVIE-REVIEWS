Yep,in terms of 2004's most major cinematic disaster,Catwoman was,well,not to put too fine a pun on it,the cat that got the cream.Opening to abominable reviews,from everyone from Empire to Zoo magazine,it was ushered out of cinemas during the 'summer blockbuster' period almost as quickly as it was released.It then placed it's lead star in the embarrassing position of accepting a razzie award having earned an Oscar for her devastating turn in Monster's Ball only a few years earlier.\n\nIt is a pretty dreadful film,but there are arguably a lot worse.It's main problem is the story,which is so uninteresting,but the same could be said of the action on display.Also,this is a film that's managed a pretty notorious achievement.It makes Halle Berry look unsexy.The first suit we see her strutting around in is okay and fairly pleasing to the eye,but the main one (the one she's in on the poster) is really unsexy and unflattering.\n\nIf you want to engage your curiosity value,go right ahead,but I hope you know what you're letting yourself in for.**"

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow. I just watched this film on TV. I didn't pay to see it in theaters, although I am considering filing a lawsuit against my cable company for mental anguish. A friend and I decided to watch it on a whim and as the credits rolled my friend asked who wrote it, to which I replied \"You know, it's not always the writers fault.\" This is true is is not always the writer who messes up a story. But in this case it is very much the writers fault. Our story follows Patience as she goes from lovable shy girl to CAT-woman. I use the capitals in the word CAT because the writers seemed to feel the need to impress upon the audience at every possible turn that she is now a CAT-woman. I got the feeling that our trio of would-be poets would have preferred to stand in theaters with baseball bats labeled \"CAT-woman\" which they would swing at any member of the audience who didn't seem to appreciate the blatant cat references and mannerisms of Ms. Berry while screaming \"GET IT? SHE'S A CAT! ISN'T THAT COOL??? SHE'S A CAT!\" if they had been given the opportunity. The \"cat-bat\" is swung so often in this movie I began to feel the need for a catchers mask. The story is poorly thought out and the plot seems merely designed to let us see Halle in the leather suit a few times to distract us from considering the money wasted making this piece of litter. Oh and not to spoil things but the police in the movie are morons of the highest caliber. When presented with clues in the form of a used glass with DNA, fingerprints which were all over the jewelry store, or some lipstick? If you said fingerprints you'd be wrong, just as wrong as this movie."

Because one day, my friend, this train-wreck will be playing at your local buck and a quarter cinema @ midnight 30 with a line of freaks rolling along the walls. Each will be holding a ball of catnip in one hand and a jar of face cream in the other; and you'll be the #1 popularoso if you can recite along with this mutt. All I can say is WOW. That is the worst villain of all time: Marbleface.. my face has become marble from too much toxic face cream? No, this wasn't directed by a Frenchman. I mean it..This movies is A+ cheese. CGI catwoman to real Berry is stunning. Goes from sleek to klutzy instantly. If you like this movie like i do, your rolling on the floor. Every second is purely genius. If you liked it for real, your bus just pulled up, get away from the comp.\n\nHighlights: 1) This is not Catwoman. Catwoman is Selina Kyle; this is patience something or other. This movie was too embarrassing to be connected with such an awesome character 2) My fav part of the lame costume: the shoes with the toes sticking out. 3) Oooooh the most sinister thing we can think of: the fiend knows the face cream is ruining the beautiful girls faces, but wants to profit anyhow. This kind of villainy puts Lex Luthor to shame! 4) Catwoman's freak out with the catnip! This is when the Rocky Horror crowd crowd will toss the catnip balls at the screen 5) You cannot argue with the music too loud scene. period. A keg's nozzle will NOT squirt that far Patience. How did you achieve such a feat. You really are a super hero."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh, where to start...imagine all the intellectual depth of Showgirls, plus all the excessive and ridiculous special effects of Charlie's Angels, and then throw in some dialog crafted by whomever wrote for Governor Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze in the fourth Batman movie, and only then are you even close to a movie as awful as this.\n\nI suppose one should not expect much from a director who actually refers to himself as Pitof. But let's come back to that. Let's move on to Halle Berry. Note to Halle Berry: Letting Billy Bob Thornton ream you endlessly on camera is certainly degrading, but it was also a good career move--and you won an Oscar; feverishly eating catnip and licking people's faces on camera, however, is not a good career move--and you'll probably win a Razzie this time. They make you return Oscars for movies like this. Oh yeah, as for the supernatural explanation for Patience Phillips/Catwoman's superhero status--she gets CPR from an immortal Egyptian cat--I am not kidding.\n\nAnd then there is Benjamin Bratt, who happens to be a pretty solid actor, but could have very likely damaged a good career. If his participation in this movie isn't enough to stigmatize him, then I'm sure he had to pass up a lot of good roles because of all the time he spent having his foot surgically removed from his former agent's rectum. There is a scene in this movie--probably the worst, and that's no small achievement--that is reminiscent of that ridiculous scene in Daredevil where Jennifer Garner/Elektra and Ben Affleck/blind superhero have a Kung Fu fight at a playground in broad daylight; in this movie it's Halle Berry and Ben Bratt playing one-on-one hoops and her doing Catwoman flips and yet no one appears to be too amazed by this, much less pants-soiling surprised, and on top of that it has a sort of VH1/Color Me Bad/early New Edition video feel to it. And I'm really not sure what city this is all supposed to take place in--Gotham, Metropolis, the land beneath the whole in the cutting room floor--but apparently this place only has one detective, the unfortunate Bratt. No matter what the crime is--burglary, murder, domestic disturbance, interrupted ballet performance--he's always there.\n\nAs for the rest of the cast, that annoying woman from Mad TV--I know that's not specific enough; I mean the most annoying one who plays what I guess is supposed to be some bizarre Asian lady--well, she plays Catwoman's annoying and sort of slutty co-worker comic relief since Rosie O'Donnell was apparently unavailable.\n\nAnd then we come to Sharon Stone. Now I know her career is going down the crapper with all deliberate speed, but it's still hard to understand this one. The only thing I can guess is that the opportunity to break into silly, pseudo-feminist diatribes made this a role she couldn't turn down. Of course Sharon has often lamented the lack of good roles for older women in Hollywood, and she's absolutely right about that, but this is not the best way to lodge a complaint, and plus that's always been a little peculiar coming from an actress whose greatest cinematic achievement is the conspicuous exposure of her labia.\n\nBriefly back to this Pitof character--I thought that pretentious one-named idiot who did the Charlie's Angels movies--McG, I believe--was bad enough, but this guy is even more shameless and obviously lacking in talent. What's with these guys who've never made a movie and are already going by only one name? Don't you have to work up to that? I mean if is Scorsese wants to go by Marty, fine; if Tarantino wants to be just Quentin, or even just Q, whatever, but where does a hack like this get off using one name? This movie deserves every Razzie it receives, and while some reviewers may say it's not really that bad, remember, it took a lot of money to make this godawful thing, and if people don't speak out about how dreadful it really is, they just might make Catwoman 2. Can you live with that?"

If you see this movie and are over the age of 16, you will end up hating yourself for letting yourself rot for 104 minutes without getting anything back, except an increased feeling of wanting to get revenge on Hollywood. They say that it is very hard to get your script into a movie. Well, after seeing this movie, I think a one legged monkey could write a better script, without either pen or paper. The fact that Halle Berry even uses a male stunt double, makes me loose all respect for both her and this movie. Besides the stunt double thing, the movie still sucks. The dialog sucks, the acting is not even present and the action looks sloppy and poorly thought through. This movie actually made me like The Core better, which is pretty much impossible.

It might be inspired by my estimation of the film's display of only 12 minutes of living, breathing actors (which I will get into more below). Or it could possibly be inspired by the many errors that there wasn't even an attempt to cover, i.e.- Patience becomes Catwoman after wandering into a restricted area. How did she get into this restricted area, you ask? By walking through the door marked 'RESTRICTED AREA,' in bold, red text, which was simply unlocked and didn't even have a significant locking device on it. You know, I might've also hated the movie (not worthy of the word 'film') because of the pointless-undeveloped story line. And, really, it's not possible to look beyond the disgustingly audacious 'style' of one-named director, Pitof, which can only be described as the style of a headless chicken running through a maze of landmines. Oh, yes, said headless chicken is also being chased by angry natives wielding machetes.\n\nI mentioned above that I estimated that only 12 minutes of living, breathing actors were shown during the entire 140 minutes of film. Almost every sequence of the movie featuring an actor seemed to be butchered by the insertion of CGI's. I'm dead serious. I'm not just talking high-flying, sucky action sequences- I'm talking scenes of Catwoman walking to a motorcycle and calmly getting on it, and the other one that immediately comes to mind is a sequence where a man (a baddie) is simply walking. Yeah, walking. It seems agents and managers are really watching over their clients these days.\n\nNow, two questions I'm asking-\n\n1) What is the point of Catwoman? What the [expletive] does she do?\n\nIt's explained in the film that Midnight, the 'magical' cat, chose Patience to become Catwoman, but something is wrong here- CATWOMAN HAS NO PURPOSE!! Every other superhero out there has a purpose- They save people! It seems Catwoman's only purpose is to kill the people who attempted to kill her and chase a cricket or two. There's nothing else to her!\n\n2) Where is the REAL back story?\n\nIt sure as [expletive] wasn't in the film! Why wasn't she shocked and attempting to reason and deal with the emotional ass-kicking that would come with the revelation? She's told she's Catwoman by the clich\u00e9 cat lady, she buys a mask and nails and the result is the 'superhero.' It's adds up, but not into anything of any value whatsoever. Shame on you terrible writers!\n\nHalle Berry is a good actress. I'm not doubting or denying that. She fully deserved her Academy Award nomination and win for 2001's Monster's Ball, but something bad happened here. Her acting started awful and ended awful. I'm hoping the talents and reputation of Berry won't be harmed by her inadequate performance.\n\nNow, My request to Halle Berry- Ms. Berry, I want my money back. I never thought I could see such a terrible performance from an Oscar winning actress. Maybe you were just doing your best with the material? But, you know, that really is not a valid excuse. After reading the screenplay, you should've thrown it in the face of the agent who dared display it to you. How could you not notice how awful it was? Make some better choices and hopefully your career won't plummet as so many others have.\n\nI recall an interview with Ashley Judd, the original casting choice for Catwoman, who said something along the lines of, 'Turning down the role of Catwoman is one the things I regret the most.' Ashley, never say that again. You have only been saved by not appearing in this hilariously terrible film.\n\nListen people, don't waste your money on this glorified..er\u0085um..crap. It's not worth the $6-$15 bucks!\n\nSo now you ask, why not just give it a zero? Why the zero-point five? Well, The editing was sufficiently bad; the acting of Alex Borstein could've possibly taken some effort, appropriately placed CGI's were okay, and I like cats.\n\nDirecting 0/10, Writing 0/10, Cinematography 0.5/10, Editing 1/10, Acting 0.5/10, Overall Satisfaction 0/10\n\nFinal- 0.5/10"

Also, the woman professor scenes adds credibility to the story.\n\n-The computer animation was crude with Catwoman's movement being too fast and unnatural, perhaps due to poor s/w and slow computers of the time.

After all, I have a higher tolerance for crap than most people, and, once in a while, I like to see something that completely sucks. According to the critics and to voters on IMDb, Catwoman is supposed to suck bad. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, the movie really doesn't suck. I mean, yeah, it sucks, but it hardly plumbs the depths of true suckitude. Currently it sits at #35 on the IMDb bottom 100, but I can think of way more than 34 other movies that suck far worse than Catwoman. It is much more fair to say that it is a mediocre, perhaps slightly below average, action film. It has a few pros and lots of cons. The cons first: 1) The jumpy editing is awful. 2) Way too much CGI. Same problem with the 500 pound gorilla comic book movie out right now, as well. CGI is probably the worst thing ever to happen to cinema; it's hard to believe people are worshiping a technique that looks more fake than stop-motion. 3) Benjamin Bratt is a horrible actor, and the ugliest handsome man I've ever seen. 4) How the f*ck did Alex Borstein land a movie role? She should be doomed to die on MAD TV, the longest running train wreck of a show ever. 5) Crappy, crappy script. The pros: 1) The film looks wonderful, even though that's due mostly to the CGI (I guess when it's making buildings and inanimate objects like that, it's not so bad). The costume design, even apart from the Catwoman outfit. And if they gave out Oscars to hair stylists, the ones who worked on this film would have no competition. 2) Sharon Stone \u0096 not a great performance, by any means. Her character is downright silly, perhaps even nonsensical. But she's gorgeous and has a great presence. She makes a really boring villain somewhat more interesting. 3) Duh! Halle Berry! She might not have the best ability to choose roles. Perhaps she's just obsessed with money, and now that she's got a statuette, she's going to do everything in her power to become a billionaire. Whatever you can say about her, she's a great actress. Last year, she brought Gothika up a notch, and she does a lot to make Catwoman more entertaining than it ought to be. She plays the characters' two halves, the sweet, insecure girl and the dominatrix, very well. And, come on, I'd be lying if I said I didn't go to the movie because I thought Berry would be walking around in a leather outfit for a good portion of the movie. And, damn, she's hot. This makes the movie watchable, if nothing else. There's a shot where the camera circles Berry from toe to head right after she first dons the Catwoman which was worth the price of me embarrassing myself by handing my free pass over to the cute little theater girl at the counter. 5/10."

It is the most unmitigated piece of sh*t I have ever seen, worse still than Batman and Robin.\n\nThe plot is like an episode of Baywatch, Halle Berry is completely unsexy and the effects are pure rubbish. Not to mention the stinking direction. I hope that \"Pitof\" never sullies the cinema again with this kind of tripe.\n\nPlease, take heed: nobody else should ever see this atrocious film."

Halle Berry doesn't even become Catwoman until about 1/2 hour into the movie. Its not just bad, ITS SLOW TOO! Not worth a rent, not worth watching on cable, and not even worth stopping on when flipping through the channels.

But how stupid do they think we are??? Good Lord. They could as well have just dressed the three of them up in costumes and let them walk up and down a stage and it would have been much more entertaining than it actually was.\n\nI'm sorry, because I love Halle, I love Benjamin, and I don't really mind Sharon, but honestly I think this movie was pointless, anti-climactic and uninspired. It took me two days to get through it, and it's an experience I would love to push out of my memory. As I was watching it I was just praying I would see a shot of a half-naked Benjamin Bratt so I'd feel as if I got at least a quarter of my money's worth. Well...I got like an arm and a bit of chest. At least the guys got to see Halle prance, strut and jump about in a skin-tight leather suit. That's the best I can say."

        "review_title": "Dear Ms. Halle Berry, I want my money back",
        "review_detailed_main": "Dear Ms. Halle Berry:\n\nAfter watching Gothika earlier this year I wrote you a letter detailing my bewilderment with your film choices after so historically taking home an Academy Award for your role in Monster's Ball. My letter detailed how I felt you should have used your new bargaining power to solidify yourself amongst the great non-white actors of any era.\n\nI can only assume that my letter did not hit its target as I have just had the displeasure of watching your new big screen dud, Catwoman.\n\nLet me first say that I was intrigued upon first hearing about the role and when I saw the production stills of you in your Catwoman outfit, I became rather weak at the knees. After seeing your body in Monster's Ball and in Swordfish, I had the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end at the notion of you in a leather outfit with strategic rips throughout and a whip that would make you my first call of choice had I ever been in peril and needed a superhero s.t.a.t.\n\nI wasn't keen on the Catwoman character however. I was a religious watcher of the campy Batman television serial and the Catwoman villain as played by Julie Newmar and perfected by Ertha Kitt and I thought Catwoman was best on a show that didn't take itself seriously as, let's face it, having claws and a whip as your weapons of choice are kinda comical.\n\nBut a funny thing happened, Michelle Pfeiffer had a kick at the suit in 1992's Batman Returns and although the movie was a major disappointment and the character still seemed stale, I was at least intrigued by the woman behind the suit.\n\nTo make a long letter shorter, I then held out the smallest glimpse of hope for your entry. Then I had the unfortunate occurrence of seeing the trailer. What led you to this role I wondered. The script revealed nothing that would lead me to believe that this was a good career choice. In short, a woman who is the prettiest, most polite individual this side of both oceans, happens upon a corporate conspiracy of her employer, Hedare Beauty. A result of her findings, she is left for dead, but resurrects as someone who feels comfortable wearing leather and donning nails that leave marks on lovers that would make Freddy Krueger weep in appreciation. After settling a few gripes, she goes after the corporation heads while trying to maintain a relationship with her new boyfriend cop played rather naively by Benjamin Bratt.\n\nHmm, a revenge film where someone comes back from near death to use their new athletic ability acquired in their coma state into a world of hurt for all those that get in the way. Well, that has never been done before has it?\n\nFor the first time in almost five months, the theatre patrons did not bug me during your film. Usually, I am the unlucky sonofabitch that always seems to find the group of people either in front or behind that have no theatre manners. Just my luck, during Catwoman, the audience was silent (except of course for the roar of laughter that I am sure was unintended at certain points in the movie). Maybe in awe of the sheer audaciousness of the venture or maybe showing signs of embarrassment for you, barely a snore could be heard. I have never so much wanted to listen to someone talk about his or her golf game on the weekend during a film in many many a cat's life.\n\nSo, Ms. Berry before I wrote you regarding my lack of understanding as to your choices. This time, I am writing to you asking for my money back. The only good thing in Catwoman is your outfit and you took too long to adorn said costume. The special effects were the jerkiest I have seen this side of the new millennium and had it not been for Sharon Stone and a few good biting comments, I probably would have used my pen to start slashing the screen. Not being able to blame the director (someone named Pitof that had as much experience behind the camera as I have had between the sheets), I must apply the full 100% of my angst towards you.\n\nI leave it here at peace in hopes that Catwoman does not have 9-lives. From the reaction to the audience, I expect this made-for-Mystery-Science-Theatre waste of time will end up on video before you could lick up a bowl of milk with your hands behind you back.\n\nCome to think of it, THAT I would have paid for.\n\nwww.gregsrants.com"

This movie is not dark or serious, it's fun which in turn makes it entertaining. Cat Woman, in this film, is spontaneous, witty, and overall weird. However it makes sense that the character behaves in such a way. From a realistic point of view, if one were to be magically revived by cats, they're bound to experience some odd alterationa in their personality and actions. In any case, if you plan to watch this movie don't go in expecting comic book accuracy, but instead expect and entertaining quirky action flick and you'll probably enjoy it."

OK, it wasn't the best film ever, and yeah, there have been better Catwomen (namely, Julie Newmar and Michelle Pfeiffer), but when you sit and watch it with no expectations, it's actually kind of cool.\n\nFrom a superhero point of view it's a little one-sided- there aren't any real villains, at least, none who pose a real threat. Although Sharon Stone's character reminded me a tad of Poison Ivy, you know, super-beauty-products and all that jazz. But I quite liked that it showed how someone really quiet and shy can turn into a catty, sexy weirdo.\n\nNo offence meant to catty, sexy weirdos.\n\nCatwoman has no real point to it, other than to explain how Patience gets her powers. It would be good if there was a follow-up where she beat Batman / Superman / Poison Ivy or whoever, but since the film did so badly this seems about as likely to happen as pigs flying, hell freezing over, and Ozzy Osbourne announcing a fondness for Girls Aloud. Which is a shame, because I didn't think the film was that bad.\n\nThey'd have been better off doing a spin-off from the Batman flicks with Michelle P (or a lookalike) as Catwoman, so the back story wouldn't be necessary.\n\nDon't hate me for loving Catwoman. Please?"

Well, as a visual effects producer myself, I can say with confidence that he shouldn't give up his day job - directing VFX is very different to directing a film. Even having said that, the VFX in \"Catwoman\" were pathetic at best: half of it looked liked a poorly rendered video game!!! Please go back to France and do something else with your life like making coffee or croissants or pretending to be American.... 2hrs of my life WASTED!"

Actually if you look at the film in pieces its pretty good, unfortunately you have to look at it all at once on the big screen, which means that this movie is a car wreck.\n\nThe film looks good. Pitof, the director, is a former visual effects director so he knows how to make things look good. I love his first feature, Vidocq, and this film reminds me of that film with its wild moving camera, but here it doesn't always work. I have the sense that Pitof knew it wasn't going to work and got lost in his own thing.\n\nThe biggest flaw in this film is the script. The writing is cartoony, but not real. Everything that is said and happens seems off the rack as if this was put together by committee. Actually that's what I think happened, everyone putting in something but allowing no central vision to hold it all together. My guess it was the studio heads who really were calling the shots and putting things together according to a check list. Bad mistake since nothing fits together except fleetingly. The acting is okay, but the central casting of Halle Berry was wrong. She's not bad, indeed she is hyper-sexy at times, but she doesn't come across as tough as she really should. She comes off like a young girl playing dress up, who knows none of it is real. Thats great if you're in a bedroom, but not when we have to feel for our heroine.\n\nI don't blame her, someone should have seen that she wasn't working and removed her. Its not her fault that she isn't believable since she gives it her best shot. She has to learn to pick her roles or her career is over.\n\nThis is a film made by a group of talented people who should have known better. They should have seen this wasn't working and corrected it before it was too late.\n\n3 out of 10.\n\nPS Sharon Stone is too good as the villain. She may end up in danger of being typecast not only in her career but in life as well."

Catwoman's major problems are that it doesn't have much of a sense of humor (I don't recall laughing), it's the wrong time to be a pretentiously single-named french director, and it's a bit flat. Complaints that the plot is silly, are lost on me when a scientist with 4 robotic arms is considered terrific. Others hate superhero moves because they waste too much time on the \"origin\" storyline. Are they better when they jump directly to the hackneyed evil scientist (Alfred Molina) plot line? Some complain that the special effect are bad. Well, Spidermans swinging and tumbling through New York looks emphatically phony & cheesy to me also. Catwoman is shallow, but it's nowhere near as bad as the uniformly bad reviews whine.\n\nFor me, Spiderman 2 lacked any of the depth or values that everyone gushed about. I cannot stand the constant idiotic stupor on Tobey Maquire's face. Kirsten Dunst majorly sucks as an actress and the plot & villain were at least as stupid as any other. I am thoroughly ****ing tired of girlfriends who are models and actresses. An audience that swallows that tired line of horse**** is pretty stupid."

After watching this movie, my answer will now be Catwoman with Halle Berry in the role. Dressed in a sultry and revealing leather costume with a body as lithe as a cat and a sultry demeanor, she embodies sensuality. Unlike the earlier version that was a super villain, this iteration is fighting evil, specifically a cosmetic company that is about to release a new product. Their research has demonstrated that the product is dangerous to use, but the lure of massive profits is too great. The movements of Catwoman are a triumph of special effects, she leaps and walks on narrow surfaces like a cat and sometimes eats like a starved animal. Action scenes are intense and amazing to watch without there being too much smashing and bashing. Catwoman relies more on her avoidance skills than she does on simply whacking on her opponents. There is a dynamic love interest along with a best female friend that adds significant humor to the movie. The friend is not a sidekick in the usual sense, just a friend with a humorous bent that helps keep the alter ego of Catwoman thinking and acting like a human female. This is a fun movie to watch, one of the few superhero movies where women will enjoy the chic-flick aspects."

When she was Catwoman, she looked very sexy in that leather outfit. Now the script was weak at times, but I really liked the overall look of the film, with the splendid sets. The special effects were a bit ropey, and others where it looked part-animated, or like the Matrix, but they're weren't the weakest part of the movie, that was the script, which seemed rather muddled and trite. The supporting players, particularly Sharon Stone weren't that bad, and while slow-moving and predictable at times, neither was the plot.

The special effects equal spider-man's easily, as you should expect, and some of the action scenes are pretty good, sadly some are pretty bad too.\n\nAll in all the movie is below the standard it could, or even should be, but to give it a score of 1 is too harsh.

Halle \"I won an Oscar for sleeping with Billy Bob Thornton on camera\" Berry pretends to act here, portraying Patience Phillips (Selina Kyle anyone?) a loser who works at an evil makeup company, wherein she stumbles upon an evil makeup plot by Sharon Stone and her evil homosexual sidekick. I guess it makes sense, especially to a man simply known as Pitof, who directed this mess. Direction would allude to clarity, which this film does not contain, most likely due to the fact that does not speak English. If he could, there is NO WAY that he would have read the script and felt that it was appropriate to go ahead and make this into a film. Lets not even get into specifics here, because the cinematography, soundtrack, CGI, and especially the acting is the worst I have ever seen. If you don't believe me watch the basketball scene and see if you don't want to hurt people. Watching this film is like someone punching your mother in the face. I tried, I desperately tried to finish the film twice, and neither time my intelligence and dignity simply wouldn't let me. Its just that bad. I could go on and on..... the scene where the cat lady explains to Halle that cats choose one woman like Neo from the Matrix and that cats are magic and whatever else was said while I wasn't paying attention....the laughable fight scenes, the fact that she becomes cat like and licks herself clean and chases crickets etc....

I saw \"Ninja Force\", \"Psychocop\", \"Dreamcatcher\", \"Tank Girl\" and the worst peat of all time (until now), \"Manos, the Hands of Fate\", and, all you MST3k fans out there like me, I'm sorry to inform, this IS the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. I believed in Manos until I saw this. Make way for Catwoman up to worst #1! The chosen one that would beat Manos is finally here!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Moonlighting from the X-Men movies, Halle Berry unwisely portrays a shy, downtrodden advertising artist who gets stepped on by virtually everyone. When she finds out that the makeup firm she works for is planning to release a toxic skin cream that makes people ill if they don't keep using it, her bosses - Sharon Stone and that smug French guy from the Matrix sequels, conspire to have her bumped off, and she ends up drowning in raw sewage. She then reemerges as a \"cat woman\", with super agility and strength to rival that of Spider-Man or the Crow, and more ferocious personality, which she compliments by going with a short butch haircut instead of her initial long curly locks, and starts running around in a hooker/porn outfit with a whip and begins beating up people. Naturally, she's looking for revenge, but falling in love with cop Benjamin Bratt complicates things.\n\nLike so many others, my mind is boggled as to how this piece of crap came to fruition. The plot is horrible, the dialogue and acting laughably bad, and the special effects and action sequences pitiful. There are no words out there that can sufficiently describe this failure among failures. True the film has problems that extend well beyond her, but Halle Berry, a former Oscar winner, is simply terrible in this film - and no, showing off how great she looks on the edge of 40 does not redeem her for this piece of junk (either they offered her too much money or she was so depressed over her divorce she just didn't care what the work was as long as it got her away from home and her troubles). Hell, Benjamin Bratt probably gave the film's best performance, and he was stuck playing the hapless love interest/boy toy cop.\n\nIn closing, this piece of crap makes other similarly crappy films like \"King Arthur\" look good by comparison (and KA was awful)."

        "review_detailed_main": "24 July 2004. I had doubts, but Halle Berry makes a perrrfect catwoman with her moves and feline behavior. Though a terrible basketball player that stunt doubles or special effects can't hide, her transformation into Catwoman is one of the best personality changes besides The Fly. The action is good, Sharon Stone's script is a little weak though it's good to see her back. The ending is suggestive of Spiderman. Halle isn't so much erotic or sexual as sensual as she herself has described. There isn't so much sex as wild, unbridled heated freedom with enhanced senses. I would think perhaps, this movie might be too threatening for men and a bit out of the box for women. Yet, as a movie - the transformation of the independence of cats into a inhibited, passive women into her own is a powerful message and experience that Catwoman manages to capture. Seven out of Ten Stars."

As this abomination of modern cinema went on the only way it amazed me was by how much worse it could possibly get - only topping itself. Halle Berry was weak at best and Benjamin Bratt came up with the worst acting I've seen in about 3 years.\n\nThe plot only made things worse. WATCH OUT! KILLER FACE CREAM ON THE LOOSE! Can you get any more idiotic? I think not. Catwoman herself was not at all the bad-ass character she should have been, and only succeed in looking like a cross breed between a conehead and a goth. This movie is an embarrassment to the screen. With 90 million dollars you think they could have come up with something a little better for Christ Sakes."

I don't think she's totally responsible, she's working with an abysmal script.\n\nIs Catwoman a hero or villain, I've never known the answer to that, but here, she's too much of a villain, they didn't get the conflict right at all. The characters have zero chemistry.\n\nCatwoman is totally devoid of any of the character's background, there's no Gotham, no Batman, she's just Catwoman in name only.\n\nAlex Borstein did at least try.

        "review_detailed_main": "Usually, when you watch a movie with a bad reputation, you're pleasantly surprised. Or else, that means the movie is VERY bad (Judge Dredd, for example). Don't worry, unlike IMDb's infame-ous troll (I won't say his name but his initials are SV), I won't try to pretend Catwoman is the best superhero movie on the market. That would be a lie. But at least, it's watchable. I found myself watching it from the beginning to the end without feeling bored, despite the many plot holes and continuity errors.\n\nSo, what are Catwoman good parts? 1-The opening credits, with clippings and articles about cats and the previous Catwomen (I don't think Pitof directed it, since there's a similar scene in the movie which is poorly edited). 2-There are a few beautiful shots: the very first scene, an underwater shot of Patience, alas spoiled by a stupid voice-over; or the two shots of Catwoman in front of the moon. 3-The first Catwoman costume. The one she's wearing during the jewelry's heist. How come they thought the atrocious second costume was better? 4-Halle Berry. Like Helen Slater for Supergirl, Halle was blamed for Catwoman's failure while she was the only actress who took the project seriously and gave us a convincing acting, both as Patience and as Catwoman. She did the best she could with the script and truly didn't deserved her razzie.\n\nThe bad parts? 1-Pitof! He's unquestionably the worst director on the market! This man knows nothing about storytelling, using a dozen of shots when one would be sufficient, and sometimes filming everything except what is happening. Most of the fighting scenes are confusing since it's hard to figure what's going on. 2-The CGIs! As someone already noted, the best CGis are on par with Spider-Man's worst. Worst of all, they were used for scenes that would have looked better with trained animals, animatronics, stunt women and wire works. 3-The promotion. First, they pretended Catwoman was a serious movie with a message about female empowerment. When the movie bombed at the US box office but was about to be released in other countries, they said it was an humorous, tongue-in-check movie, not to be taken seriously (And note how Pitof, after telling everyone he had never read anything about the comic's Catwoman, was then pretending he has been a fan of the comic for years!). Unfortunately, Catwoman was none of both, so the spectators were disappointed in both cases. Not to mention the trailers only used the corniest scenes and dialogs of the movie. 4-The main villain. It would have been a great plot twist if Laurel was first shown as a likable allie for Catwoman, while her husband looked like the real villain (according to earlier Sharon's interviews, it seems it was the original intent). Unfortunately, she's immediately revealed as the main villain. Another problem is the villain in a good superhero movie must be a) someone with powers or abilities that made him equal or superior to the main character (Zord, Joker, Selena, Magneto, Green Goblin, Dr Octopus), b) someone smart enough to find the main character's weaknesses and use them to get the upper hand on him (Lex Luthor, Top Dollar); in both case: someone that can be a match for the hero(in). What are Laurel's powers? She can't be wounded. That's all. She get her indestructible ass kicked for about 3 minutes, get the upper hand for a few second, then get her ass kicked again and die. What a looser! I think it would have been better if the writers had made her a former Catwoman gone bad, with the same powers than Patience.\n\nAll in all, it's a movie that is watchable... on TV! This way, you don't get your guilty pleasure spoiled by the thought that you gave money for seeing this."

        "review_detailed_main": "# 23 of the IMDB Bottom 100 movies of all time? Please. I've seen enough stinkers in my time to know this isn't among the top 100 of them. Although not one of the best movies you'll ever see, it's certainly far from the worst.\n\nBecause I base what I'm going to see on the reviews of IMDB, I was going to take a pass on Catwoman. After all, I've never been led astray by IMDB.\n\nMy wife, a Berry fan, wanted to see it and since I'd seen everything else that was fit to be see (per IMDB) I decided to score a few points with the Missus by going. I kept my expectation low which was the best thing I could do since the only way to go is up. After watching it, I now know why the ratings were so low. All the purist DC comic fans were upset because they expected Michelle Pfeiffer and instead got Halle Berry. (The geeks that read the comic books. I happen to be a comic geek, but I understand that the formula can't always be followed -- so I try to keep an open mind.)\n\nOk, ok, so it doesn't follow the Batman series created by Bob Kane. Who says it has to? It had decent action and fairly simple story. (This story doesn't take a lot of brainpower to follow). We don't have Selina Kyle, but Patience Phillips a young artist stuck in a job drawing ads for Cosmetics Company. A rather wimpy character (ala Peter Parker) \u0096 She's a doormat for everyone around her. Then, she sees something that she's not supposed to. Bad guys try to take her down then, BAM - POW, an accident happens. Cat brings her back. (The resurrection of Phillips is a little lame, but, hey, this is based upon a comic book universe. Don't expect much). Now, the formally meek Phillips comes out of her 'cage' looking for revenge on the people that 'killed' her.\n\nI didn't walk out wishing for 2 hours of my life back. It could have been much worse. Go to this movie, forget about the comic books and enjoy a fairly decent show. The kids will like it and so should the men. Of course, when you return, input an honest vote. It doesn't deserve to be a 2.7 on a 10 scale. Maybe 5.5 out of 10, but not 2.7."

(Hats that were taken off for her are put back on again). Anyway, it almost doesn't need to be said that this is a pretty obviously clunky and shoddy film in many ways, with cheesy scenes around every corner. It has a bad script, poor direction and not very good acting. It's not helped much if you think back to earlier depictions of Catwoman from Lee Meriwether (Batman: The Movie (1966)) or Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns (1992)), both of whom were effortlessly cool, slinky and sexy, whereas Berry just...isn't so much.\n\nHowever, this is still a pretty watchable bit of nonsense. I have no idea how much it deviates from the actual comic-book character, as I know nothing about this. But it moves along at a good pace and we have a string of ridiculous scenes to appreciate as we go. It's not really helped by the fact that Catwoman really does not have a proper adversary to fight against but this is, like I say, down to poor writing. Berry is still decent fun to watch and the film is overall entertaining in a really daft way. It should really have been better though, given the potential."

When the action does come, it plays like a poor man's PS2 game. Only Sharon Stone gives a decent performance. When i go to see a Hollywood blockbuster i don't expect to see a movie that comes off as a poor clone of My big fat Greek wedding and Bridget Jones Diary and some CGI that looks like a afterthought. Also too much of the outside is obviously a studio set. When you think Judge Dredd and Supergirl got blasted by the critics and public, after seeing this Turkey. They may need to take a second look at some underrated comic strip movies. 1 out of 10, but it deserves ZERO."

It's pure junk food that will distract your senses for a split second and encourage you to perhaps buy an over-priced bowl of popcorn. Amazingly bad. My friend had to tell me the premise \"Sharon Stone invented a facial product that will destroy your face if you stop using it.\" I had to ask him to repeat it. No way did they spend $85 million dollars to base a movie on that premise. No chance. That's simply obscene. It's stupid. It's beyond base. But yes. Now, did the producers pick three writers randomly off the L.A. Metro and force them to decide on the premise before the next stop? What was their first choice? \"Act 1: Catwoman gets feline leukemia and must save herself by traveling into the sun for radiation treatment...\" This is a classic case of giving a project too much money and allowing utter amateurs to get behind and in front of the camera. Every scene was framed and executed with the absolute minimum of forethought. It was as though this had no development time. But I expect it had too much development time. Everyone said their piece, hundreds of opinions were sorted through and lastly, no one was satisfied. When the script started to suffer they hired another writer to help. Then the lawsuits started. So they split the credit but no one wanted or was able to IMPROVE THE SCRIPT. I guarantee the writers lost jobs because of this junk. The producer is probably delivering mail in Glendale. With $85 million dollars they made a movie that is not watchable except in the most vegetative state. It is distracting like chicken mcnuggets. You eat one and forget you ate it. Ten minutes later you wish you had eaten a carrot. A simple carrot. Or, out of respect for catwoman, a sardine."

Though a few people did note that the movie wasn't actually that bad. I can only assume that these are the cousins and uncles of Halle Berry, the producer and the rest of the crew's ilk, trying to pull a vicious joke on my behalf! The reason for the movie's score being so horrendous is VERY justified! To put it mildly.\n\nHalle Berry is supposed to be a frightened little girl without style, and in becoming Catwoman, she suddenly gets \"balls\" and style. Overnight! Wow! I loved what Tim Burton did in Batman with the Joker and his evil regime, this worked perfectly because the world surrounding the evil empire that the Joker built, matched. But HOW THE HELL DID anybody get the idea that An Evil Empire of Cosmetics, producing addictive and acid-like creams and potions, would ever seem remotely credible.\n\nBasically, just see the beginning and when she \"dies\" the mish-mash animated cats bringing Halle Berry back to life, sets the setting for the rest of the movie. And the amazing thing is that it is running on my TV right now, and I some horrified that I needed to post this for you. Now I will turn it off and NOT SEE the remaining 45 minutes, because I have some trash to take down, clothes to wash and other daily chores that suddenly have become violently important."

Berry saves the day by manifesting a luxuriously sexy amble and, thanks to special effects, doing the snazziest things in her feline S&M outfit. Granted, the fracas between Berry and Stone is inevitably a standard cat fight ho-hum, but what do makers of movies care? They rag on big business - will you believe that a company of awesome influence will inflict a hideously disfiguring beauty cream upon America's women and not expect within days that everyone will know and the game will be over? - because that's how the teeny weeny family businesses that are the Hollywood studios are: so furious at those mean big businesses destroying our nation - and they know if a sexy booty can be shaken, an otherwise ridiculous film may triumph."

(For those who watched Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman in one of the Batman movies, you'll see the vast differences in the movements and even facial expressions of the two ladies).\n\nFrankly this movie was a waste of time, money and film. If you don't believe me, go waste your time and money to find out for yourself.\n\nNot only were the visual effect and CGI's poorly done, but there was no plot, storyline or even plausible dialogue. The producers and scriptwriters did not build a credible hypothesis to launch their logic for this story.\n\nI'm sorry for all the comicbook catworman fans out there. They must have been pretty let down with this lame attempt. Sadly there isn't enough magic in the movies to make this film watchable."

Comic book characters are always flat and one-dimensional, but they should be so in a funny and entertaining way, with the exception of Catwoman every other character was uninteresting. Even Catwoman had few remarkable lines and her character was rather bland. The only redeeming feature of course is Halle in a ripped - and very revealing - leather outfit.

While it is cheesy and over the top, there are moments where it is fun to watch Halle Berry go wild with the crazy and manic material. Being the DC Comics character in nothing, but the title, Catwoman completely creates a new story for the feline heroine and it makes some very interesting choices in doing it. The zanier the film gets, the more watchability it retains because if it had stayed grounded, this would have little to no redeemable features. The story they tried to create is admirable, but I don't think there could've been any version of this film that turned out great."

I know, I know, it doesn't do to confess to such a thing in polite company. Suggest that I had taken leave of my senses and my only response is a shrug and a smile. Yet, I say, I enjoyed Catwoman. And not in that oh-so-ironic 'so bad it's good' way either. No, I liked it in the 'well I thought that was rather good, actually' kind of way. Which is particularly worrying, because if there is one thing that the world and his wife can agree on, it is that Catwoman is this year's shoe in for a golden turkey award (excepting 'Thunderbirds' and 'the Chronicles of Riddick' of course). I, however, found it to be a fun ride, full of good, schlocky moments, some nice action and boasting a confident visual style and a performance from Halle Berry which falls just the right side of parody. Oh, and the much-derided catsuit definitely gets my vote. I also thought the pairing with Benjamin Bratt worked a treat and Sharon Stone made a satisfying villain. In short, plenty to enjoy.\n\nNaturally, until now, I have been careful to keep this strangely positive reaction to myself. In fact I was so disturbed by my feelings for the movie that I decided to see it again just to make sure I had not missed any of the innumerable horrors the reviews had promised. The second time, to my astonishment, it seemed an even better movie than the first. A few details had initially bothered me. While, for example, some of the special effects worked really well (the transformation scene, Catwoman sliding between two buildings, or tumbling out of one in graceful slo-mo), some didn't. But on second viewing I was surprised to find all these details seemed somehow better integrated into the movie as a whole. I am now thinking of seeing the movie for a third time, but in a decidedly more relaxed frame of mind. Well, I have heard of people that have seen Catwoman up to seven times. Are we all mad? Perhaps so. But I guess we might as well enjoy it. It would be such a shame not to."

        "review_title": "What a Load of Kitty Litter",
        "review_detailed_main": "Out of all the Batman characters to have their own feature length movie, none have been more infamous than one of his greatest foes, Catwoman. Made after years of development hell following the successful albeit controversial Batman Returns, a stand alone Catwoman origin story was brought to the big screen in 2004, with Academy Award winning actress Halle Berry in the title role. Despite the hype, the film was met with scathing reviews and a poor financial performance, and is often considered one of the worst comic book movies of all time, let alone movies in general. After seeing the final result, it sure is one big pile of kitty litter.\n\nAs a more one off origin story of Catwoman, the film centers on meek designer Patience Phillips, who discovers a conspiracy within the cosmetics company Hedare Beauty that involves their biggest product possibly leading to serious health dilemmas. After being murdered by the conspirators, she is revived by Egyptian cats that grant her superhuman cat-like abilities and becomes the crime-fighting crusader Catwoman. While that plot may sound bizarrely fascinating on paper, the movie unfortunately comes off as way too bizarre for its own good. The main fact that the villains in the movie are makeup company owners is ridiculous enough, but their actual motives are even more baffling once you get into the film's poor take on corporate expansion. It's really insulting how the movie tries to present this huge theme of female empowerment, yet it comes off as manipulatively sexist, as if the script was made up by a bunch of old men in a boardroom rather than a passionate screenwriter. Then again, the whole movie reeks of sexual overtones that you can't take it that seriously.\n\nA good example would have to be Catwoman's outfit, which looks so skimpy and unintentionally degrading that Patience comes off more as a gimp than an actual superhero. Also, given that the film's director was formerly a visual effects artist, one can understand a lot of gritty backdrops and computer effects throughout, including some portions of a computer generated Catwoman for hard to reach places. The sets do look pretty grim and disturbing from time to time, but the visual effects actually detract from their frightening look and age the film like rancid cat milk. That joke may have been bad, but it's still better than any of the tired cat puns this film's script coughs up. However, the greatest crime the film committed overall might have to be the editing. A lot of the sequences have so many cuts per second, and it becomes so hard to comprehend what is happening on screen, be it an action scene or a casual conversation. It feels like the filmmakers couldn't trust their audience to sit still for one whole minute that they desperately wanted to jump around with one shot after another.\n\nIf there is one true saving grace throughout the whole movie, it would have to be Halle Berry performing her damndest as Patience/Catwoman. Granted, her hoaky acting does explain why she received a Razzie, but she is definitely the most convincing in terms of bringing this oddball woman to life through the weak dialogue and jumbled narrative. She also does a good job transitioning from neurotically quiet mess to cat conniving crusader, even if some of her scenes can come off as a little too corny. As for the rest of the cast, Benjamin Bratt is hammily charismatic as detective Tom Lone, Alex Borstein is annoying as Patience's comical friend Sally, and Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson might have the most boring roles in the whole movie: the Hedares. While seemingly subtly sly at first, they barely have much going on outside of being the one note baddies, and let's just their performances are not the least believable in the slightest. It really is saying something when a movie about a feline-esque superheroine has a less fascinating cast than it should.\n\nCatwoman has seen better days in a lot of Batman accompanied properties, but it seems like that little kitty couldn't quite land on her own feet. After almost twenty years, Halle Berry's Catwoman venture still stands as one of the most laughable embarrassments of an ambitious experiment gone horribly wrong. Maybe one day, the cunning feline will get her chance to truly shine once more standing alone, but there's a reason why even die hard comic book fans don't like to look back on stuff like this. At least now we can remember Halle Berry as the ultimate dual Oscar and Razzie owner?"

I'm not sure which music videos they watch, the ones I see have better editing and actually some direction.\n\nMost know the plot already, Patience Philips a shy person, blah blah blah, gets killed, blah blah blah, brought back to life from a cat, blah blah blah, seeks revenge, blah blah blah, dates cute cop, blah blah blah, fights Sharon Stone. The plot is not original, so one wouldn't go to see it for the plot. Not when they could just rent the Crow.\n\nThe editing and direction in the film is shaky. At times, the direction seems masterful, the opening credits were great. But after that the film fails. During a scene with just two people talking for about a minute or so, the camera switches angles about 6 or more times, and not even at logical places. The action sequences were horribly edited, to the point I nearly got motion sick.\n\nThe acting? I know Halle has an Oscar, but geeze... The woman is no Catwoman. When she's Patience Philips, well... Let's just say, I saw nothing unremarkable about her. She was hot and sweet. Had this been in real life she'd have men lined up at the door. At least Michelle's Catwoman at least looked like a geek. Sharon Stone is a very, very weak villain. Nothing threatening about her, she wasn't even a fun villain. And then, Benjamin Bratt who plays the cop that replaces the caper crusader? Well, let's just say, I think he was trying to suppress a snicker through the whole thing. He was eye candy for the ladies, although the character wasn't quite as stupid as some people make him out, he's still not the brightest crayon in the box. Sally, Patience's friend was the comedy relief. If you want cheap sex jokes you could get on cable, or even network TV, then she's right up your alley.\n\nThe effects were simply laughable. Really, they had a CGI of a cat (They could've used a real one in the scene easily.) they have a CGI of Catwoman walking and they always use CGI on the whip. And the way Catwoman moves... Its actually more like a spider then a cat. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised it they simply took Spiderman's scenes and changed him into Catwoman.\n\nLastly, was it entertaining? No. Not for me, I was counting the minutes for it to end. I could've been wowed, really, the opening credits were fabulous. But I'm guessing they knew that too since they used the same scene three times....\n\nIn the end, if I had to review it on the 4 star guideline, I'd give it zero, or perhaps 1/2 of a star. It really is that bad. When there's so many other good films out there, why waste money on this kitty?"

I can assure you I am not one of those people, when I see a spade I call it a spade and to be honest I would rather be beaten with a spade than see this piece of c*** again!\n\nI'm a self confessed comic book nerd and always have low expectations for movies of these but this really was a justifiable disappoint. I saw the trailers and thought wow Halle Berry + Catsuit = Can't go wrong. Well it did. The storyline had more holes than a colander. It was really boring despite being \"full of action\" and most the time made no sense. They also overused the CGI, nothing against CGI if it actually looks good. Don't get me started on the goofs, if I was planning on reviewing it fair enough I'll be scanning for any mistakes but this was something that I was casually watching on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nIf you want to see the film go for it. You may really love it but for me it was so bad and not even the \"so bad it was good/funny\".\n\nI certainly never plan on watching this again."

        "review_detailed_main": "While one would have to be kitten to call this the cat's meow, \"Catwoman\" is so bad that it may be catalogued as good--so catastrophic in conception and made of the waste one finds in the litter box, that it's as amusing as watching a kitty playing with yarn. At least, it left me feline good. Halle Berry's performance, while surely compared to coughing up a hairball by someone, was worth it merely as the catalyst for her to hold up her Oscar, for \"Monster's Ball\" (2001), in one hand and her Razzie, for this, in the other as she accepted her award at the Golden Raspberry ceremony.\n\nHer Patience--already baring the name of a pet--begins generically as supposedly less-attractive, or at least not as sexy, although all this amounts to is Berry (this sentence is cataphoric, by the way) generally pussy-footing through life and wearing loose clothes. While not exactly the cat's pajamas, her wardrobe is loose enough to comfortably sleep in. Since it's a superhero movie with a female lead, the filmmakers, apparently, thought it appropriate to turn the first part into a rom-com. \"Saturday Night Live\" later made a joke of a Black Widow movie as a rom-com, seemingly too scatty to recall that DC and Warner Bros. had already done that with their superheroine here. Thus, Patience has two co-worker friends who interfere in her sex life, one being the rotund comic-relief type and the other the stereotypical gay guy friend. They even provided her with a latex fetish garment, which she repurposes for her first catsuit. And much of the movie is spent on this mouser dating that hot detective from \"Law & Order,\" including some ludicrously-inappropriate sexual flirtation and pawing during a one-on-one basketball game they perform in front of a crowd of school children.\n\nWhile the rom-com high jinks continue, we're also introduced to some hissingly-bad CGI for everything from artificial environments, to magical cats, to Berry leaping across buildings, along with a wretched, if catchy, pop-music score, whooshing sound effects for kicks and twirls and dizzying edits to workaround the choreographed fight moves. Patience receives her second of nine lives by being resurrected by an Egyptian Mau's bad breath, which causes her to become another breed of cat, so to speak--actually, some sort of human-CGI-cat hybrid, as she rubs catnip on her face, prances about her furniture, hisses at barking dogs, scratches men, hates rain, loves sushi and lies in bed eating eight cans of tuna by hand. She learns that a cat in gloves catches no mice and, thus, starts running around and performing catwalks on ledges in a shredded dominatrix cat costume complete with a whip.\n\nThe best worst thing of all here, however, has to be the dialogue, which is full of some remarkably bad comebacks, puns and, if lucky, catchwords and catchphrases. While Patience is a graphic artist, she lays into her boss with the musical reference, \"Then let me try the remix.\" Even better, she responds to another villain's line of \"game over,\" with the least clever of rejoinders, \"Guess what. It's overtime.\" And, back to the rom-com part, her retort to a warning of a deadly loose electric cable is, \"I know I felt a spark between us.\" Then, of course, there are the cat puns: \"What a purr-fect idea\" or \"Cat got your tongue,\" when, in fact, she is holding his tongue. She even orders a White Russian at a nightclub, but with \"no ice, hold the vodka, hold the Kahlua.\"\n\nSharon Stone is also an appropriately catty glamour puss scorned by her tomcat hubby (in other words, she doesn't like \"Sharon\" her man). There's some ridiculous plot involving a beauty product with hideous side effects, and Berry tries to let this cat out of the bag, but it also gives Stone superpower skin... like a stone, so that she and Berry may catfight, or, if you prefer, fight like cats and dogs. Otherwise, there's a silly science scene where a technician can supposedly tell personalities and genders from handwriting samples. Another scene has Berry slipping like a cat through the bars of a jail cell. There are also clich\u00e9d shots of her posed in front of a gigantic moon, and the copycatted orange-and-teal color grading helps make everything look super unrealistic. It's enough to make a cat laugh."

And if she really digs this handsome cop, why doesn't she make more of an effort to keep him around? (Their relationship is like a screenwriter's afterthought.) It's never explained why Patience drops off the art-designs down in the belly of the building--or why the heads of the cosmetics firm think that, by not saying anything about their toxic product, they'll be in the clear when it's discovered somethings wrong with it. But two segments really stand out as idiotic: Halle Berry challenging Benjamin Bratt to a little one-on-one court action and Berry's night flight on a motorcycle (did becoming a cat-woman suddenly make her adept at sports and cycles?). There's no character here, so we really don't care about Catwoman--there's no interest in what's at stake for her. The villains (particularly Sharon Stone) are so poorly defined, we can't even accept a double-cross on face value. And the lovey-dovey stuff seems shoehorned in at the last minute, which bears the question: Why do the makers of these superhero movies always feel their films need a romantic angle? If it's here to titillate the target audience with some hot action, then that failed, too. *1/2 from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have not read a ton of comics that this character appears in, but I do know enough about her to realize that she's pretty far from this portrayal. However, that alone is not necessarily a negative, unless you are looking for a depiction that follows the source material, in which case, you should know up front, this ain't it. It can be justified to alter fiction over time. This flick serves a couple of purposes, although not one of them was intentional. The two most obvious being revealing that, in spite of the undeniable appeal, a sexy woman behaving in a cat-like manner can actually make her less attractive; and proving that Pitof, as I realized when I watched Vidocq, has absolutely no business directing. He can do FX, few problems there. Meanwhile, any movie he does is going to be driven by the special effects(which are frankly, terrible at times in this), and otherwise be flat and soulless. I mean it, compare any frame of this to that of Batman Returns, when Pfeiffer is on-screen. I've got no issue with Berry, or her skin color. She's done pretty good acting elsewhere. And she definitely looks hot, and not only in this. Here, you too often have to look past the ridiculous things they have her do, right down to numerous of her movements. Burton's transformation sequence was Gothic and disturbing... this one is silly, plain and simple. Meet Patience Philips. She is sad. That does not appear to stem from her fashion sense being arrested sometime in the 80's and continuing to be held for questioning... no, it's because she's mousy and scared. Then... actually, I'll spare you the details. A lot of the plot is beyond ludicrous, and this thing gets stupider the further it goes. The basket scene does add some weight to any insistent arguing that said sport... and indeed, many others that involve men and balls... are homo-erotic. Acting tends to be poor. Merv from the Matrix sequels is here, playing his role in that same way, presumably because it was not believed that American audiences could handle a foreigner doing 2 completely different performances in as many years. The fight scenes are OK. There's actually a decent idea here and there in this. The comedy is never funny. The title female is overly powerful, and nothing particularly threatens her. They go to great lengths to make her seem like a superhero, because, to Hollywood, ambiguity is a city in Russia. I recommend this solely to those with low standards, and anyone wishing to witness Halle embarrass herself. 1/10"

It took Michelle Pfeiffer's equally iconic portrayal of the Selina Kyle/Cat Woman character in Tim Burton's excellent \"Batman Returns\" to bring the idea of a Cat Woman film to the forefront. What might have sound like an appealing proposition back in 1992 somehow didn't feel as relevant more than a decade later. And for good reason...\n\nThe shy Patience Phillips stumbles upon the dirty secrets of her employer and gets killed for it. Not to worry though since she's brought back to life by some cat/deity of some kind and is reborn as the ballsy Catwoman so she can get an hair do, go shopping, do a bit of clubbing and incidentally find out who killed her and why... Oh and then she meets some generically good looking cop along the way... Vengeance and impossible love story ensues. The end. No, I mean it: the end.\n\nEverything about \"Catwoman\" smells like left overs, the remains of a Sunday dinner stretched into a Monday casserole, exhausted from having been tried and done so many times before and bloated out of all proportions with stupidity and pointlessness so the script would be slightly thicker than a RSPCA leaflet. It would be very difficult to single out one particularly bad aspect of \"Catwoman\" from another as they are effectively interwoven into a complete disaster. This is such a formulaic Hollywood product that everything about its story (or lack of thereof) mired with plot holes the size of Australia is already known to whoever has ever watched a film before. Worse of all, it is so stereotypically marketed (even through its soundtrack) that all that was missing was Halle Berry snapping her fingers while saying to Sharon Stone \"huh huh! No you don't girlfriend!\". The performances of its cast is made of sheer non-commitment, an acute disaffection that is both understandable judging by the overall b\u00eatise of the piece and insulting considering that people had to pay to see it. Last but certainly not least, the faux gloss of its CGI effects and the posturing of most of its camera works all conspire to hide the general lack of depth but actually manage to raise the bar of ugliness to brand new heights. So much so that it would be difficult to believe that it was all accidental.\n\nIt boggles the mind to think that Halle Berry could have ever thought \"Catwoman\" to be a good career move. Witnessing her, dressed for the oldest profession, struggling to act through this aimless debacle, the word \"trapped\" springs to mind. Was this some contractual obligations? What is certain here is that artistic integrity took a back seat after enough zeros were laid down on a cheque."

Eventually we meet Hallie Berry's Character mild mannered, quiet and UN attractive Patience Phillips, who works for Sharon Stone(Who through out the movie is an unpleasant scowling bitch) at a Make up company as the Art Designer for their magazine ads. They're famous for apparently a whole line of make up, but all they seem to supply is Beau Line a deadly face cream. Not only this, but Sharon Stone's husband is as unpleasant and cold hearted as she and is also sleeping with their make up model. Sharon is mad at him and acts like she is a five year old who never got her Barbie for Christmas. Patience has a friend, played by the otherwise talented Alex Borstein(More well known as the voice of Lois Griffin on Family Guy)as Sally, her wisecracking friend who makes awful wisecracks through out the movie, AND is addicted to Beau Line which causes her to faint and keep her under hospital care. After we assemble these characters, we show Patience and her daily life. This includes her trying and failing at stopping a party next door, and trying to save a kitty and almost killing herself, but is saved by Benjamin Bratt, or Mr. Ex Julia Roberts. He's a cop(again), she's an artist with make up, so opposites attract. Pretty soon, Beau Line is ready to ship in a week or so, and Patience finds out that it's deadly and damages skin severely(Which from what I've heard sounds like Batman, or I'm just mixing up my movies.) They find out that she found out and kill her. Eventually, cats find her and after saving a cat becomes reborn as cat woman.\n\nA problem I had was that Hallie Berry, as talented as she is abuses her Cat powers by playing Ben Bratt 1 on 1 in basketball, and not only eats tuna like a junkie,but orders milk at a bar, and is attached to a ball of catnip. Some other parts involve a makeover in 5 seconds, Catwoman learns how to use a whip after one try, and robs, but gives almost every item back, and the most famous part, when Patience struts out in an S&M style cat suit as Catwoman. Also, the scenes with Sharon Stone are just as unpleasant as the last. She never smiles, kills her husband and frames Catwoman, and just has an icy voice that makes her the irritating Ice Queen she really is. Also, who thought of the idea of a Shut in Cat lady as one of Catwoman's friends anyway? Or who came up with the soundtrack sounding like music at an orgy or a rave.\n\nAll in all, this movie is like i said terrible, but watchable, on HBO don't rent, cause you won't want to pay for this hairball of a popcorn flick."

        "review_detailed_main": "Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a visual artist who is stuck working in the advertising division of a large beauty product manufacturer, Hedare. When she acquires information that could potentially put the company out of business, they try to dispose of her. Because she had previously, unwittingly passed a \"test\", however, she is saved by a group of cats and transformed into a Catwoman.\n\nFirst, let me note that I loved this film. It's a 10 out of 10 for me. Since I'm well aware that most critics, professional and amateur alike, have trashed this film, I'll focus on why I thought it was so good. Maybe this will help some new viewers consider giving it a look, and possibly encourage some reevaluation by those who have already seen the film.\n\nThe script immediately drew me into the film, and although I'm male, I identified with Patience. I'm also a visual artist. I have also worked for a company similar to Hedare in the past (although a much smaller and less nefarious beauty product company). I lived in an apartment that looked, on the outside, almost exactly the same as Patience's apartment complex. I also had neighbors who night after night played loud music or television until three or four a.m., while I first tried to block out the sound in any way that I could, then asked politely for them to turn the music down, and so on, until I finally called the cops on them so I could get some sleep.\n\nNot that I need to identify with a character to like a film, but that made this one have extra resonance with me in the beginning. Additionally, I was immediately drawn in by the fantastic cinematography and set design. Those kinds of things are just as important in a movie as the story is. Film is a visual and aural artform. The whole package is important. Creative, attractive visuals such as those in Catwoman are part of the package.\n\nThe script, including the subtexts, worked well for me. Catwoman is a film about discovering identities, peeling away literal and metaphorical masks, and the difference between various stages of public versus private \"faces\". That the plot is centered on a beauty product manufacturer, then, is perfect. These themes permeate every aspect of the film. For example, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) is continually peeling away the appearances of Patience, throughout the length of the film, and Patience is doing the same for herself--discovering her \"true self\". I can't think of a scene that doesn't touch on this theme in some way. That's very clever and thought-provoking scriptwriting, and it doesn't end there. There are also themes about femininity cleverly woven through the film, for example.\n\nI thought the cast did a fantastic job. Berry is great as a Catwoman, and subtly referenced most of the previous screen Catwomen. She also incorporated a lot of crafty cat-like behavior. I enjoyed the supporting cast, especially Alex Borstein as Patience's friend, Sally. The effects worked well for me, and at times they were also very subtle and clever, such as Catwoman's whip representing a tail in many shots (most of this was achieved via digital effects). I was also impressed with the creativity and different approach of many of the fight scenes. It was nice to see Brazilian martial arts incorporated for a change.\n\nSome of the negative criticism probably stems from a kind of purism that is disproportionately found among comic book fans when it comes to comic book films. I'm not much of a purist, but in any event, for anyone paying close attention, you'd note that Berry's character isn't supposed to be Selina Kyle. In the mythology of as presented here, \"Catwoman\" isn't a lone token, but a type. Patience is just another instantiation of a long line of catwomen. So departures from previous portrayals of Selina Kyle aren't relevant, even if we believed that filmmakers were obligated in some way to previous depictions of the \"same\" fictional characters (which I don't believe, not being a purist).\n\nCatwoman is worth a (second) chance if you can leave some of your preconceptions at the door and if you're prepared to think a bit about a comic book film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just viewed my birthday present last evening and in a word, this was loads of fun!!!!! Halle is as luscious as ever.\n\nFirst of all, this is basic comic book fare. Therefore those of you expecting a Masterpiece Theatre production should get a grip.\n\nOf course the plot may not have been overwhelming. But neither was it in Superman, Spider Man, Hellboy, Hulk, or Spider Man II for that matter.\n\nAnd why would Halle attach herself to a project such as this? There are infinitely more important intangibles here at work.\n\nHow many young girls of color ever get to have such a beautiful, award-winning actress, of color, personify the empowerment of women? I submit that Catwoman is a wonderful exercise in showing how pivotal one's blossoming can be - the movie also addresses the dilemma of accepting responsibility for one's own actions as well an interesting foray into choosing good over evil (or vice-versa).\n\nOf course I have seen movies with better plots, tighter screenplays, more intricate direction, more elaborate sets, blah, blah, blah.\n\nOne thing is certain: NONE of them have Halle Berry slinking up and down the street as Catwoman, the LAST Dominatrix, so sexy and fetching and just plain WORKIN' NERVES!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it just doesn't get much better than THAT!!!!! The movie was fun. Did it need (or purport to be) more than that? I daresay any of the other recent comic book adaptations provided much more either and yet critics were infinitely kinder. No matter. The nature of the beast.\n\nHalle and company made a fun, entertaining movie that teaches basic life lessons in a familiar milieu. Additionally, a priceless special feature of the DVD was the \"Face of Catwoman\", a featurette chronicling Catwoman's many incarnations narrated by none other than Eartha Kitt!!!!!!!"

        "review_title": "The entertainment is mostly in Berry's hips",
        "review_detailed_main": "It is confusing to why any distributor would want to release a film explaining the background of a less noted character. Catwoman is a very intriguing character but as the saying goes, some mysteries are better left unsolved. It's good to leave the audience questioning the background of certain characters, otherwise the mind isn't allowed to explore and create the reasons why that character is the way they are.\n\nThis version of Catwoman tells the story of down on her luck artist Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) who ends up learning a dark secret behind the company that she works for. Once she discovers the truth she's transformed into a human with super cat-like reflexes by a bazillion year old tabby called Midnight. And the fact that Phillips is now called herself \"Catwoman\" is not a new thing. According to the script, there have been woman picked by Midnight to become this Catwoman in the past. So in a sense, the term Catwoman has now been generalized. So now it's just a term for those specific ones chosen by Midnight. It's a neat theory, but this should have not been penned into the actual script that was to be approved.\n\nThe whole concept of Catwoman was about her strong interest in the way of the feline. To think that she was more inclined to just acting like a cat than having super skills like a cat was more acceptable. Then there's the subplot of Tom Lone, a police officer, who dresses nothing like one. Lone is played by Benjamin Bratt who ends up getting wound up in the usual superhero clich\u00e9: the superhero doesn't tell the lover who they really are until the lover finds out for himself or herself.\n\nPlus, as any comic book fan would know, although Catwoman loves to flirt with men, she never settles down. She's a solitary worker. And for almost the whole time during this movie, Phillips is trying to settle down with Lone. Sharon Stone also plays in here, and like most films, she's a baddie. Still seductive, and still dangerous and that's good. Which now leads to the few positives in this bad apple.\n\nHalle Berry as Catwoman was a fair choice. Berry can be alluring and quite lethal at the same time so that's a plus. The way she moves is also attractive and her skills are impressive even if there were times where I knew I was completely looking at CGI on the screen. That frustrated me, how could a production with such a high budget make a film with such obvious computer renderings? We're better than that people! Same goes for the cats too; supposedly 43 cats were trained for this film. I only saw one real one and that was the cat who played Midnight and even then, there were times where it looked completely fake. What's the deal?!\n\nHowever, the action scenes were nice. They're not amazing or spectacular but they were entertaining none the less. The flexibility of Catwoman was always cool to watch but that's about it. The dialog was too puny for me. There were too many lines that were said one right after the next that had a cat pun in the sentence. Enough! This isn't a contest, screenwriters! Not even the music by Klaus Badelt helped and he's not a bad composer either! His score to K-19: The Widowmaker (2002) was very moving but it feels like here, he got lazy. Hey Badelt, wake up!\n\nHalle Berry and Sharon Stone give passable performances as their characters but nothing else is really noteworthy. Catwoman tries to entertain but it misses with each swipe it takes."

        "review_detailed_main": "Overcooked is the only way I can describe this film.\n\nWhat's wrong with it? Not the plot. The plot is actually pretty interesting, but unfortunately, the makers of this film chose to take the most anachronistic, exaggerated, silly and least compelling aspects of the original catwoman story and to emphasize and even embellish them. Catwoman is, in one sense, the story of a woman who must die and be reborn as an embodiment of feline magic and physical prowess in order to free herself from what appears (in the film) to be imaginary social oppression. What can we make of this? Are we being told that the lot of women is so awful that death and potential spiritual and physical augmentation are the only ways to achieve feminine freedom? Are we being told that cats are good role models for would-be strong and independent women? These themes, though treated a bit more subtly in the normally more outrageous and fantastic medium of DC comics, are raised to the level of ambiguous, slightly offensive, and really bizarre social commentary in this film.\n\nThe Script. The script is the primary problem with the plot. Combined with the editing and the director's overall (lack of?) vision concerning the story The love story could have been an important aspect of the story, but it is poorly developed and only really pays off in the last scene (possibly the best scene in the film). The flirty but unemotional script couldn't even be saved by the talented Berry and Bratt combination.... while I am at it...\n\nThe Casting. Bratt and Berry, as pretty as they both are, and as talented, have NO CHEMISTRY in this film. As much as I like Haile Berry, this was not a good role for her. First, she's not a very physical actress. Second, she was apparently not appropriately inspired to internalize her character well enough to create consistent characterization. In the end, she was more likable before she actually became the Catwoman. Haile - stay away from sci fi, it's simply not your genre. Bratt is fine in his supporting role - playing a stereotype TV detective - as are Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson - the heavies.\n\nThe Cinematography and Camera-work. Were simply awful. The CGI sequences, which tend to dominate every action sequence, are neither believable nor artistically done. After seeing the CGI in LOTR, it astonishes me that anybody would think they could get away with what passed for action animation in thi film. I would have rather seen the film cut to a cartoon for the action sequences than to go where it went. The film also uses a lot short clips and clich\u00e9 close-ups to grab the viewer's attention. these techniques have become such a standard approach that they no longer have any impact. Ho hum.\n\nThe directing. See all of the above.\n\nCatwoman is not nearly as bad as many seem to think (the modal vote here on IMDb is 1). I can honestly say that the film really had good potential and occasionally made me think. I even liked some of the characters. Hopefully the next time somebody takes on this interesting tale (if that should ever happen again), they will learn from the plentiful mistakes this version supplies."

So what, if we hurt our customers, as long as we line our pockets and make lots of money!\n\nHalle Berry, as the timid ad worker, meekly tries to tell her noisy neighbors to be quiet. So meek, that no one can even hear her. When she became Cat Woman by a chemical accident, she boldly went over to her neighbor's loft to tell them to shut up! She even sprayed them with a water/soda hose.\n\nHalle Berry puts a lot of energy in this role, toying with the bad guys, and intensely eating fish with her boyfriend at a restaurant.\n\nI know it won't win the Academy Award, but I enjoyed seeing this movie at my favorite bargain cinema!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Though there was never any great public outcry for it, the idea of producing a Catwoman movie had been in one stage of planning or another ever since 1992, when Michelle Pfeiffer memorably brought the character to the big screen in BATMAN RETURNS. I'm not sure why. Certainly Pfieffer's sensual interpretation of the character was one of the few pleasures to be had in that woeful sequel to Tim Burton's equally bleak and depressing original: but even so, Catwoman, in and of herself, is not really all that interesting as a character. Without Batman, there is no point to Catwoman -- just as there would be no point in making a movie about Prof. Moriarty without Sherlock Holmes or about Ernst Blofeld without James Bond.\n\nCatwoman's allure -- cheesy sexual fantasies aside -- exists solely as part of the Batman mystique. Even going back to Julie Newmar's purrrfect incarnation of the role in the 60's TV serial, Catwoman never stood out as a criminal mastermind or a colorful adventure figure, but rather as one of Batman's more memorable props, the one criminal who might seduce Batman into being bad, or at least naughty. Like all the other cartoonish villains in the series, Catwoman is a gimmick -- a clever gimmick, in that her black cat imagery is both a counterpart and a contrast to Batman's dark, yet heroic, persona -- but a prop nonetheless. Like the Batmobile or the Utility Belt, she is just another part of the Batman play set.\n\nThus, it is curious that not only does the CATWOMAN movie have no Batman, or even a reference to his existence, but apparently this isn't even the same \"catwoman.\" As played by Halle Berry with a strange sense of desperation, this Catwoman is Patience Phillips, not Selina Kyle. So, even though the character is credited to Batman creator Bob Kane, the film really isn't even a sequel or a spin off of the Batman franchise, making it even more perplexing as to why it exists at all.\n\nUnlike her original incarnation, this Catwoman is more than a glorified cat burglar with a cat fetish and a delightfully eccentric sense of style. Patience is murdered and -- for mystical, ancient Egyptian reasons the aren't made a bit clear -- she is instantly reborn with cat-like superpowers. Which probably explains just why the film finally got made; it has more in common with the freshly released SPIDER-MAN than with anything in the Batman universe. Like Spider-Man, Patience finds herself with a batch of superhuman skills; unlike Spidey, she can't decide whether to use them for good or evil.\n\nThat's intriguing. But what shows promise as a quasi-feminist lesson in female self-empowerment, quickly falls back on predictable sexist stereotyping. Instead of becoming a super criminal or super crimefighter, Patience spends most of the movie confused and indecisive. Though it is clear that her newfound skills make her a match to any man, the lame plot pits her against a female adversary, and not a particularly threatening one either. Sharon Stone does the \"special guest villainess\" bit as Laurel Hedare, a cosmetics titan who wants to flood the market with addictive face cream that ultimately destroys the wearer's face. That's just dumb; the potential lawsuits would negate any profits. And Catwoman ends up being little more than a consumer advocate. Besides, dropping a dime to the FDA would accomplish the same thing as all of Catwoman's rooftop hopping.\n\nThe film plays like an unsold pilot for a TV series, or worse, a Lifetime TV movie. The director, Pitof (never trust a director with only one name), is addicted to clumsy, excessive editing and the film has the hollow, pretentious feel of one of those artsy TV commercials that tries to sell an attitude, rather than a product. Wearing what must be the most god-awful, ugliest superhero costume ever, Berry looks more slutty than slinky, more trailer-trash tacky than comicbook cool. Compared to Newmar's classic leather jump suit (less skin, more style), Berry looks like a parody of a low rent hooker. But, at least, she tries to give a performance which is preferable to when the character is taken over by the CGI guys; it is always painfully obvious when Catwoman switches from being human to being cartoon, the latter never looking real or even surreal, just fake.\n\nCATWOMAN is one of those projects that gets kicked around so much and by so many over the years that by the time it gets to the screen it is clearly damaged goods. Yet, it's hard to be forgiving; despite its pedigree (pre-sold concept, Oscar-winning star and all the time, money and talent that Hollywood can afford to waste), CATWOMAN ends up being just a disagreeable alley cat, a stray that has lived one too many lives."

How else could you describe a film that concludes with, \"Purrfect\" and equally inane quotes throughout including, \"Cat got your tongue?\" and \"It's overtime!\". What a pathetic disaster this film is, and a crime in ticket admission; nobody should have to pay two cents for this waste of time. The acting is mind-achingly terrible: I surely believed Sharon Stone had more class and talent than this. The direction is atrociously ill-focused and dizzying, never even bothering to concentrate on a scene for more than five seconds. This kind of technique might have worked for the web-spinning scenes in \"Spider-Man\" but prove miserably weak and futile in an already painfully bad film. Not that I was expecting too much out of \"Catwoman\", but just about the only positive feature for this outright disaster of a film was the dark, Gothic scenery, which I found to be quite befitting for the theme of the film: dark, empty, and intoxicatingly bleak. How this film was ever greenlighted as a major movie production is beyond me, but perhaps this atrocity will be justified by the time of the Razzies. Meowww...What a bad movie... 1/2 out of ****"

This Movie dishes out a lot of the subtle Cat-like stereotypes in the form of a woman - Catwoman. To me it seemed like candy with extra sweetening, my favorite animal + gorgeous woman = Something worth watching.\n\nSure the plot wasn't some deep and meaningful drama, but I don't believe I was ever lead to the expectation it was supposed to. This is about the lifestyle of a Cat, and a Woman's assimilation into that lifestyle.\n\nAgain, I feel the critics expected something else and are crucifying what they got as a way of venting their disappointment. How about appreciating the movie you got people, or is that too much to ask? have a purrrrfect day -cc"

        "review_detailed_main": "You know the old saying, \"Do not change horses mid-race\", well I think that heavily applies to this film. I think the biggest hurdle that most of us had to overcome in this film was that Catwoman was not Michelle Pfeiffer. Most of us are still a generation of Batman Returns fans, as well as Tim Burton's darkness, and Halle just couldn't fit those shoes. Pfeiffer gave us this unbridled performance as this tormented woman who is given a rebirth by some cats, while Berry continually felt as if she was just going through the motions in order to try to be cooler than Pfeiffer was. You could see the competition going on in the film, and it hurt the overall story and characters. I will agree, this film had a very weak plot, but with the right person behind the mask of Catwoman, this could have been a decent film. Sadly, Berry just didn't put the force into it that I felt Pfeiffer did. There wasn't enough passion in the eyes, just this uncanny ability to act like a cat. Catwoman was more than \"just a cat\", she was this troubled soul that had to deal with both the good side of her actions as well as the devilish. That is what never came through with Berry.\n\nOutside of the complete miscast of Halle Berry, there were a couple other points that I just felt cheated after watching the film. The scene where the cat breaths on Halle was too eerily like Ralph Wiggum's \"My cat's breath smells like cat food\" moment. I kept waiting to hear that whenever possible. It would have granted this film one additional star more. Sadly, we had to live with what was in this film, and not what wasn't. What was in this film was shoddy acting, a very flimsy script, and scenario after scenario that just didn't seem to work. I realize the Pitof (the director) was trying to show a very feminine film that could be seen as a feminist picture, but to me it just didn't work. All of the sudden this cat brings out what Patience couldn't in the past? Suddenly, with the quick breath of a cat, she could play basketball better than ever, crack a whip, and drive a motorcycle. There was no development here, just plain assumption. I needed more development of this character instead of just this light-speed characterization that lead nowhere.\n\nAnother element that didn't brood well with me were the villains. Who were they? What was their purpose behind their situations? Without giving us any of this information, we can only assume that they really weren't evil and that perhaps Catwoman was caught up in this big misunderstanding? I know that is far fetched, but honestly Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson were not that sinister. Sure, every company that you work for has that boss that is not going to treat you with the greatest of respect, but does that make him the super-villain? Then you have Sharon Stone with this pathetic super power that works and doesn't work half the time. I just didn't care at this point what Catwoman was to do to stop the corporation. It was this huge dilemma that I could have solved quickly by perhaps incorporating something about the Umbrella Corporation and a tie into Resident Evil 3. Anything could have been better than what Pitof presented here.\n\nThe themes were also as jumbled as a child's playroom. Scattered throughout this picture you had different themes that never quite tied into the big solution. There were the feminist issues, the skin care/growing old is \"ok\" theme, the dual personalities and to live life to the fullest moments, and then there was the pro-self sidesteps that just never took us anywhere. It was like bobbing for themes in this mess. Nearly every five minutes, Pitof would present to us either a new theme or an older one that should have been dropped, but instead found itself back in the picture. It became increasingly clear with these scattered themes why Berry couldn't quite capture her character. There were supposed to be several layers to her character, but instead with all the layers everywhere except on Berry, it became increasingly more difficult to uncover. This caused both problems for the film itself as well as for the audience forced to sit through this mess. I mean who wants to visit a place of rest and have to clean up before being able to enjoy it. Not me, and that is how I felt with this film. I felt that it was this huge mess that Pitof created and wanted me to clean up. It was pathetic.\n\nOverall, I was not happy with this film. Either Pfeiffer should have been in it or it should have been shelved. With the growing business behind superheroes in today's cinema, Hollywood studios will have to pick and choose which ones they think will be big. You cannot release them all, and it proves with the attempt to capitalize on this small hero that ultimately failed. I hate to go with the rest of the critics with this one, but I just did not enjoy the final result. The costume, the style, the themes, and the acting all put a hinder on this film that was unrepairable from the beginning. This is a perfect example of a film that should have been scrapped from the beginning instead of rushed to theaters. Procrastination does not pay off in the long run!\n\nGrade: * out of *****"

Also, after Batman Returns, the idea of a movie about Catwoman was in talks for years and Michelle Pfeiffer always turned off the possibility maybe because what was shown in Batman Returns was the necessary to maintain all the secrets and mysteries around the character. If you want to know how to destroy an amazing character just watch Batman Returns and then Catwoman and you will know perfectly what I'm talking about. Hale Barry did a terrible choice that just jeopardized her career after an Oscar wining. Sharon Stone... pff... well, she's in a constant decay.\n\nReally...

She nearly dry humps a police officer in front of school kids, destroys sound equipment cause it's too loud, steals bikes, goes up against Sharon Stone in the worst role of her career (and THAT is saying quite much), and basically acts like the bitchy cat she is.

        "review_detailed_main": "The clumsy designer of advertisement of cosmetics Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) accidentally finds that the company where she works is using a formula that would destroy the face of the costumer in case of interrupting its use. The gang of the Machiavellian co-owner of the company, Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone), tries to kill Patience, but she is saved by an Egyptian cat, becoming the very skilled, agile and powerful Catwoman. Meanwhile, the detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt), who is in charge of investigating the murder of the scientist who developed the evil cosmetic, dates Patience, and suspects that she might be Catwoman.\n\nOK, it was my fault, I had read the reviews of IMDb, newspapers, magazines, even heard the comments of some friends about how bad \"Catwoman\" was, but I decided to buy and watch the just-released DVD, and I really found it a bad movie. First of all, the story sucks and never works, being totally inconsistent and laughable so bad it is. Sharon Stone and Benjamin Bratt are ridiculous, having caricatured and grotesque performances. Sharon Stone wears an ugly white costume in the end of the movie, which deforms her body. Halle Berry deserves a chapter: her filmography is composed mainly of C movies, or minor participation in good movies, like \"Jungle Fever\" and \"Bulworth\". Her great role was first in \"X-Man\" and her greatest performance was in \"Monster's Ball\". However, some critics have written that she is beautiful and hot and, the worst, she believed in such a lie. In \"Catwoman\", she is dreadful in both characters (Patience / Catwoman), specially trying to be sexy in the role of Catwoman. I missed a lot the class, the movements and the charm and sensuality of Michelle Pfeiffer in \"Batman Returns\". At least the soundtrack is reasonable. By the way, who is this awful director? My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Mulher-Gato\" (\"Cat-Woman\")"

I don't mean just disregard their opinion, I mean you should cease to associate with them altogether as they clearly have some kind of mental problem.\n\nThat's right, if you liked this movie there is something wrong with you and you need to seek help immediately.\n\nProblem #1: The main character is boring. You simply can't feel anything for her. She isn't interesting enough to invest any emotion in at all.\n\nProblem #2: Sharon Stone is the villain. Sharon Stone is famous for only one reason. She showed her naughty bits in Basic Instinct. That's it. Basic Instinct wasn't even a good movie either. Anything that has Sharon Stone in it without her exposing herself isn't worth anyone's time.\n\nProblem #3: The dastardly plot. A company is selling a beauty product that is addictive so people can't stop using it. That's pretty much it. They kill Catwoman to shut her up, but she comes back and gets revenge. In an attempt at a clever plot twist Sharon Stone has super-toughness from using the evil product in question. So wait... the evil beauty cream gives people superpowers? Then why is it evil?\n\nProblem #4: The effects are inconsistent. Some of them look pretty good and some of them totally suck. It looks like they pulled the effects budget halfway through the film and some of the rough animations were passed off as final effects.\n\nProblem #5: The costume. Man did it suck. The outfit she wore early in the film (in the bank heist scene)looked good, it fit the character. The outfit from later on was just stupid, especially the mask/helmet. It made her look like a special ed kid.\n\nThis movie isn't even good to make fun of. My roommates rented it and made me watch it thinking that we could have fun mocking it. What followed was three hours of total silence. The movie was like 90 minutes long. For the following 90 minutes we just stared at the blank TV screen in utter amazement at the crap we had just watched.\n\nAnyone that tries to get you to watch this movie is not your friend."

But in a world that has given us \"Manos: the Hands of Fate\", \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"Starship Troopers: Hero of the Federation\", that doesn't really say much.\n\nI watched this movie because I have a morbid curiosity about bad movies. Particularly, figuring out where they went wrong. And the consensus here is ... pretty much everywhere.\n\nLet's start with the story. The villain's dastardly plan revolves around marketing a facial creme that rejuvenates the skin, but, if one stops using it, has some very mean side effects. That's about it. MAKEUP! Oh no! The world will never be able to recover from that diabolical blow! Sure, the Joker (in Tim Burton's BATMAN) used personal grooming items seemingly at random to inflict mild cases of death on the unsuspecting public in his sadistic mind game to cause horror among the population of Gotham, but we're talking about a creme here that actually makes you look uglier if you stop using it! NOOOOOOO! Okay, snark aside, I just couldn't care about the \"evil plot\" except for the fact that they killed our heroine to keep their little secret.\n\nWhich brings us to the next point. Giving Catwoman superhuman powers because she is brought back to life by some mystical Egyptian cat? Really? You're going to stick with that? That's not quite the MO for this character. Sure, she may act catty at times, but there is nothing supernatural about her. Adding this mystical element just distances the audience even further from the character. Revenge we understand. Slight insanity? Got it. Superhuman cat powers? You lost me.\n\nThen there's the kinetic, motion-sickness-inducing direction. Do you think you could lock that camera down for a minute or two? Please? The lighting and coloring don't help in the least. It is just way too visually busy. I understand trying for \"artistic\" filming, but this is ridiculous.\n\nIn the end, the only reason I gave this more than one star is that, for those who want to see how to ruin a movie, this is something you could actually sit through and take notes. As the movie ends, you truly don't care about anyone or anything in the whole movie. So it gets some extra stars for the education it gives in bad film making."

        "review_detailed_main": "I admire the approach the filmmakers have taken towards \"Catwoman,\" for rather than setting their tale in the same dark, cavernous, largely computer-generated metropolis we are used to in most of these superhero movies, they have chosen to keep it rooted more in the real world. In a similar way, they manage to keep Catwoman herself believable, vulnerable and realistic, thanks in no small part to the beautiful and beguiling Halle Berry in the title role.\n\nBerry plays Patience Phillips, a pretty, but less-than-glamorous advertising artist who works for a major cosmetics company, ruled over by a tyrannical CEO and his equally ruthless wife, the former spokes model for their products. When Patience mistakenly overhears the corporate bigwigs discussing the fact that one of their best-selling creams is causing women to become seriously ill, she is dutifully murdered by a couple of the boss' henchmen. However, all is not lost for Patience, for, unbeknownst to her, she has been chosen to receive the special gift of reincarnation in the form of a cat woman who will no longer be subject to the laws of either nature or society.\n\nThe best parts of \"Catwoman\" involve Patience's incrementally becoming more and more catlike in her attitude and demeanor, and her slowly dawning realization of what is happening to her. It takes awhile for her to accept this surprising turn of events, but, when she does, she becomes, quite literally, a new woman, bold, self-confident and willing to take on the oppressors and evildoers in our society. Patience is paired up with an attractive police officer (apparently the only one ever on duty in that city), who gradually comes to realize who and what she is as well. Berry and Benjamin Bratt make a very appealing romantic couple, and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie. Also impressive is Sharon Stone who deserves credit for allowing herself to appear in a role in which her \"fading\" beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\"). Stone is the villainous wife of the company's CEO who is determined to make sure Catwoman doesn't spill the beans on their defective product.\n\nThe special effects are probably the least successful aspect of this film. Catwoman's jumping from rooftop to rooftop looks an awful lot like CGI effects to me. And the movie does occasionally go on auto pilot (especially towards the end), though, thankfully, not usually for very long. The literal cat fight between Berry and Stone at the finale is necessary, I guess, but really rather silly overall.\n\nStill, considering the pounding this movie received from both critics and audiences when it was first released in the summer of 2004, I wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable \"Catwoman\" turned out to be."

Plus, the villains in this movie are from a COSMETICS COMPANY!!!! A COSMETICS COMPANY??!!! Are we going to be attacked by makeup? A little silly, don't you think? I certainly think so. Since Sharon and Halle Berry are both very beautiful women, I would think there would be elements of satire here. However, the movie is played straight. Stone has given this performance before in Total Recall and Basic Instinct and has given it much better. I think Stone is a one note actress and it shows. Benjamin Bratt is just going through the motion as the cop/love interest for Catwoman. If you have a free ticket to go, like I did, see it. Otherwise, wait for video. A generous 5/10."

While being Catwoman, a detective played by Benjamin Bratt pursues her and even go wall to wall action with her. Another supporting character is a supermodel, played by Sharon Stone. I was so stunned that she was playing an character in a movie like this. Why is she doing in a bad movie like this one? The thing that really bothered me throughout the picture is the wall to wall action. I was so tired of seeing the camera focusing on these very fast and intense fight scene between Catwoman and somebody that Catwoman fighting against, like for a example, a street mugger. As for Halle Berry, I felt that it was an embarrassing thing to do is have her wear that stupid Catwoman costume. I felt like laughing at her. You know a movie is bad when you have a great actress working in a bad movie. Catwoman is a really bad movie and a disappointment, a really bad disappointment to Halle Berry. \u2605 1 star."

Every time I've watched the movie and with different people, someone always seems to point out the obvious goofs.

Everything went wrong, starting with the script. It's hardly at a kindergarten level: some nobody at a cosmetic company comes upon a sinister plot by her greedy corporate superiors. Wow: corporate bad guys; creative, original, brilliant. The evil corporate baddies off the girl, who gets miraculously resurrected by a bunch of out-of-work alleycats. She then adapts a feline persona, and the inevitable vengeance rampage commences.\n\nIt gets worse. What's with Halle Berry's bad hair day? It looks like a hundred cats buried rats and other stuff they had killed in her hair, then ripped some of her hair out by the roots. At least she wears a hood that covers that mess through most of the movie. It's ironic that the Catwoman was originally a campy satire of the femme fatale character type in movies, since this movie makes an attempt to reimagine the character as a serious figure. The ineptitude of the film makes Halle's Catwoman the lamest and campiest of them all. The director tells the story poorly, and Berry's acting is as dull as a de-clawed fang.\n\nEveryone in the cast looks embarrassed to be a part of this, and with good reason. As some of the previous actors to play the role might say: this movie is a complete cat-astrophe."

Besides that I have a personal dislike for these comic-book based films, the only ones I like are the X-men films (whereas both Spider-man's bored me to death and the hulk made me lose faith in the way movies are written). However, boredom can drive people to doing strange and mysterious things, so when I was channel flicking, catwoman was just starting so I thought \"what the heck!\" and watched it.\n\nFirst of all, the acting in this film is very campy and over the top, but then it was much better than I expected! Halle Berry does what she can with her character, but Sharon Stone made the movie for me! Stone is deliciously bitchy and evil which just works for me. Benjamin Bratt also does well with what he is given (i.e playing possibly the worst detective in movie history). I think Laurel and Hardy would make better detectives! The story is your basic super-hero plot. Weak but generally nice person has some sort of accident and is fused with animal/mutant powers and thus decides that saving the world from evil is the best career choice from now on. However our intrepid hero is misunderstood by the general public (surprise surprise) and is labelled a criminal.\n\nOverall the film is silly but I rather enjoyed it! Who knows maybe you will too!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is what happens to a comic book movie when there is no central intelligence or guiding hand in control who understands and respects the character. It makes me doubly thankful for the Spider-Man and X-Men films, which could easily have had the same thing happen to them.\n\nThe sad part is, there are flashes, here and there, of a much better movie which is hopelessly buried under the main portion of schlock.\n\n1) The opening credit sequence is interesting, and intriguing, with it's suggestion of a 'cat cult' that runs throughout human history. It's an element that never really gets touched on in the comics. It's just that Selina Kyle really likes cats, and the role suits her personality.\n\n2) Catwoman's 'first' outfit, the black patent leather suit with the domino mask, is 100 times more convincing than the horrible thing she eventually ends up in.\n\n3) And the whole scene in which that she wears the black leather outfit,where she kicks the bejeezus out of the hoodlums in the jewelry store because she wants to rob it herself...THAT'S the movie they SHOULD have made.\n\n4) When Catwoman uses her 'feline' abilities to slither through the bars of her jail cell, that is pretty cool. It's something that a 'normal' person couldn't do, but something a lithe woman who was 'channeling' a cat might be able to pull off, and it is understated and quirky enough to make the viewer say, \"Hey, that's an interesting ramification of being 'cat-like' that I hadn't thought of.\" It looks good.\n\n5) And even with all the stupid 'cat' jokes - the tuna consumption, hissing at dogs etc., Halle sometimes gets enough 'ooomph' into the character that you suspend disbelief for 3-4 seconds at a time. A lot of actresses wouldn't be able to pull it off in the middle of all the other stupidity ...even Michelle Pfeifer and Julie Newmar might not be able to make that stupid outfit work at all.\n\n6) In spite of the fact that Sharon Stone's villain has an extremely stupid superpower - skin turned to stone by her own product - and in spite of the fact that the character of the villain is a one-note caricature, she is a good choice for the role, and she actually sort-of makes the character work for about one scene in every 4-5.\n\n7) The final knock-down,drag-out between the heroine and the villain-ness doesn't succumb to most of the easy clich\u00e9s movies used to fall into with girl fights (b*tch slapping contests or WWE cat fights.) They punch each other around pretty good, with a lot of energy and physicality, and leave most of the sleazy 'girl fight'/femdom porn aspects alone.\n\n8) I have to grudgingly admit that the closing 'coda', where Berry voiceovers the character's mission and vision, while a great sexy \"TLC\" type song sets the mood and the character struts away from us into the moonlight...that was a great little movie moment.\n\nSo that's maybe 30% of the movie that doesn't insult the character or goes for the cheesy cat jokes. The rest of it, while made in an ultra slick MTV video style, is a waste of time and money. It's pretty and shiny as hell, but has no guts or heart to it. I'm not saying that a movie about a superhero has to take itself ultra-seriously - see the humorous parts of the first two Superman movies, or either of the Spider-Man movies. Those movies made wry self-aware comments that were also loving tributes to the energy and vision of their creators. But while \"Catwoman\" (the character) is about an interesting, freebooting adventurer with her own standards and nobility...Catwoman (the movie) is about a bunch of Hollywood hacks spinning some kind of \"Cosmo\" girl/\"I walk alone\" fever dream.\n\nOh, and I hope I never see Benjamin Bratt in another movie again, ever. Sorry, Ben."

I sometimes wonder what exactly people expect from these movies. When i go to see a superhero Flick I rarely have any expectations at all, except hoping to be entertained, and this one passed the time nicely.

It is a full-throttle and entertaining leisure view with a far from perfect, but interesting story and Halle Berry is simply amazing as Catwoman, in my honest opinion. One mistake I have actually seen a few ignorant people make though is that Patience Phillips is not the Catwoman that has been played out in the Batman phenomenon, she is a version of the essence/character that is Catwoman, and in any matter she is a damn fine one at that. She might not be the best portrayal of the character in Catwoman history, since so many think that is so, and she might be the worst, but that doesn't mean she is bad and she is unable to be found enjoyable.\n\nI don't care if this film stuck to the original characterizations of Catwoman or not anyway. It does not make the character of Catwoman out to be the villain or the superhero, just the figure that is Catwoman who strives for what she desires and in the end it's what I really enjoy about it. It seems like working hard for what she wants is what Catwoman is all about anyway, so doesn't that stay true to what people have been familiar with from Catwomen in the past in some way? The plot is the worst aspect, but not bad. What kind of plot were people really expecting from a film called \"Catwoman\" and there had been no confirmations that it had anything to do with Batman? It really doesn't matter, because when the cast played out the scenes all the problems it has fade away, in my opinion, for how delightful and exciting they manage to be.\n\nSome final thoughts are that it had excellent action, great outfits and was overall a hell of a fun ride from the very beginning to the very end. It's entertainment value and flair makes up for what it lacks in solidity and depth, but most don't believe it has any value whatsoever. In any matter, I enjoy it every time I watch it. The performances are fantastic for what it set out to do regardless of what Halle Berry said at the Razzies. Why would an actor/actress try to boast themselves when excepting a Razzie anyway? Her catsuit was sexy! I love this movie, as do other people, it is just that the hate shadows the required appreciation it receives from the minority of viewers."

        "review_detailed_main": "CATWOMAN has achieved the lowest standards of film-making possible; I asked myself whilst watching this film \"Is it even feasible to get away with making a film so mediocre?\" Its insipid, abounding with clich\u00e9s, absolutely empty of character, depth or anything remotely stunning and exceptional. The film's supposed saviour is the use of antagonistic,nails-driving-through-your-brain annoying hip-hop music and the personage of the 'b****' that people seem to find so attractive nowadays. Halle Berry proves that she's just a Hollywood mannequin with no exceptional talent. Ugh...the entire film was just the most repulsive, statement-making piece of filthy trash that I have ever seen. To begin with, the most irritating aspect of this film is the fact that some brainless moron out there thinks he has the right to take somebody else's character and mutate her to the heaviest extremity- SELENA KYLE is the true CATWOMAN, a tortured, slightly insane woman whose motivation was human hatred and self-destruction- PATIENCE PHILIPS is a timid little nobody who thinks that graduating from Art College makes her an artist, and whose 'cat woman' alter ego is in all senses nothing more than a hip-hop b**** in a dominatrix costume.\n\nTim Burton/Michelle Pfieffer's 'Cat Woman' was a genuinely dark, sensual and believable character compared to this abomination.\n\nSo we're expected to believe that there is such thing as a magical,presumably immortal cat who can boost a woman's ego just by breathing on her? Wow-what an almighty gift that this cat Midnight gives to Patience! The cat breathes on her...and what happens? Nothing. She just transforms from shrinking violet into bully-girl b****, and thats considered to be a super heroine power??? So being the almighty, sacred Catwoman entails utterly deliberate, completely unnecessary, conceited, rampant, sexually desperate behaviour? Since when did cats practise these characteristics? If behaving like the stereotype 'cat' human is considered to be a power, then why aren't mentally ill people considered to be sexy and heroic?\n\nThe only 'power' Catwoman has is the power that all 21st century women have, which is the power of free will, only not all free women dress up in disgusting fetish costumes pretending to be a cat, treating people like dirt! There was no motive to this character other than the fact that it is considered cool to be a b**** nowadays. Its the only indication of female power that modern audiences understand, whereas being a b**** and being brave are two entirely different things.\n\nThe old woman who explained everything to Patience is clearly a cat-fixated maniac; she irritated the Hell out of me with her twitchy, whiskery face and her staring, cat-fixated behaviour; ooh blimey the old lady surrounded by the cats with the sound of sickly, wet, desperate meowing echoing all around, with the sacred, ancient history, the terrible deadly line of the rampant, nasty cat b****es!!! So all great and powerful femininity stems from being a b****? I DON'T THINK SO. GET REAL!!!! This cat woman is entirely unlovable; a motiveless hip-hop b**** with the ultimate attitude problem, more a mentally ill dominatrix than a heroine. She's out for nobody but herself and her bland little career; she gets \"flushed down the pipes\" and we're all meant to feel terrible for her, like some terrible injustice has been done to her (by the way, I was laughing my head off when she got \"flushed down the pipes\") and the ending is clearly supposed to be something special, the bulky-bottomed, bulky-breasted b**** just struts off into an unrealistically huge moon, whipping her stupid whip with the hip hop blaring! B**** B**** B**** B**** B****!!!!!!!!!\n\nI didn't think it was possible to make a film this pathetic and weak and stupid until I saw this; AVOID!!!! And another thing is that Sharon Stone is practically portraying herself and her midlife crisis... \"I was everything they wanted me to be; I was never too beautiful, never too powerful, and then I turned 40 and they threw me in the trash.\" It says a lot about her own career, wouldn't you say?"

One can't even enjoy the action scenes because they are unimaginative and badly done.\n\nThe acting is OK, but the actors can only use the script they're given. The camera work is actually quite good, at least sometimes. The few scenes that do create a certain atmosphere do so because of this, not because of the plot, acting or dialog, but the (few, I think) computer animations used, look about 5 years behind their time. I don't know if the director had any goal other than showing off Halle Barry in a ridiculous costume, if he did, he did not succeed. The movie would probably have been better if they'd made it funny instead of serious (and used professionals for writing the script and designing the costumes) but since they did not:\n\n1/10, 0/10 if I could.

But then, exactly at the point where the character of \"Patience\" turns into Catwoman it mutates into what I think is best called a very long \"Destiny's Child\" music video. Together with the main character, everything else suddenly went down the drains. Left over was a sorry excuse for a story, horrible acting, absolutely ridiculous characters doing stupid things and some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. And don't get me started on these silly fight scenes! I guess they really thought it would be enough for the audience to see Halle Berry in an (actually quite stupid looking) tight catsuit. Well, it's not.\n\nRating:1/10 - avoid at all cost"

I can almost see how you could have a Catwoman movie w/o the Batman but to completely ignore 95% of the canon from the comics is just amazing. I can't believe Hollywood makes dreck like this and then blames people not paying $10 a head to see it on internet piracy. The only reason I watched it was because I heard what a train wreck it was and it was showing on HBO. The costumes, writing, and of course the acting are all horrendous. I could just see Sharon and Halle balancing their checkbook in the back of their minds as they reeled off some of the most banal dialog ever to grace celluloid. Not really even entertaining as \"Mystery Science Theater\" fodder because although it's terrible, there was not as much unintentional comedy as I expected. Save your time, save your brain cells. Skip it!"

I'll admit, there were a FEW creative shots, or ideas in this movie, but those are totally ruined by how bad it is! I wanted to shut it off, but sheer morbid curiosity kept me watching - just to see how bad it could get.

Resurrected by a magical Egyptian cat (yes, you did read that right!), Patience is imbued with supernatural feline characteristics: incredible agility, fantastic vision, a love of catnip (yes, you read that right too!).\n\nAfter kitting herself out in a rather fetching black leather outfit complete with whip, she sets off into the night to get revenge on the evil Hedare head honchos and their henchmen.\n\nA mess of dreadful visual trickery, Catwoman is an embarrassment for all involved: the director (and I use that term loosely), Pitof, has no idea how to construct a movie, and a barrage of CGI replaces any attempt at decent storytelling (not that there is much of a story to tell since the plot is asinine to a degree that beggars belief); the acting is uniformly awful; and the special effects leave a lot to be desired, ranging from OK to downright dreadful.\n\nDeserved winner of multiple awards in the 2005 Razzies (awarded to the year's worst films), Catwoman is a stinker from start to finish."

Halle Berry looks amazing (and when I say \"amazing\" I mean drop-dead spectacularly gorgeous), and although I'm not a big fan of the ripped leather costume, I have to say the camera-work that films it is pretty damn good; in fact it's bloody excellent. There is great style in the moves, the design, the attitude. The whole cat-like thing with the independence, impulsiveness and irreverence - coupled, to boot, with the desire for greater female liberation - is translated really well from the idea to the celluloid.\n\nOn the down-side, the story is pretty dull.

        "review_detailed_main": "How to describe Catwoman? Well I think my one line summary is fairly to the point. There was nothing horrifically bad about the film, it just wasn't any good. The storyline to begin with was slightly nicked from Batman Returns where a mousy woman finds out her bosses secret, is killed, brought back to life by moggies, wears leather. I guess the whole back story of catwomen covered that one up a bit, but still they could have come up with something a little better. It would be unfair to compare Halle Berry to Michelle Pfeiffer because the characters are actually different in the way they react to the fact that they have these new powers. Selina was more hell bent on eliminating her killer and went quite nuts because of it. Patience seemed more determined to just bring down the empire of Hedare. Her revenge just didn't seem as believable.\n\nThe action sequences where real people were involved were fairly OK but the computer generated ones were distracting because it was so easy to tell when they actually occurred. I'm beginning to get slightly annoyed with film makers constant reliance on computers to have action sequences. I know in some cases it would be physically impossible to have any stunt person perform what is required, but they should limit the amount of times that impossible stunts need to be performed. Trouble is in catwoman when Halle Berry was performing her own stunts she was slow and jerky. The final fight at the end was a fine example of this. It almost seemed like they were just fighting in a set patten, following the rehearsals slowly and methodically. Now on to the acting ability of the lead characters. Halle Berry can be quite good when she knows the film is going to be successful, there was nothing wrong with her performances in both X-men films and Die Another Day, but she just seemed so wooden in Catwoman. But if it was possible Sharon Stone actually lived up to her name and had about as many facial expressions as a granite statue. Maybe that was part of the character who was wearing so much of that face cream that she couldn't actually move her face, we will never know. Benjamin Bratt seemed almost non-existent in this, just really going along with everything and not really having much to do with anything at all.\n\nIn summary, this film had so much potential to be a great action comedy that didn't have to take itself seriously like the Charlie's Angels films have managed to succeed in doing. But with a thin plot and terrible acting it was never going to be. Basically this is just a film centred on Halle Berry and the fact that she is hot property. She had better watch it though, she has done a couple of turkeys since winning that Oscar and with 6 films lined up between now and next year we could become so saturated with her that we will eventually tire."

This is from someone who has seen quite a few over the years, some atrociously bad. This isn't one of them. The acting is passable for this sort of film, with Sharon Stone making a good villain, though not in it enough, and Halle Berry is worth a mark alone for her sex appeal. She is in fact more sensual when she is not in her bat costume, and unlike Jennifer Lopez can act with more than her posterior. The plot is okay, though I do agree with people when they say Cat Woman doesn't seem to have any sense of purpose. The effects are okay, but are average for this type of film, and I can only conclude, that a lot of the negativity for this film comes from the this.

It's a total mess from beginning to end, a misstep every way, featuring lousy cinematography, some of the worst special effects known to mankind, absolutely appalling acting from the entire cast and one of the most mundane and derivative scripts I've ever seen played out on camera. Yeah, I didn't like it much.\n\nFrom the beginning, when we meet dowdy Halle Berry and her insipid voice-overs, I just knew that the main inspiration for this film was going to be SPIDER-MAN. I was right. However, director 'Pitof' is no Sam Raimi; in fact, he's a French special effects man who seems to have virtually no idea how to make a movie. The scenes with CATWOMAN are excruciatingly painful, the most derivative and sanitised I've seen, while those with Berry as her human persona are dull and clich\u00e9d in the extreme. I despise that TV show Ugly Betty and this reminded me of that far too much.\n\nMeanwhile, stereotypes abound: the chubby best buddy, the flamboyant gay guy, etc. After Berry turns into Catwoman \u2013 in a scene that makes no sense \u2013 it becomes even worse, if that was possible. The fight scenes are over-edited monstrosities, and the CGI effects completely laughable. Berry herself \u2013 well, I won't ever be able to forget just how bad she is in this film. Her Catwoman looks like some S&M fan's dream, and every single damn scene has some kind of sassy black woman's music playing over the sound track; I can just imagine some audience member jumping up in her seat in a key scene and thumping the air, shouting \"You go, girl!\". At least, that's the intent. The supporting cast are also poor, with a charisma-free Benjamin Bratt perhaps better renamed as Benjamin Prat, and Sharon Stone's villainess \u2013 well, let's just say she's now repulsive and unable to make a good film.\n\nPreviously, I thought BATMAN & ROBIN was the dumbest superhero film out there, but that's a masterpiece in comparison to this mess. What a crock!"

But \"Catwoman\" is literally SO bad in every conceivable way that I personally couldn't even find enjoyment from pointing out all its faults-- there were just so many.\n\nAs others have already pointed out, the film crams it down your throat that Halle Berry is a CAT-woman, to the point of being insulting. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The acting is dreadfully bad, the lines are terrible and terribly delivered (not even George Lucas could write dialog this bad), the action sequences are out of place and usually happen for no logical reason, and the film's continuity suggests that two different people with completely opposite personalities edited it. Hollywood would do the whole world a lot of good if it blacklisted this director from ever making another film.\n\nI've seem some crappola movies over the years (\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", \"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\", \"Gigli\") and I can enjoy even the bad ones because I stop trying to immerse myself in the story and just laugh at the film itself. Unfortunately, \"Catwoman\" was so bad that I couldn't do either-- it has no story or compelling characters, and is just such a pile of dung that it can only be described as an utter waste of time. I warn anyone considering this movie that you are preparing to throw away two hours of your life that you can never get back.

        "review_detailed_main": "Although the Batman films from the last two decades have not 'wooed' me as much they have other people, I must say that 1992's Batman Returns did, for me, stick out as an entertaining and well shot film with essence of noir that just worked on my level \u0096 interesting then, that I recently saw this film: Catwoman; whom just happens to be one of the 'baddies' from Batman Returns. However, this 'spin-off' or prequel or whatever you want to call it, really didn't work.\n\nTo say that this is a horrible, horrible film and is one of the worst ever made is being a little too cruel. Overall, what I think the main problem is with Catwoman, is that it just didn't seem that dark. The violence was tame, there was no bad language, most of the stunts didn't impress me and even Halle Berry's catsuit just seemed to be 'censored' for some reason. So, from the beginning; the flaws are there regarding getting the film's priorities right and the main character correct.\n\nMy first suspicion that Catwoman was going to end up being a little disappointing was the first scene that we see Halle Berry's Catwoman (A character called Patience Phillips) and Tom Lone (Bratt) interact. Phillips is out on a ledge bizarrely attempting to save a stray cat in an unsafe place (something Lone then questions the sanity of) but Lone thinks she's attempting suicide so he tries to save her. The fact he manages to cover something like three floors in under ten seconds and then the fact we are presented with Philips realising she's late, not even offering an excuse, not even coming to terms with what it is she just did before literally grabbing her gear and leaving Lone there by himself; exclaiming 'Sorry, gotta go. I'm late(!)' was enough to have me praying it wasn't going to do this for the rest of the film.\n\nFortunately; or maybe mercifully, the film doesn't really have too much of a script so there isn't much dialogue once Phillips becomes Catwoman. There are some excruciatingly bad exchanges between Phillips and her co-worker Sally (Borstein) about finding the perfect man, etc. and the scenes with Lone, the love interest, aren't as awful as they could've been. So instead of shoddy dialogue writing, we are presented with action sequences the bulk of which fall flat for a few reasons. To say Catwoman moves like a cat would actually be a bit of a lie as she moves around more like a flea or a squirrel. She can run up walls, jump from building to building and basically defy psychics as much as she wants. I read after the film that some scenes were inspired by Spider Man \u0096 he's a spider with artificial webbing \u0096 a cat and a spider are two very different things. Apart from anything else, the scenes weren't even that entertaining in a 'guilty' sort of way.\n\nI think that when Bob Kane thought up Catwoman, he was thinking along the lines of: femme fatale, Bruce Wayne's female foil, a dominant woman amongst the crime and male run corruption of Gotham City. In Catwoman, she is as shallow as she should be deep; Catwoman is relegated to being a fetishistic object of desire who can do you damage but only because she's able to, not because she's forced to. This is hammered home during a fight scene in and outside a night club whilst a song is playing; the lyrics seem stuck on: \"I'm ready to make you mine\". Catwoman in Batman Returns was very different to this and this only makes Catwoman (2004) look more like Batman Forever or Batman & Robin rather than Batman Returns.\n\nWith the film already failed, the final nail in the coffin is the horrid finale fight sequence where two dominant female characters are bashing each other with poles and whips and through glass yet no broken bones or blood ever seem to show themselves. By this point, Catwoman has come close to relegating itself to B-movie status and thus is a film to ultimately avoid.\n\nIf you're thinking of watching it with the idea that possibly, you might see Halle Berry as a dominatrix type figure then even then you're going to be disappointed as she isn't even that alluring in the film \u0096 how they even got that wrong, I'll never know."

I'm only commenting on how the movie looks.\n\nAnd it doesn't look too well, really. The first thing I noticed was the overacting done by every actor that hit the screen. Maybe this improved after I left the movie, but what I saw was ridiculously overdone. This turned a potentially good movie into a slapstick. It's because of this that I couldn't feel for the main character: the actress distracted all my attention away from the character.\n\nThe second thing I saw was a scene with obvious special effects in it. They were as overdone as the acting was. I always thought that special effects should make an impossible sequence look realistic. In this movie, the effects are used to make the movie look even more fake. It's way, way too obvious that everything you see was inserted by a computer.\n\nThat's about it. Yes, I have seen a tiny bit of the movie, but even that tiny little bit was so much overblown, that it felt a whole lot longer. I can only hope that the rest of the movie wasn't as overdone as the part I saw. If you're a viewer who can be put off by a bad-looking movie, don't see this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Since this movies conception, there have been numerous references to Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the 1992 classic Batman Returns. 2004's Catwoman has absolutely nothing to do with either Batman, his villains, nor any resemblance to that Catwoman character. Questions have been raised wondering whether Halle Berry could fill the same role as Pfeiffer. Well, in my opinion, no. The depth of acting it took for this incarnation was more geared to martial arts and being sexy in leather. Don't take it wrong, Halle Berry, an excellent actress, wasn't given any true depth of character to work with.\n\nThe movie seems to be divided into halves. The first part deals with Patience Philips working for a cosmetic company as an art designer who just can't seem to get anything right when it comes to her boss. What began promising at first, turned into a disaster when Catwoman finally arrived about 40 minutes into the film. This second half lost the story with a barrage of leaps and fights mixed with a loose love story.\n\nThere are a few resemblances to Batman Returns, and maybe these were a nod to it:\n\n1. Halle Berry turns towards the camera, crouched delivering the same Meow! as Pfeiffer's character.\n\n2. Catwoman, always letting her curiosity rule, goes into a store, where instead of meeting 2 security guards as Pfeiffer's did, she meets 3 robbers.\n\n3. Catwoman stands in front of the moon.\n\n4. Catwoman nearly falls out the window, and later on, is almost pushed out the window.\n\nThe references are there, but for anyone who hasn't seen Batman Returns, you wouldn't notice them. There are a few more nods, but I think the point is delivered.\n\nSo, what's this story all about? Well, if anyone has seen the trailer to Resident Evil: Apocalypse, then you would have the story in a nutshell. In the trailer to RE2 (due this Fall) there's a facial cream that rots your skin and its side effects are toxic. (Funny, I was reminded as well of The Jokers mixture of poisonous toxins he shipped from his factory to shelves in 1989's Batman.)\n\nOK, we have the fired employee who is killed because she found out about the evil corporations secret. A cat performs CPR (or so that's what it looks like), and she comes back to life. There isn't a comic book villain in this movie, ala Joker, Penguin, or Doc Ock (Spider-Man 2). What we have is the ruthless and completely flat corporate executives. There's no depth to these villains and no clever schemes to nab Catwoman, only pin a few deaths on her. There's your story ladies and gentlemen and I think you can pretty much figure out how it turns out.\n\nIn the beginning, there was so much promise. From the opening credits showing the origins of cats in myth and legend to the meeting she has with the owner of Midnight (the cat who performed CPR.) After that, it was a downhill spiral. I will say that the catsuit was nice and very revealing, however the headpiece looks really odd. Catwoman got her claws from Tiffany's I think (they really do look like designer nails).\n\nI have to say, in all fairness, that Catwoman in Batman Returns was a lot more real and the character had a purpose. From her stitched up suit to her makeshift claws. Some may think I was going into this movie with a preception of Catwoman from Batman, but I did not. I had followed this movie since it was first announced and knew it was not the same. I also knew it had nothing to do with the Dark Knight, but I did expect one thing...a good story for the money. Halle Berry is better than a walkthrough part and deserves a good script, she's proven herself as a fine actress. Nothing is really explained in the movie and it's loosely tied together between action sequences and sex appeal.\n\nTo see, or not to see, that is the question. The answer is up to you."

Although they are quite horrendous to start with -- honestly, few comics are this badly written, and Garfield has more realistic animation than the feline CGI in this movie; maybe Halle Berry cutting her hair was the actual coup de gr\u00e2ce? Well, it doesn't really matter. What's important is to follow the recipe, or avoiding this movie completely."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just finished reviewing three Ingmar Bergman movies and now I have to write about \"Catwoman\". Gee, I feel like stepping on an ant-hill after climbing Kilimandjaro. Now, where do I start? (since the question is not whether the movie is good or bad, but how bad it is).\n\nWell, there is this quote from the TV show \"Malcolm in the Middle\" that had me laughing to tears and I've got to hand it to the writers for coming with such a fine and brilliance piece of cleverness. After they finished celebrating his birthday, a cone-wearing Dewey is asked if he liked the party, his comment is implacable : \"I expected nothing, yet I'm still let down\" Now this is how I feel about \"Catwoman\".\n\nI won't throw more rotten tomatoes at \"Catwoman\" because I didn't expect much to begin with. I registered on IMDb the same year as the film's release, I had all the time to know about its reputation, its flop at the box-office and unanimously disastrous reception, so there was nothing to heighten my expectations except the slightest hope that the film would belong to the 'so bad, it's good' category... but even then, there should have to be a good reason for me to watch it instead of a film that just happens to be 'genuinely good'. It took 10 years but between two remote control's clicks, I caught the movie right in the beginning, and I decided to give it a chance.\n\nBy chance, I meant the benefit of the doubt. And it didn't last, Halle Berry portrayed a woman who, for some no other reasons than plot requirements, became a cat after the opening scenes showed her in every possibly kitty-like situation (almost) in case we forgot. Why all the rush? You've got an A-actress like Halle Berry (well, that's what she used to be anyway), she had just won an Oscar, she could have put some three-dimensionality within her character so how about sitting on a lonely place and trying to give her more substance and not just turn the woman into a cat-like creature right on our nose.\n\nI have a confession to make, I haven't seen Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' movies yet, yeah, yeah, shame on me, \"booo!\", I know. But I'm going to say something positive: from what I understood, his movies did well because the scripts didn't rely on special effects, but on characters' development. This is not character study or some kind of intellectual stuff, but just a way to inject some humanity, anything to enhance our empathetic process. Instead of that, the French director Pitoff, who lacks both talent and a first name, focuses on an unpredictably bad and basic antagonism between Patience Philips (Catwoman's real identity) and a big cosmetics corporation selling an eternal beauty-cream, whose only secondary effect is to burn the skin when they stop to use it.\n\nAnd I thought the whole fiscal subplot in \"Star Wars Episode I\" was pointless, how about that? What kind of vileness is supposed to come out of such a plot? Or is it supposed to fit the casting of Sharon Stone as Catwoman's nemesis and Lambert Wilson who does nothing else than embarrassing himself. All these actors proved to be capable when given a good script, I don't know who wrote \"Catwoman\" but I'm an aspiring screenwriter, I'm not 100% sure about my talents, but that a script like that got a shot sure gives me hopes.\n\nAnd I'm also a feet-fetishist, and as much as I love the toes sticking out Berry's boots, damn, even I knew it was aesthetically wrong, unless it proved the movie's real intention which was to appeal on the lowest levels. After all, Catwoman is too sexy a character not to have her sensual savagery been exploited, but then how about injecting some sensuality and make the film a bit more adult, instead of just some paws's traces in her friend's back. I don't remember the name of the actor, but I'm sure I'm doing him a favor by not trying to.\n\nCatwoman's outfits were probably designed to inspire the lustiest appetites, but if it failed as a superhero film, it did as well as a soft porn spin-off, while in both ways, it could have been interesting. And all the attempts to make Halle more feline... meeooo... ouch! I wish I could find one thing to appreciate, but it's as if Pitoff deliberately sabotages his own film, by inserting some stupid random basketball scenes or some cringe-worthy CGI effects, and don't get me started on the whole Egyptian mythology, Alex Borstein and... did I mention the basket-ball scene?\n\nIs making a good film that complicated? Sometimes, all you have to do is write one great scene with two characters sitting in front of each other, and it can provide something interesting. Nope, Pitoff wanted his \"Catwoman\" so badly it ended among the movies considered the worst of all time. As an aspiring filmmaker, a film like \"Catwoman\" is the kind of nightmare that makes me wonder if I shouldn't also shorten my name just in case.\n\nA wasted use of talents because of a lack of direction, too much CGI, a lack of script, too many hackneyed situations, a career-ruiner move, definitely. Do actors read the script, I don't know. Proof is that script is the movie's spine. Indeed, as I started this review with, I just watched three Ingmar Bergman movies recently and I have no doubts that even someone like Pitoff can recreate the same shots, so technically speaking, he's got it. Just learn to use some close-up, one good script, and even the crappiest thing can redeem itself.\n\nWhy am I talking about Bergman anyway? Well, sometimes it's the plain that give its emphasis to the mountain."

But I got so much more than that, I found a movie , all be it not Oscar or Award worthy, but a movie, that really did take me from reality for a bit, I become completely emerged in the story which may be silly, but who cares! The fight scenes, where all in my opinion beautifully choreographed, and the CGI, I thought was definitely above average. Hallie Berry was excellent both as Patience and Catwoman. Playing Patience with real raw emotion, and she genuinely did look frightened to speak her mind, but on the other hand as Catwoman Hallie exerts all the sexiness and confidence needed to pull of such a sensual character, and in that tight leather suit she does look HOT!! Sahron Stone is delicious as the sexy villain, and Benjamin Bratt is good enough for he's mainly unimportant character. A lot of people have given this movie a lot of flak and I can kinda see why but not really, if you can call this movie anything it has to be VISUALLY STUNNING, like Gothic, mixed with modern art. The backing Track is excellent, the stunts are better than you would be led to believe, the CGI is definitely a lot better than people have been saying. All in all no where near as bad as it could have been, And isn't it worth going to see Hallie Berrie and Sharon Stone in a cat fight anyway. All in all a fun filled, visually striking twist thrilled ride from begging to very end.\n\nGo See Honestly"

But, after watching it, I thought it was better than I lot of movies now days. Sure, you must suspend a lot of reality in order to believe that Patience could be brought back to life by the soul of an ancient cat, but I thought it was explained so it made some sense. I didn't think the idea for the evil villain being selling a cream that makes someone's skin rot if they stop using it was a great idea. They could have come up with a better plot there. But, I liked how Patience doesn't remember and must investigate her own \"death.\" Plus, it was great seeing the independence personality trait of a cat coming out of her. Like when she finally decides to break up the noisy party across the street. That was great.\n\nYou could tell when it was the computer Catwoman, but it was not used excessively. I liked all the cat like fights and one liners by Hallie. I especially liked the fight between Catwoman and Tom behind the stage. She says I don't come when called, only when I want. Just like a cat.\n\nCatwoman needed to use her whip more. And I don't understand all negative talk about Hallie's costume. I thought it was hot and slick. And what was up with Sharon Stone's face. It's like they use so much pancake make-up so you can't even see one wrinkle, or maybe they are just trying to hide plastic surgery scars. She really is starting to look like an alien. Why can't she just accept her age and stop trying to dress like a 20 year old.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: I liked Catwoman and I'm also a cat lover, so maybe that has something to do with it. While the plot wasn't the best, I thought the action scenes and feline one-liners was good. I recommend it."

Catwoman was the remain of the old, make-a-crappy movie-out-of-great-story school, which rivals Batman Forever and Superman IV on the title of: super-bad movie.\n\nNo shape and size inside the movie, story delivery is poor, and who would ever think Catwoman would walk into a disco bar and danced along to get attention? I mean, this movie was more a hip-hop video gig than a fully featured movie.\n\nIf you wanna see Catwoman, Batman Returns is the movie for you.\n\nP.S. No, neither the producer nor the cast, and least screenwriters - didn't read a single comic book about Catwoman. Nor owned a cat."

Who can fly, and generally act like a cat. But she's supposed to do that, she's Catwoman! And then of course, there's the awful casting of Alex Borstein as comic relief (read \"waste time in this piece of garbage movie, make the audience laugh because they probably want to stab themselves for ever purchasing tickets\"). And then, the abysmal special effects. I've played video games with better CGI than this. And then, the usual sex scene and clich\u00e9d romance. And then, the horrendous dialog. Sin City was fantastic, and had bad dialog. But it didn't take itself seriously.\n\nThis does.\n\nAnd of course, the fast paced cutting. You can barely see the action on screen. And it shows just how fake it actually is. One moment they're here, 2 seconds later, another place. And the fighting just looks fake. It's awful.

And it was undoubtedly the worst superhero movie I've seen so far, surpassed only by \"Steel\" in 1997.\n\nFirst of all, the film is shamelessly unfaithful to the source material. Except for the film's title, there are no ties between this film and the DC universe. Catwoman's alter ego isn't named Selina Kyle. There are no other DC characters involved or mentioned. The story doesn't even take place in Gotham City. In fact, the city isn't identified at all.\n\nBesides being nothing like Selina Kyle, Patience's new and unnecessary feline traits render her character laughable, such as sleeping on shelves, hissing at dogs, gobbling down sushi and tuna, etc. She's not even a true cat burglar; she's only stealing jewelry because cats like shiny objects. Not to mention a few incredibly lame cat puns she utters, such as when thwarting a robbery: \"What a purrrrrfect plan\" and when interrogating a goon \"Cat got your tongue?\" Ugh...\n\nThe story is lame and completely out of place for the genre. A vigilante battling an evil cosmetics company that makes anti-aging cream with dangerous side effects just doesn't sound fitting for a superhero movie.\n\nThe effects are terrible, especially the overused and unconvincing CGI. The Egyptian cat that bestows Catwomans powers onto her looks cartoonish, and so do the seagulls seen afterwards. Catwoman's CGI model looked as if it came from a PlayStation 1 game, and the directors' obvious attempts to cover it up by smothering Berry with make-up only made it more ridiculous.\n\nThe practical effects are no better. During the final battle when Laurel falls to her death, it's obviously a dummy. Poor editing and quick cuts only worsen the experience, especially during the aforementioned battle. There's also the films failed attempt at slow-motion effects that only leave sloppy motion blurs, like during Catwomans motorcycle scene.\n\nI doubt even the most hardcore Catwoman fans will find any enjoyment in watching this."

This film is so awful. If you still feel like watching it, DON'T. Rent Striptease with Demi Moore instead. It's as bad as this one. No, it's actually worse which somehow makes it better.\n\nHalle Berry was hot as lava in Monsters Ball, but sorry kids, don't expect the same from this flic."

He's at least as good here as he was in \"Miss Congeniality\".\n\nUnless there's a revival of \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot!\" playing at the multiplex, don't miss this fantastic action film!"

It is meant as an origin story for her and tries to give a more mythological reason for why she's Catwoman. I feel like the pacing can be a little rough and some parts can be pretty predictable. I find that where the movie falls short. Bad pacing makes it bad to follow along. I find some things in the movie taking less time than when I think how long it should take (a policeman goes in the building and up the stairs in less than than a second when I feel like it should have taken several seconds longer to make it to the apartment). In the beginning, they told us what would happen eventually, of which makes that plot point extremely predictable and no way a surprise. I find it better if they left the thing at the beginning. That and a bit of the pacing kinda got to me and makes it worse in my opinion. I find this movie as a worse version of Cruella, of which released about 17 years after this one. Both movies are about fashion designer anti-heroes living a double life trying to take revenge on those who wronged them and has characters we know are villains and making them the main character. This movie just failed to keep my attention as much as Cruella did.\n\nOverall, I find Catwoman is a comic book film that failed to be good as other comic book films."

Too much time is spent setting up the ridiculous story, creating a character that is too far removed from the comics. Halle Berry is decent enough, but plays the part a little too ditzy. Sharon Stone hams it up, but that is probably the best part of the movie. The plot, centering on a beauty cream that stops aging but destroys the skin if you stop using it, is beyond stupid. The meeting of cop Benjamin Bratt and Berry is ignorant. If I had to rescue a woman who was trying to save a cat, I think I would have her committed instead of buy her a drink. But, all of this could have been campy fun. Unfortunately, director Pitof actually believes he is making a good movie. I find it more than a little sad that no one realized this kind of film-making is only good in cheap TV-movies. The real killer of the movie is it's reliance on bad computer effects. I've never been a fan of them in general (I think it takes more creativity to mold the effects out of real objects than to punch keys); I really hate bad effects. The one's here are the worst I have ever seen in such a high-profile, expensive movie."

First off I gave this film 4 out of 10 stars for a few reasons, but I think why people dislike this film so much is because the writers & directors tried to fantasize & upgrade a story that didn't need upgrading. People liked the Julie Newman Catwoman of the 1960's Batman TV show & Michelle Pfeiffer of the 90's Batman Returns film. It's like when the Coke company came out with New Coke in the mid 80's when everyone was happy with the original formula. Why give her superpowers where to my knowledge Catwoman was just an extraordinary person like Bruce Wayne/Batman? Also the name change to Patience may have thrown some longtime Catwoman fans off. I think that's why we see more realistic Catwomans in The Dark Knight Rises & The Batman. This film also might be the reason why we see more gritty, realistic Batman films in the Batman films that succeed this. Overall decent flow to the film, good action, varying performances by all actors & a decent soundtrack. Again 4 out of 10 stars."

So I'm not an ardent Catwoman fan - which may help to keep my perspective neutral.\n\nI didn't really like this movie but it wasn't so much for Halle Berry's acting or the performance of any of the other actors. Personally I think Halle did a pretty good job. She was naive and insecure when being \"normal\" and she became sexy and self-assure when she was Catwoman. Can't fault her there. I think we all agree that she played the normal part very well - the differences in the perception of her performing skills come, when the Catwoman part is concerned. Whether you like her version of Catwoman then depends probably on how you'd like Catwoman to be. For me - who has never given a thought about that - she played well. If you're thinking along the lines of a \"real\" Criminal who enjoys her crimes and who is also cruel ... well, you may be disappointed by Halle Berry's much tamer approach.\n\nThere are a couple of things, however, which are pretty bad and ultimately manage to drag this movie down - no matter the quality of the actors.\n\nThe thing I found most annoying is the camera work. Three seconds this angle ... three seconds that angle ... after three seconds yet another angle. This constant change of the camera angle is making it incredibly difficult to get into the movie. Try to watch this on fast forward and you'll go nuts. Scene and angle changes are nice and sometimes necessary - one can overdo things, however, and this is horribly overdone.\n\nIf you're familiar with the Catwom comic character and have formed an opinion for yourself how she should be ... you'd probably be better off avoiding this movie. If you haven't formed an opinion yet you have a chance of enjoying this one - if you manage to ignore the frenzied camera angle changes."

Halle Berry seems to be having a blast playing the mild mannered girl who dies, gets brought back to life by a group of cats, and suddenly is a sexy cat burgler/revenge vigilante.. Still, we dont get to know enough of her before she is murdered to really care too much for her or notice the differences upon her transformation. Benjamin Bratt, who seems to be making a career out of playing cop boyfriends here is the police detective who becomes involved with her.. of course since there is absolutely zero chemistry between Berry and Bratt the romance doesnt work at all.. in fact very little in this film works. Sharon Stone as the egomaniacal villain just makes you feel sorry for the state of her career.. the action sequences are weak and the CG Catwoman animation is just terrible and looks like a video game. Really one of the worst films of the year. GRADE: F"

If one looks hard enough, that is.\n\nPersonally, I'd say that one good point, at least, is the cast. All actors seem intent to do the best with what little the script offered them. Which - and this is where we get started on the bad points - isn't much. Believable characters are a seriously endangered species in Catwoman:\n\nTake your average, but beautiful female loser with a boring daytime job and about as much assertiveness as an empty glass of water, then provide her with superpowers and a whip. Next, choose the love interest: a good-looking guy with an honorable job and the drive to prove his perfection in every situation, especially if that situation is dangerous. Then, we need the best friend: not all that attractive, not all that interesting, selfless in pushing the heroine towards the love interest (despite crushing on that love interest, too). The villain is the walking, talking clich\u00e9e of a bitter, middle-aged woman trapped in an unhappy marriage who thus gives up on all feelings and goes strictly for the money. Her husband is really just the typical asshole boss who cheats on his wife and spends the rest of his time yelling at employees.\n\nMeet the main characters of Catwoman! Hurrah!\n\nSadly, it doesn't get much better. The plot is ridiculous; the special effects look like special effects; Catwoman's outfit appears to have been bought in a cheap s & m leather shop; and more than just a few points are made with a sledgehammer and make me wonder just how stupid the movie creators think we are. Hopefully not as stupid as the love interest aka Tom Lone, who doesn't recognize his poorly disguised girlfriend even as she's kissing him.\n\nOverall, the movie might have been tolerable had it not relied quite as much on the sex appeal of its main actress. As it is, it leaves you with a bad aftertaste and the sound of a splashing whip that you'd expect from late-night channel surfing rather than from a movie that allegedly wants to appeal to young female moviegoers.\n\nWasted money, but it might be fun to rent for a movie night with some friends and a lot more beer."

But we were pleasantly surprised.\n\nSure there were some plot holes and the CGI was pretty obvious, but Halle Berry played a very likable character--and she definitely had her sexy strut down. When Catwoman wanted to kick butt, she did it with flair.\n\nAnd I've got to tell you, I didn't get the feeling that the movie makers took the movie too seriously. Watching an ignorant Patience rubbing catnip all over her face in the throes of feline ecstasy and then a few minutes later trying to deal with why she'd done it was pretty funny. And you gotta love her method of dealing with obnoxious neighbors.\n\nIf you want to pick the movie apart, there's definitely plenty of room in this flick. But if you're willing to just go along for the ride, it's a fun one. The storyline probably could've been better, but I enjoyed the Patience/Catwoman character and I'd be willing to check out another film about her.

Patience Phillips is the contemporary take on it.\n\nI think the 'raters' are being a bit harsh with this one, there are a large amount of flaws but there are also a few plus points.\n\nFirst lets look at the flaws, OK well this may take a while cause there are a few so i think i will just look at the main ones. 1. the script isn't great, there were a couple of moments when i kind of cringed for instance when Hallie berry walks up to a glass door (bearing in mind its glass totally transparent so she is able to see through it) an says ' is anybody there'. there were a number of moments like this when i thought 'not to quick on the up check are u patience. 2. There is a total lack of mismatch in the villain department , cat-woman is like this karate cat thing then she is basically up against someone with really hard skin. 3. this is the biggest one for me Hallie's best friend in this movie is so annoying, when ever this lady speaks all that exits her mouth is a barrage of MTV style sentence's, she also seems to delusional think she is a fine honey, and continuously gives Hallie Berry advice on how to pull men. OK thats the most annoying things on the up side: 1. Halle is awesome as cat-woman, she is sexy and confident and i don't think many other actresses could have been as good as she was taking into account the films main falling point. 2. some of the fight scenes were quite cool, I think it was corpora the Brazilian form of martial arts she was performing, don't get me wrong, i don't know much about that kind of thing though so i may be mistaken. 3. OK the cgi wasn't brilliant but it was not as bad as previously made out. OK thats all i can think of at the moment so i will wrap it up. if you like Hallie berry watch this film, if you are an OPEN MINDED comic fan give it ago. if you are after an hour and a half of not so serious entertainment with an attractive lead and a tenuous romantic relationship give it a go. If you are a comic fan boy or are after a serious film steer clear my rating 5.5 out of ten not great but if there is nothing on or Ur a man with a lonely night ahead of you give it a look"

The story and the main villains plot is beyond silly and for that reason alone this movie is already a waste of time.\n\nBut there is more wrong with this movie. First of all this movie has almost nothing to do with the Catwoman who we all knew from the Batman franchise. The makers have taken lots of liberties and changed the character and settings entirely. Why? Whatever their intention was, they failed terribly with it. The character isn't interesting and the story also doesn't make her always understandable. One time she has a sort of amnesia and she doesn't remember what happened when she Catwoman and vice versa when she was Patience Phillips and then at other points of the movie she remembers everything perfectly. It makes the movie confusing at times and the main character a totally unbelievable one.\n\nDisappointing was also the main villain(s) who are perhaps always the most important element of a superhero movie. Like I mentioned before, the villain(s) intention were totally lame and not likely, even by comic-book-movie standards.\n\nThe movie features some at times horrible (and pointless) CGI-effects. Also the action sequences weren't much good, this is due to the absolutely horrible and just totally wrong action editing.\n\nQuite honestly, Halle Berry isn't horrible as Patience Phillips although she isn't great as Catwoman. Please give the Razzie's to really bad actors and not to good actors who play in bad movies. Her Catwoman costume was however quite ridicules to look at. Does she has no self respect as an actress? There are some other good and well known actors in this movie but the script doesn't provide them with anything good or interesting to do on screen.\n\nYes, the movie does have some entertainment value but the silly story and the way it is told make this movie nothing more than a poor superhero movie wannabe.\n\n4/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "The 2001 Oscars have been dubbed by many, including myself, as the Night Of Political Correctness. I still maintain that Denzel Washington has never deserved an Oscar, since to him, every character is alike and about as multidimensional as a puddle of urine. People still believe he is a great actor, unfortunately. Halle Berry, on the other hand, has set about proving me correct in my statement that during X-Men 2, one half expects Anna Paquin to turn to Halle and declare that she earned her Oscar. Halle proves this expectation in spectacular fashion here.\n\nEven if Halle were the best actor on this grey Earth, she would be utterly unable to escape the poor conception of this cinematic abortion. Spinning off from Batman is not such a bad idea, but the character of Catwoman does not work as a hero. Her sinister nature as a cat prevents it. But that is one of the least of the woes here. The plot, if one can call it that, revolves around an evil conspiracy within a cosmetics company to market a product that is destroying the health of customers. Yes, you heard me right. Mr. Cranky hits the nail directly on the head when he says that this film sets back the idea of a female lead superhero so far that it may never return. Which is a shame, because a Rogue spin-off from the X-Men series is something I'd gladly pay to see.\n\nSharon Stone gets a thankless turn as the lead villain, who promptly tells us in the climax that using her product forever will give the user a virtual stoneskin, while stopping its usage will destroy said user. Hang on a minute, didn't Catwoman just stop her friend from using the stuff not forty minutes ago? You know, that support character who is never mentioned again, anyway? Can we say this plot detail was quite clearly not thought through? Anyway, back to Ms. Stone. Stone's career has fallen hard in the wake of the downfall of the erotic thriller, and given that she appeared in such classics as Police Academy 4 before then, it's hardly a surprise to see her so at home in something so dismal. She is quite clearly comfortable in her B-grade environment. Berry, on the other hand, looks absolutely lost with having to balance the weight of the entire film on her slender shoulders.\n\nBenjamin Bratt was basically washed up when he left Law & Order, and Catwoman does nothing to change that. Like Stone, he is a decent actor drifting in a sea of crap, and just tries to salvage a little credibility. In his favour, he manages to keep the film from becoming another pathetic feminist man-bash. How, I don't quite know, but he does. Maybe it is the fact that he is the only actor in the entire picture who doesn't look absolutely lost.\n\nThey say that the name of a director can often indicate that it will be an unmitigated crapfest. Since the Alan Smithee alias has already been exposed for this, Hollywood has resorted to coming up with more creative aliases for bad directors. Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle had McG, and now Catwoman ups the ante with Pitof. I suppose we could acknowledge the honesty inherent in a name that sounds like someone spitting, but really, one would think Hollywood studios could put two and two together, to deduce that maybe the money-paying public can smell crap films a mile off thanks to these names now.\n\nI won't even dignify Catwoman by giving it a one, a score that signifies to me that a film is bad enough to be good. Catwoman is so bad that it goes right past being good and ends up awful. I gladly await the use of the racism defense against the general crap level of this film."

He criticized the filmmakers for giving little thought to providing Berry \"with a strong character, story, supporting characters or action sequences,\" but his primary criticism came from the failure of the film to give the audience a sense of what her character experienced as she was transformed into Catwoman. He rather referred to it as being a movie \"about Halle Berry's beauty, sex appeal, figure, eyes, lips and costume design. It gets those right.\" Um, Ebert, are you saying they got the costume design right? Because this is definitely one of the things that went very wrong. Not only does the film completely miss the tone of what a Batman or Gotham City film should be, it also does some very strange things with Catwoman. I appreciate their trying to go in anew direction, but it was the wrong direction."

Maybe people were expecting a Christopher Nolan type film that takes itself overly serious but I'm very glad that wasn't this film.

But not only is it fun, it has a lot of good action, the movie moves along at a good pace, keeps you involved and gives you a lot of laughs when you need them. In my opinion these superhero movies should be like the comic books they came from, easy to look at, simple yet detailed story and most importantly, FUN. The Hulk, Spiderman, Daredevil, and Catwoman all did a great job of bringing the comic books to life."

Its often very funny, possibly when it isn't supposed to be funny, but who cares where the humour stems from at least its there. If this film had been done more as a pastiche than a serious superhero film, it may have survived a little better. Shot like an extra long music video, the film does have some decent directorial ideas, but they just don't come through. Pitof puts some great angles in, and often has some flair for imagination, but to often the film chops and changes set pieces and moves at such a pace that you have no time to take in the fact that the film is actually quite pretty.\n\nThe script and storyline are just terrible. Whoever is responsible should never write ever again. Killer face cream... enough said. Sharon Stone and Halle Berry do well with the little characterisation they're given. Had this been a showdown between Michelle Pfeiffers Catwoman and Sharon Stones Katherine Tramell I can't help think this film may have been a hit.\n\nIts a real shame that this film just didn't go correctly. It is my belief that Catwoman is a great Superhero/Villain and I think if done correctly it could be great, but until then sit back, relax and take in this Catwomans absurdities. It's not good, however it is watchable.\n\nHalle Berrys Razzie win does seem a little extreme, though her acceptance speech is brilliant."

        "review_detailed_main": "With the bar set high by the \"Spider-Man\" and \"X-Men\" franchises, today there is a certain expectation for movie adaptations of comic books. \"Catwoman\" fails to live up to the simple expectation that such a movie be more entertaining than \"Daredevil.\" It is as if the filmmakers simply stopped thinking beyond the concept of \"Halle Berry in a catsuit,\" and could not be bothered to fit around her an engaging story, a memorable villain, or colorful supporting characters. And most toxic of all is Berry's performance itself.\n\nNearly a decade ago another film similarly tried to coast on the sex appeal of its central character. While \"Barb Wire\" did bomb at the box office, it nonetheless offered up entertainment. Pamela Anderson, as the title character, displayed little acting talent; as a walking, talking caricature, however, she thoroughly infected the movie with trashy appeal. Her utterly guileless line-readings even made the deadly dialogue spring to life. (\"Don't call me 'Babe'!\")\n\nNeither blessed (nor cursed) with Anderson's larger-than-life persona, Berry turns in an earnest performance not so distinguishable from her \"Storm\" in the \"X-Men\" movies, minus some garments. Whereas there she blended in as part of an ensemble, Berry's blandness is brought front and center here. Oscar-winning performance not withstanding, Berry's lack of range renders her transformation from timid Patience Phillips to Catwoman a mere cosmetic costume change from dowdy to S&M; she displays no matching inner change, aside from playing up some cattiness. And this exposes a fundamental weakness in the casting of Berry as Catwoman: instead of a transformation of a girl into a woman, the girl remains, only playing dress-up. The role required an actress who could project the sly, worldly adultness of previous Catwomen Eartha Kitt and Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nBut then again, with nothing else in place to prop up the central character, even better-suited actresses would be hard-pressed to transcend this material. Sharon Stone, as the villain, here lacks the charisma she brought to \"Basic Instinct,\" \"Total Recall,\" or even episodes of \"The Practice.\" Benjamin Bratt ends up almost as anonymous as the rest of the supporting characters. And the only thing director Pitof brings to the table with semblance a comic book is his name.\n\nSuccessful comic books achieve the illusion of fluidity from panel to panel. In \"Catwoman\" the effect is the exact opposite: The movie always feels oddly static, as if entire scenes are stuck in singular panels. Fittingly enough, \"Catwoman\" never seems intended to be anything more than the movie equivalent of a Maxim magazine photo spread. And the costume itself reflects this entirely: Ill-suited for fighting, and made to fall off during a pillow fight at a soft-core slumber party."

She now has all the characteristics of a cat. She is not good or evil, she is catwoman.\n\nShe beats up bad guys and takes on the cosmetic industry.\n\nThere are many problems with this rendition of the character of catwoman but it is not quite as bad as many people make out.\n\nFirstly there is the character of catwoman. Catwoman is a projection of the male fantasy woman, but with a twist. She is more, beyond his control. This is why she is the perfect enemy/lover of batman.\n\nBut in this version Halle Berry is just not sexy enough. She might be the sexiest woman alive but catwoman is not just sexy in the playboy centerfold way. Instead she is desirable because she is in control.\n\nAlso, there are not many female superheroes and this one belongs in the 1950s. Catwoman is sexy and powerful. But catwoman is something that controls the character of Patience rather than being the power and sexiness she finds in herself. It is not a character than woman for the last 30 years can identify with.\n\nWhere is the supervillan. I mean, she gets to fight a woman whose only power is that she has a face like marble from using a new super cosmetic. If you don't have a good supervillan you don't have a good superhero.\n\nThe story, I mean, really, it was so full of holes the working title of this movie was probably \"Swiss Cheese\". There is no development of the evil, no reason for the murders. The bad person is a woman who is powerful (this is not a spoiler you find this out near the beginning) and beautiful. There is no choice presented to her or Catwoman to be good or evil. Powerful older woman = evil. Young beautiful powerful woman = good.\n\nThe CGI. Computers mean you can make people jump around in an unrealistic way. Guess what, to the audience it looks silly. Siperman only got away with this because a lot of it happened during some interesting plot and character development.\n\nThe clothes. Nothing special there. She should either have stuck to the first outfit or had a lot of costume changes (something I like, I mean unless people from Krypton don't have Body Order superman's costume probably spells something shocking).\n\nHowever, the story introduces the character of catwoman, and makes it interesting enough to think about. Not worth seeking out, but work watching if you have a couple of hours and have you no wet paint to watch dry."

Unfortunately, as soon as she starts to recite this film's ridiculous dialogue, her good looks are negated by everything else that is wrong with this movie. Although I think of Berry as one of the elite actresses of her generation, not even she can help but hack her way through the ludicrous dialogue she's forced to use. Of all recent films I've seen lately, this one is superior to \"You Got Served\" (the worst movie possibly of all time), but that's about it. Don't waste your time."

The screenwriter very thoughtfully wanted us to be sure that the character is 'cat'-woman. So he/she/it designed a script, with much help from hip-hop and R&B musical influences, to show constantly her feline attitudes, abilities and mannerisms so that it imprints on our brains that she's essentially a 'cat'.\n\nThey needed a story and a villain. No problem, no need for an original story when you got enough comic books. For the villain they cast the aging Sharon Stone, perhaps anticipating her ability to bring success through her loyal male fanbase of Basic Instinct. And finally they got some action scenes with expensive digital effects and ever-changing stylish camera angles... the marvel of modern technology.\n\nThus they made a film.

He was in charge with the visual effects of several success movies, including one of the later 'Alien' films. 'Catwoman' is only his second film, and his first in the US. The story brings the comics female cat-hero into a rather banal bad-corporate-America plot. Nothing too special, nothing we have not yet seen in many similar films already. A feeling of deja-vu (and too often!) comes also from the hero - just-a-human duality of the character that was inserted here as in many such films to achieve some effect of deepness. Unfortunately, Pitof has nothing new to say as a director, and even not too much to say as a visual effects expert either, at least not in this film. The set and the effects looked too cartoonish to me, and the graphic approach intentionally cartoonish probably, seemed to be simplistic. For a film made the same year as 'Spiderman 2' this is not enough. The relationship between the girl/cat hero and the police inspector lacked any tension, and did not fit too well in a film that targets the whole family, unless you accept that it's aimed rather for adults with kid mindset. Sure, Halle Berry is beautiful, she fits well in the catwoman outfit and seems to enjoy what she is doing, but this is not enough. It's fair entertainment, but still 'Catwoman' is not even a good film in the comics movies genre. 5 out of 10 on my personal scale."

We aren't even talking \"The Hulk.\" It was a good decent movie.\n\nThere are actually many things to enjoy about this movie.\n\nFirst of all great enjoyment may be had by watching Halle Berry. No stunt double could affect the walks she took on. Hey! Walking is acting! OK, the rest of the acting she did was great too.\n\nSharon Stone really brought it for this movie as well. There are some people who can bring it to the screen and she is one of them.\n\nGreat enjoyment is had in watching Catwoman kick butt. Great enjoyment is also had in watching Catwoman and Sharon's character square off.\n\nPersonally I enjoy a movie in which a character, particularly a female character, learns to be come strong.\n\nThe plot was logical and you could follow it.\n\n(BTW: Benjamin Bratt was great as well, though his part was pretty limited.)\n\nThe critics do have some ground to stand on, however. It did not make the grade for a great movie for several reasons.\n\nThe main character changes greatly through the movie but these changes are not explored or explained so they seem very disconnected. The rest of the characters were rather hollow and clich\u00e9d. You might expect this from the film's comic book origin but movie goers have come to expect more.\n\nThe CGI Catwoman was very obviously CGI and was rather intrusive. The animation was jerky, did not maintain constancy of form and contained movements not natural to the universe or character.\n\nI am puzzled as to why the producers felt it necessary to change the name and origin of the character. No doubt this annoyed fans of the Batman universe.\n\nThere were some other things that limited the movie, but not enough to take it down completely.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this movie."

Imagine that the director of a Brittney Spears music video is handed a budget for an action movie, and also gets to write the script. What do you think will happen? This movie will happen. The plot is absolutely pathetic, without any direction, context or motivations. It's like a 5 year old's imagination of what an action movie should be like.\n\nIt didn't need to be like this. Halle Berry can act. The budget was there. But this is arguably the worst written and worst directed film I've ever seen. It's up there in the rarefied atmosphere of stinkers with \"Ishtar\". The only redeeming feature that makes it better than Ishtar is the fact that things happen and Halle Berry looks good. in Ishtar, Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman don't look that good, and much of the movie is just wandering around.\n\nBut putting it in the same ballpark with Ishtar says a lot, doesn't it? There's an old Gary Larson \"Far Side\" cartoon captioned \"Video store in hell,\" and every title is Ishtar. I think we can now revise that so half of the titles are Ishtar, and half are \"Catwoman.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "There are films so bad that they actually manage to achieve an entertainment value all of their own. And then there are films so bad that they are just bad. Catwoman falls squarely into the latter category. After Michelle Pfeiffer's revelatory turn as Catwoman in Batman Returns, many waited anxiously to see a re-teaming between her and Tim Burton in a separate film. Sadly, that did not happen. Instead, we get this cheesy, congealed mess, which feels like it is still in the development stage. Halle Berry does the honors this time as a mousy woman, who mystically survives a deadly experience and returns with feline powers. Her story feels like an incredibly limp and aimless rehash of what Batman Returns did much better. Berry, crammed into a ludicrous outfit that looks like a cross between S&M bondage and a cheap bikini, plays the role like she is a frustrated runway model. The sequence where she balances cat-like on furniture in her apartment while chatting nonchalantly on the phone is particularly laughable. There is no edge to her work here - whereas Pfeiffer's Catwoman was a woman on a mission of revenge, Berry's Catwoman seems oddly aimless. The supporting cast does not help. Frances Conroy shows up briefly in an embarrassing role as some sort of librarian who has to explain Berry's newfound powers to her. Alex Borstein is intolerable as Berry's typically loud-mouthed friend/co-worker. Benjamin Bratt is unimpressive as the cop who falls for Berry resulting in non-existent chemistry. And for the villain of the piece, we get a diabolical cosmetic queen, played by a shell-shocked Sharon Stone. To be fair, early in the film when her husband replaces her with a much younger woman, Stone does manage one or two affecting moments as a woman whose youth and glory days are falling by the wayside, but said depth evaporates quick. A late plot twist with Stone seems to come out of no where and she never seems much of a match for Berry. It may have been helpful if she had a character that would have allowed her to go over the top, but the character even on paper does not seem especially notable. There are literally no action pieces that stand-out and whoever is responsible for that ear-shattering warble that passes for music throughout the film should be throttled. Sadly, the film never achieves the level of so bad it is fascinating. Rather it is so bad it is just plain boring."

But you live in a world that has no place for someone like me. You see, sometimes I'm good. Oh, I'm very good. But sometimes I'm bad. But only as bad as I wanna be. Freedom is power. To live a life untamed and unafraid is the gift that I've been given, and so my journey begins.\n\nSneer, if you will, but this film had great make-up, great stunt work, and, most of all, it had Halle Berry. Maybe I am prejudiced, but that's the facts.\n\nJust a book lovers try to compare movies to books, I would guess that comics people do the same. I don't know about the Catwoman of comics fame; I just know of this terrific girl who was trying to find herself.\n\nAlex Borstein was cool as sally, and Benjamin Bratt was also good as the man trying to peel away the layers and find out who Catwoman was.\n\nIt's not batman or Spiderman, just Catwoman and good campy fun."

My qualifications: NONE, but I couldn't possibly screw anything up as badly as you people did with Catwoman.

As a result she is under a lot of pressure and those in charge are willing to do anything in order to increase their profit margins. So when Patience accidentally walks into a secret meeting where they are discussing the harmful benefits of their new product she is shot at and subsequently dies in an attempt to escape. However, she is magically resurrected by some extremely unique Egyptian cats with incredible mystical powers. Not only that but she also inherits certain feline attributes which enhance her physical abilities as well. And part of her is tired of being pushed around. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie definitely had its faults and deserves some of the criticism that has come its way. However, I do not think that Halle Berry deserved a Razzie Award for \"Worst Actress\". Quite the contrary. Although Julie Newmar essentially holds the patent for that particular role, it should also be noted that Halle Berry brought a good deal of sex appeal to her performance as well. That being said, the problems with this film centered more on the awful CGI and the overall plot than Halle Berry's performance. At least that is my opinion. In any case, while this movie wasn't nearly as good as it could have been, I don't believe it was nearly as bad as some have suggested and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average."

There was Michelle Pfiffer. This Catwoman moves like a cat, but she fights like a tiger! That puts Pfiffer into shame. The movie in my opinion is good, it wasn't blockbuster good it was great, personally. Any movie that doesn't do well in the theaters doesn't mean that they are bad period. Everything may have been obvious to most people, but tough criticism really hurts the sell of the movie. I enjoyed the movie whether it did or didn't do well in the box office. So be your own critic about this movie and make the judgment for yourself. Rating 3 out of 5 stars."

I managed to catch this for free on my friend's cable, so I don't feel as violated as I could if I had been paying to see the film. That doesn't mean I didn't feel plainly insulted by the garbage that this film tried to pass off as watchable. One can plainly see just by looking at this movie how horrible it is. The movie makers seem to have been trying to take the cheesiness of the final batman movie (which, might I add, made it bad) and mix it with a blatant feminist 'a-woman-is-as-good-as-a-man' mentality. The result of this cross-pollination is a blossom of something that goes far and beyond the level of asininity that any work of media should ever attempt.\n\nHalle Berry, who I don't like to begin with, acts about as well as a freshman high school student in their first school play (I wonder if she pictures the audience naked when she gets nervous?). Often times, what can help a movie recover from a poor lead are it's supporting actors. However, if by supporting actors, one means actors that help support the lead and tell the story well... then this movie had slim to no chance of recovery. Particularly rank were the performances of Sharon Stone (who always seems to be a detriment to whatever movie that was unfortunate enough to cast her) and Frances Conroy (who makes it feel like her character would do better as the insane Seer from J.K. Rowling's writing and not as the wiser woman she is supposed to be portraying). Benjamin Bratt seems to be the only one doing a halfway decent job of acting, and that is most likely due to the fact that he is once again cast as the same thing he seems to be in every work he does: a cop. With a cast that obviously doesn't have their heart in the work that they do, one can't help but wonder why they are even doing it. And that isn't even mentioning the poor writing and hideous (yes, HIDEOUS) costume design of Catwoman herself.\n\nIt certainly makes me yearn for the days of yore, when Michelle Pfeiffer played a Catwoman who was more about the crime, or the 'hunt' if you will, than about the possible feminist aspects of being a strong and independent woman. The times when feline prowlers didn't have to prove themselves, and had the nine lives to back them up."

        "review_detailed_main": "How to describe this movie? It's a tough question. I could go with something pictorial, like a giant pile of manure covered in a swarm of buzzing flies, or try to invoke some sort of description based upon the booing and jeering audience in the cinema when I saw this. But those would not be good enough. No, this movie left me feeling at the end of it as if it had just murdered my entire family, and then subjected me to a couple of millennia of Abu Ghraib-styled torture.\n\nJust what is it that provokes such vitriolic hatred? The movie is just flawed, from start to finish. I know from experience not to expect too much from American superhero flicks, but this makes \"Batman and Robin\" look like a masterpiece of modern film-making. The script is embarrassingly clich\u00e9d and bad, the cinematography is average at best, and Halle Berry's acting is about as wooden as the contents of a lumber yard. Apart from Ms Berry, all of the other actors here, mostly a collection of Hollywood wannabes and has-beens, overact to a degree that would make William Shatner blush with embarrassment.\n\nSome people might think it slightly silly that I'd take offence at going to see tripe like this, but when you think about it, the millions of dollars that were spent on the bevy of special effects in this film (an ironic term, since not a single one of them is very special at all), could have been spent on cancer research, feeding starving African children, or, perhaps my favourite, actually putting together a decent film that people will watch out of something other than a sick sense of fascination with bad cinema."

The script, mainly mirroring Patience' (Halle Berrys) transition to the ultra cool superhero, is superficial to say the least. The characters come from the handbook \"How to make film without lots of surprises\", changing \"without lots of\" to \"with no\". It looks that no one in the production team cared about the quality of the movie as a whole. Some clich\u00e9s are so predictable that it's hard to stand even for admirers of Berry (who is allowed to present her physical attributes, but even that doesn't save it). Catwoman is a film that, when accidentally stopped during the screening, would hardly leave anyone to beg for continuing. A film every future director should see \u0096 look it up under file \"How to do it not\"."

The plot is total nonsense which has something to do with Berry deciding to become the character because of her sense of smell abilities but at the same time torn between becoming a super hero and as a civilian. She also falls in love with a cop Tom, (Benjamin Bratt perhaps handpicked by Berry) they hook up and eventually cross paths as he doesn't want to arrest her since he falls for her. The heroics is beyond ridiculous full of second rate over acting conveniently happen whenever Berry is around- what are the odds of that happening. Bomb."

In fact I think she is an incredibly hot woman and I wouldn't kick her out of my bed if she decided to have a sleep over at my place. As an actress I do not have a problem with her, but I do have a problem with her choice of roles... maybe she needs a new agent (Halle I am available!)\n\nWhat everyone needs to realize is that Halle is not responsible for this movie sucking. It's the writers who need to be shot here (maybe director too /shrug). There is nothing to this movie... the entire thing feels to me like a very flashy commercial for some kind of Dominatrix shop in Hollywood. The plot holes are too numerous to even list here, and bringing them up might put me to sleep.\n\nHalle, even your beauty cannot save this film. It's a shame no one has learned from movies like Barbwire... just because you have a scantily clad sex goddess in the movie does not mean you can pay somebody $5 to write a script and expect people to actually enjoy your movie.\n\nTo the writers/director/producers of this horrible movie: You should be ashamed of yourselves, please stop making movies and seek alternate forms of employment. Oh and screw you for making me waste my hard earned cash.\n\nP.S: Halle I meant what I said, I can surely do better as your agent then whoever is getting you into these terrible films... call me =)\n\nMatt"

Halle Berry would have been my first choice for the part, but the acting was average, Halle, did not look that good, of course only in terms of acting, she is a stunning actress. The story was not very good, it seemed unimportant, and as well childish, it is about a cream that makes women ugly, it does not kill, but can effect their health, I thought that was really awful. I think if the story was changed, the movie would have been tones better, as well, they could have added a villain maybe, something else, that stands a match, instead of a strong woman. The fighting, and action scenes were very imaginative, and fun to watch, overall, the movie was fun to watch, not very deep in emotions, but more just \"fun\", it also tells the story of how Halle or Catwoman, become a stronger person, have higher self-esteem, which is quite an important story, or message to tell."

I'm not even half way through the movie and it already makes me this upset to actually write about it. I will admit that Hallie Barry is very good looking in her outfit but you cant base a whole movie around her good looks. Also, I don't understand how this is consistent with what Catwoman is supposed to be like. In the Batman movie/cartoons she likes crime, in this movie, shes a crime fighter? Also she apparently can move around the city like Spiderman but without the webs. She's supposed to have the powers of a cat, not a grasshopper.

That's why I can't wait of Catwoman II to see where and how the character develops.\n\nCatwoman is fantastic. Halle worked that cat suit, she even inspired me to go to the gym. Berry became Catwoman, she embodied the feline femme fatale. The way she moved after becoming Catwoman would've have made my kittens proud, it was feline fantastic. Then there's the romance. Berry and Bratt made a sexy couple and their chemistry was magical. Sharon Stone was purrfectly b___y and I mean that as a complement some times a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do. It's a fun film all around. Love the catfights, love the romance, love the man crazy friend, I loved this movie. If it were the 90s I'd give it two around the world snaps. It's not about feminism\u0085 it's about independence. It's not about the old Catwoman\u0085its about the new Catwoman and she still could kick Batman's butt if she wanted or seduce him if she chose to.

Above all else, it was visually stunning and very vibrant. \"Catwoman\" also looks very sleek, but there just isn't enough substance. The whole plot is ridiculous and so simple it could've been written by school kids (Halle's transformation into Catwoman doesn't make much sense). On the performance side there's not much to say either. I think Halle is a fine actress, but here she just mews stupid one-liners like \"Cat got your tongue?\" (for some reason she reminds me of Arnold in \"Batman & Robin\"... weird, I know). And her controversial dress, well, let's just say Michelle Pfeiffer did it better in 1992. Sharon Stone, another okay actress when given proper material, goes totally over-the-top which is not a good thing, at least not in this case.\n\nI would say \"Catwoman\" is worth just a rental, it isn't the most horrible film in the world but it certainly isn't good either. For a better \"Catwoman\" experience get \"Batman Returns\" with Michelle Pfeiffer."

Catwoman has been around since the 1940's, building a long and detailed history of which there is a lot to choose from. So when Warner Bros. decided to green light the film, they subsequently threw all that out the window and replaced it with a plot that resembles The Devil Wears Prada (2006) mixed with Monkey Business (1952). Though, don't worry there's some Egyptian cat God mumbo-jumbo wedged in to make the action make cursory sense.\n\nPatience (Berry) works for a cosmetics company who is about to release a new skin cream line which has some interesting side-effects. Patience finds out but is drowned before she can notify anyone. Washed up on the shores of an unnamed city, Patience is revived by a magical Mau cat thus giving Patience cat-like abilities. She then uses those abilities to dress-up in a slinky leather costume and fight the CEO of the company Laurel (Sharon Stone) before she releases her skin cream to the masses.\n\nLet's assume you know nothing about Catwoman and thus don't care that the story of the film is almost offensively derivative from the source material. The film is still a jumbled mess of overt plot holes, conspicuously broad characterizations and a particularly fearless performance from Halle Berry who doesn't quite yet know she's about to be put down. Her performance is so emotionally invested in the story and physically over-the-top that you can't help but feel bad for her. Truly, this film is a disaster for all involved."

        "review_detailed_main": "According to the unintelligent opinions of many portly fan boys , catwoman failed at the box office because the catwoman character was black , the director was French and there wasn't enough sex and violence . Well let me be the one to say that these opinions are not only wrong but incredibly dumb. The reason why cat woman failed is because it looked stupid - which it was ! Catwoman sucks on every level . The plot ,that sees our cat powered hero taking on a killer cosmetic company , is just ludicrous. After a short while you wont care about which character does what to who and if you haven't walked away from catwoman after about 20 minutes of screen time then you'll probably be sticking around to criticise its many , many flaws . Flaws like the cringe worthy acting , the atrocious dialogue , the embarrassing cat resurrection scene , the poorly shot action , the hatefully crappy and unnecessary cgi stunts \u0085. Its all just embarrassing ! The film would have benefited from sticking to batman returns continuity and following the further adventures of Selina Kyle (a far more charismatic character than this movies catwoman ) as she faces another DC villain .\n\nThe only high points are the films stylish set design and halle berry's sassy, sexy interpretation of catwoman (and not her nerdy and annoying alter ego , Patience Phillips). These highlight aren't enough to improve this campy , corny and incredibly dumb, waste of a potentially decent comic book flick though. Avoid this cruel joke of a flick and watch batman returns or the original batman animated show instead."

        "review_detailed_main": "Contrary to the movie's general horrible reputation, I actually enjoyed watching this movie. This film is probably \"Catwoman\" in name only, a departure from her true purpose as the sly, sometimes evil, cat burglar, as intended by DC Comics and creator Bob Kane. In this movie, we have Patience Phillips, played by Halle Berry, stumbling upon a plot to get people to buy this beauty cream; you keep on using it, your skin is smooth and strong like marble, and if you stop using it, your skin disintegrates. At the course of the events afterward (I do not want to provide any spoilers), Phillips becomes Catwoman.\n\nCatwoman's mission to foil the villain's plot portrays her as an actual hero in the movie, rather than the crafty cat burglar she originally is in the comic book. This probably upset true comic book fans, for Catwoman was not given her true form in this film, contrary to what what Michelle Pfieffer did to the role in \"Batman Returns.\" Pfeiffer delivered a solid performance as Catwoman and stayed true to form-portrayed as a burglar and a nemesis to Batman, but also has a love interest for the Cape Crusader and reluctant at times to commit crimes, making her more like an anti-hero rather than a villain. Berry portrayed the character more like a superhero, and bears almost no resemblance to the comic book character. In addition, probably the movie's sometimes cheesy dialog and campy special effects contributed to this film's poor reviews. Aside from that, I personally think the action is quite good, the movie is fast-paced, the plot is followed well, the subplot of how a woman can turn into a Catwoman is interesting and Sharon Stone gave a quite devious performance as the villain. The only problem I had was that her role was not emphasized enough; the producers should of depicted her actually showing her crafty self and committing evil deeds, like the villains did in the Batman movies.\n\nIn addition, a picture of Michelle Pfieffer in her Catwoman outfit was briefly seen in Orphelia Powers' house, which meant that Patience Phillips is merely \"another\" Catwoman.\n\nOverall, a pretty exciting and action-packed movie. My favorite scene is when Berry storms into her neighbor's apartment, furious of his overbearing parties, silences everybody by squirting water in his loudspeakers and jumps on him.\n\nSo, with this movie, you may like it, you may detest it. I just treat this as a movie involving another Catwoman in the Batman/DC Ccmics universe.\n\nGrade B-"

        "review_detailed_main": "What a nightmare. Somebody pinch me and wake me up. That's what I kept thinking while watching this movie, which turned out to be a truly painful experience. And I'm not generally a conspiracy theorist, but after enduring \"Catwoman,\" directed by Pitof (who? who?), I'm convinced that someone (or ones) are out to sabotage the careers of both Halle Berry and Sharon Stone (not to mention Benjamin Bratt). It's one thing to set out to make a \"B\" movie, but to waste such talent and beauty through sustained incompetence (yes, sustained, this movie wasn't filmed in a single day, was it? Come to think of it, maybe it was...) is nothing short of criminal (cinematically speaking).\n\nI do not like to dwell on the negative aspects of any film, and I always attempt to seek out the positive (even most bad movies have something good in them, though you often have to look hard and deep to find it), but in fairness to Halle Berry, it must be noted how badly the script, editing, graphics and visual f/x, choreography and the director-- especially the director-- failed her here.\n\nThis misfire shouldn't allow us to forget Berry's excellent performances in such films as \"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge\" and \"Monster's Ball,\" for which she deservedly was awarded an Oscar for Best Actress. The extent of her talent is undeniable and evidenced by the fact that her presence alone can add the necessary spark and elevate the stature of movies like \"Bulworth\" and \"Die Another Day.\" So the million dollar question is, how did she wind up in this embarrassment? She (as well as the audience) deserves better. Obviously, she put her trust in the wrong people this time around, and at the top of that list is the \"director\" of this mishmash, Pitof.\n\nI guess the lesson here is that even a major star should be wary when approached with a project that's been placed in the hands of someone whose name sounds like one of those ridiculous vanity plates you try to figure out while sitting at a red light and staring at the car in front of you. To put this as nicely as possible, Pitof (who? what does that MEAN?) didn't have a clue about what to do with this film, and especially with his actors. How could this have happened? He's given all the ingredients (Berry, Stone, Bratt, big budget) to make a prize winning cake and he turns out a lump unfit for consumption.\n\nAdd to Pitof's incompetence a laughably bad script (even the ability on the part of the viewer to suspend disbelief won't help with this one), bad editing and exceptionally poor computer graphics and visual f/x that look like something left over from the Stone Age of technology (when Catwoman is bounding and leaping about it has the appearance of an early generation video game; she looks more like a frog than a cat) you have a film that should be expunged from the resumes of everyone involved.\n\nBut, like I said, even a bad movie can have a high note if you look for it, which brings me to the only redeeming aspect of this film, the performance by Alex Borstein as Sally, one of Catwoman's co-workers. Best known as the voice of Lois Griffin in TVs \"The Family Guy,\" Borstein has a charismatic presence that, within the context of this film at any rate, outshines even Berry and Stone. Better off for all concerned had this movie been titled \"Sally,\" with Borstein given top billing and accordant screen time.\n\nUnfortunately, too, for all concerned, \"Catwoman\" will enjoy it's full nine lives on the shelves of video stores everywhere. Just keep in mind, when you come to this shelf, pick up \"The Cat's Meow,\" \"The Cat In the Hat,\" \"Cat People.\" \"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof,\" or anything with \"Cat\" in the title that isn't followed by \"Woman.\" Take it from me, you'll feel a lot better in the morning."

At least Halle Berry laughed this off, because if she didn't. I would cry for her right now.\n\nHalle Berry is literally but in a costume that reveals 95% of her body without showing the inappropriate parts of her body. (No offense, it's just there are MPAA ratings), and has to battle a former supermodel who sells bad moisturizer. They couldn't make her fight Black Mask? Or Harley Quinn? Seriously?\n\nThe action scenes are very bad, and the CG just screams fake. Maybe there was a reason this movie bombed. Who am I kidding, there was a big reason! You can't even consider this a DC movie, because it's more about a woman cosplaying as Catwoman. And that awful basketball scene. Most people I know like that scene and the movie because it shows off Halle Berry's body. I admit, Halle Berry is a beautiful woman, but if you want a movie that shows her beauty, you're looking in the wrong place.\n\nSo, doing a bunch of sexual moves on a basketball court in front of a bunch of kids is okay? Man, I must really need to observe human behavior more. Not! I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this movie, because it's not for anyone. But if you do. Just please be careful. It's a train wreck."

It is not enough to make the movie watchable but still it made me rate it 2/10 rather than 1/10. I guess it is something...\n\nNow the bad things... Everything else... Halle Berry is an awful actress. I know, she won \"Oscar\" for some other role but, well, she is an awful actress. All she had to do is to look sexy and she failed miserably. She is a beautiful woman and yet she looks quite ugly here. It wasn't due to her make up or something, she just walks ugly and acts ugly. Her moves remind me more of an ill monkey than a cat or whatever animal she was supposed to look like. Her walk makes her look drunk constantly. I can't even remember the way she talked. I don't remember even the name of her character. Yes, she is THAT faceless.\n\nPitof is an awful director. 'Vidocq' was one of the most painful movie experiences I have ever had and this movie is even worse. Pitof has no sense of pacing, he can't direct anything... He may be good at doing visual effects but that's not enough. You need a real directing talent to do a watchable action movie. If you don't have it...\n\nThe stunts are awful. Badly shot and badly choreographed and it is quite obvious that Berry used a stunt double.\n\nThe story is even worse than the stunts.

I was expecting to see the cheeky and clever woman but at first when I saw her I was surprised. Cause in her origon story she is a prostitute and a theif and she does not have any super powers. I thought I will see an alright movie about my favourite anti-hero but I was wrong. Still I'm giving it 3 stars because hey she is still my favourite character ever"

It's hard to imagine that anyone thought this was a good way to give Catwoman her own story. We've had two versions of Catwoman since this abomination and both of them put this mockery of the character to shame. Plus let's face it, nobody will ever live up to Michelle Pfeiffer's iconic portrayal, she captured lightning in a bottle with her legendary live-action Catwoman. Even Jared Leto's Joker seems like Oscar-worthy material compared to Halle Berry's Catwoman. This film has definitely set the bar for how awful a comic book movie can get."

I liked how they introduced the idea of different generations of Catwomen. I do admit there is some 'corny' parts in the movie but I think its worth every penny!! The main reason people do not like it (at least from the review I read about it) was because they critic was expecting Spider-man material. NO! Don't do that! Catwoman and Spiderman are practically polar opposites. You are an idiot for expecting that if that is what you did! If you are looking for a fun, sexy, action packed movie, go see Catwoman!

        "review_detailed_main": "I finally ended up watching \"Catwoman\" for the \"How Did This Get Made\" podcast, about terrible films, and I have to say, this one really lives up to its reputation as being nearly unwatchable.\n\nPatience Phillips (Halle Berry) unwittingly discovers that the cosmetics firm she's working for is producing an addictive product that will kill people. She's murdered by agents of co-owner Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone) but brought back to life by magic cats and imbued with enhanced speed and agility. Along with a cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) Patience investigates her own 'death' and tries to stop the company before the product hits the wider market.\n\nThis truly lives up to its awful status. It's a boring, unambitious story with terrible performances, an awful script, bad CGI and horrible dated music. All of those criticism pale though in comparison with the movies ultimate problem, director Pitof takes his artistic bent way too far and his constantly moving camera renders the whole effort unwatchable.\n\nThere are some other aspects of the film that I might have liked, Alex Borstein is playing a fun \"best friend\" role, liked a toned-down version of her character from \"Mrs Maisel\" and I like Frances Conroy in other things. Sharon Stone is having a well-deserved renaissance now after this (and \"Basic Instinct 2\") looked like a death knell for her career. She's not actually that bad here but made to look ridiculous by the script. Her criminal plan is one of the least sane I've ever heard, as if when people start dropping dead no other scientist is going to be able to piece together that it's their product.\n\nOften emotions are heightened when a film is new and either excessive praise or criticism can be edged away over time, but \"Catwoman\" is one film entirely deserving of its initial scorn and, if anything, has aged even worse."

Catwoman as a character was not as dark as it was supposed to be.

To say I agree would be an understatement. Holy leather catnip! This was torturous! Patience, a designer for a cosmetic company, is killed after witnessing the side-effects of their product. She is then (stay with me now) brought back to life by a cat who breathes on her corpse, granting her agile abilities of a cat. Thus becoming Catwoman. Completely disregarding its source material, Pitof's adaptation is \"Purrfectly\" terrible in every way. The story is quite simply nonsensical. A cat foresees the fate of Patience and decides to \"test her\" before choosing her to hone the powers of Catwoman. The eponymous anti-hero is not just the nickname for a jewellery thief. Oh no no! Pitof has better ideas! Catwoman is actually an entity of some kind that has been passed down since the Egyptians, bestowing the user the ability to climb walls, leap gracefully, devour fish and cat food, rub their nose in catnip and hiss at dogs. Quite literally embodying a cat (giving Patience a complete personality change). Why? Who actually thought this was a good idea!? Was it Halle Berry who nearly destroyed her career the same year as winning her coveted Oscar? Nope. Was it Sharon Stone who, much like her character, attempts to stay relevant and youthful? Perhaps. What about the overuse of horrific human visual effects that caused me to hiss at the screen? Nearly. The dull story that thinks it metaphorically showcases the negative connotations of using makeup? \"Purrrhaps\". Was it Pitof? Oh, definitely. The clich\u00e9d romance, plot conveniences and unusual addition of an R&B pop soundtrack made for an already outdated experience. But the sheer amount of quick cuts during the action sequences were unforgivable. Physically making me feel nauseous. To be honest with you I could go on and on and on, but you don't want to hear me drone on about how bad this disaster is. Everyone involved should be ashamed. Who even says \"meowww!\" after a fight?"

But, compared to horrible comic book films like Daredevil and The Hulk, Catwoman is OK. The many behind the scenes specials that was aired to promote the movie, you see that Halle is doing most of her own stunts in this film.In the film, it is put together very well with over the top CGI effect so Halle did have the whole Eartha Kitt/Michelle Pfeiffer vibe, if not better because Michelle nor Eartha did their own stunts, sorry, but they were just pretty faces but great actors.Batman Returns is the only good movie coming out of the Batman series.So Michelle is one of the best infamous catwomans. So Halle becoming a fighting machine is applauded.\n\nThe CGI effect could have been a lot less in the film and Sharon Stone performance in this film is overrated, but not as bad as Demi Moore's comeback.(Sharon Stone is trying to make a comeback right?) Benjamin Bratt is a great leading man, but we all know a leading man, or what Hollywood like to call it \"love interest\" ,had to be in the film.Superheroes are best defined by the qualities of the villains they must overcome. Some action sequences are really good, then some are mediocre, and then some are just plain boring.\n\nHalle one liners are hilarious and of course she is great to look at. She did an \"ok\" performance in this movie and the many people that was in the private screening, it was too many people in there I might add and there were even more outside trying to get in, seem to enjoyed it. This movie is not to be taken that seriously, compared to Spiderman and X-men, it is not on its level. Even though Spiderman and Catwoman, both had overrated CGI effects, like the poorly I, Robot,please skip that movie, not worth your money, its an enjoyable movie with likable and non-likable characters with added great performances from Frances Conroy, Lambert Wilson and even the animated Alex Borstein.I also might add it is not as terrible as Batman& Robin, Daredevil, or The Hulk!!!!!!! 7/10"

I don't know about the Catwoman of comics fame; I just know of this terrific girl who was trying to find herself.\n\nAlex Borstein was cool as Sally, and Benjamin Bratt was also good as the man trying to peel away the layers and find out who Catwoman was.

I don't know what happened but they really screwed up Catwoman's story. They had all the pieces there with Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman to make a good movie, yet somehow it morphed into this. Thank God it didn't end here for the DC superhero movies. You could tell the talent was way better than the material they were given to work with. And you can't say they didn't have any talented people attracted to the movie because Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt, Sharon Stone and Alex Borstein are all talented in their own special ways. This movie also seemed like it was rushed into production way to quick because there as some things off about both the script and special effects. But I think this movie is hugely exaggerated on how bad it is. It's not a bad movie but it isn't great. I would recommend this as rental but if you can find it for cheap on sale or watch it for free it's worth a look over"

I guess the one-liners catwoman's says dont help and also her over the top strutting is laughable in this movie.\n\nAnother issue in Catwoman is the thin story.

        "review_detailed_main": "There comes a point where simply reading about cinematic infamy isn't enough, and you have to see it for yourself. 'Ishtar,' 'North,' and 'Showgirls' are all sad examples, and Pitof's much-maligned adaptation of a beloved comic book character is another. Before even watching the movie proper there's a lot to think about, and setting aside the end result, I appreciate the thought and effort that went into this. Myths, legends, and folklore from across all eras and cultures have centered around that truly superior terrestrial life form, the cat; this character is nothing if not an easy symbol for female empowerment, individuality, and a fight against oppressive systems. The writers try to play with these ideas in part, and also weave in themes of extreme corporate and capitalist malfeasance, and sexism. I admire the notion of protagonist Patience being effectively transformed as she takes on a new persona, going from meek and nervous to confident and brash; I take no issue with the way this rendition of a classic character is separated from the wider lore in which she's otherwise based - I see no reason why such a figure couldn't be treated as her very own person. Angus Strathie's guiding tack behind the infamous costume makes perfect sense to me. All this is well and good. And none of it saves 'Catwoman' from the significant problems that weigh it down and have helped it to earn a label as one of the worst films ever made.\n\nThere is a tawdry, dire, overbearing, excruciating lack of tact or nuance characterizing this feature. There's a false, waxy sheen layered over the fundamental image; every instance of CGI is simply unbearable, including not least that first moment when our protagonist has her \"awakening,\" and too many illustrations of her \"powers.\" That CGI, the cinematography, the editing, and a great deal of the writing and direction - dialogue, scenes, characters, plot development, and so on - are forthright, over the top, and even overzealous to the point of being not fun, but hopelessly tacky. This also applies to any action sequences, filled with zip, zest, bombast, style, and a transparent intended \"cool factor,\" but also invariably tiresome for lack of any dynamics or subtlety. There are actually some really terrific ideas here, including the concept of Patience taking on feline traits and behavior, and these lend themselves to genuine delight and laughter at times. The fact that such wit and humor feels kind of out of place in an action flick, well, that's highly unfortunate. I like that Catwoman's fighting style is informed by capoeira, seen far too little in film or TV, but again the issue of how action sequences are orchestrated. I don't think Strathie's costume design or the work of the hair and makeup artists are inherently bad; I think their contributions, like all else here, were guided to the seediest, most blunt, most kitschy, and irritating ends they could be. Even the music, both Klaus Badelt's score and select songs on the soundtrack, are fine in and of themselves, but employed to ends that are actively irritating and far too on the nose.\n\nThe production design and art direction range from earnestly fetching to excessive. For the most part I think the cast is fine, and in the very least they try to imbue their performances with sincerity that is generally far too lacking in the proceedings. All the same, there's a tinge of inauthenticity in the acting, even from the likes of Frances Conroy, Lambert Wilson, or Sharon Stone, that I can only assume is owed to the senseless overcooked ethos that defines every last element. And as for Halle Berry, well... In some moments we see the refined personality, range, and otherwise skills that we know she possesses and has demonstrated elsewhere to great success. In some moments she's at least clearly having a good time. In too many others, however, Berry is overacting with a frenetic, overcharged bluster that's just plain outrageous. Sure, we can chalk this up in part to the way Catwoman is written in the first place, and above all Pitof's direction and the overall slant of the production are a predominant factor. Still, she leans so hard into the dishonest swagger that she becomes a controlling focal point of it - its victim, to some extent, but just as surely its driving force in some measure. Golly, is this regrettable.\n\nHave I mentioned the picture's embrace of forensic pseudoscience, the favored instrument of crime shows on TV and untrustworthy state agents in real life? Have I mentioned the significant practice here of the male gaze at every opportunity - never sexy, only ever sleazy - into which the final look of Strathie's design directly feeds? The root concept of every component part is at least baseline suitable, if not also inventive, clever, and or smart. For lack of mindful care, however, or perspective, there is glaringly, appallingly little about this that actually comes off well. Through to the very end this is too often altogether boorish or obnoxious, and far too little entertaining. What kernels of value it can claim aren't nearly enough to rise above the overwhelming crudeness and bawdiness of what it ultimately represents. It turns out that 2004's 'Catwoman' really is That Bad.\n\nI see what it could have been. That is it not what it is. I'm glad for those who do get more out of this than me or many others. Unless you have a special reason to watch, however, then Pitof's 'Catwoman' is a feature that's best left to that wing of the vaults that no one talks about."

When she almost drowns in a drain, she is mysteriously brought back to life by a cat and Patience is transformed into an wild and untamed woman with cat like abilities. With her newfound transformation Patience becomes Catwoman, a sleek and stealthy creature balancing on the thin line between good and bad.\n\nHalle Berry was terrible in this movie. I was in disbelief that Halle Berry would appear in this rubbish. Catwoman also saw the beginning of the end of Halle Berry's career, particularly after she was riding high from the success of X Men (2000), Swordfish (2001) her landmark Academy Award winning role for best actress in Monster's Ball (2001), and the coveted role as a James Bond girl alongside Pierce Brosnan in Die Another Day (2002). Since the box office failure of Catwoman, Halle Berry's career has never recovered. And Sharon Stone as the lead villain could not even salvage her career with an awful performance. Sharon Stone's glory days are well and truly over and her performances in Total Recall (1990), Basic Instinct (1992) and Casino (1995) seems like a distant memory. I was shocked that screen writing team John Brancato and Michael Ferris were involved in this atrocity. They both certainly have done better work in their career with The Game (1997), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Salvation (2009) and Surrogates (2009). Director Pitof has also disappeared without a trace from Hollywood.\n\nWhen I will think of Catwoman/Selina Kyle I will always think of Michelle Pfeiffer who immortalised Catwoman in Batman Returns (1992). Recently Anne Hathaway turned in an excellent performance with her take on Catwoman/Selina Kyle in The Dark Knight Rises, and for TV audiences Camren Bicondova plays a young Selina Kyle in the 2014 television series Gotham. Rewinding to the Batman TV series (1966-1968) and the movie (1966) , Catwoman was played by Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwether and Eartha Kitt respectively. The 2004 version of Catwoman should be banished forever from existence.\n\nCatwoman is so bad it complements kitty litter. No wonder this deserved the title of being the worst movie of 2004.\n\n1/10."

That's why there's a female arch-villain who is head of the evil skin-care product line.\n\nDid I mention the skin-care factory? Unfortunately for me, I saw this on the plane so aside from opening the emergency release lever, there really was no escape.

Catwoman used to be one of my favorite DC Comics characters because she wasn't a hero, but she wasn't really a villain either. And by the way, the REAL Catwoman NEVER acted like a REAL cat. She may have had cat-like reflexes, but she was still as human as Batman/Bruce Wayne.\n\nThis movie actually lowered my IQ. I dunno why, but I saw it twice, at the time I thought, \"Hey, maybe it'll be better the second time around.\" I was wrong. As for the story, god forbid something in this movie make sense. I believe Carlos Mencia has a phrase for something like this, \"Dee Dee Dee!\"\n\nAll said, I rate this movie a 1, because they won't allow me to rate any lower."

The most unfortunate thing I can think of saying about this film is that it had the misfortune of opening up against bigger blockbuster films like the Bourne Supremacy and I, Robot, while Spiderman 2 was still going strong also. This is a good little action-type movie that should be given a chance. Ignore the critics (I ALWAYS do) and check it out for yourself. Though this film is no comparison to Star Wars in any way shape or form, I read somewhere that critics (as usual) trashed that too. See it and then decide for yourself."

I found it was very well filmed (the camera is excellent, there are many very innovative angles used), the special effects are good (which cannot be said for many much better rated movies), the sound is very good and the acting is more than passable.\n\nYes, the story is simple to the point of being naively stupid, the screenplay and dialog are full of clich\u00e9s, but then again, this is not an adaptation of Ezra Pound, this is a superhero movie, and for that is exactly what it is supposed to be; a well made cartoon!\n\nOh, and on one thing I do agree with Ebert... Halle Berry is gorgeous! It is hard to think of any actress on screen ever that has emanated so much sex-appeal, such sheer beauty.

Catwoman is a failure because they took a good actor(Benjiman Bratt, Alex Borstein, Frances Conroy) and paired them with gorgeous but lukewarm talent like Halle Berry and Sharon Stone. Couple these casting faults with an overuse of CGI tricks, gaudy set design and cutesy music video moments and you have this movie. The plot line put forth by Ms. Conroy's character should have been the focus of the movie instead of putting so emphasis on the damned costume and the overbearing soundtrack and violence. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching Ms. Berry and Ms. Stone having their cat-fight but I think that the audience is smart enough to have had a little \"story\" thrown their way. It's a crying shame that so much money and time was wasted for so little return."

It's like someone stabs me with a needle every time something simply too stupid happens on the screen. A typical blockbuster has a few of these, Catwoman had a years worth. The movie is incredibly stupid. The characters are stupid, the dialogue is incredibly stupid, the action scenes are stupid and the entire scenario of the movie is truly stupid. Stupid.\n\nIn addition, the direction is horrible, Halle throws her worst performance I've seen to date, other actors are awful and the movie has no \"atmosphere\" to speak of, it feels incredibly pretentious and poorly written from start to finish.\n\nAbsolutely dreadful. 1 point for the outfit and the laughs."

Yep, something is rotten in Denmark.\n\nPrince is then found out by the bad guys and left to die, but she not only recovers but also absorbs some mystical cat powers. Now armed with catlike agility and dexterity, she clads herself in a cat-eared cap and CGI whip and goes out to get revenge in her new identity as a cat-burglar anti-hero. Conflicts ensue, she meets romantic interest Bratt, and dukes it out with Sharon Stone.\n\nThis movie is thoroughly and unapologetically dumb. With silly dialog, cardboard acting and some pretty mediocre action sequences, Catwoman is much more corn than comic book. Halle Berry is a talented actress, but in Catwoman she acts likes she's on auto-pilot, and only drags the whole thing down further.\n\nSure, Catwoman was never supposed to be a Casablanca, but even a popcorn movie needs intelligence and fun. Catwoman is just a sprawling mess. If extreme-campiness is up your alley it may be worth a look, but otherwise don't waste the ten dollar box office fee on this turkey."

I don't know anything about the director's background, but my guess is he had his start in music videos. \"Catwoman\" pretty much has the same hyper-kinetic, MTV-style direction that we see in way too many recent movies. Some of the shots are obviously computer-generated, and definitely took me out the movie. Halle Berry gives as good a performance as possible, but there's not much you can do with mediocre material.

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh my god\u0085 First of all let me start with one thing: The Cat Woman is not Afro-American. I see a few people talking about an alternative Afro Cat Woman from the Comics as well as from an old TV series; OK, so, let me explain to you people: Spider Man had six arms, became evil, died, resurrected, was black in an alternative reality, was a woman and so many other ALTERNATIVES, but Spider-Man, the original character from the Amazing Spider-Man comic book is brown haired, blue eyed skinny looking guy, the other versions lasted for ONE comic book only as an alternative deal, that is it period. It does not make him Afro-American in any way, so, don't do a movie about it. The very same thing happens with Cat Woman \u0096 she had alternative stuff, but the original character IS a foxy Blonde Blue Eyed woman. Once the director and casting crew decided to change that, they lost millions of fans including me. It is a stab in the back, a betrayal worthy of trial! Don't mess with the originality of an ancient character, please, don't ever do that again.\n\nNow, lets just say the idea of a Cat Woman movie is cool nonetheless, so I did managed to watch it, I am a fan of her (Cat) after all. After ten minutes of watching, I noticed I had a pain head and realized I was going to regret renting this for my entire life, and when the movie ended I did.\n\nHalle Berry is pretty? Sure, but is she as beautiful as a Blonde Blue Eyed woman? Hell no, and I noticed this movie needed a foxy blonde, it hell needed it a lot and Halle did not manage to replace it, not in a million years. Again, the Cat woman is Blonde Blue Eyed, so, when you change that, you kill the best feature of the movie. Don't listen to the very few people who say the \"blonde\" type is a 2k stereotype, old stuff\u0085 I am sorry but it is not, if the Cat Woman was Blonde I am sure this one would get at least a 6 from me.\n\nEveryone wants to see a foxy Blonde in a costume like that; now you take that away... You simply have nothing interesting, period. OK, so, enough with the blonde deal, lets say you are a fan of Halle Berry, cool; you can see her as the Cat Woman. Don't even dream amigo! Even if you CAN manage to tolerate her presence (Impossible to me ever since she boycotted the X-Men 2 and 3 because she is \"An Oscar Winner... boohoos\"), you still have the worst movie ever made in history of man kind at your television. Why is the worst of all? Because of Halle and Sharon acting as well as everything else.\n\nI find this very disturbing because the director or \"I don't know who else\" actually thought that the mere presence of Halle would be enough to make it look good, and again this proved that I am right about her \"not deserving her Oscar\", because her acting in this movie was the worst in history of man kind. I have never seen anything like IT in my entire life. I am not joking, if you watch this movie, you will notice that Halle makes some strange faces as if she was acting in a blue screen or as if she was staring into the \"void\" the entire movie, looking like a robot or \"retard\" woman. The lack of a decent acting is so disturbing that you will start to feel like watching one of those tapes your own kids do at home. The other reasons are the lack of special effects, good fighting scenes, action, good sound effects and the most important of all: A Story. I don't know what went wrong in there, it is not the low budget \u0096 just check The Punisher, the lowest budget movie ever made and yet it looks so amazing, the actors did a superb job \u0096 So, maybe it was the presence of the short haired Sharon Stone (Someone should tell her, she is looking like a dude) who lacked to fish the blonde lovers like me, or it was the painful acting of them both, or the fact that they changed the ethnicity of one of the coolest female characters of the comic book, leaving us only Elektra and the Wonder Woman as a \"true to the fans\" crossover.\n\nIt is a pity that an Oscar winner like Halle acted so badly, disturbingly I am starting to think she never deserved the statue, as it was not her first bad job, just go and see her on X-Men 3, she had a terrible performance as well \u0096 Maybe she is falling in her career, who knows? For your own sake, don't bother for this one, even if you are a fan; seriously, there is nothing to see there, other than a pain head."

Director of this movie is not the right choice for it. I think that the movie would be much better that some other director like Stephen Sommers or Bryan Singer was directed it. The story is weak and the name of main character is changed to. From Celina Kyle to Patience Philips. Who knows why. Other characters is good enough. The scenes of Catwoman in action was too much animated and faster than the real person could do it. Movie itself is to short than I've expected to be. However, Halle Berry was great playing the Catwoman as she usually is in her other movies. She always tries to give us her best performance. I recommend everybody to watch DVD edition of the movie with all extra material on it. You can see a documentary of all the women's playing the character of Catwoman from the beginning to the end.

I heard it was a box office bomb even though I didn't see it in theaters. This film is mostly likely unforgettable like no matter. The acting is poor in my opinion. My question is why is the Cat Woman costume look like what a 13 year old look at the picture and do you know what? Also it's worse than BatMan and Robin (1997). This film need a lot of improvement."

What is even stranger is that 8 of these positive \"reviewers\" have reviewed only one movie: Catwoman. \"\n\nI would like to say, even though I have never reviewed any movie before and wasn't one of the 8 people this guy is referring. I do get an IMDb account to just to vote for Catwoman in hoping that it won't sink down the bottom 100. This is my first voting on IMDb because I am really lazy to get an account and fill up application form. I just want to read other people's comments.\n\nHowever, I am really irritated that there are so many people who are trashing this film when they have either never watched the film or already form judgments before they went watch the movie. That's why I decided to contribute my first vote and first message to Catwoman.\n\nI personally found the movie to be really entertaining. I went to watch the movie with 4 other friends and all five of us loves it.\n\nThis movie may not to be best movies ever but I found it really really cute and sweet. The last summer movie that I think is as entertaining as this one is PoTC. I really like the chemistry between Halle and Ben. They make such a cute couple together. It also has a lot of humorous scenes. For anyone who is giving this movie a 0 rating, please go watch this film first before you make your judgments."

        "review_detailed_main": "Catwoman has become one of the most despised films of 2004. Critics and fans alike mauled and hissed at it, criticizing everything from Halle Berry's acting to Pitof's direction. It even got 7 Razzie nominations. However after viewing this film on DVD, I was pleasantly surprised. The film has numerous flaws but its not as bad as its made out to be.\n\nHalle Berry plays Patience Phillips, shy artist by day, bank-robbing Catwoman by night. There is a plot, but it quickly takes a backseat to shots of Halle Berry strutting around in a S&M suit. While its not her best performance, Berry convincingly balances the two personalities of her character. Its the supporting cast where the movie begins to fall apart. Sharon Stone is terrible in her role as the villain, she either spits out her lines or overacts the entire picture. The other characters are not developed enough to care.\n\nWhile one good actress can carry a decent movie, Pitof ruins the film with heavy editing and terrible use of CGI. The fight scenes are so choppy that they allow a man to stand in as Halle Berry's stunt double. Other scenes such as Catwoman on the motorcycle look like the camera was tossed in a laundry machine. And while Halle Berry looks gorgeous in the Catwoman costume, she is replaced half the time by a CGI catwoman that seems to be able to defy gravity at will. When the lead actress is the only thing a film has going for it, its best not to replace her with a digital puppet.\n\nOverall, this film is watchable if only to see Halle Berry strut in the Catwoman costume. Other than that, its a turkey. Save your money and buy something else."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember a few years ago I was flying back to LAX, and the in-flight movie was \"Waterworld\" starring Kevin Costner. I had read that it was one of the worst movies ever made, and wondered \"How bad could it really be?\" Well, after the first 10 minutes, it REALLY was that BAD. So I took a nap for while, then proceeded to watch the remainder of movie without the headset on. Amazingly, the movie was now watchable and somewhat entertaining. This anecdote is a long about way of saying that \"Catwoman\" will someday be a great airplane movie sans the audio headset. Yes, this is a glaring indictment of a totally inept movie that wasted 90 minutes of my life. Granted I did see the movie to kill some time. Stupid me. A dear bud, Bobby, pointed this out to me. This vacuum of redeeming quality is completely unexpected given that Halle Berry as Catwoman is one of the most stunningly beautiful women to watch on screen. Benjamin Bratt as her torn romantic interest Detective Tom Lone is a great looking leading man and solid actor. The very hot and steamy Sharon Stone plays her evil best as aging cosmetics baroness, Laurel Hedare. However, all their star power can not overcome the incoherent and incomprehensible storyline. The movie is a mess. Director Pitof has a cutting edge visual style, and provides a cool textured score. Ultimately, this does nothing.\n\nI do like stupid funny movies-- that would be intentionally stupid and funny movies. What I do find most annoying is unintentionally and ineptly stupid movies. This would be \"Catwoman\". It is a bad omen when the opening credits require an explanation later in the movie itself. The transformation of meek and mousy Patience Phillips (Berry) to the fierce Catwoman is plain dumb. Berry looks stunning in the costume, and obviously trained her body rigorously for this role, but this is all for not. Even if \"Catwoman\" had some quality gratuitous nudity, it would not have been able to salvage this train wreck.\n\nDon't see this horrible movie. It is a complete waste of time, even if you are looking to waste some time. Really."

This is by no means a good film, but i can think of many worse ways to spend a couple of hours - as far as bad films go, at least this one is in no way pretentious or boring.\n\nOK so it is stupid (since when do cats know how to do kung fu/basketball /breakdancing/whip wielding/running up walls?) and the fight scenes are nothing but a series of incomprehensible fast cuts (presumably this was cheaper than sending Halle Berry on an intensive Kung Fu training course), but the actors and director do a reasonable job, and the film at least looks expensive.\n\nThe one thing i really don't understand is who came up with the plot in the first place. What superheroes need is a good super villain. And since comic book movies (particularly comic book movies starring Halle Berry in a revealing leather costume) are presumably mainly aimed at a male audience, who on earth thought that a couple of executives at a cosmetics company would make good bad guys? So the concept of the film was flawed from the start, but in my opinion i don't think that justifies the vitriol this film seems to attract.."

The incorporation of the classical views of cats and women is very intelligently done, and the character of Patience is believable and smart.\n\nShe is an amazing super hero/villain. I have always adored the character of Catwoman, especially as the anti industry ecological activist. I like the direction they are taking the character. No longer simply a sexy counterpart of Batman, Catwoman has her own agenda, her own personality.\n\nHalle is a very talented actress who brings to life a very complex character with both respect and innovation. The Catwoman idea is not used simply as a gimmick, it is a very believable and respectable transformation.\n\nI doubted the casting when I first heard the movie was being made but now, I think that anybody but Berry would have been a mistake, she brought both glamor and humility to the role.\n\nSo, go see this movie and enjoy it for what it is. Don't compare it to other comic book movies because the character is not just a comic book character. She has grown beyond the confines of the page and has erupted on the silver screen as a powerhouse of action and sexuality, she is Catwoman hear her roar... and I for one, will be roaring along with her."

As a huge Batman fan myself, this is completely unappealing and an absolute waste of space. Because the thing is there's nothing in this movie where it understands who Catwoman is. She just acts like a cat and does excruciating things. This would come from a director that would normally work as a visual supervisor. And just by watching this movie alone, I can see he's not ready to produce movies. And what proves all this is the stuff he can think of such as an unbearable written story. The action is dull and uninteresting to watch. The villain twist has no sense of surprises. The characters are all unlikable. And Halle Berry has given a really awkward performance. Along with low quality editing that feels out of place, like the CGI cats. Please if you're like me and truly a Batman fan, do not watch this film unless if you want to see what a train wreck in a superhero movie style looks like. Maybe one day we'll actually get a good movie about Catwoman. But this film is the complete opposite and is easily one of the biggest disasters to come out of DC."

Every actor except Halle berry is either under acting or playing the role in an incredibly annoying way and even Halle berry like everyone else has awful writing that makes her character look bad. The cgi is also awful, this movie had the same budget as the second Harry Potter, came out 2 years after it and still the cg looks incredibly rushed and bad. This movie is also meant to be feminist but they do such a bad job at this that it almost feels like a parody, the villain is a woman who plans to use evil makeup to control the world, Catwoman wears her classic leather suit but for some reason she wears nothing but a bra on her chest which not only makes no sense in universe but is also just a hilariously obvious way to pander to horny kids. All that being said I love this movie, the action, acting and story is so over the top and every piece of dialogue sounds so phoned in or just plain stupid that it makes this movie both entertaining and hilarious from beginning to end. Genuinely one of the funniest comedies I've seen and almost none of it is intentional."

Perhaps that's why I was able to enjoy it. I mean, it is a terrible movie, the script is somewhat incoherent, the dialog is ludicrous and the special effects are silly rather than cool. But it is also a movie that is rather amusing, sometimes on purpose, more often by accident, and it moves pretty quickly. It's certainly more entertaining than The Incredible Hulk, which is an example of a bad movie that doesn't even manage to be any fun.\n\nThe general incompetence of almost every aspect of the film can at times bring it close to the level of an Ed Wood movie, but alas the film lacks Wood's pretensions to greatness, and rarely is so bad as to be laugh out loud funny (although it does happen a couple of times). The movie also manages a few legitimate laughs. So all in all, while I wouldn't want to watch it again, I don't regret watching it once.\n\nStill, this must be the worst portrayal of Cat Woman. The most interesting conceptually was probably Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns, even though I didn't think much of the movie, but for me catwoman will always be the fabulous Julie Newmar from the TV series."

        "review_detailed_main": "Often you watch a film and think \"This sucks so hard that I don't know where to start\" but with Cat-woman the errors are glaringly obvious and easy to break down.\n\n1) The score, the first thing that hits you when watching this film is that the score is completely inappropriate. The timing is off, it will kick in while someone is talking and kick in with heavy rock music when a couple is on a date. When someone takes their jacket it off it will sound like the final scene from cliffhanger before a much more uneventful scene. If there was any chance of immersing the viewer in this film, the score was the final straw.\n\n2) The choreography, I'd like to think for Halle Berrys sake that someone else told her to move and walk like that when she is in 'cat-woman' mode. (In my opinion) The way cat-woman walks is not provocative, confident and carefree... it looks silly and ruins any chance of cat-woman being a decent protagonist.\n\n3) This history of cat-woman. I'm not a marvel/batman expert so I don't know much about this but I do know that Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burtons Batman universe... well she rocked as an incredibly dark and mentally disturbed cat-woman. The 'sex in the city' cat-woman created in this film just doesn't paint the same sortof picture at all and anyone over the age of 25 will remember Michelle Pfeiffers cat-woman well. While I'm at it, there are strange undertones to the dialogue when explaining cat-woman in the film, like instead of just making someone that goes a bit crazy and gets bitten by a cat they start trying to make a statement about how a woman behaves without hibitions. All a bit too much for me.\n\n4) The CGI. CGI is heavily used in this film, every single time the cat-woman does something that would seem inhuman they revert to a CGI version of Halle Berry in costume - OK, fair enough. Problem: The CGI isn't high quality enough for the close ups, they zoom right into the face of the fake Halle Berry asif to make it as obvious as possible that you're watching something that isn't real. Six years later they're just about got a believable Jeff Bridges in Tron 3D, why at that time they thought to do this I don't know. The over use of CGI continues with the use of over-zoomed shots and at one point even a CGI ferris wheel. Minutes later they use a real life version of the same ferris wheel, all seems a bit strange to me.\n\n5) The acting. There are some good actors in this film but I found the acting to be unbelievable, there was chemistry between Halle Berry and the detective but little believability to their characters in my opinion.\n\nA lot of films could take one of those 5 points and continue but cat-woman didn't have a chance. I made it an hour into the film but really felt asif every scene was ruined by one of my five points.\n\n4/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I suppose it doesn't take much to get a green light in Hollywood these days. Catwoman wouldn't have been particularly difficult to pitch: Halle Berry crammed into a leather bodysuit, kicks ass, saves world. The End. Oh and she is handy with a whip. And has a bitch fight with Sharon Stone. Did I mention the leather bodysuit? Good - that ought to do it.\n\nI guess some wag in the pre-production meetings may have tentatively ventured some concerns about lack of any plot or characterisation, but he was evidently shouted down and told not to be such a worrywart.\n\nMuch of the criticism levelled at this film is unhelpful and frankly misjudged. If you want to be intellectually stimulated go and watch Kubrick or Truffaut or, better still, read a book. This is a no-brainer, an event movie aimed at the school holiday market with tie-in video game potential. Anyway there is actually a fair bit of mileage in the idea behind Catwoman: The comic book traditionally transfers well onto the silver screen \u0096 Spiderman 2 opened recently to rave reviews, and the Batman franchise from which the character is taken has enjoyed immense critical and commercial success (the dreadful fourth installment Batman and Robin aside). Add to that Berry's considerable Box Office clout and you have what is surely a recipe for success.\n\nUnfortunately though, even the best ideas will flounder if they are not fully thought through. Berry may be a good, nay Oscar-winning actress \u0096 better, certainly, than the catsuit's previous incumbent, Michelle Pfeiffer, and light years ahead of Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar who rubbed up against the Dark Knight in the original sixties Batman TV show \u0096 but she cannot salvage anything from this.\n\nShe plays Patience Philips, a lonely, browbeaten graphic designer at a large cosmetics firm run by slick businessman George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his glamorous wife Laurel (Sharon Stone). After unwittingly stumbling upon a dastardly plot to thrust an anti-ageing product with hideous side effects on an unsuspecting public, Patience is bumped off only to be reanimated by a bunch of mystical moggies. Invigorated with feline zest, she seeks her revenge and falls for hunky cop Tom (Benjamin Bratt) en route. Cue lots of computer animated leaping about and plenty of catty anthropomorphism including Berry scoffing down tuna by the tinful, hissing at dogs and the obligatory milk moustache scene. Interestingly, Patience's alter ego is also surprisingly adept at basketball and kickboxing \u0096 not skills you would traditionally associate with the domestic pussycat.\n\nBerry, as always, looks terrific, but she still falls someway short of Pfieffer's seminal Catwoman. The character in Tim Burton's Batman Returns is part of a wider ensemble. Fewer scenes enable Pfeiffer to cloak her Catwoman in ambiguity and maximise her impact \u0096 most memorably when she backflips effortlessly across a deserted lot, pauses and miaows sardonically as a massive building explodes behind her. It helps that she is directed by Burton, the master of the dark, acerbic fairy tale. Berry can count herself unfortunate that her movie is helmed by the curiously monikered Pitof, a Frenchman who seems to have arrived from nowhere (and, on this evidence, will be scuttling back there before too long).\n\nStill, Pitof has obviously at least watched Batman Returns, for his movie simply lifts Catwoman's plot line out, dumbs it down and sets it to a pumping soundtrack. There is no heart, no ingenuity and there sure as hell isn't any depth. We learn nothing of Patience's past or why she has been selected to be blessed with superpowers. The villains of the piece are ludicrously unimpressive \u0096 you can imagine them being laughed out of the Global Confederation of Comic Book Baddies for sheer lack of imagination: 'So, what fiendish plans for world domination have you come up with? A super virus? Nuclear War, maybe?' \u0096 'Er, no, but we have developed a face cream that will give people a nasty rash\u0085'\n\nWilson is a tired, identikit evil genius, and Sharon Stone is more of a loony Bridgett Neilson clone than an exotic femme fatale. Neither can touch the sinister malevolence of Christopher Walken's Max Shreck or Danny DeVito's Penguin. Their plot is also so pathetic that Catwoman needn't have bothered with a dangerous, elaborate showdown to bring them to justice \u0096 simply reporting them to Watchdog would probably have done the trick.\n\nCatwoman certainly isn't the car crash it could have been. Bratt's cop is pretty bland, but his chemistry with Berry is OK, and the computer animation whilst over the top makes for a slick cartoon landscape that is appropriate for a film like this. And, of course, if you can stomach the dizzying camera angles and stodgy dialogue, the pay-off is Halle Berry clad in leather and wiggling delectably. I would suggest that many red-blooded cinema-goers might well consider that a fair trade.\n\n5/10"

But, ever since Michelle Pfeiffer donned the outfit in Batman Returns, I've fallen in love with the character, Catwoman. When I read about Angelina Jolie starring in the role 2 or 3 years before the movie's opening, I was ecstatic. Then, it switched to Nicole Kidman, and then Halle Berry. I was skeptical about how the movie was going to turn out, because at first the plot sounded dumb, and the outfit didn't impress me. After awhile, though I began to love the costume, and after seeing it on opening night, I've been completely obsessed. I've bought all the merchandise, the DVD (watched about 10 times since I bought it), and I believe it is one of the best movies ever! The plot is stupid, I'll admit, and Sharon's acting was terrible, as well as Lambert Wilson's, but I don't understand everyones hatred of Halle's. She was superb in playing all 3 roles in it, Patience, Patience/Catwoman, and Catwoman herself. The movie lines were campy, but who the hell cares, it is a fun action flick, and shouldn't receive all the hatred its getting. The people picking the razzies should take another look at the other loads of crap we got this year, such as Baby Geniuses 2, and Harold & Kumar (which I still don't understand why they made those pieces of crap). Also, everyone was saying how the CG was terrible, and how great Spiderman was. Take a look at the facts, Spiderman is completely covered from head to toe, of course he is going to look good in CG, as Catwoman is mostly skin-showing. I was also disappointed that it wasn't Selina Kyle, but after seeing the movie, it explains that there isn't just one Catwoman, there are many Catwomen, and I think people don't here that part, so they just keep on complaining about a Selina-less movie. Bottom line, it was a great movie, one of my favorite movie, the favorite actually."

Some scenes are genuinely good and interesting, athough it did have many flaws. Berry hissing at the dogs was very funny (unfortunately), and the director/writer chose not to delve into the duality nature of Catwoman to any degree, which would have made for an excellent story (remember the dance/discussion between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle in the Batman movie?).\n\nLastly, why do people seem to love when villains are constantly \"over the top\", ala Bullseye in Daredevil and Sharon Stone's character in Catwoman? I'm incredibly tired of hearing how great the acting was because the character was \"over the top.\" Well, guess what? That over the top villain is the one that's farthest from real life behavior! They're positively goofy. That's not a plus to me.\n\nOverall, 5/10."

The director is an easy target here, especially because for some reason he likes to call himself \"Pitof\", but really it's not all his fault. The action (the only thing directors with one name care about) is actually filmed rather competently, it's just everything in and around in that makes me cringe. Halle Berry's performance is just miserable. She's a good actress, she's great at emoting, she's great at portraying complex characters, too bad for her this movie doesn't require any of that. This movie requires someone that can make these one-liners sound cool, and that's really not Berry's cup of tea. It all just feels so extremely awkward. It's a bad sign when Sharon Stone's outplaying you. An even bigger thorn in the eye is the screenplay though because seriously, what is this crap? Even if you forget about the plot, these lines are just so incredibly bad. I can't believe they found actual people willing to say them. This movie has little redeeming qualities, and is in fact a total disaster."

        "review_detailed_main": "and that is what you get when you watch Catwoman. Personally, I don't really care that this movie is not based on the original Selina Kyle character, because I never knew much about her anyway. So big deal, though I can understand why fan boys will be upset. so why not something different? Well firstly, let's cut to the chase. Who cares if Catwoman is not white! Halle Berry is a fine actress and deserved a chance to play Catwoman. However, in terms of her performance in this movie, her acting gets a bit sloppy when she is in the catwoman suit. Her character becomes this over the top sexy woman who cracks the whip too many times and who is given a laughable script and plot line to lead this movie.\n\nYes, my main problem with this movie is how silly the plot is. Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips (how they hell they come up with an absurd name such as Patience is anyone's guess) who is a shy, timid woman who works in a company that makes beauty products. When she overhears a secret in a new product called Beau Line and that if you use it, your face will deteriorate unless you keep using it, she is killed, then resurrected by some CGI cat, which is very obviously CGI. Now she has superpowers such as leaping from building to building, walking up walls like a cat and very clear vision.\n\n**********MINOR SPOILER*************** OK, the villain in this movie, Laurel Hadare (Sharon Stone). I don't have a problem with Sharon Stone, but for one thing, she doesn't really have a superpower that can match Catwoman's abilities. Her ridiculous strength is having a face like stone because she has used that beau line product for years. Hence she can't feel pain. Ha ha ha ha ha. When she says the line in the movie in the climatic fight 'skin like living marble...and you can't feel a thing!' it is just plain ridiculous. And Catwoman is knocking the crap out of her and hitting not just her face but her legs and everything. I mean did Laurel apply the cream on her whole body as well? How come she can't feel pain in those other areas? It is really that absurd.\n\nThe editing in this movie is overdone. One of Catwoman's fight scenes with a guy outside a night club has probably over 40 images edited together so you can't follow the action properly. What's more, the action scenes are totally devoid of suspense or good choreography that it feels more like they made it up on the spot.\n\nThe soundtrack of the film is alright. I did like how they used the music but at other times the film feels more like a music video sometimes. The best scene is where Catwoman is walking and the camera slowly reveals her in her costume to the song 'whose in Control?' Benjamin Bratt who plays the cop and love interest seems a bit wooden and flat, and there doesn't seem to be a spark between him and Halle. I think they could have picked someone a bit better.\n\nThe character development of Catwoman is also not done very well because Patience seems to accept her being Catwoman very quickly before really coming to turns with her new identity. At times, it almost feels like she has a personality disorder and can't control who she is.\n\nSo this movie does have some fun moments and you really have to turn your brain off to enjoy this movie, otherwise you will just see how stupid the plot, script and in particular some of the lines given from Halle Berry are. It should have been a really more in depth movie.\n\nWhat we know is that Patience is not the only Catwoman out there. She is in a line of previous women who were once catwomen, thus if a sequel had been made, she could possibly have met up with one of the other catwomen and teamed up or something. But that is never going to happen since they didn't do a good job with this one. Oh well, nice try guys.\n\nThis isn't the worst movie ever, there are so much worse. I think this was harshly criticised but it makes sense when you think about it. If you're going to take a character well known such as Catwoman on a $100 million budget and not do much with it that is unique or groundbreaking, then why bother? Halle Berry really should have thought about this before she took on the role. And she does try her best, but since she is trying to be both good and bad in terms of the nature of her character, we don't really see the bad side.\n\nTo the writers - for your next movie, please please do not make it about face cream whatever you do!"

I do understand the hype about worst movies, because I think these awards are more or less for \"the most disappointing pictures\" rather than the worst.\n\nSo why is Catwoman not the worst movie of all times? The story is somehow acceptable, the characters are pretty flat, no real psychological depth to see. But on the other hand, some Batman movies for instance suffer from the same symptoms.\n\nSo what's really disappointing here is Halle Berry playing the main character. But on the other hand, I guess its a good thing, she accepted the worst actress award here. She certainly improved, got an Oscar, and so she might have learned something here. Sharon Stone on the other hand didn't do much better here and it's a pretty bad piece of job, she did here.\n\nThe story is boring, but I must say my biggest disappointment was to see a movie, which wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. Except for the effects, that were unacceptable all the time."

        "review_detailed_main": "The infamous reviews from this particular title are more well known than the movie itself, as 'Catwoman' truly crashed and burned at it's release in 2004, both critically and commercially. However, I respect that it wasn't exactly a picture if marvel, but was it really that horrific?      Personally, I really do not think it was, and I believe that many who claim to hate this title, merely just jumped on the bandwagon in a hope of looking intelligent. I really do realise that it isn't exactly good, and many aspects would drastically need to be altered, such as the following:      Firstly, as a huge comic and more specifically Batman fan, Warner Bros did have to realise that by creating a comic book adaptation, their main target audience and more importantly domestically paying audience, would be  (wait for it) the comic book fans. For example, people will pay to see Selina Kyle, in a Gotham city based escapade. But we got Patience Phillips in some hi-tech LA or something or other. That's not what the audience wants to see, it sparks the question, who are they aiming this at?      As well as this, the storyline was a bit weak; killer beauty creme? Not exactly the works of a great mastermind, let's be serious. The plot was all over the place and a bit weird, making it hard to link onto one part of the story.      And lastly, the acting. Halle Berry sparked as the cat, but simmered as the girl. Her performance was absolutely cringy in some places, but she still did have her moments.      Okay, rant over. Now to shed some praise on the poor thing.      The effects were great, and the action sequences were fun and exciting. I do think that, that was nicely done indeed, especially with the cat like movements of Halle Berry jumping around, and the camera angles were impressive too. I also think that the sticky RandB music created a svelte mood whenever Catwoman walked onto screen, and it really helped spice up the on screen action too.     So, overall, we have a movie far from perfect, but also far from terrible, which is why I've given it a 5, because it really is slap bang in the middle. It's nothing special, but it's not disastrous."

        "review_detailed_main": "This Batman spin-off, as I'm sure you know, has been very poorly received in general. I missed its theatrical run back in 2004, but that's certainly NOT something I regret! I never even knew of the film's existence until sometime later. Now that I've seen it, unlike many others, I certainly don't hate it with a passion, so I can't join the many who have voted 1/10 for it. However, it's definitely a disgrace compared to several other comic book movies of the decade, and I can still pretty much understand all the hate.\n\nPatience Phillips is a shy woman, constantly down on herself, who works for Hedare Beauty as a graphic designer. One night, she happens to overhear a conversation, and learns the truth about the company's new anti-aging product, how it will have dire results if one stops using it! When they realize that she has found out their evil secret, they chase after her and try to kill her! Eventually, they succeed, but Patience is brought back to life by a cat! After this, however, her life is a lot different! The cat has given her new superpowers, and now she is not a hero, not a villain, but somewhere in between! She is now Catwoman, and she plans to find out who is responsible for her death so she can get her vengeance! Soon, she ends up causing a lot of trouble in the city, and may pay the price for it!\n\nI never expect the scripts of these comic book movies to be absolutely flawless, but do expect them to be at least half-decent, and the script for \"Catwoman\" isn't even that. It's a very juvenile one! Halle Berry certainly can act, but she puts on a poor performance in her starring role here, obviously because she didn't have a good script to work with. Her character does some pretty ridiculous things after being rescued, such as drawing a silly picture of her boss and eating cans of cat food. Clearly, Berry realizes how bad she is in this film, and how bad this film is, as she appeared to accept her Razzie \"Award\" for Worst Actress! The film is also rather poorly directed, with some rather cheesy action sequences, though you could probably find worse action sequences in \"Power Rangers\". Certain scenes in \"Catwoman\" may be so bad that they're almost amusing, but not quite.\n\nI'm sure pretty much everything I've said about this movie has been said before, but I really don't know what else there is to be said. Now, much worse excuses for movies have seen the light of day, and I may not agree 100% with the extremely low rating for this one, but since it is pretty bad overall, I can't complain too much about that rating. Changing Catwoman's name from Selina Kyle to Patience Phillips is not a big deal, but all the flaws that I've pointed out are. Unless you're really curious, there's probably no point in seeing this film, but even if you are curious, you might regret it! If you want a good comic book movie, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere. Fortunately, one good thing I can say is kudos to Halle Berry for taking her Razzie and giving a funny acceptance speech! I guess she has a good sense of humour."

I had my test yesterday, while watching the flick our very own feline Sarah, came down the stairs just when \"Moonlight\" started moaning. So the animal went straight to the sofa, sat in front of the screen and continued following the film with some great interest (which is remarkable indeed as she just tends to fall asleep during films). And every appearance of Moonlight made her twist the ears. In short: this movie can't be that boring, at least not for cats. ;)\n\nHuman remark: As pet owner I know cats can move fast - but not like Daredevil so it was a bit \"unnatural\" watching Halle move faster than the eye can see.\n\nSmallest of *** spoilers ***: I personally liked this film not having a happy twosome end...\n\nSo 5 out of 10 (incl. 3 from the cat)"

But, if the people would actually read about it before they criticized it, it would be a better understanding. In the old Batman show, the Catwoman played by Eartha Kitt had a granddaughter named Patience Phillips, who lived in Lake city. See?? but I thought it was good. Although there was too much animation opposed to real life, me and all my friends thought it was good. Her costume was real good, because it wasn't copying any other Catwoman of the past, and she looked good in it too. I say go suck a lemon to whoever said it was bad. I thought Halle was a purr-fect Catwoman."

I have been told that before and I am aware of that. That doesn't mean I do not give movies bad scores. And it also does not mean many will agree with me along the way.\n\nWhich is something that is true about this mess here. And when I say mess - even when Halle Berry is a mess, she is still a hundred times better than others at their best! Fact - you can't deny that (at least not in a way that I would accept it ;) ). Having said that, there is also Benjamin Bratt here - so almost everyone is covered when it comes to eye candy in the movie. Although you can add Sharon Stone and Kim Smith to those who are into females I reckon.\n\nHalle still was able to have a career after that and most did more or less. Kim Smith though - well she wasn't so lucky. Though it is tough to judge or to know if she even was up to the task (acting wise, because she had the looks down for sure). Why am I focusing on the acting? Because a lot has been said about that - and yes it is a bit campy to say the least. But it is the feel they (hopefully) went for anyway.\n\nThe story is comprehensible, but there are a lot of bad puns along the way and I understand if people are not patient enough. Especially considering the quality the (comic book) movies have nowadays. Not just Marvel - but even DC (I reckon most Snyderverse fans will see it that way).\n\nMost probably will still have Michelle Pfeifer as their favorite Catwoman - on the other hand Zoe Kravitz might just have gone and stole that \"crown\" (jewel), especially from younger viewers. Story wise there is not much to tell - and while Hally may look ridiculous in certain scenes (I don't mean the aged CGI mind you), she is still making more sense as a cat lady (no pun intended), than anything that was shown in the movie Cats a few years ago ... just saying."

But, to be honest, I really don't think it's worth my time. What I will say unequivocally is this: The script is 6th grade level at best. The story-line is amateur-hour. The special effects, action scenes, and fight choreography are a joke...totally boring, fake, and generic. The final nail in the coffin? The acting is embarrassing. I've never been a huge fan of Halle Barry, but this movie proves to me that she is far, far over-rated. She is a decent, even above average actress given the right vehicle for her talents...but her abilities are not in an elite class where she is able to make an otherwise boring or bad movie watchable. Some actors have that kind of screen presence where they can make trash seem somewhat interesting. She does not. The director should never get another job in Hollywood. This movie came off like some kind of masturbatory fantasy, like a 1.5 hr long music video gone wrong. Spend your time doing something, anything else. Mow the lawn with scissors. Turn the heat up and re-do the drywall in your house. Shove bamboo under your finger-nails. Just don't see this movie. Don't give the misguided producers and talentless hack of a director some kind of false reward for this garbage. We want comic book adaptations that are worthy of their franchise and our hard-earned dollars. This steaming pile of dung is neither. Avoid at all costs."

The acting is what can be expected by a laughable Academy Award winner, and the writing seems like it was generated by a computer which was fed every Schwarzenegger 1 liner and simply rewrote them. What really makes this movie lame is the expectation that the public (American especially) will be impressed by a CGI superhero leaping about. We _were_ impressed by this when it was done well and they called the movie Spider-Man. The CG effects are not done well, they look overly cartoony and are used far too much; for example whenever there is a fly-by shot of the city a model would have looked a lot better. All in all, there is nothing about this movie worth watching if you are a film fan.. unless of course you are a red-blooded American male, then at least there is Halle Berry ;)"

The character's names (Patience Phillips, Tom Lone) are even goofier. The over-the-top cat-costume makes Halle Berry look like a mouse. Worse still, the movie has nothing to do with the comic book character. However, it happily rips off much better works (such as the first two Batman films and The Crow). A scene in which Halle chomps down sushi pretty much says it all. Unsurprisingly, Ebert has given it one star and the film won't make more more than $13 mil this weekend.

It feels the plot is too smooth the problem that what berry's role should have to be. Actually, this film just have some easy intricts. But, i think on the whole this film just enough entertained me. Still hilarious looking the sweet and beautiful Berry's face. Maybe Pitof should have choose more charismatic cast for catwoman's boyfriend. He is just little under par in handsomeness.\n\nThe main problem is Halle Berry who get this part.

Here she is turned into Catwoman and has real cat-like behavior (see the movie and try to give the graphics a break). I believe that no movie actually rates a 1 or a 10. Voting a movie up or down to change its rating is misleading, which is the worst thing you can have on rating list site. That being said, it is NOT a 1 and it is NOT a 10! Stop it y'all! The good points I've gone over. Now the bad news. Weak story, simplistic dialogue and uneven CGI ruin the great premise that I liked. It is a 4 or a 5. But, I would watch it again. Another reviewer suggested that it might become a cult classic because its so bad. I think so too. There is something about Halle Berry's movements as Catwoman, both live and CGI that truly seem inhuman, and border on hilarious."

I know comic book movies are rarely like the comic books they're based on but they're at least a little similar but this was.... I was just confused through out the movie, nothing made sense. The villain was an old model for killer face cream? They could have done better than that. The only reason I would even consider watching it again was to see if I could finally understand. I mean the end of one scene had her weird friend passing out on the sidewalk and the next thing you know she's sitting in a wheelchair at the hospital talking a mile a minute like nothing ever happened....

Well, because I only vaguely remembered the movie, well honestly, I remembered Halle Berry as the Catwoman character, and that was about it.\n\nThe storyline in \"Catwoman\", as written by Theresa Rebeck, John Brancato, Michael Ferris and John Rogers, is sort of a mixed bags of nuts. If you sit down to watch \"Catwoman\" with the notion of it being a DC movie with the Selina Kyle character and watching a movie tied in with the \"Batman\" universe, then you will be sorely disappointed. Because that just simply isn't what director Pitof delivered with this 2004 movie. If you, however, sit down to watch \"Catwoman\" with the notion of it being a somewhat cringeworthy movie based very loosely on the DC character of the same name, then you might actually find a shred of enjoyment in this movie.\n\nI have to admit that I had expected it to be a DC-based movie, so I found the movie somewhat of a swing and a miss. But if you step back and look at it objectively, and forget all about DC and Selina Kyle, then \"Catwoman\" is a decent enough movie. Sure, it had flaws and such, but it does make for some cheesy enough entertainment.\n\nPersonally I didn't care much for the costume that they opted to strut Halle Berry around in here. The costume was way too revealing and made very little sense for someone to wear, especially for someone on the edge of the law, as in doing robberies, fighting criminals and such. Sure, I can see that there is some appeal to a certain demographic audience by having Halle Berry running around scantily clad, but it just was too tacky.\n\nThe acting performances in the movie were fair enough. I know that the acting performances have been disliked broadly. But I actually found them to be adequate enough when you take into consideration the shortcomings of an improperly written script and storyline. The movie has some good talents on the cast list actually, with the likes of Halle Berry, Sharon Stone, Benjamin Bratt, Lambert Wilson, Frances Conroy and Byron Mann.\n\nVisually, then I found \"Catwoman\" a bit too gritty and dark, and the underlaying references to matters of an adult content was just growing tired really quickly. Again, not the best of choices for the movie. The special effects in the movie were okay, not great though, but passable enough to make the movie watchable.\n\nWhile the 2004 movie \"Catwoman\" is not a particular great cinematic gem, then it actually makes for an adequate enough, although somewhat corny and cheesy, viewing pleasure. I have, after all, seen the movie twice now since 2004.\n\nMy rating of \"Catwoman\" lands on a bland five out of ten stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Catwoman is about a shy and timid woman named Patience Phillips who, after discovering something horrible about a product called \"Beau-line\", is killed by their henchman before she can make her escape. From there, a magical cat named Midnight breathes onto her dead face and is brought back to life, with a few feline characteristics. After her resurrection, she makes a decision to repay those who killed her and along the way, she will stop the contamination of beauty products by Beau-line. By the way, I liked Catwoman's outfit, minus the mask, shoes and gloves.\n\nSo much for the plot. To be honest, it was not anything more outrageous than plots for Spider-Man, Batman, etc., but it seemed to be a hybrid of a super hero movie and a chick flick. While the movie did have some interesting aspects to it, such as nice camera views and a few scenes with the whip, the CGI was pretty bad and that interfered with the movie for me. I thought the special effects were on par or worse than Hulk's (I liked Hulk better). But I did like Catwoman's suit.\n\nI thought the whole cat thing was WAY too forced. Purring loudly, hissing at dogs and the whole catty attitude. I thought the scenes where she was performing various balance acts in her apartment while discovering her new abilities were more than enough to get the point that she was cat-like.\n\nOverall, the movie was pretty bad for what it was. Comparing it to Spider-Man, Punisher, X-Men and the like makes it look far worse than it is. I'd say this movie is pretty much middle of the road, around a 5.5 - 6.5 of 10. It was better than the old Spider-Man movies from the 70's. If you want to see some real trash that deserves a 1 rating or lower, see Savage Roses or Plump Fiction. Did I mention I like the outfit?"

No. Was it worth the money to rent it? Sure, but I didn't pay for the rental.\n\nCatwoman is about a girl who dies, but a few cats bring her back to life and she becomes a... bad/good girl? That's the thing about the movie that didn't work for me. Catwoman would beat the crap out of someone and steal jewelry, then she returns the jewelry with a sorry bag and feels bad for the guy that she killed. They should've written Catwoman as a villain, like we all learned to love her as in Batman. I love cats, but they made cats out of CGI and it looked sorta fake. Lots of the movie was CGI, but that's okay. But they overused it, in my opinion.\n\nIf you've got an hour and thirty-eight minutes to waste, and a few dollars, rent the movie? But don't buy it. It's not as bad as many people say it is, however."

        "review_detailed_main": "For not using the source material (Catwoman from the Batman universe), though Bob Kane is acknowledged for creating the character (old Bob is rolling over in his grave s I write this), Warner Brothers is smart. Now if they choose to introduce Catwoman in the newly revamped Batman franchise they can without this wretched piece of film coming back to bite them in the bum.\n\nForgive me, I need to vent this and get it out somewhere since I have been expressly forbidden to write a review on my own website (cross promotional industry deal with a couple partners... I can't believe we're supporting this train wreck of a film!) The movie started off with some interesting tidbits about ancient Egyptian beliefs about cats and the goddess Bast, that was the best part of the movie and it was inserted under the opening credits. Not caring much for Halle Berry to begin with, the first quarter of this movie is her bumbling about, over acting and trying differentiate the character from her future Catwoman persona. It's definitely like watching a car accident first hand... in slow motion.\n\nBeyond the horrible acting by everyone there's the bad direction. Pitof is allegedly a decent director but in this movie his choppy and stylized direction is like watching an 80's music video while wired on high doses of caffeine. There is very little redeeming quality in this movie save for a few witty lines and decent scenes. Definitely not worth the admission price (thank all that is holy that I got in for free) and I'm not even sure I'd recommend it for a rental. Nope. I think not. Wait for it to show up on basic cable in a couple years if you're awake late at night and feel like wasting 2 hours of your life."

        "review_title": "It's not as bad as all that",
        "review_detailed_main": "Not only is Catwoman not a disaster, it's not even the worst superhero film of the year. Not that Catwoman is particularly great, but it's not as bad as everyone is saying, and in fact, it's fairly average. That's not an accomplishment, but for a film that should have by all rights been a disaster, it's a bit of a surprise.\n\nHalle Berry, of course, stars as Patience Phillips, whose introduction and storyline largely follows the territory Tim Burton laid down over a decade ago with his take on the character; Patience is a shlep who is under-confident and under-appreciated (as if someone looking like Halle Berry could turn out that way) and whose best friend Sally (Alex Borstein) always has to push her into everything. Together they work for Hedare cosmetics, run by George Hedare (Lambert Wilson, the guy who played the Merovingian in the bad Matrix films) and his bitch of a wife, Laurel (Sharon Stone). Much like in Burton's version, Patience finds out something she's not supposed to and takes an unfortunate spill that ends her life. Of course she's brought back to life by some sort of cat-magic (it's explained in the movie) and becomes the feral, ferocious Catwoman.\n\nThough it's a bit of a stretch to see Berry playing a frump, I have to congratulate whoever did her hair and makeup, because her varying looks fit the character's state of mind perfectly, and she seems just at home playing wimpy Patience as she does over-the-top Catwoman. Stone to me is the single most piece of ironic casting in ages; she plays a model who's being pushed aside due to her age and is desperate not to be put out to pasture. You'll also find some genre faces in some bit roles \u0096 Peter Wingfield miscast and strapped with an American accent as a scientist, and the Asian guy from Earth: Final Conflict as one of Stone's stooges. And of course, there's leading man Ben Bratt, playing Detective Tom Lone, who at least has the good manners to be interested in Prentice before she dons her dominatrix gear.\n\nBorstein and Berry get on well, and there is some real chemistry between Berry and Bratt, a warmth there that makes their flirtation believable. Catwoman swipes a scene from Daredevil, when Patience and Tom play hoops; it reminds you of the Matt/Elektra sparring scene at the playground, but this one's more fun and displays a lot more chemistry. In fact, the movie is pretty enjoyable right up until they decide that Berry has to dress like a stripper and act like a whore \u0096 and there Catwoman goes right out the window. No matter how you try to play the character (and Berry tosses subtlety aside in a flash), the Catwoman outfit is so outrageously stupid that it is simply impossible to take seriously. That Berry chooses a few times to try to channel Eartha Kitt \u0096 possibly the worst choice for a screen Catwoman ever \u0096 doesn't help things (any acting choice made to emulate any performance on the old Batman TV show is just a bad idea in general). The outfit single-handedly kills the film, though admittedly the crazy CGI stunts don't help much. The action is also wildly over the top, with Catwoman hopping around the place with greater speed and agility than Spiderman.\n\nActually it's a shame, because those involved went to a great deal of trouble to draft a cogent mythology for the character, even down to the silly mask she wears, and they spent a fair amount of time trying to establish the bipolarity of Catwoman (a trait I've never cared for, but it is often a part of the character). The attempt at post-modern feminism is absurd, but a fair amount of work was put into this film in an attempt to establish a mythology (and probably a franchise). I was even impressed by the cosmetics company design work, because it was so terribly close to what real ones are like (and it was frustrating to think they had done so much with production design and dropped the ball on the most important costume in the entire movie).\n\nMost of the acting is okay. Borstein always seems like she's having a good time, and Bratt plays a slightly warmer version of his Law and Order character. But he's a very likable guy, and you can see why Patience (or any woman) would be drawn to him. Stone overdoes it a little, but really, when has she not? The irony of casting her as a former model who has turned to stone (almost literally) to me far outweighs any problems with her performance, which are minor in any case. Berry herself overdoes the Catwoman vamp, and I wish she hadn't, because this might have actually been a wholly enjoyable film if she had reigned it in a little.\n\nCatwoman is not a terrible film, though it misses its audience by a mile; it was obviously aimed at young women, but with that Striperella outfit, it's going to attract more men than gals. Actually I preferred it to the much more popular Spiderman 2; while this lacks a performance anywhere near Alfred Molina's Doc Ock, at least here the romance works, and much like Spiderman 2, a lot of the plot hinges on being able to buy into that. You can see some heat with Berry and Bratt; Dunst and Maguire sometimes seem like they filmed separately and were paired only in editing. Catwoman's probably going to be forgotten (or on deep discount on DVD by the end of the year), which is maybe not a fate wholly undeserved, but I've seen many worse films this summer. I can't really recommend this, but I can't tell you to stay away, either. All I can tell you is that it's being unfairly maligned by a viewing public who championed two films of monumental mediocrity masquerading as fun to the tune of almost a billion dollars this summer; you do the math."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Catwoman\" is a 2004 superhero film directed by Pitof and starring Halle Berry in the titular role. Despite featuring a beloved character from the DC Comics universe, the film received largely negative reviews from both critics and audiences alike.\n\nThe story follows Patience Phillips (played by Halle Berry), a shy and insecure graphic designer who works for a cosmetics company. After uncovering a dark secret about the company's newest product, Patience is murdered by her employer. However, she is mysteriously revived by an ancient Egyptian cat, granting her enhanced agility, strength, and feline instincts.\n\nEmbracing her newfound powers, Patience adopts the persona of Catwoman and sets out to seek revenge on those who wronged her. Along the way, she encounters a charismatic detective named Tom Lone (played by Benjamin Bratt), with whom she develops a romantic connection. However, as Patience delves deeper into her dual identity, she must confront the true nature of her abilities and the forces that seek to control her.\n\nDespite its intriguing premise and the star power of Halle Berry, \"Catwoman\" failed to deliver a compelling narrative or engaging characters. The film's over-the-top action sequences and lackluster special effects were widely criticized, as were its inconsistent tone and disjointed plot.\n\nAdditionally, the film's departure from the established lore of the Catwoman character, as well as its failure to capture the essence of the comic book icon, disappointed fans of the source material. Halle Berry's performance received mixed reviews, with some praising her dedication to the role while others found her portrayal lacking depth and nuance.\n\nOverall, \"Catwoman\" is often regarded as a missed opportunity to explore the complexities of one of DC Comics' most intriguing characters. Despite its flaws, the film remains a curiosity for fans of superhero cinema, offering a unique take on the iconic Catwoman character that ultimately fell short of expectations."

What was Pitof thinking? the movie was so trashy that it looked like it was shot in a junkyard. Producer Denise Di Novi was in on this god forsaken pile of trash, and she was in on Batman Returns, which was very successful. I thought she would make Catwoman successful. What would really make Catwoman successful would be Michelle Pfieffer, Michael Keaton, Tim Burton, and of Danny Elfman.\n\nPitof did not know what he was doing. Has this guy ever read a Batman or Catwoman comic book? Catwoman has always been about Batman, Not Benjamin Pratt. Batman and Catwoman are the real couple, like Superman and Lois Lane. Catwoman's real name IS Selena Kyle, NOT Patience Phillips. Catwoman lives in Gotham City, NOT Chicago, or New York, or even Canada! Catwoman is supposed to wear a sexy tight vinyl jumpsuit, not torn baggy leather pants, a leather bra, and open toed heels. That would be very uncomfortable to run and jump with without boots.\n\nI remember going out to see Catwoman with my girlfriend at the time. We did hear a lot of backlash before the movie was released. We went in to show support for DC Comics, especially since we both loved Batman and Catwoman. We hoped Catwoman would beat Spider-man 2 at the box office. But when the lights went on after Catwoamn, people got up and had a bad reaction like if they got mugged or punched in the stomach. I turned to my girlfriend and she did not say a word. But when I saw people coming out of Spider-man 2, I just wanted to scream and beat Spidey fans to death. If I wanted to be insulted, I would rather watch Schumacher's bright gay vision of Batman than to watch Catwoman ever again."

Why keep the Catwoman name if you aren't going to use any of the character's established history. At least then you wouldn't have had comics fans crying foul...\n\nThere appeared to be a few good nuggets in this film, but the bad choices, in my opinion, far outweighed the interesting ones. That costume, I mean, come on! If I was leaping around rooftops and doing all that gymnastic stuff I think I would prefer to have some more protection around my back and belly, and that stupid head mask made me wonder if she was hiding some kind of brain swelling in there.\n\nAround the time the first photos of Halle in the skimpy costume came out, I recall reading it described as a costume fit for the porn version of Catwoman, very apt as far as I'm concerned.\n\nAnd the bad kept coming, all those cheesy one-liners that would have been more at home in the sixties show than coming out of Halle's mouth, the plot was wafer thin and predictable, the fight scenes, which in a superhero movie should be one of the high points, were cut so fast that it was hard to tell what was happening often, or else the wire work and CGI were too obvious.\n\nI rented this movie out of curiosity, to see if it really was that bad, and, well, it was... However some of the extra features on the DVD are interesting, especially the feature which has interviews with almost all of the people ever to portray Catwoman, and also many of the writers from the comics, all presented by Eartha Kitt, camping-it-up in a good way, unlike this lacklustre film."

It's a lot better then Daredevil & Hulk for a start, the CGI may look ropey but it's just as bad in Spider-man 2 and you should really expect it by now.\n\nHalle Berry was watchable, I wanted to say she was awful especially since she ruined the last Bond movie but compared to the wooden performance of Uma Thurman in the highly regarded Kill Bill, they should give her another oscar!"

Dog Lovers, I think you'll like this movie as well. Halle is one sexy kitten and brings a fresh feel to the character of Catwoman. She does seem to borrow certain mannerisms from past actors who played Catwoman, but she also shows that she was up to the challenge and comes across with a solid performance. The camera work was a bit over done and most of the time you could tell of the computer generated images of Catwoman doing her cat like moves. Even certain fight scenes seemed a bit awkward at times. Sharon's Stone's performance could have been better, but she was playing a vengeful, ex-model, who was being tossed aside for a younger beauty. How deep can you go when your playing a shallow character to begin with?"

        "review_detailed_main": "(sigh) For every American superhero film we have today there are about two lying in the superhero film graveyard. The Mandrake the Magician movie that was supposed to follow The Phantom, the Wachowschi's Plastic Man movie, The Justice League movie that ran out of money, hundreds of dozens of movies that could have been great but died during production and were buried in the superhero film cemetery. But this film\u0085Whatever crime this movie commits is made worse by the fact that at one point in its life it could have been one of the best superhero films of all time. Let me explain. If you've ever had the misfortune to watch Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns' you will notice that the movie ends with a shot of Catwoman looking up at the Gotham sky even though we the audience earlier assumed her dead. This was because Burton and the studio were planning a spin-off film for the character. Now if you've seen 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' one of the main problems with them is that Burton isn't interested in Batman and makes him take a backseat while he gives centre stage to his rogues gallery who are just the sort of freaks Burton is comfortable with. A movie devoted to one of those freaks would have had a lot of the good points of the Burton batman films but with the strength of being more focused. On top of that the best aspects of 'Batman Returns' were the Catwoman stuff so there was a lot of potential. Unfortunately 'Batman Returns' didn't make its money back and got Burton replaced with Joel Schumacher. Now if this had been the end of the story for the Catwoman movie it would have been fine, tragic but fine. But for some ungodly reason Warner brothers refused to let this film die and kicked it around development hell for years until they finally gave it to some no name director so the studio could spit out something to compete the marvel dominated Superhero scene. And so we got this unholy zombie of a movie that is a textbook example of how not just to write a bad female superhero movie but a bad movie with a female lead. Now before we get to the big problem with this movie I want to address the little ones. Firstly the production design is blandy bland bland, nothing interesting, nothing to right home about, just bland. This unappealing look is made worse by frequent use of really bad CGI. This movie has competent actors but none of them are interested in making a good movie so the performances aren't bad, bad can be fun, they're just weak. The plot is weak, the action is almost competent except the editing and CGI conspire to ruin it. The soundtrack is bad generic female black pop music (think discount versions of Beyonce or Brandy) that is obnoxious to listen to. Now if these were all the problems this would just be direct-to-video bad, nothing to compete with Hulk or Elektra just bad. There is one aspect of the movie that manages to single handedly make this one of the worst superhero movies of all time. The horribly misguided feminism. Dear lord this movie's treatment of women is awful! It tries to be all empowering and yet ever single female character in this movie is defined by her relationship to men. Worst still this movie has all the clich\u00e9s you find in bad chick flicks; questionable morals, idiot characters, gay friend because men and women can't just be friends, an awkward bumbling lead, a dumb leading man. And then on top of that add all the clich\u00e9s of a bad female superhero movie; objectification of women, sexist male villains, older women villains, girl power motifs and a costume designed more to excite juvenile viewers then it is to actually serve any function in combat. In summary this movie is decent idea filtered through the very worst clich\u00e9s that cinema has to offer. This isn't even fun in a bad way it's just bad. Avoid at all cost."

My expectations were low as I already knew of the bad publicity this film received during its release. Not all is bad here still there is plenty of room for improvement. I don't think the material is overly great for the actors to work with at the time yet it's probably more relevant nowadays in comparison. Many women do in fact have cosmetic surgical adjustment more than ever in todays times highlighting their insecurities and removing age lines. The point story is very one dimensional though coming off more like a romantic comedy than a fully devoted comic book adaption. Halle Berry isn't to blame for what i see as a poor depiction of Catwoman; the character development is poor here. There isn't a whole lot of obstacles for our main protagonist to have a reason for being Catwoman she just more or less stumbles upon it! By chance she comes across information she shouldn't have and bingo, through no fault of her own she is in danger. I don't think any of the actors were bad however with the material they were working with it is really hard to sell this concept. It appeared to be a movie that didn't know quite what it was. Do we go dark? Should she have a love interest? Or shall we go full on chick flick with this? Nobody seemed to fully invest into one idea so it became a movie that just didn't seem to work. Even the antagonists weren't fully rounded or developed characters."

In my opinion she didn't even work as a piece of eye candy, that suit was just ugly. As for the rest Benjamin Bratt was wooden and Sharon Stone, just plain horrible.\n\nFinally the director Pitof (riight) did nothing to even remotely excite.

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, it's true. I sat down to watch this movie with the enthusiasm I usually reserve for MST3K films, expecting nothing but the worst movie of the century. You can imagine how disappointed I was then, when the film actually turned out to be quite entertaining.\n\nNow, before you gasp in horror and wonder whether I've lost my scornful touch, I have to say the movie was far from perfect. But, compared to what I had been expecting, it was little short of amazing.\n\nOK, so the story is silly, but is the idea that a woman who dies and is revived by a mystical cat any less ridiculous than someone being bitten by a spider and developing super-powers? I think not. The plot is simple, which actually serves to help the story, rather than hinder it, since you don't waste time wondering what the hell is going on. And Halle Berry is likeable enough in the main role that you can believe in her as the titular character. The action is fairly well done (see below for further thought on it) and keeps things moving along at a brisk pace.\n\nNow the bad things.\n\nFirstly, and once again I have to bitch about this because it is becoming a festering epidemic in Hollywood that must be stamped out! Stamp it out I say! - the CGI effects. They suck, quite frankly. At no point in the movie are you ever in any doubt whatsoever which Catwoman is a real person and which is CGI. It's doubly irksome here because, in addition to being glaringly obvious, the CGI animators still haven't got to grip with basic physics concepts like mass and momentum. Catwoman (whom we can assume weighs at least 120lbs or so) leaps about more like a demented flea than a cat and lands from great heights without even the slightest noise. Anyone who's ever owned a cat should be able to attest to the fact that they're anything but silent when running and jumping around. In fact the based on the CGI alone it would probably be better to rename the movie Monkeywoman.\n\nSecondly, the action scene editing is just awful. I don't know who had the bright idea that, if you cut and chop scenes endlessly during an action set-piece it would make things look faster and more agile, but it don't work buddy! In several sequences - the basketball scene, the motorcycle ride and the \"playing\" with the cop above the theatre stage scenes the cutting and chopping is relentless. In most instances you get far less than a second to try and make sense of an image before it cuts to the next, then the next and so on. You must get thirty or forty cuts during a short scene. All it succeeds in doing is completely disorienting the viewer until they don't care what's going on, they just want it to be over. In fact, I actually felt a bit nauseous during the basketball scene (which is the first time you get the treatment). After that I got my spacelegs and could tough it out, though I still had a headache by the end.\n\nA third annoyance were the cat traits that Halle Berry's character developed after she became Catwoman. She became fond of fish for a start. Well, that's stereotyping cat behaviour if ever I saw it. My cat preferred cheese to anything else. Catwoman also preferred milk and hissed at dogs. These might seem little things, but they were somewhat silly and aimed at cheap laughs. However, despite my fervent hopes all through the film, not once did she lick her genitals. Nor apparently, did she develop six nipples, or I'm sure her boyfriend would have noticed. Or develop a foul cat-breath with all the fish she was eating. So it amused me that she was given some, but not all, of the traits that cats are famous for.\n\nDespite my lengthy gripes, the film was OK to watch and much better than I was fearing. If they'd have addressed the problems above, the film could really have been quite good. As it was, it was a harmless way to spend an hour and a half."

        "review_detailed_main": "I always liked the idea of a Catwoman movie, she was always one of the most intriguing villains in the Batman universe and the fact that a brilliant actress such as Halle Berry was involved told me that I would love this movie. That was nearly three years ago, since that time I have seen this movie three times, and each of those three times I have unfortunately been left feeling cheated after seeing it. You see the movie Catwoman basically takes the character of Catwoman that I loved, dumps her into a bizarrely ridiculous universe revolving around make-up, gives her one of the most ludicrous costumes to date, and to top it all off just ruins every likable aspect of her character. So what's so bad about it? The action? The performances? The story? Well if I'm honest I'm not sure, the action has its moments despite hardly being amazing, the performances range from half decent from Halle Berry to stupid, Lambert Wilson, to just the plain horrifically ludicrously nasty performance by Sharon Stone. The story could have worked I suppose if given the proper treatment, even though the story about the main villain being evil because she isn't the front page girl anymore just never could work. No the biggest problem is the the fact that the script and direction basically mutilates this movie. This might have scraped mediocre had the camera bothered to stay still for two seconds and the dialogue been devoid of some of the worst clunkers in cinema history! Catwoman herself is a great character, and thankfully Halle Berry manages to make a terrible script not sound awful. Why she received the Razzie for Worst Actress is beyond me as she really does still have moments to shine. After she gets past the pathetic whimpering girl stage early on in the movie and gets serious she works very well. Of course her romance with Benjamin Bratt's policeman could never work, the pair have no chemistry and Bratt seemingly the charisma of a gnat. In fact the scenes where them two do a weird basketball sequence doesn't fell sexy as its meant to, in fact it just feels odd and misplaced. Sharon Stone clearly makes the biggest career mistake of her life in this movie though. Her character to be frank shouldn't exist in the first place, but just her performance itself is awful. I can't comment on her any more as she really is that hate-able in the movie.\n\nCatwoman isn't the worst movie in the world, and the action does manage to make the movie rise a teeny bit above one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But the fact that no real effort has been placed into it just annoys me to the extreme. I would watch a Catwoman 2 on three conditions, Halle Very is back, the director and scriptwriter are fired, Sharon Stone swears that she will never act again, especially in a superhero movie. Then I'd consider watching a sequel, but since this was globally despised I really doubt I'd ever have to endure one anyway. So if you wanted to see this, take my advice don't, go watch Batman Returns instead."

I was shocked that Manos and Saving Christmas were overtaken after years being the worst, well, because they are.\n\nI'm not surprised this movie was down the list because it is a bad movie. Now, if it were meant to be campy and over the top, then I could appreciate it more. Movies like the aforementioned Manos or Plan 9 From Outer Space are cheap, cheesy atrocities but those trainwrecks are delightfully awful. This movie was trying to be serious but it was painfully awful.\n\nThe writing and directing are the starting point. The directors have their vision and the actors comply. A horrible script can't be saved by even the best actors. Halle Berry is an incredibly talented actress. She has proven that many times in her career. Unfortunately, there are times where you feel her looks are front and center over her talent. She is very beautiful but this character made her look a little trashy. Michelle Pfeiffer is also very beautiful and the direction,script and her performance put her miles ahead. She was more covered up but it was sexier and more sultry. The movie was very dark yet campy but she nailed it (and a bit spooky).\n\nSharon Stone is always a delight even though she is really not that great of an actress, it seems to work for her but not here.\n\nWhat does puzzle me is the people who rate something like this a 10. I'm not insulting your opinion, it's all subjective, but why a 10 when many of those reviews do have issues with it. How do you give it a perfect score!!!!!!!! 10 on this scale is perfect. It doesn't fool enlightened people. We actually read reviews, not just an overall rating. If they are predominantly bad, though it may not deter watching it because, again, taste is subjective, it kind of give it credence. I do laugh at some perfect scores because some of these people love EVERYTHING (according to other reviews) even the worst crap ever made. What do you rate the truly great movies??? Ok, I'm done there.\n\nI'm looking forward to The Batman. We will get another new version of Catwoman in Zoe Kravitz. Another beautiful young woman (look at her parents, no wonder). She will be Selina Kyle and I'm hoping for a convincingly strong portrayal. You couldnt pay me enough to watch the Twilight movies but Robert Pattinson is a very good actor so I'm praying it makes me forget Ben Affleck!!! We need to get back on the right track."

Spiderman had NOTHING new to contribute its in many ways a clone of its own ... Catwoman may not have a lot of new techniques but it works !! some people badmouth it without the knowledge of the real catwoman ( the marvel cartoon ).. eg just because Catwoman jumps from building in stealth doesn't make it a bad movie maybe you all should take notes or something considering that hale berry is catwoman and not a cat .. The statement that a cat would make noise is plain stupid .. Besides Hale does a far better job than Toby she identifies herself with catwoman Toby does not.. About the plot i really cant sea what all the fuss about what about Spiderman then ? thats a joke .. This ain't a thriller its based on a cartoon and plots in cartoons is for the common folk .. since comics is directed at kids.."

        "review_detailed_main": "Halle Barry is excellent as Catwoman, especially in the difficult Patience/Catwoman transition. As Patience she is convincingly innocent, self-effacing and awkward; as Catwoman she is sexy, graceful, lithe and powerful. I can't find a thing to fault in Halle's performance, especially her amazing stunt work and extraordinary physical conditioning. She clearly put a lot of effort into preparing for this role and learning to move in a convincingly cat-like manner. I particularly like the way she handles her whip, which is reminiscent of the languid motion of a cat's tail or the quick strike of a paw.\n\nAs good as Halle is, overall the movie is very disappointing, a victim of both lack of imagination and heightened expectations. In fact, the only aspect of the movie that works is Catwoman herself. Her costume and diamond claws are wonderfully done, but she's all dressed up with nothing to do. While her backstory is well done, everything else seems like an afterthought. A comic book character needs a world of mystery, intrigue, danger and romance to inhabit. The story and setting need to take the viewer beyond the mundane. It needs to be larger than life, and that starts with imagining something extraordinary. The writers and director fail completely in this regard.\n\nThe contradictions inherent in a character of dual nature offer ample opportunity for dramatic tension, but the story fails to take any advantage of this, either. Nor does it bother to really explore Catwoman's danger-loving bad girl side.\n\nThe director, Pitof, is listed as an effects director on a number of French films and the last (and worst) of the \"Alien\" series. Clearly, he's not ready for prime time. Does an effects director even work with live actors? To judge by this effort you wouldn't think so. The difference between a blockbuster success and a complete flop can come down to hiring an inexperienced director to head an $85 million dollar project.\n\nThe bottom line: this is a watchable and entertaining film. Halle Berry's performance certainly makes it worth watching. I think anyone coming to it without high expectations will enjoy it.\n\nAn observation about votes and User Ratings: I noticed in the User Ratings that over 40% of voters gave this movie a \"1\". What's up with that? Considering how many genuinely crummy movies there are out there, the worst that can be said of Catwoman is that it could have been a lot better. I mean, really, you have to wonder how many of those votes are due to a herd-mentality \"piling on\". It's sad to think that this might be motivated in part by the star's race and gender."

The movie is not about the comic book character, not even a little. Its much closer to a spin of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. This meek woman 'changes' into a cat/person hybrid and causes havoc. blah.\n\nIt would be like me making a movie about two yellow suns fighting over a planet and calling it Star Wars.\n\nThe best part of the entire movie was the intro and music.\n\ni sure hope nothing i said could be considered a spoiler, because i did not check the box."

But over all the movie was by far one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.\n\nI would like to recommend that you should not buy this movie. If you really what to see this film, rent it.

        "review_detailed_main": "Catwoman is such a fantastic idea -- like Spiderman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc. And yet, the directing of the this film was so music video-influenced and A.D.D. that it did a disservice to Halle Berry and Ben Bratt. Bratt and Berry's talents remain untapped for what they could have done. Additionally, the reduction of Berry's power to sexual attractiveness is a bummer -- and what are girls and boys to take from that? Spiderman is sexy, but not looking like a centerfold. Compared to Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman's walking the line of vulnerability, sexual power, and physical power, this presentation of the superhero/antihero feels like a disservice to the genre & to women and girls in general. The base story pits woman against woman over beauty and sexual virility -- what's that about? Is an aging gorgeous model really a sufficient nemesis? And finally, is the overall \"moral\" that a strong independent woman cannot have a relationship? These are questions I fear the filmmakers never asked themselves, and, though this movie could have been great, it instead does a disservice both to the actors and to the audience."

She works as a graphic designer for Hedare Beauty, a mammoth cosmetics company on the verge of releasing a revolutionary anti- aging product. When Patience inadvertently happens upon a dark secret her employer is hiding, she finds herself in the middle of a corporate conspiracy. What happens next changes Patience forever.\n\nTrust me this is not only boring but stupid. Halle really can not pull the role. Sharon Stone is just mugging for the camera. I have no idea why Warner Brothers made \"Pitof\"the director. Trust me this film is so bad that nobody has ever let him direct anything again. That includes \"Traffic\"."

I'm not even going to bother explaining anything to the comic book geeks who have already made their point more than clear, but for the rest of us just looking for an air conditioned, popcorn-filled night of pure action sequences and corny one-liners, this movie delivered. So lighten up. At least it didn't have a ridiculously over-the-top villain (*cough* Spiderman *cough*). Or Kirsten Dunst, for that matter (shudders). Top 100 material this is not, but it doesn't belong in the bottom 100 either."

        "review_detailed_main": "After reading some horrendous (and I mean really, really bad reviews of 'Catwoman', I was definitely considering giving it a miss). I have to say that after having seen it, I am absolutely at a loss to words as to why the critics have mauled it so doggedly, and in my opinion unfairly. Were we watching the same film? What was so bad about it? Sure so the plot was on the thin side and the dialogue was highly camp, but other than that I can't see what has provoked the spewing of critical vomit all over this film. Halle Berry makes an adorable Patience, and displays her vulnerability believably and effectively. On the other hand, she really sexes up the screen as Catwoman with the witty one-liners, the hot costume and the raunchy whip cracking. Once again Halle has displayed her versatility.\n\nThis film is called Catwoman, the name should explain itself. I don't understand why people are ripping it to shreds or calling it laughable, e.g. as in the way Patience acts becoming Catwoman, i.e. the catnip incident (once), the hissing at dogs (once), the tuna (once, which I found to be amusing), the prancing around. What exactly did you expect her to do? How else do you act like a cat? How else does a human gain feline tendencies? Got any better ideas? I didn't think so. Yet we don't rip Toby Maguire to shreds when he shoots web from his arms (yeah like THAT makes sense.) There is clearly a double standard approach adopted by some critics, who contradict themselves more then they'd care to admit. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy Spiderman as well as this.\n\nThis not brain food and you don't have to evaluate your life after it but hey, people need that once in a while. It's a fun movie... The CGI was NOT bad, sure it was obvious at times that it wasn't Halle but for the most part it was done to a high standard. Let's be honest here and give credit where credit is due the cinematography is superb. It has such a visual allure, a dark, rich atmospheric look, and it is almost sexy to look at. The camera work is very original looking, kudos to Pitof, am I the first person to actually praise him? I think so. The scene where the Egyptian Mau brings Patience back to life is beautiful and picturesque. The music creates an epic mood.\n\nSharon was fun to watch as the 'past it', shallow, bitchy Laurel Hedare. Alex Borstein shined as Patience's best friend and Benjamin Bratt did the best that he could with what he was given as dialogue. Lambert Wilson plays his part, in the usual camp style, but does it to perfection. All in all the acting is not bad, and unless somebody has a personal vendetta against Halle Berry, it can't be said that she didn't put her all into the part. She was sizzling as Catwoman. One critic in particular said that she looked \"as sexy as a hairball in the outfit\". Either a jealous woman or a man with terrible taste in women must have written that. Halle has undeniable sex appeal in the part. The soundtrack is typical summer movie fare with the usual dramatic theme song, mixed with the current popular styles, hip-hop, r'n'b. This is after all a film that has to appeal to a teenage audience. The action scenes are exciting and well executed. The ending is suitably over the top but still entertaining. One scene that I thought was ridiculous was the basketball scene and some of the dialogue could have been much better, however the positives weigh out the negatives for me.\n\nThis is no Citizen Kane or Pulp Fiction but its no Gigli or Swept Away either. I have seen way worse comic book movies. Daredevil, Hell Boy and undoubtedly Hulk were worse than Catwoman. It is, on no level one of the worst films ever made. What were people thinking writing that? I went in with the lowest expectations possible for Catwoman and came out of the theatre having seen a supremely entertaining, undeniably above average film. Critics should be ashamed of themselves and audiences should not be puppets. This is worth seeing. There has been a 'Let's jump on the bandwagon' attitude regarding this film. One person bashes it and suddenly everybody does. I'm glad I went to see this film so I could make up my own mind regarding it. I usually do agree with critics but on this one, I beg to differ. Everybody is entitled to an opinion, you might not like mine, and I might not like yours but there is no need to be downright nasty and unfair when reviewing something. There is such a thing as being balanced. Oh and before people start complaining about the absence of Selina Kyle, and Gotham city, who cares, life is too short.\n\nSo if you want to some light, leave your brain at the door entertainment, go to see Catwoman. If you want to see a high drama Oscar category film, go to see something else. It's fun, sexy action-packed, camp, stylish summer fare. It is a step above the usual Hollywood fare in the style stakes. Pitof shows a typically stylish French attitude. Halle Berry does herself proud. If you want to be a gullible puppet, believe the 'we're failed artists', overly critical, intellectually snobby critics. I don't really care if that seems like a generalisation because it is most likely true. I bet many of them haven't even seen it. See it for yourself, and make up your own mind. I look forward to a sequel\u0085.."
