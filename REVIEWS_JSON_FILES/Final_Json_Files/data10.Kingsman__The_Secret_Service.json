Instead I got a crazy, mad, violent, nutty and over the top film. It has a definite Britishness to it, it's a very smart looking production, very well acted, with some jaw dropping fight scenes, the visuals and production values are extremely high. The fights involving Sofia Boutella were just insane, she's particularly good. Some big casting, Colin Firth as always makes the perfect gentleman. It's Samuel L Jackson I particularly enjoyed, he was just so funny. Lots of violence, which if it's not your thing you should avoid. Overall, slick and very funny. The world is saved by a chav!! 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Having really enjoyed/loved 'X Men: First Class' and 'Kick Ass' and being someone who likes a lot of the actors, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' did seem really intriguing.\n\nThere was the intrepidation of whether it would balance the violence and humour well, whether the violence would feel too much or whether the humour would leave a bad taste in the mouth. Finally watching it, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was surprisingly brilliant. It sends up the spy genre (primarily James Bond), very like 'Kick Ass did with comic books, and does so brilliantly.\n\n'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes that gives the film an almost operatic grandeur (like in the fight scene in the church), very cool gadgets, richly coloured lighting and audacious production design. The soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.\n\nVaughn does a fine job directing here. Not just achieving the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing and the characters interesting, but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things like with the opening credits.\n\nThe film's script is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar and very witty, with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny to hilarious moments. While the action is grim and unflinching (some of it is not for the faintest of hearts) but nail-biting and surprisingly dynamic, the fight scene in the church especially standing out. The story is very clever and absorbing, with incredibly energetic pacing without being too hectic or rushed. The film does deal with the twist well, it could easily have been out-of-place, clich\u00e9d or overly silly but it's actually a lot of fun with a touch of humanity injected.\n\n'Kingsman: The Secret Service' contains some very memorable characters, including a hench-woman with legs that can kill. It's very well acted too, three of the standouts being Colin Firth, cast against type but doing a phenomenal job (also doing incredibly well in the action), Taron Egerton as an immensely likable main lead and Samuel L. Jackson (though his performance has divided reviewers it seems and understandably), who is clearly having the time of his life as lisping megalomaniac villain Valentine. That is not to dispute Michael Caine, who is more than dependable as a somewhat ambiguous sort of character, and Mark Strong who has a knack of making even weak material interesting, or Sophie Cookson, very fetching though in a slightly underwritten role, and Sofia Boutella who nobody wants to mess with.\n\nIf there is something that lets 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' down it is the ending with the anal sex. This was the one part of the film that to me came over as really unnecessary and tasteless, also seeming very out of place compared to the rest of the material and it is introduced randomly. The infamous Princess line is pretty offensively perverse as well.\n\nAll in all, though, a surprisingly brilliant send up that does nearly everything right. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Well folks, that's how it's done. Ever thought MI-6 (note: that's what the British call their secret service) is a club for snobbish, upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? OK, Bond is kind of cool (I hated the last two, though), but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level. Not since 'District 9' have I had that feeling during the watching of a film like \"this movie just does everything right\" (by which I mean of course: it plays exactly to MY taste).\n\nCompared to this film, every James Bond movie released after 'Licence to Kill' looks like a snore-fest. This is such a kick-ass, \"balls against the wall\" crazy ride that I had to shake my head several times in disbelief during the screening I was invited to. And I actually knew what I was in for. I've seen every film by Matthew Vaughn, but I was not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one. Thought 'Kick-Ass' was pretty crazy? Wait till you see this.\n\nOne of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors. The well known stars all play against type, which makes this even more unreal. Remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies like 'Bridget Jones'? He just won an Oscar for playing the stuttering King of England, and as you will see in 'Kingsman', that Oscar was well deserved: that dude (Colin Firth) can play anything! He's more bad-ass in this than Bond ever was!\n\nA word to the wise, though, this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish. It is a comedy but a very, very violent kind of comedy. And the language alone will shock the MPAA out of their pants. Watch this if you're into films like 'Lock, Stock', 'Kick-Ass', or 'In Bruges' and you'll probably love it - don't bother if you're more into serious films or family friendly comedies. As for me, I had a (bloody) good time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down \"no-blood-no-swearing\" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as \"action\" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.\n\nWhich brings me to this movie. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughn's previous films, 'Layer Cake' and 'Kick-Ass', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally bad-ass, and I can now say that's actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of bat-sh\u00eet crazy.\n\nYears ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated Bond might be like. I don't know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because 'Kingsman' is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of 'Men in Black' and 'Mission Impossible' thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what 'Game of Thrones' is to 'Lord of the Rings': Where the former can't and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check. Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.\n\nBut it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare 'John Wick' or 'Equalizer', 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.\n\nEDIT:\n\nP.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies. If you're a film fan (especially of films that don't cater to teenagers), you might find it as enlightening as I have:\n\nwww.the-fanboy-perspective.com/the-importance-of-the-r-rating.html"

I would never have thought that a stiff Brit like Colin Firth could pull off action - but boy, does he whoop ass in this one. I thought the story was rather original (don't know the Comic), it's a bit like an ultra violent James Bond parody. Or better: a crossbreed of Bond and Kick-Ass. Finally an action movie that doesn't use kiddie-gloves. The kid who plays the recruit is also worth mentioning. I've never seen him before but he really nails it. There's a lot of humor in this film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not overdone. And Sam Jackson finally found something he hasn't done yet. I guess his role was already spoiled a bit in the trailer, but believe me: you haven't seen Jackson in this kind of part before. This is an excellent, over-the-top bloody and sexy film for fans of old-school action films. I give it 10 stars. Highly recommended!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Gary \"Eggsy\" (Taron Egerton) is a teenager who has no direction in life. His father was part of a secret agency called Kingsman who battle evil undercover. His father was killed when Eggsy was a baby. His fathers mentor Harry (Colin Firth) persuades Eggsy to try out for the Kingsman. Then there's evil Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a (pretty stupid) idea for world domination.\n\nThis has been a hit with critics and audiences seem to like it. However this directors last film was \"Kick-Ass\" which was OK but got way too violent and vicious in the end. This is no exception. The beginning and middle are not bad. Full of action and energy and some excitement. The violence is restrained but really kicks in at the end. As a rule violence doesn't bother me. However this movie seems to take an unhealthy attitude to it. They seem to LOVE showing people being viciously killed or tortured. It's all speeded up so it's like a Looney Tunes on acid so it isn't too upsetting but after a while it wears you down. It got depressing and uncomfortable. Also the movie is far too long. This doesn't have to run over two hours. Worst of all is Jackson. He's TERRIBLE! His OTT performance wasn't funny or amusing--it was just incredibly annoying. And what was with that lisp? Pretty stupid plot too even for a spy spoof.\n\nOn the positive side the rest of the acting was pretty good. Egerton is a likable main character; Firth is always good; Michael Caine is good also in his too few scenes; Mark Strong is fun as Merlin and Sofia Boutella is interesting as Gazelle. So it does have a lot of action, suspense and violence but it's too much and far too cruel."

I like Jackson's villain with a speech impediment. It's a fun exciting compelling action adventure from start to finish."

        "review_detailed_main": "Matthew Vaughn, who's previous films in the director's chair number just four \u2013 \"Layer Cake\", \"Stardust\", \"Kick Ass\" and \"X-Men: First Class\" \u2013 does not do subtle. But he certainly does do stylish and entertaining. Of his past works Kingsman resembles most closely Kick Ass with its anarchic tone and comic-book violence. This is not surprising given the film is based, as was Kick-Ass, on a new comic book series by Mark Millar (this time with Dave Gibbons).\n\nColin Firth plays Harry Hart (aka Galahad) a member of a secret spy network called Kingsman. Firth is quite outstanding playing a gentleman spy: a role he was born for. When one of their own gets terminated on a mission Harry proposes Eggsy (Taron Egerton), the son of an ex-colleague, to go forward to a lethal form of training to become the replacement Kingsman.\n\nWhile all this is going on, a dastardly plan (that will result in global mayhem) is being plotted by the billionaire Valentine (a completely over-the-top and lisping Samuel L Jackson), ably protected by his female bodyguard (and literally a Blade Runner) Gazelle, played by the strikingly beautiful Algerian actress Sofia Boutella. Will the Kingsmen defeat the dastardly plot in time before the countdown runs out? (You can probably guess, but you'll have fun finding out).\n\nWhereas Bond has Universal Exports, Kingsman's \"cover\" organisation is a Saville Row tailor's called Kingsman, giving all of the spies an excuse to wear outrageously fashionable suits.\n\nThe \"M\" in this network has the codename of Arthur, played with enormous style by Michael Caine, especially in one notable scene where he suddenly slips from his posh Etonian accent into pure East End gangster. The \"Q\" equivalent is played by Vaughn-favourite Mark Strong, for once playing a good guy and playing it very well indeed.\n\nIt's also great to see, before his Star Wars return, Mark (Luke Skywalker) Hamill playing a global warming expert, who has more that one reason to get a bit hot under the collar.\n\nDuring the heyday of the early Bond films in the 60's a number of spoof films arose: the gratingly erratic Casino Royale (with David Niven) being one, with James Coburn's \"Flint\" movies being a better example. Kingsman is a worthy example of this genre: a film that has its tongue firmly in its cheek, and with a range of nice Bond-references, particularly in regard to the clich\u00e9 about the villain telling the hero the details of his plot before putting him to an intricate and readily escapable death.\n\nI really liked this film from the off. It oozes style from the opening titles onwards and when we move into the extended agent training section Vaughn turns the action knob to 10, showing off the style of newcomer Egerton, who has great charisma and carries the role well particularly when matched with the charming and likable Roxy (a film debut for Sophie Cookson).\n\nUnfortunately, in my view, Vaughan and co-screenwriter Jane Goldman can't quite help themselves and turns the action knob to 11 for the second half of the film. A scene of carnage in a church will be too extreme for older or more sensitive viewers, and a gruesome scene to the stirring notes of \"Land of Hope and Glory\", whilst hysterically funny and done purely for laughs, doesn't quite fit with the mood of the film: it channels more \"Mars Attacks!\" than the Bond-spoof that has gone to date. Similarly a good gag with a Swedish princess is pushed a step too far in a final scene. A case of \"less is more\" in this reviewer's book.\n\nIn summary, well worth watching for a fun Saturday-night cinema trip. My one request to Vaughn is that if there is a Kingsman 2 (which you could certainly see happening) then he maintains enough interest to direct it: I'm not sure I could stand the disappointment of another Kick Ass 2.\n\n(If you enjoyed this review, please see the multi-media version together with more reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to subscribe.

Plus super shot \"martial art\" action that should make the Matrix jealous. The action has its true Shakespearian/GoTh moments and all supported by cool tech-stuff. Great aspect in this movie is the music, an extra comic dimension. When you see the movie you'll know what I mean. Next too all the clever fun and furious action, it touches on petty crime poverty and home violence. Matthew Vaugh captures the grimness yet doesn't loose it's lightness ... and I like the message: \"a gentlemen is not born, a gentle(wo)men is someone who chooses to be one.\"\n\nThe young gang, like Sophie Cookson, held up well and Taron Egerton established his position in the gang of giants. Colin Firth's aloofness was crowned with a kick-ass bite, Samuel Jackson brings his role back to old fashion comedy, strongly supported by Mark Strong and Michael Caine. It is a big 9,5 - this movie just nailed it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kingsman: The Secret Service marks the third film in a row that director Matthew Vaughn has adapted from a comic book background. His two predeceasing being Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011) - which, by all means, were pretty damn good!\n\nOver the last few decades, both comic and superhero movies, mostly fall into the easy trap of taking themselves too seriously. Where Vaughn's vision lies, and so-far proved by his former comic adapted films is that they draw a clean balance to where drama and serious character development ends, and cartoonish humour meets, leaving a unique entertainment that stands out.\n\nBased on the comic by Mark Millar (who also created Kick-Ass), the film sees a young \u2013 no better way to put it \u2013 chav, called Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), taken under the wing of Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a spy for her majesty's secret service. With the aid of Michael Caine and Mark Strong, they soon come face-to-face with the villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson); an ego- centric - Steve Jobs-type - billionaire madman (with a lisp), who hates the sight of blood \u2013 yet holds a vision of mass biological warfare.\n\nLicenced to thrill, Kingsman' is almost a love-letter to the James Bond films \u2013 but not too far as a parody, like Austin Powers - but more a homage to the franchise - a 007 meets Kick-Ass, of sorts. At a point, Colin Firth's character, Harry, even mocks the thought by saying 'give me a far-fetched, theoretical plot any day\u0085'\n\nFans of Bond and Kick-Ass are certain to love it, as through rollercoasters of action, comedy and espionage, comes a bucket of winks, references and nods to the world of spy movies. Just like the colourful, gadget ridden Bond films of the 1960's, Kingsman is very fun to watch, with 'wham, bam, thank-you ma'am' style of mayhem, one- liners and bonkers soundtrack crazed all over it.\n\nThe comic the film was based on was already hugely entertaining \u2013 in fact, probably the best we have read. Littered with Millar's creative quirkiness and with Vaughn's auteur film-making, has left a stylized-spectacle of ultra-violence.\n\nPortraying the lead character of 'Eggsy', Taron Egerton (also in this month's Testament of Youth), proves to be an outstanding newcomer as he brings the character to life with an energizing vibe of a comparing ethic of chav lifestyle vs. gentleman's class.\n\nAlongside, and tackling the mentor, come father type role, is Colin Firth, who based on previous filmography alone could easily be classed as Britain's most boring and typecast actor. Until now, the mold romantic films is broken as he picks up a gun and finds an encyclopedia of wit and enters openly new territory. It's Colin Firth like you have never seen before! \u2013 and it is bad-ass.\n\nSqueezing in with a 15 rating (somehow), Kingsman is never short of violence and its guts and guns galore, when kneecapping; slicing off body parts and explosions become all too familiar. Given the calibre of talent involved, Kingsman' does not fall stereotype and gimmicky like other YA spy adventures like Stormbreaker, or Spy Kids, but instead, a well-deserved mash-up of espionage and true cinematic excitement."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's strange when you consider it, how much the Spy thriller genre has changed and grown because of James Bond, there is not a single Spy movie that is made that isn't and won't be compared to double 'O' seven himself. So I suppose it's no surprise that a film like Kingsman had to be made eventually, so I suppose the reel question is will this make the Sky fall or just be a quantum of nonsense?\n\nSay what you like about Mathew Vaughn the man likes his comics. So far out of the 5 films he has directed, 3 were graphic novels first. Kingsman is one of them. The man's like the anti-Zack Snyder, he directs films based off of comics and brings out real issues in them, as opposed to Snyder who directs films based off of graphic novels and ignores any merit or comment on the wider world the books make and just makes HIS movies. I'm happy to say that Kingsman is probably the most fun I will have in a cinema screen this year.\n\nAs I've already said Spy films get compared to James Bond, so let's begin with that shall we? Kingsman is a film that is both totally unique and its own movie whilst fully embracing its British heritage, the films marketing campaign drew strong comparisons to For Your Eyes Only artwork. The film acknowledges all of those stupid spy clich\u00e9s in a way which is both knowing and clever, and then it ditches them all. The best example of this I can give is in the opening sequence of the film, there is a glass of whisky, a lot of people die and there isn't a drop of said whiskey spilt, and at that moment Kingsman sticks two fingers up at the past and says \"we're the future\" and from that second onwards Kingsman is its own movie. The film successfully reinvents just about every stereotype imaginable in a spy film.\n\nThe villain, who is always central in a spy movie, is Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Valentine is a megalomaniac who wants world domination, all standard stuff so far, he also has a lisp and is terrified of blood. That's the kind of thing Kingsman does really well, it sets us up with the standard and transforms it to be unique.\n\nThe film is of course preposterous in the extreme, but I don't care. It was funny, clever, brilliant and unique. Kingsman has so many pro's to it that you can easily overlook the minor short comings, because in the end the film has a baddie who has blades for legs, I mean who doesn't love that?\n\nWhat I like most about Kingsman is that even with all its madness it still manages to have some kind of heart; the entire movie is kind of a think piece on class war and the importance of legacy. The movie has a brain and a soul and it has no problem expressing either, the finale to the parachute problem proves this most for me.\n\nI would be remised if I didn't mention something about the cast, let get over the whole \"the obvious people are amazing thing\" and look forward to the new comers Taron Egerton (playing \"Eggsy\") and Sophie Cookson (playing Roxy). These two talents have come from nowhere and broken through the glass ceiling, Cookson and Egerton are stars with one film to their names, and they deserve every single piece of praise that comes to them. Taron is such an unbelievably versatile young man, he can be funny, clever, cool, cocky, brash, physical, confident and insecure all without saying a word or moving a muscle. Also, I loved seeing Jack Davenport on screen again.\n\nKingsman is the film this country needed; it's confident and fun, without being disrespectful or full of nasty. In short, Sic."

        "review_detailed_main": "People will have interesting reactions to this film. All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. I would call it an action comedy, but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has.\n\nThere are cool POV shots, and it gets you right into the thick of it. It mixes it up with some short moments where it doesn't cut so quickly, as well as a few long takes that are particular nice. The violence and comedy has a guttural component, which a person like me really enjoys, but it will throw some off.\n\nThe film is a throwback to old spy flicks, while at the same time being a sort of parody. It is humorous throughout. Samuel L. Jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver, which goes with the tone of the movie. It is nice to see Samuel L. in the role of a bad guy. I have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman, who has a different element to her. Colin Firth fits in with the particularly suave spying; and, the newcomer playing the protagonist, Taron Egerton, handles both the action and comedy well. Mark Strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor. It is fun, however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it. It is not a film for everyone, but that makes it better for others. I personally think it is Vaughn's best work.\n\n8.75"

The acting, particularly by Taron Egerton and Colin Firth, provided some charismatic moments, while the music added to the film's energetic tone. The casting choices were generally good, with strong performances from the ensemble. Cinematography delivered stylish action sequences, and Matthew Vaughn's directing brought a fresh approach to the spy genre. The writing aimed for a blend of humor and action but occasionally leaned too heavily on crude humor and clich\u00e9s. Its strength lies in its irreverent take on the spy genre and creative action sequences, but it struggled with tonal consistency and character development. Overall, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is an entertaining, if occasionally uneven, spy romp."

        "review_detailed_main": "Matthew Vaughn is now one of those directors that I can trust. This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25).\n\nThis film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act.\n\nKingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast. If you are looking for a good popcorn movie to see, this is a movie you should see with your pals."

Knowing that this film was directed by Matthew Vaughn(Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class) I had a pretty good idea that this film was going to be really good. If you love fast-paced, stylish, humorous, and all around awesome flicks, then this is a definite must see! The action was amazing and I really loved watching Colin Firth kick some ass! Samuel L. Jackson was very fun to watch as a villain as well. I don't think I've had that much fun watching a film in a really long time. The way the creators put a different spin on the superhero genre in Kick-Ass, was very much how they put a spin on the Spy movie genre in Kingsman: The Secret Service. I can guarantee a film like this won't win any major awards but I can guarantee that you will have an entertaining time with this film. Must see 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Kingsman: The Secret Service is the most typical Mark Millar/Matthew Vaughn movie you'll ever get. It has the author's same gratuitous violent content, shallowly depicted intriguing themes and outrageous ideas towards various genres, as well as the director's stylized action scenes and trademark visual quirks. It tackles the same personality and ambition from the Kick-Ass movies; it speaks the language of the well- known genre while also mocking the worst of it, yet goes hypocritical about its own opinion. And as always, it still offers their classic pleasure by just being pure silly and violent, but then it doesn't gain anything more than that.\n\nJust like what they did to superheroes, The Secret Service both pokes fun and shows its affections to the classic elements of the themed genre. Though, the criticism doesn't go any farther than pointing out its clich\u00e9s and trend by dialogue. It never really tries to transcend anything or prove to be better than what spy movies have done, the film just feels like expressing those opinions. In spite of that, the plot is outright ridiculous, but for the film, it just loves being dumb at those conceits. The movie is clearly contented at throwing away a bunch of fascinating ideas within this world, even at the training scenes where most of their work don't necessarily applied in their actual mission. While it's fun, it never really outcomes anything more than a zany imagination.\n\nHowever, the pacing feels kind of slower than it deserves. This is the type of film that needs a little more momentum to actually live up to its silliness. Maybe at the action scenes, it did, but most of the film has to settle with many things that don't need much of a heavy breathing. It's still entertaining, the characters are easy enough to root for out of their charm, that a simpler pacing would have make things easier to watch.\n\nAnd there's a huge benefit with its style. Matthew Vaughn only has a single aim in his action scenes and that is to be \"Awesome.\" Even for a sequence that is meant to look terrible and morally ambiguous, the style still manages to gloss it over with cool camera shots and velocity, which strangely happens to be the best action sequence of the bunch. It's kind of difficult to think if this is appropriate, but then this is a property that should never be taken seriously. There is a lot to like in the cast. It's easy to picture Colin Firth as a classy spy, and he does it perfectly, while adding up a sense of gravity in other parts. Eggsy appears as a generic young protagonist, but it's Taron Egerton's charisma is what made this hero shine. Samuel L. Jackson makes for a fun and mostly amusing villain. And there's always a likable presence in Mark Strong.\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is self-indulgently fun; so self-indulgent, it tends to sacrifice many of its mundane senses. This is one weird, nerdy fantasy that is easy enough to pleasure comicbook or simply dumb action movie fans. It has style, twisted humor and of course, exciting action. There is nothing else beyond that, though. We just encountered an origin story that has the potential for a new big franchise. We can't fault a film for having an utter joy with itself, it just feels sort of empty. It could have been a little more thoughtful once in a while.And even slightly quicker. But as a total guilty pleasure, this is alright."

Watching the trailer a month ago made me interested to watch this movie since I'm a fan of spy movies especially the 007 movies. The movie is about a young teenager from London called \"Eggsy\" who is chosen by a professional agent from a super secret organisation who call themselves the \"Kingsmen\" to go through the deadliest \"job interview\" to be the next Kingsman spy.\n\nThat said I must say I was not disappointed. The action is fast-paced and there's a lot of comedy.The movie is sort of like 007 meets Men in Black. The movie obviously parodies the old traditional 007 formula especially of the Roger Moore era but this is done in a good way. Kingsman; The Secret Service reminded me how great the old 007 formula was until it was changed until Daniel Craig's portrayal of the agent. After watching this movie Daniel Craig better take notes because there is a new agent on the block and that is \"Eggsy'.\n\nThat being said Kingsman: The Secret Service is the best movie of 2015 so far. Don't miss it!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's got a solid story with strong acting and a great cast. It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation.\n\nFirst off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!\n\n8/10\n\nP.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad."

Hart initiates Eggsy into the Kingsman, a privately operated secret service and, in the course of his training, they both run afoul of evil billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who, of course, has a nefarious scheme that needs thwarting.\n\nThe film has one subtitle too many, and it takes that approach to everything: excess in moderation. Its attention to detail is impressive without being overly meta: only Hart and Valentine acknowledge their debt to classic Bond films, and nobody feels the need to comment on the overkill of an evil lair that seems like it could have been airlifted straight from You Only Live Twice. As a rewatch 03/12/22' opinions remain same. Very fun entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kingsman: The Secret Service is such a silly film, but it embraces that and, out of that, creates one of the most fun and entertaining action films yet.\n\nPart of the reason why I'm giving this film 10 stars is that it contains perhaps the greatest action sequence I've ever seen in any film. I'm still absolutely stunned by how the scene was executed, and I saw the film more than three months ago; I assure anyone that the action sequences are unlike anything they've ever seen before. The careful camera-work, the choreography, the high-octane music, EVERYTHING fits so well to create the ultimate violent action sequence. I mustn't spoil it.\n\nThe other reasons I enjoyed the film follows: Colin Firth takes on the role as Harry Hart, a member of an international spy organization dedicated to protecting peace in the world. Firth takes on the role with enough seriousness and heart (Hart) to make the film engaging and fun. He steals every scene he is in, and his action sequences are the best ones in the film, but I'll get to that later.\n\nNewcomer Taron Egerton plays the new recruit Eggsy, a rebel with a lot of heart and dedication to his family and friends. Egerton makes him instantly likable as the lead and spawns the right emotions to help the audience almost instantly know his feelings and the tone of the film.\n\nThe story overall is a typical formulaic spy plot, though Vaughn adds some more contemporary and ideological elements and twists (that have taken popularity with superhero films lately) into it to make the film more different and exciting from the stereotype James Bond films.\n\nOverall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a roller coaster of a film, that seems to pick up and slow down at the perfect moments. The story is fun and dynamic, and the action is impeccable."

What I loved was that all these agents, huntsmen (and women) are in love with spy movies and they brag about it. Everyone from Austin Power to Borne and the granddaddy of them all (possible that is true;)) James Bond are mentioned both as role model and poking fun to some of the plots holes that they have in their stories.\n\nThe dialogues are also very well written (I suspect Tarantino has put his hands in to that) and the changing between the polite British tone and the ripped fire cursing made me laugh my ass off. The great result must be from the fact that everyone must had a blush working their and it was apparent to the way the characters were reacting to their environment (bonus fact to work their ,you could work beside Mark Hamil himself!).\n\nIn the end is a enjoyable spy film ,with elements of spoof films of old and I recommended to all, just make sure that in the company you don't have a person with a wick stomach, did I mention the gore?

        "review_detailed_main": "I like Mark Millar's body of work. I loved The Ultimates 1 & 2, Civil War, Wanted, Kick-Ass, and Nemesis. I never really read of Kingsman, nor did I hear about it until I saw the first trailer.\n\nWith that being said this film was okay, decent fun.\n\nI didn't particularly find the beginning interesting, despite some stylish opening credits. I found that the film really took its time to get started and it took too long to get everything set up. But there are a lot of moments that really kept me involved. In particular Samuel L. Jackson as Richmond Valentine and Colin Firth as Harry Hart/Galahad.\n\nFirth kept me emotionally involved in the film as his character bonds with Taron Egerton's Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin. Not to mention he is a complete badass. As for Jackson, he surprised me the most. When I first heard about the casting of Samuel L. Jackson, I thought putting him within this cast felt a little force, and I thought this was going to be another \"typical Samuel L. Jackson performance.\" But to my surprise he was very intriguing to watch. He was a clam, sensitive, and for a lack of a better word, a soft villain, but with an ultimate goal. His character also had a lisp and a swagger to him that was a charm to watch on screen.\n\nTaron Egerton is pretty good here too. He's got chops to hold his own against Firth, Jackson, Strong, and even Michael Cain, who has a small role. His comedic timing is very spot on and has some humorous dialog. He was very good in the role, but he doesn't shine until the last act of the film. Here is where he shows that he's a very capable action star, something director Matthew Vaughn is very capable of showcasing, i.e. Chloe Moretz(Kick-Ass). He also shares a nice, but kinda useless friendship/romance banter with Roxy portrayed by Sophie Cookson. Mark Strong as Merlin is also great here too.\n\nThis film also shows off that Matthew Vaughn flare. The action sequences are fantastic and well shot. There is one particular scene in the church that may turn some people off, but one can't deny that it was pulled off with style. At times the film can be hard to follow. I finally understood Valentine's motive and plan in-between the middle and final act, and some bland and boring spots here in there. But Kingsman is very self-aware of other spy movie clich\u00e9s, filled with stylish action, solid performances and a decent amount of laughs that will pleasantly kill off two hours of your time.\n\n7.5/10"

The great fighting scenes along with tremendous effects made this movie a future classic. Its portrayal of the secret service in this well thought plot is sure to be remembered. Who needs the 00 anything, its time for the knights of the round table. Although i have wondered \"What if they need more agents than there are names? Will they go for Lancelot 2.0 or something along those lines?\". Moving on from that, I highly recommend watching this movie else you will miss out. The story of eggy (wish they had another name) and his wit was a definitely good time pass. I wish i could watch it again for the first time."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie practically makes a case for itself. It's every bit as outrageous and bizarre as old Bond movies with equally colorful outlandish characters. It uses anticipation of gritty spy movies made in recent decade, then unapologetically opts for much more eccentric route, even though some of them are a bit too strange. When all the bullets have been fired and nifty gadgets used, the aftermath might not be sensible, but it will definitely delight.\n\nStory revolves around Eggsy (Taron Egerton), a young man who has a less fortunate life. After a few events Harry Hart (Colin Firth) recruits him to join a secret service known as Kingsman out of respect for his fallen father. This may play out similarly to a few other spy movies at the start, but what separates it is the exaggerated antics. It has action theme, but everything is done with lighter candid tone. Egerton is a good cast, as he's new and represents youthful bravado with slight volatile emotion.\n\nAs the rest of the cast are veteran actors, half of them being dapper British and also Samuel L. Jackson, there's bound to be elegance, especially in the profanity. Mark Strong, Michael Caine and Colin Firth look like they are just having fun, it's fresh to see them beyond their usual somber characters in thrillers or dramas. Props to the character Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), she's as agile as her name suggests. Her character expresses personality a lot through motion and the bionic legs are really nice touch inspired from classic Bond.\n\nChoreography is blatantly over-the-top, all with dodging bullets or deflecting them with umbrella. The direction delivers either pleasant yet surprising details or excessive burst of loud explosion, both are done in earnest whimsical nature. Script is very honest, the movie realizes it's better to play to its strength rather than using convoluted gimmick, as it aptly puts it.\n\nIt's loud and occasionally senseless, but one can't fault Kingsman for not having class. After all, looking good is half the battle. is half the battle."

Has one of the best \"fight\" scenes ever to be put on screen.Never knew Colin Firth would be a good action hero. The fight scene in the cabin at the beginning of the movie sets the tone for the entire movie. Heard there is sequel in the talks which I am skeptical about, hope they do not ruin the first movie with the second."

Here are the 2 MAJOR errors which made the movie horrible! (1) There is a scene in the movie with a mother cutting into a bathroom door with a knife. The 2 year old kid who is in the bedroom to be safe from crazed mum is terrified, and screaming. There is no such thing as a 2 year old \"acting\" to be scared. The parents who subjected their child along with the director should be charged with child endangerment. This scene is so disturbing my 17 and 20 year old daughters were disturbed. (2) There is a scene at the end where a princess being saved tells the young leading actor that if he saves the world, that he can have sex with her in her anus. Again my entire family was horrified. This came out of no where. But it didn't stop there. When he was finished saving the world, he went back to her cell where she was held captive and had anal sex with her and left his video glasses on so the secret agent helper could see. They didn't show them have sex, but he went back to room with a glass of wine and the movie ended with a scene of her butt. This literally is how the movie ended. This raunchy no good scene was uncalled for and took everything good in this actors role away. If I could give lower than 1 star I would."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film was so cool! It's not just a hilarious parody of the spy genre, James Bond in particular, but it's one of the consistently entertaining and thrilling films I've seen in years. With an absolutely enthralling story, that goes beyond just taking the mick out of spy movie clich\u00e9s, brilliant performances, epic special effects, massively exciting action and absolutely stunning direction, this is a film that lets you be entertained to the max.\n\nI'll start with what I thought was the most amazing part of this whole movie: the action. As we've seen in Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class, director Matthew Vaughn knows how to make a properly exciting action sequence, but I've never seen him do it to the extent seen here.\n\nSome of the battles in this film go on for up to 5-10 minutes, and whilst I expected that seeing all that violence for so long would be tiring and boring, I was absolutely exhilarated by absolutely every action sequence here, thanks to Vaughn's stunning direction, using the shaky cam to add to the grittiness but still making it clear as day as to what's happening, as well as some fantastic songs to accompany all the action kicking off.\n\nBut it's not just the action that makes this film so good, the story is absolutely spellbinding too. You'd expect it just to be a send-up of Bond films, and while it does do that a lot (particularly towards the end of the story), there's so much more to be had from the plot here. The first half has very little to do with being a parody, and is on its own an interesting and of course hugely entertaining plot, introducing the wide variety of characters in a unique way and grabbing your attention right from the off.\n\nOf course, the whole movie is a comedy as well as an action-packed thrill-ride, and it doesn't disappoint on that front either. Whether it's something hugely sadistic, satirical, clever or just plain stupid, there's a high chance you'll be wetting yourself laughing at what's going on in this film, and although it doesn't impede the story from being as exciting as it is, there's so much laughing to be done for the whole two hours.\n\nMeanwhile, the characters and actors are all fantastic. Colin Firth is stunning as the veteran Kingsman agent, whilst Taron Egerton is a hell of a lot of fun as the young prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson does a great job as the insane Bond villain, helped by a scary but still entertaining performance by Sofia Boutella as the Oddjob-ish evil sidekick.\n\nOverall, there's no escaping the fact that is one of the most entertaining and exhilarating films you'll see all year, filled with stunning action, direction, performances, plot and comedy, and that's why it gets a 9.2 out of 10 from me.\n\nwww.themadmovieman.com"

The longer I was watching the movie, I kept on realizing how much I loved the movie. It was filled with unique action, an unforeseen plot, and a great quirkiness that enhances the film so much. Along with all of these features, the movie was filled with a class A cast. It was a very well needed/well-rounded movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1997, English secret agent Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a member of a top-secret spy organization, sees one of his recruits fail during a training program due to his mistake. 17 years later, the murder of another agent leaves a vacant position in the organization. Hart, code-named \"Galahad\", explains there is a position available, as Agent \"Lancelot\" was killed by the assassin Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) -a hoodlum to service of nasty Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson)- , while trying to rescue Professor James Arnold (Mark Hamill) from kidnappers. Along the while, Eggsy (Taron Egerton), having dropped out of training for the Royal Marines despite his intelligence and capability, has become a chav. The young troubled male is recruited by a training program to join a spy organization as an evil mastermind plots to release a threat that would send the world into chaos. Manners maketh man !.\n\nKingsman is based on the graphic novel \"The Secret Service\" written by screenwriter Mark Millar -author of the Comics series \"Wanted\" or \u00a8Kick Ass\u00a8- and one of the latest star writers of Marvel, for whom he created the series \u00a8Ultimate X-Men\u00a8 and \u00a8The Ultimates\u00a8about The Avengers and drawn by the cartoonist Dave Gibbons who's also comic illustrator of \u00a8Watchmen\u00a8for D. C. comics .\n\nHooligan action comedy, the film has a humor similar to Kick Ass and even more spectacular action. A parody of spy movies and James Bond series, dealing with the investigations of Harry Hart, who tries to hunt down a peculiar and dangerous technological genius who is endangering world security. On the other hand, the film shows the unusual tests that the son of the recruit who 17 years ago gave his life for Hart has to go through if he wants to become part of the Kingsman. The plot is a little bit ridiculous , but we're in a spoof action comedy and it is narrated in fast movement ; besides , abound the surprises , being very funny and bemusing . In the film there is suspense , comedy , emotion , action-packed , tongue-in-cheek and chases galore with impressive velocity pursuits. The screenplay is nicely developed as well as characters and the frenetic action united to excellent special effects that are varied of these too . From the beginning until the end the amusement and entertainment is continued .\n\nIt stars Colin Firth as the implacable but calm agent Harry Hart and the then newcomer and today a world star Taron Egerton playing the badass trainee agent Gary 'Eggy' Price and Samuel L. Jackson as a blotter and some annoying villain. Adding other nice secondaries, such as: Mark Strong, Jack Davenport, Mark Hamill, Sofia Boutella, Richard Brake, Geoff Bell and special apperance of Michael Caine.\n\nThe pic was brilliantly directed by Matthew Vaughn . He's a good writer, producer (Guy Ritchie movies) and director, producing or shooting blockbuster films, such as: \u00a8Layer Cake\u00a8 \u00a8X: First Class\u00a8, \u00a8Stardust\u00a8, \u00a8Kick ass\u00a8, \u00a8Rocket man\u00a8, \u00a8Silent night\u00a8, \u00a8Tetris\u00a8, \u00a8Blood night\u00a8, among others. Rating: 6.5/10."

Samuel Jackson is the worst villain in movie history. His lisp and sideways baseball cap is totally ridiculous and he is totally not believable in his roll as the evil anti-hero. And there is no explanation why an American black man is in this British film to begin with. The only explanation that I can think of is it is only to satisfy the film industry's liberal diversity quota. Would have enjoyed it more had they not chosen that path. If Samuel Jackson is in the sequel I probably won't be interested to in watching it. Not because of Samuel Jackson, who is a fine actor, but because he sucks at being a villain and I'm not into racial diversity quotas in movies."

But Samuel L.

My sisters especially are big fans of Colin Firth so I rented this.\n\nThe story is about a teen from London (Taron Egerton) called \"Eggsy\" who is chosen to interview as a professional spy for a secret group called the Kingsmen. They eliminate applicants during the \"interview\" -- which is actually a series of treacherous attacks, etc. -- until there is one left standing.\n\n\"Kingsman\" is reminiscent of The Avengers on TV and 007. It has some very funny scenes, particularly toward the end, and clever dialogue throughout.\n\nThe violence was very cartoon-like, but I still didn't like it and found it too much and too graphic. I admit I'm not a big fan of violence, but I'll put up with it for something like \"The Godfather\" - -- not for this.\n\nLots of explosions and clever spy devices, with good performances by Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Egerton. Look for Mark Hamill -- see if you can find him without knowing which character he plays."

However, main character Eggsy is quite likable. Usually characters in this role initially seem unredeemable, but we know he's got what it takes from the start. I guess that's a refreshing change from the usual.\n\nIt was also fun to see SL Jackson play a very different role than usual. I had to check the trivia section on IMDb to confirm, but I was pretty sure that his lisp in the movie was his own idea. It was.\n\nOverall the film manages to have the right balance of comedy and over- the-top action movie violence. It's a great film for an evening you just want to relax and let your mind check out for a while."

Galahad (Colin Firth) is responsible for trying to get Eggsy to join the service. The film succeeds in the area that so many other films fail - you care about the characters! This isn't only true of the lead characters either, it is also true for several of the supporting cast. There are plenty of laughs and a very memorable visual scene towards the end of the film. I guess some of the laughs may be a little vulgar for some peoples tastes, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film!"

Colin Firth is a darling in the film always the English gentleman he did not disappoint and Samuel L Jackson with his lisp was amusing to say the least! overall its not one for the kids but if your having friends round for a few beers its easy going with a few twists and surprises and a little James Bond taking the mickey out of.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" isn't quite what you'd expect having seen how the film has been advertised. But for those who might have read the well-acclaimed 2012 comic that the film is based on and from there may have noticed that the film is bringing back the same duo that bought us \"Kick Ass\" (Matthew Vaughn and Mark Millar), \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" may perhaps prove to be less of a shock. The film is most of all a fun one, well-executed by the man whose influence is prominent in it, Matthew Vaughn, the film's director. But Vaughn's style, as seen in the several action sequences that come to define the film are not all that \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" is and the rest of it is relatively generic, poor and boring and definitely stands out in contrast to what I remember \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" for.\n\nThe film's action sequences are each brilliant with one in particular perhaps being the best I have ever seen, where Colin Firth (playing Harry Hart) cuts and shoots his way through the throats and heads of a group of fire and brimstone American, bigot church-goers. The film's ending is also brilliantly shot, unfolding in front of you like a painting. Some have called this style obnoxious, which I understand, but it fits into what \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" is, a film with James Bond archetypes that have been cranked up to about level 100, and that are the complete opposite of the James Bond films we are currently used to.\n\nAnd this is the same for the film's main villain, tech billionaire Richard Valentine (played brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson) who obviously has a phobia of sorts for blood and a lisp. He dresses in a way that is a relief in contrast to the suits I've seen almost every single James Bond villain play in recent times, instead wearing orange, blue or purple baseball caps with matching outfits of course. When I first saw Jackson on screen I couldn't help but burst out laughing.\n\nWhat lets the film down is in what happens when Colin Firth isn't killing everybody in the room. Boring archetypal stuff that is a product of what happens when this James Bond parody is trying to be serious for a moment. Moments like when the film's protagonist, Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) is running down corridors with soldiers chasing after him and miraculously seemingly forgetting how to shoot their guns (I mean this scene is painfully poorly shot). It's these moments I suppose that emphasise how Vaughn is not much a director of actors, but more of action and that is where he succeeds here, as he did in \"Kick Ass\".\n\nUltimately \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" is a good film, and the average member of the audience my age will come out agreeing with me because of how similar it is to what we saw in \"Kick Ass\", but for the critic that I am slowly becoming several things stood out to me which proved detrimental towards the film's style. However, if you want to see a film that is full of blood and gore with a great soundtrack to keep the pace up, a film that in many ways I found took inspiration from my favourite film of 2014, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", then look no further. You don't need to think and you can just be whisked away by Matthew Vaughn along the corridors of Richard Valentin's base, even though there may be the occasional moment when you find the soldiers aren't shooting at, nor running after you."

It's like James Bond meets The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, with a healthy dose of British charm and swagger thrown in for good measure. Taron Egerton's portrayal of Eggsy is a revelation, combining wit, charm, and just the right amount of badassery to make him a truly unforgettable protagonist.\n\nBut what really sets Kingsman apart is its irreverent sense of humor and tongue-in-cheek attitude. From the over-the-top action sequences to the witty one-liners, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. It's like watching a Bond film on steroids, with more explosions, more gadgets, and more banters than you can shake a martini at.\n\nVisually, the film is a feast for the eyes, with slick production design, stylish costumes, and enough gadgetry to make Q jealous. The action sequences are like a choreographed ballet of destruction, with every punch, kick and explosion executed with precision and flair. The stunning cinematography and jaw-dropping special effects are top-notch, rivaling anything Hollywood has to offer.\n\nWith its slick style, sharp wit, and heartwarming moments, it's sure to leave you shaken, stirred, and wanting more."

Samuel L Jackson amazing and the role he played was just perfect for him. The ending was just comical and the plot twists were well thought out though not exactly original. The overuse of swears was a bit annoying but really helped to set the mood sometimes."

In a cinematic landscape where few movies strike the perfect balance between action and humor, *Kingsman* stands out with its masterful scripting. The film expertly keeps the action intense and the comedy sharp, never allowing one to overshadow the other.\n\nThe storyline is tightly woven, with a plot that consistently surprises and entertains. The ending is particularly satisfying, tying up all loose ends and connecting every plot point seamlessly, leaving the audience with a sense of closure that is often missing in films of this genre.\n\nHowever, the movie isn't without its minor flaws. One of the rejected Kingsman applicants is dismissed without a memory wipe, which feels like a significant oversight given the organization's secrecy. Despite this, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' remains an exhilarating and stylish film that successfully redefines the spy genre, offering both thrilling action sequences and clever, well-timed humor. A must-watch!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Not your average James Bond spoof, this espionage comedy features characters who acknowledge the Bond franchise and lament the serious turn taken by the series in recent years with less colourful villains and less imaginative plots. At the same time, 'Kingsman' also features a plot deliciously absurd on the level of 'Dr. No' and 'Goldfinger' with a villain set on destroying most of the human population from his glamorous lair in the side of a mountain. The gadgetry on offer also has a zaniness not seen in the Bond franchise since Desmond Llewelyn's heyday as Q. And yet, even with such absurdities in place, the villain's scheme is remarkably relevant to the world today with climate change issues and conservation in mind, and there is a memorable speech in which humankind is compared to a virus slowly destroying Earth. The film is not without its drawbacks; the tone is often uneven as the story constantly flips back and forth from serious to comedic. Samuel L. Jackson also tends to overplay the villain, lisping half the time for no particularly good reason. Colin Firth on the other hand is very, very good as the proper gentleman spy who trains our protagonist; the way he keeps calm and cool all the time offers some of the film's greatest laughs. The action sequences are also noticeably well coordinated and while the heavy carnage has understandably attracted complaints from some, the filmmakers are careful not use bloodshed for bloodshed's sake. Few films (if any) have used fireworks quite the same way as they are used here!"

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing LAYER CAKE all these years ago I was instantly struck that a new and important director called Matthew Vaughn had arrived on the British film making scene and Vaughn was a name to keep an eye out for , same as Danny Boyle was from a decade earlier. Since then Vaughn hasn't made enough films and the ones he has made are entertaining enough mixing black comedy and violent but live up to the clich\u00e9 of close but no cigar and KINGSMAN continues the Vaughn resume in the Vaughn style\n\nSo what's KINGSMAN about you ask ? How about \"Bond deconstructionist comic book adventure done in a British tongue in cheek style\" ? Maybe not an entirely accurate description but KINGSMAN is a very difficult film to pigeon hole . In feel it's similar in some ways to KICK-ASS but in many ways it isn't similar and I wonder if I mentioned KICK-ASS down to the same production team being responsible for that film ? The story itself revolves a lower working class nobody called Eggsy who lives on a dead end London estate and is recruited by an offshoot of the British secret service to foil the plans of an international villain called Valentine . It's not all that original and the tone of the film isn't entirely successful or consistent but like LAYER CAKE the story itself is a bit of a mess . This is hardly surprising for a film that often veers from meta-fictional Bond or Bourne far fetched globe trotting adventure to a British grief porn kitchen sink drama . What stops it all falling apart is the sense of fun and kinetic energy Vaughn injects in to the film in general and the cast in particular . Any movie that has Firth , Caine and Jackson as the leading lights is worth watching for that reason alone and that trio don't disappoint though Mark Strong's annoying unconvincing Scottish accent is a distraction .\n\nWe occasionally hear rumours about a big budget silver screen version of DOCTOR WHO and I wonder if Matthew Vaughn would be the natural choice to direct that quirky , unique and uniquely British show ? And some of the plot turns are so far fetched they wouldn't be out of place in DOCTOR WHO . Colin Firth as The Doctor versus Samuel L Jackson as The Master ! Sign me up for a ticket now , though please no swearing and get Russell T Davies to do the screenplay instead of Jane Goldman Regardless of what Vaughn does in the future he's still a name to keep an eye on and here's hoping he's making films for years to come"

It is well made and filmed with confidence which is refreshing after a spade of disappointing action films like The Expendables 3, Taken 3 for example. Imagine if Matthew Vaughn was allowed to direct an Expendables. This is a violent film but it is filmed in a manor that is in-between soft core action of again something like Expendables 3 and Graphic action of say something like Robocop making it both accessible to both audiences. The film has been marketed in a way which well respected actors such as Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, and Michael Caine are all involved in a comedy / adventure film, which is true, however anyone that has seen Kick Ass will know what is going to happen. I applaud the three above for their involvement in something they would normally not take on, they all give good performances, as well as Matthew Vaughn regular Mark Strong. The two young leads also give good performances, however I think Samuel L Jackson steals the show with strong support from Colin Firth.The film is good fun and deserves all the success I am sure it will receive. 2015 is going to be one hell of a year"

        "review_detailed_main": "This reminds me of what Tarentino would have done with the Bond series similar to what he did with 70's era Kung Fu movies and action flicks but there's a twist: There are many who say that the theme to Kingsman is conservative. It's like Falling Down for James Bond. It's a similar experience to what I had with the Breaking Bad series which is leftist in feel and scope. In Breaking Bad, the implausible scenario is that a schoolteacher and DEA agent ultimately take drug money to help with their medical care because the government has lousy healthcare benefits. That's like saying Obama has to take the bus because the government doesn't provide him any transportation. It's laughable. But despite that leftist premise, I could enjoy that series.\n\nBy the same token, I get the sense that the audience in the DC region theater were mostly leftist but enjoyed the film despite the tone of the film being one of the most conservative or right wing than I've seen in years.\n\nA savvy viewer will find a number of inconsistencies and plot holes but that goes for the Bond films as well. What \"secret spy\" is quick to tell everyone he's a secret spy and sleep around and draw attention to himself? These plot holes are meant to be savored. Working class folks and the upper crust are both portrayed as yobs with a modern twist: NOBODY smokes. Ever. It's refreshing. Remember in the Bond films how everyone puffed away continuously? I hope this becomes a trend that is repeated in later sequels (which there will surely be.)\n\nThe film appears to have recruited every potential spy and cameo imaginable. Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, Samuel Jackson, Colin Firth among others both pay homage to the Bond style thriller while introducing new elements (Jackson's particular performance is hilarious.)\n\nWatching in the theater was surprisingly enjoyable because, not in spite of, the other audience members that made obvious comments during some action sequences but were stunningly silent in others. I could feel their shock and relished it. Vaughn takes violence that had been reduced to pornography in modern Hollywood and gives it a new artistic twist while also knowing when to tone things back a little and introduce suspense."

        "review_detailed_main": "So Fifty shades of F***ing Sh*t top this movie at the box office where 50 shades got everything wrong and there's nothing good about it, but Kingsman got a lot of good things to talk about so at the end of the day Kingsman win.\n\nThe story is about a street-wise punk with a set of fast hands (and a faster mouth), finds himself recruited by an underground spy agency. If he can pass their test, he will be one of the new initiated into their ranks - just a threat from a twisted tech genius threatens the world.\n\nEvery since the first trailer for this movie came out I already known that this movie was going to be great because Matthew Vaughn directing it and that guy knows how to make a well made film that reminds everyone what good movies are, and that's why these no surprise that this movie was awesome.\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is a like tribute to good spy films that seem to be serious or not very well made these day, yeah they where cheesy and goof but that's what we remember best from them and this movie was the perfect tribute to that, and a perfect tribute that everybody isn't going to see because everybody is going to see 50 Shades of Rubbish, I just lose faith in humility after that.\n\nMatthew Vaughn to me is a director who knows how to direct good action scenes and knows how to entertain the audience, and with this movie he directed this with style and a enough effort to make a bad-ass film, even when his movies mostly flop at the box office it will have a cult following and Kingsman will have a cult following. Nice work Matthew Vaughn.\n\nJack Davenport who is a new star and this is his first big role his every been in and my god was he great in this movie. This is my first time I ever seen this guy act and let me tell you this guy has a bright future a head for him.\n\nNow at the first I didn't really thought that Colin Firth kicking ass would work, but after seeing the movie I was wrong..dead wrong. Every time Colin Firth was in a action scenes I bought it because I heard in a article that he did all of his stunts and I got to say he pulled it of brilliantly. His character Harry Hart was the best character in the whole film and every time his on screen he stole the whole film for me.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has the villain was just spot on brilliant, I mean talking about a villain that was fun and freaking hilarious. But at the first I wasn't very sure about the way he talked in the film, he talked like Adam Snadler from WaterBoy, but after a while I got use to it and it worked for his character. These days I feel that Samuel L. Jackson is just filling it in with his new movies, but in this I actually sawed him playing and caring about his character and he knocked it out of the park.\n\nThis movie probably has one of the best action scene I've seen since...I'm not kidding you here but The Matrix, and that's the Church scene. May god way do I even begin with this, the scene itself was fast paste but I still could see what was going on and that action scene was shot beautifully well and it showed what action should be filmed. So watch when you see the film look out for the Church scene it will not disappoint.\n\nNow for problems and I only have some: I got to say that the first couple of minutes of the movie I didn't really get sucked in into the movie that much, but as the movie went along I finally got into it.\n\nOverall Kingsman is a movie that deserves more attraction, skip 50 Shade of Whatever and see this movie, trust me this movie is more well made than 50 shades."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to say that I was really surprised about this movie. Indeed, I expected the usual 007 agents spies or superhero alike movie with the usual stale recipe, and so I waited to rent it, with no hurry at all but, I was happily wrong.\n\nThis movie takes the genre and put it in a more modern respectfulness but funny, uncensored and violent way.\n\nIt twists and distorts the usual clich\u00e9s in a timely and funny shape, it uses very funny villains, amazing fight bloody hilarious scenes and no stop action. Some people, as me, expected a usual family secret agents movie, but, this is not that and, instead, this is exactly why I liked it. Some viewer have been offended by the bloody scene inside the church, but I found it more fun just because irreverent, bloody funny and completely unexpected. It's a bit like what could be a Tarantino's secret agent film.\n\nOf course it is exaggerated in every aspect, a caricature, a cartoon. Of course it is an overly violent film, but, if you take it for what it is - an ADULT comic - and you understand this movie want to be deliberately contemptuous and unconventional, you cannot say it is not perfectly crafted.\n\nIn spite of all the usual spy agent hero movies, its strong point is that it's outside the box and for this reason unexpected, surprising and entertaining.\n\nA flawless in its (new) kind, a modern bloody and funny 007 style movie.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: For some unknown reason, my expectations for this movie really wasn't that high and I wasn't that impressed with the footage that I had seen on the trailers but now that I've watched it, I am quite impressed. The action scenes were great, especially when Firth was kicking butt in the church and the storyline really wasn't that bad. The transformation of the rude boy to a suit wearing secret agent was also brilliant and I definitely want some of those gadgets. Anyway, the film is about an undercover agency (Kingsman), who are on the hunt for a new spy to join there exclusive intelligence organisation so the individual agents take on an apprentice to train them up. Colin Firth takes on his fellow agents son, who sadly died whilst saving his squad so Firth feels obliged to give his son a chance to join there elite group. Whilst going through training, a billionaire tech genius (Jackson) threatens to take over the world by installing chips into mobile phones and giving them to people for free, so time is not on the agents side. By the time that the training is coming to a close and there are only 2 candidates left, the tech genius starts to cause violence around the world so the agency has no choice but to step in and save the world. I know that it sounds weird, but it's actually quite clever. It has a type of Bond/Mission Impossible flavour which has enough drama and action to keep you entertained from the beginning to the end. I'm usually impressed with Jacksons performances but he didn't seem to fit in this movie. His weird lisp and gangsta clothing was out of place but the other characters were great, especially Colin Firth who had total faith in his apprentice. I also liked Mark Strong, who helped the agents along the way and Michael Caine was a great touch as the head of the elite group. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film and the epic ending was brilliantly put together. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up: Although this movie cost a hell of a lot of money to make, you can really see were every penny went and it truly deserved the money it made at the box office. Its the first major role from the 25 year old Taron Egerton, who also starred in Testament Of Youth and has a major role in the upcoming Eddie the Eagle movie. Its directed by Matthew Vaughn who brought you Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, Stardust and Layer Cake and you can definitely see traits of Kick-Ass in this movie. The attention to detail is brilliant, especially during the action scenes and he covered many aspects with the cleverly written storyline. I just hope that they can get a cast as good as this, if they come out with a sequel! Anyway, it amazing to think that Samuel L. Jacksons movies have nearly grossed over $4.5 Billion dollars, with the Avengers being his highest earner at $625million. At 66 years old and with Nick Fury, Black Phantom and Tarzan in the pipeline, he truly is the hardest working man in Hollywood.\n\nBudget: $81million Worldwide Gross: $405million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/comedy movies about a secret agency who recruits a street kid to save the world from a billionaire, tech expert. 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE review by: Mike Smith\n\nBased upon the acclaimed comic book, this film tells the story of a spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program, just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.\n\nThis movie is a fun action film; it has a classic 007 feel to it and it points out the stereotypical spy and action movie clich\u00e9s and how they aren't going to do the same things; it gives the film charm.\n\nThe cast of Kingsman: The Secret Service is an awesome group of actors. Colin Firth plays the ultimate gentleman spy that all men dream of being at one point or another. Once again Samuel L. Jackson gives us unforgettable character. After a while I couldn't put up with his lisp and he started to remind me of Mike Tyson but Samuel L. Jackson is always worth a watch. Michael Caine plays the leader of the Kingsman. He is rarely on screen but when he is he is intense and mysterious. I'm unformeler with Taron Egerton's work but he was the right choice for the roll. He keeps you interested in the film and he is a good actor. I hope we see him in some north American movies because I thing he'll do well over here. Last but not least I enjoyed seeing the legendary Mark Hamill but when he did his accent it reminded me of his joker voice, but that's not a bad thing.\n\nThe film takes a bit to get warmed up but the action fight scenes are full throttle, fun and at times intense. Also, the Kingsmen has some light chuckles but what bugged me was the green screen, the CG looked cheap and this film really pushed that it was made for 3D, I'm not a big fan of that.\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is worth a watch for the awesome cast and fun action scenes but this movie is very forgettable and it takes a bit for it to get warmed up. Cheers and remember manners maketh man.\n\n7 out of 10\n\nEdited by Samantha Locke"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into Kingsman without any knowledge of this movie other than having seen the trailer once and knowing it was leaning towards the corny and cheesy character of the classic Bond movies. A concept that has been tried many times before, but even when done bad still results in pretty fun to watch movies.\n\nKingsman does many things better than Bond spoofs like Austin Powers or the abysmal Johnny English and a large part of that is due to the actors used in this movie. Jackson and Firth play their roles like they should with Jackson being quite hilarious. The main 'teen' actors aren't annoying as well, which was a big relief.\n\nStorywise this movie makes as little sense as the more out-there Bond movies. To be honest: I already forgot its plot mostly. Not that it matters: its simply a vehicle for a few pretty big action scenes. One of which, in a church, is quite spectacular.\n\nWhen it comes down to it however, Kingsman doesn't quite offer the thrill of a Bond movie. Worse is the fact that at one point it becomes too reliant (and too self aware) of it's Bond inspiration. To the point of a cringe-worthy joke that involves Bond, Bourne and Bauer being mentioned explicitly. This over abundance of Bond related themes and jokes isn't Kingsman's biggest flaw though. As spectacular and brutal as some action scenes are, they are sometimes nauseating to watch do to annoying camera work and some of the worst CGI I've seen in a major cinema movie in a long time. We rightfully criticize The Hobbit for this, but Kingsman is an even worse offender of bad CGI usage. This more than often gives the brutal action a bit too much of a cartoony, very 'Kick-Ass' feel. It could've been cartoony-Expendable-esque action, instead its Tom and Jerry with blood and bad effects.\n\nThat's not saying there are no fun moments in this movie. There are quite a few. Taken as a whole however, this movie just didn't deliver. Nor does it proof the classic-Bond formula still works. It's Kick-Ass influences and over the top humor make it a thing of its own; gadgets and women or not. It's simply a high paced, bit too self aware and slapstick-humor variation of some classic spie movie tropes.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Deftly directed by Matthew Vaughn, \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" is a nostalgic throwback to those early Bond days of the 1960s, when just about every other comedy coming out of Hollywood was a spy-movie send-up (\"Our Man Flint,\" \"In Like Flint,\" \"The Silencers,\" \"Agent for H.A.R.M.\" etc.).\n\nThis latest addition to the genre, based on the comic book \"The Secret Service\" by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, tells of a spy agency so secret that even other spy agencies don't know it exists. Kingsman is made up of a cadre of highly trained, dapperly dressed \"gentlemen\" spies who consider themselves to be the descendants - in spirit, if not in flesh-and-blood - of the knights of yore (they've even given each other code names like Lancelot and Galahad). That dapperest of dapper gentlemen Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, aka Galahad, a veteran agent who recruits a directionless youth (Taron Edgerton) from the streets of London - the son of an agent who over a decade earlier saved Hart's life - to train in the art of spying (like in \"My Fair Lady,\" the eager trainee pipes in). Eggsy's first major assignment will be to thwart the dastardly high-tech plot of a crazed gazillionaire, played by a lisping Samuel L. Jackson, who intends to save the planet by eliminating the \"virus\" (i.e., humanity) that seems bent on destroying it.\n\nThe humor in the Jane Goldman/Matthew Vaughn screenplay ranges from brittle and dry to pitch-dark satire, so dark in fact that the movie occasionally threatens to run off the rails into a tonal train wreck. Luckily, however, it always manages to right itself just at the point where we're about to bail out on it. It's true that the violence may probably be a tad too graphic for a movie of this type but the overall spirit of good cheer and unalloyed fun triumphs in the end."

        "review_detailed_main": "(Rating: \u2606\u2606 \u00bd out of 4) This film is mildly recommended. In brief: A spy film that is shaky, not stirring. GRADE: B- Kingsman: The Secret Service is an homage to the British spy film genre with its sophisticated agents, wry humor, and gadgetry. It sends up the Ian Fleming spy films but with a harsher edginess and tons of violence. Matthew Vaughn directs the film with ample flair and style, but his screenplay (co-written by Jane Goldman) lacks the right degree of mindless fun and wit. The plot follows the formula of a megalomaniac wanting to control the world and a secret agency that is hellbent on stopping him. The film is very well cast, with the exception of its villain, who acts more buffoonish than menacing. Samuel L. Jackson plays him, but the actor never conveys the wickedness very convincingly. Fortunately, the other actors contribute greatly to the film's enjoyment. Foremost are its two leads, Colin Firth who handles the action hero bravado very well and newcomer Taron Egerton as his willing prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Mark Strong, Michael Caine, and Sofia Boutella as the female Oddjob round out the ensemble. Kingsman: The Secret Service entertains, but its high level of non-stop violence is disturbing, especially in a church scene where the body count reaches absurd heights and skews the film's lighter tone which effectively is found in films of this genre. Also, the CGI is amateurish and cheap looking. Kingsman: The Secret Service is based on a comic book, but comic is not the correct term in describing this movie. Serviceable is."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. In 2010, writer/director Matthew Vaughn turned the superhero genre on its ear with the hit Kick-Ass. With this most recent film, he has done the same thing to spy-thrillers. We get the well-tailored look made famous by Roger Moore's James Bond, the fanciful and lethal gadgets from early Bond films, the ever-present umbrella (put to new uses here) of The Avenger's John Steed, and the ultra-suave and debonair manners of Napoleon Solo from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. We get all of that in a surprisingly effective and fun action performance from Colin Firth.\n\nFun is the operative word here. It's clear all parties involved are having a great time, especially Mr Firth going drastically against type. There are two action-packed and pretty humorous (in a demented way) fight scenes. One is early on inside a London pub, and has Firth flashing his particular set of skills against a group of thugs. The other (and even more raucous) fight occurs inside a church and is set to Lynryd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\". The body count piled up as fast as the guitar licks.\n\nAs spectacular as the fight scenes are, the real fun here is in the characters. The old guard of the Kingsmen includes Firth as Galahad, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, and Michael Caine as Arthur. This long-standing group is one part international spy, one part Knights of the Round Table \u0085 and these gentlemen are extremely well trained and impeccably well dressed. When one of their agents dies on the job, the recruitment boot camp kicks into gear. Made up of a group of relative newcomers to the movie world, the two most interesting are Roxy (Sophie Cookson) and Eggsy (Taron Egerton). Adding to the intrigue, Eggsy is the son of a former Kingsmen, and has some skills that aren't initially apparent.\n\nOf course, what would a spy-tribute movie be without a colorful villain? Samuel L Jackson plays lispy megalomaniac Valentine, who has a quick gag reflex when it comes to violence. Fortunately his henchman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) is equipped with razor sharp leg prosthetics and some ultra-crazy fighting skills. We even see Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold \u0085 fans of the Mark Miller/Dave Gibbons graphic novel will appreciate the irony.\n\nFirth and Egerton play off each other quite well in the mentor-pupil relationship, and Egerton is clearly set up for the franchise sequels \u0085 as is his friend and fellow Kingsman, Ms. Cookson. For those who think the Daniel Craig Bond films are too dark and serious, this provides a flashback to lighter Bond fare (minus the misogyny). Many hot topics are touched on: class warfare, domestic abuse, racism, etc, but mostly this can be taken as a rollicking good time because \"it's not that kind of movie\". It does, however, remind us that \"manners make the man\"."

        "review_title": "A Spy film with no clich\u00e9s.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Immersive, entertaining, funny, well-acted but forgettable. Words I use to describe my experience with Kingsman.\n\nA spy movie that acknowledges the various tropes and clich\u00e9s often associated with the spy genre and then proceeds to break them with minimal effort and often a frenzy of laughter. As Samuel L. Jackson's character Richmond Valentine and Taron Egerton's Eggsy state, \"It's not that kind of a movie\". Which means no convoluted plots, impossibly smart heroes, wooden and expendable supporting characters or illogical situations (except a few).\n\nThe latest directorial/scriptwriting/production venture of Matthew Vaughn of X Men First Class and Days of Future Past fame. Sadly, unlike the aforementioned movies as well as Kick-Ass, Kingsman is not as memorable. It fails to find its footing and identity and at every step aspire to illicit the same laughter James Bond does and fails miserably.\n\nKingsman's overarching plot is one of its weaknesses. It's not particularly original and not well thought out either. So are many if the action sequences, but we'll get there later.\n\nValentine drives a hard bargain with a sensible speech. He compares human to a virus on the host, the nature. With the current trend of population growth, it can only lead to two outcomes. Either the host kills the virus or the virus kills the host. But in either case, humans die. Unless someone does something to change that. So, after earning billions, Valentine takes it upon himself to save the human species from extinction. To do so, Valentine proposes a biological weapon. Neurological waves emitted from the SIM card his company will give away for free that trigger the aggression centre of the brain in a bid for humans to kill one another and martyr themselves for the greater good. All the while keeping the influential and powerful safe to be a part of the new world.\n\nOn the surface it seems A-grade but on going deeper the logic starts to crumble.\n\nThe true strength lies in the interactions and relations of the characters. The on screen chemistry and the dialogues. They never failed to charm the audience and keep them drawn into the tale of Harry (Colin Firth), Eggsy and the Kingsman's race to save the world.\n\nThe movie does a fantastic job in being fresh. It outright breaks the various tropes and clich\u00e9s associated to it. The duration of the movie, I kept on applying the various tropes and clich\u00e9s to see where the movie would slip up. But sadly, when I walked out, I had a hateful respect towards the movie for being original and insulting my intelligence again and again. No obvious double crossers. The villain not missing the clue that Harry Hart is not a billionaire and instead somebody with a much bigger agenda than that of a billionaire.\n\nThe lead character, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) having a plot armor giving him a get out of situations free card. The movie outsmarts you at every step.\n\nExpanding more on the characters, the movie does an amazing job of handling its characters the movie took its time to build up the characters. While the movie focuses on Harry and Eggsy's relationship for the first half, it sets up other characters, another Kingsman Merlin (Mark Strong) as the cold test taker and Roxy (Sophie Cookson) the eventual latest initiate to the Kingsman so they can take control of the movie in the second half without it becoming too rushed, messy, unfamiliar or awkward.\n\nIn the opening scene of the movie, Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad and the rest of the Kingsman are interrogating a Middle Eastern terrorist in a fort in the Middle East. Obviously. The terrorist pulls the pin on the grenade Galahad missed and it costs Lancelot's (another Kingsman) life to save everyone. That Lancelot was Eggsy's father, thus the on screen time and relationship of Harry and Eggsy which led Eggsy to the test to replace the recently fallen Lancelot in a botched rescue mission in the mountains.\n\nIt would be a crime to not give a special mention to Samuel L.Jackson's performance as Valentine. He acts as the movie's primary villain as well as comic relief. He has a lisp, thinks big, and is a scaredy cat and a joy to watch, all the way till his last scene.\n\nJust like the movie does so many good things, it also has its flaws that sadly cannot be overlooked.\n\nThe action sequences were too long and illogical. The movie always tried to be something else, a sci-fi movie (a woman dodging bullets), too James Bond-sy, a martial arts/karate or Matrix style jumping around. They served no purpose other than 'oooohs' and 'aahhs' from the audience.\n\nAnother gripe that will detract from the experience is its heavy dependence on stereotypes. Eggsy, single child with abusive stepfather and no aim in life His mother, a victim of low self-esteem. People from Oxford and Cambridge being snobs. Boys being snobby and unfriendly.\n\nAll in all, though, Kingsman is one of the most well-paced spy films that has its moments and deserves a watch, well because it is fun and forgettable.\n\nRating: 3/4"

The movie is about a boy, and his name is Eggsy and it is about one Kingsman finds him because he's father was a former Kingsman and trains him to be a gentlemen spy. I am not going to spoil anything so I don't wanna say anything more. The action is great, the humor is good, the story is awesome and the directing was brilliant! The camera moves so amazing, it catches every action movements that no action movie have ever done like this. It is a movie so exited that my hands where really sweaty. There is some violent scenes but it is awesome. This movie is best on IMAX because there is some really cool scenes. Imagine the best James Bond movie and Men in Black put together to a small team with cool gadgets (and without aliens). Thats for me was almost a dream, and now we are here! This one is my favorite movie and I say that everybody should watch this movie. I highly recommend it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't help but deliver a positive review for this movie. After all, anyone with a sense of humor and an appreciation for R-rated comical violence would enjoy this. Director Matthew Vaughn - although he has few films to his name - shows his creative side with Kingsman. The story walks a fine, fragile line between controversial levels of violence and dark humor. Although Kingsman reaches its hands into both of these cookie jars, it manages to maintain that balance while preserving the story.\n\nThe screenplay is smartly written, and just creative enough to avoid the mundane features of the action genre. By establishing solid character development in several scenes, the audience is kept in the loop, never being conflicted as to whether or not a scene is meant to shock, humor, or please. Perhaps it is the talented casting of Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Mark Strong, and Samuel L. Jackson that makes the \"serious\" scenes serious. There is enough meaningful dialogue between Eggsy and Colin Firth's character that we find a comfortable area with the progression of the story, and are not at the mercy of mindless violence to hold our attention. Nonetheless, Kingsman offers abundant violence that, had creative and fast cinematography not been utilized, would have been nearly unbearable to watch.\n\nCrowd-pleasing, comical violence, and an intriguing premise make this movie a type of cross between any 007 film and Kill Bill. As such, any Quentin Tarantino fan will enjoy this movie for its stylistic scenes of excessive violence. It's not difficult at all to take this movie seriously; it doesn't rely on gore or sex. It's a refreshingly original type of fun, which is something that the action/comedy genre could use more of."

        "review_title": "A very good film....but...",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" is a very good film....exciting and heart-pounding throughout. However, it has a couple problems and you might want to think twice before watching it or letting your kids watch it.\n\nThe story is very much a reworking of the Jame Bond films...with a few major differences. Instead of one incredibly super agent working for the British secret service, this film is about an organization of men working for the British government as super spies. So, if they want to concentrate on different agents in upcoming films (such as in the third film), they can since it's not just about one guy. Also, while the agents are very sophisticated like Bond, they are more killing machines....with MASSIVE amounts of blood and gore. Oddly, Bond killed folks, mostly as a group in some exploding lair, but there was no blood and not nearly as much violence as you'd assume you'd see.\n\nThere are two main plots for this secret organization. The first one involves the recruitment of a new agent, Eggsy (Taron Egerton). Much of the movie concentrates on his training and, ultimately, his first mission. To me, this was the most interesting part of the movie. This leads to the mission...the second plot. A billionaire maniac, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) is planning something bloody and evil....and very genocidal. And, naturally, it's up to the two new recruits to go into action.\n\nFor the most part, I really liked the film aside from the incredible violence. It was smart, well written and well acted. But one scene really left me a bit turned off. Eggy's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Colin Firth) is in a church in Kentucky when suddenly it turns into a giant bloodbath and everyone is killed but this agent. What bothered me is that I think this scene was meant to celebrate this mass killing, as the church members were all extremists....ultra-right wingers who were filled with hate and prejudices. It made me uncomfortable that the film seemed to minimize the deaths of these idiots...idiots but human beings. Don't get me wrong, the deaths of many people wasn't necessarily the problem...as in the end something similar happens. Why is the later kill-fest not the same? Well those later killed were all involved in committing mass genocide. Is being politically incorrect (and a bunch of jerks) as bad as those who commit genocide? And, should we enjoy seeing people we dislike killed like this?\n\nOverall, a film I generally liked but one that you never should let kids watch or anyone who cannot handle the gore. Also, you may find yourself uncomfortable with that church murder scene. If it had been in an abortion clinic or meeting of any left-wing group, it would have been equally repellent to me...though from what I noticed in other reviews, it didn't bother a lot of the viewers."

This is Seth Rogen bad. People like Colin Firth should be ashamed allowing their name to be associated with garbage of this magnitude.\n\nThey try to trump up humor from exploding heads of people. They try to compensate lack of substance with excessive meaningless violence and gore. They try to compensate lack of quality humor with endless profanities.\n\nNone of the characters is really attractive except for Firth's and only to some extent.\n\nThis is for teenagers who use to watch all these horror movies with people cut to pieces and whatnot.\n\nCrap like this deserves minus 3 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie does not disappoint. Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, I mean seriously,how could you not have a good time in the cinemas watching this! The plot,although it had it's flaws,kept you entertained. Also,Taron Egerton delivered a great performance.\n\nThe movie is based upon a comic book series,and although it is a comic book based filmed,the action may seem over the top at points. Especially the church scene. Sometimes this \"over the top action\" movies are entertaining to watch,but this movie,in my opinion went to over the top. For instance,as I mentioned before,the church scene. It was not a necessary scene. Sure it was fun to see Colin Firth kick butt,but it didn't need to be as detailed and graphic as it was. But,this scene did not ruin the movie. Samuel L. Jackson played his role perfectly. I promise you,they could not have found a more perfect actor to play this role. He was funny and delivered a great performance. Colin Firth,as always,was great. Taron Egerton always had a great performance. It's always good to see some young good actors with potential.\n\nAll in all,this film was a great movie,great action,and great acting. I highly recommend this film to fans of Matthew Vaughen's past films. It definitely is a fun movie movie to watch at the cinemas with a box of popcorn."

        "review_title": "Devastating Fun",
        "review_detailed_main": "Matthew Vaughn is someone who clearly enjoys his work and you can see that in every inch of Kingsman: The Secret Service. This is a movie where you can see that entertainment and fun was always put ahead of everything else and as one would assume, this resulted in a film that is both entertaining and fun in a way that many action films don't seem to want to be anymore.\n\nOne thing that is quite refreshing is how this film never tries to be anything deeper than an action film. Earlier last year I saw The Raid 2 and although that film is far superior to this one it was somewhat irritating when it tried to be a much deeper tale that it was, an element which Kingsman doesn't suffer from. And a predominant chunk of the film's quality comes from how electrifying and ridiculous the film's action sequences are. The camera has incredible pace and Vaughn had the intelligence to maintain single, long, violently energetic shots during the most engrossing action scenes. And it can't be said enough how cool it is to see the cultured and clean Colin Firth beat the sh*t out of people.\n\nWhat makes the tone of the film so memorable is the constant knowledge that the film really doesn't give a crap about what makes sense or what is reasonable and how much it clearly wants you to know that. Every character in this film it basically a exaggerated caricature and they are all the more hilarious for it. The film embodies how clich\u00e9 it is and in a way it transcends clich\u00e9 all together because the audience has the constant knowledge that when something dumb happens, the film is laughing at itself just as much as the audience is.\n\nI have to say I was somewhat irritated when I heard people calling this movie 'original' as I feel that that is not only an insult to actually original films but insulting to this film itself. Because the true genius of the film is how much perspective it gives us on the action genre. Modern action movies seem to be trying far to hard to be edgy and what this film recognises is that it is far more important to be entertaining than different. It builds itself on the best clich\u00e9s that classic action has given us and cranked up the levels of ridiculousness to the point where you can't help but just smile your way through the film. It is so wonderfully giving and un-self- indulgent to it's audience which is why it is such a joy.\n\nIt is a film that is quite hard to criticise seeing as it already seems to be a sort of semi-parody of itself. I did have some problems with some of the characters specifically the female supporting character. When we are first introduced to her they display her as incredibly composed however in later scenes they make her into an incompetent damsel in distress just so that the male lead could act all heroic and comforting (something that seemed out of character for him as well.)\n\nOver all this movie achieves basically everything it set out to do. It's fun and thoroughly worth your time. I would never give it higher than an 8 though because it has no real depth to it at all (which is kind of the point of the movie I guess). Go see it!"

I really like the direct who also directed Kickass in Matthew Vaughn. I did come out of the theatre entertained so in some capacity the film achieved its goal but however there was unnecessary humour through the exploitation of teenage stereotypes which I did not find funny at all. This humour was just not for me, there was other people in the cinema which found stealing cars, saying \"Bruv\" hilarious so it did hit some level of the audience. The humour did take a good turn towards the end of the film which had good moments. The plot line and twists where actually really good some that audience would next expect. I really enjoyed the plot as It had a good story. The characters were semi-likable but not always that great in my opinion. Colin Furth was very good in the movie and so was the lead Taron Egerton but the Villain in Samuel Jackson just became really annoying by the end. But overall it was good cast and solid performances.\n\nI would really recommend this film to friends or family as it was entertaining, okay humour, good actions scenes, and good performances. However some of the humour may only be targeting certain people which could be a issue when the film releases to wider countries very soon. It was also one of the very few times that I have been to the cinema recently that it was near full so Kingsman is obviously doing something right.\n\nI would give the film a 7/10."

After getting in trouble with the police, Gary remembers an important number that he can ring at any time he needs it and after ringing this number he is released from prison and becomes friends with Harry Hart (Colin Firth) who is one of the heads of the Kingspan organisation. Harry gives Gary the opportunity to make something of himself and make his father proud of him by joining this secret organisation. but has Gary got what it takes to make him succeed?\n\nYeah I'm prepared to except that this was a little clich\u00e9d at the start; a young man has gone off the rails and needs a bit of direction in life, but the way that this aspect of the plot is developed is very well executed. You just can't beat a true gentleman actor like Colin Firth beating up a load of chavs and then returning to his unfinished pint of Guinness. It's wonderfully pompous, but also very insightful at the same time which is a very hard trick to pull off. We then witness a marine core training regime which again in the wrong hands could have come across as boring or dull, but again there is a requisite amount of fun injected in to proceedings, but then we're reminded of the seriousness of the requirements of the Kingspan Service. It works well because it shows the serious nature of the training, but also manages to make light of it at the appropriate moments.\n\nThe performances across the board are roundly good; Firth does a pompous uppity toff like no other, Caine is Caine and basically phones it in (although Caine phoning it in is still better than watching most other actors trying). Egerton is the star of this show who is an interesting actor - he can play the cockney chav well, but is also surprisingly effective outside of this clich\u00e9 - he kind of reminded me of Jack O'Connell. Again Geoff Bell is Geoff Bell and is a very much one note actor, but he plays that note very well and is excellent here.\n\nKingsman isn't an obvious and goofy spoof in the way that Johnny English, or Get Smart is (the eventual agents aren't bumbling or inept, but with Kingsman it has more subtle nods and winks to the genre and it was these subtle nods and winks that really had me laughing - the war room scene from Dr Strangelove and the obvious parody of The Spy Who Loved Me towards the end). This is where the film was at its strongest.\n\nThe only weak aspect of this film lay with Samuel L Jackson as a villain and the entire sub-plot; for starters as much as I like Samuel L Jackson as an actor I could not take to him as a villain here - he wasn't intimidating or funny and that stupid lisp started to get on my nerves after a while. Although his involvement in the story makes sense towards the end, it was a little bit dull for the majority of the running time leaving it up to the rest of the principal cast to keep things moving which thankfully they manage to do with relative ease.\n\nThankfully, more of this works than doesn't and it has enough set-pieces and action sequences to make this an enjoyable picture. Yes it's not entirely successful over its full 120 minutes running time, but it kept me laughing consistently and also had enough heart to it to make you care about the characters all round. Jolly good show!!"

The second half turned into a complete different movie.This movie is to the point it shouldn't have been released if what you call action is senseless shootings and exploding body parts are all over the screen. I totally forgot what was the point of this movie after the anal sex reference. Where is good writing and screen play for movies ?? This movie could have been a hit but it's a low brow waste of time for me or anyone who has common sense. that's what's missing now in America, common sense."

It is a very fun ride, completely enjoyable from start to finish, jam packed with great action sequences, sincere hilarity and outstanding characters.\n\nThe movie is very original, there truly is not, nor do I think there ever will be, a film quite like it. It's certainly a parody of the spy genre but in a very different way, it's not quite like Naked Gun or Austin Powers, it's more of a tribute to old fashioned spy films, like the Roger Moore Bonds.\n\nThe cast is fantastic, and as this is a Matthew Vaughn (easily one of the most talented directors in Hollywood) film, there are many actors in unexpected roles. Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson have never done anything like this before,. Firth is the slick, skillful super spy and Jackson is the main villain who also provides a lot of comic relief, you would not expect to see them in these roles, but they completely own them nonetheless.\n\nMatthew Vaughn also likes getting very small actors in the main role, and he made a great choice with Taron Egerton, a talented young actor who suited the role of Eggsy perfectly, and I hope to see more of him in the future. A hilarious, action packed breath of fresh air, Kingsman brought a smile to my face throughout and I am so happy a film this insane exists, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy.\n\nA spy organisation recruits a young man with little skill but a lot of promise, meanwhile, an evil genius plots to take over the world with a new smart phone.\n\nBest Performance: Colin Firth"

Although very different from Kick-ass (story wise) Matthew Vaughn does use his personalized style of stylized violence and epic explosive scenes. From watching the film it was very clear that this movie was made by the director of Kick ass. Similarly to Kick ass this movie takes a realistic look at an idea and puts it in a comical action movie which works extremely well.\n\nIn general this film is another look on the gentleman spy concept. The film plays with the idea of two people from different backgrounds united to defeat a common foe. Although I was not a fan of the loss of a main character I can see why this was done however I have no idea if this was included in the original comic that this film was based off.\n\nI would rate this film as an eight out of ten because it displays fantastic acting and film work."

It takes the Spy genre and makes it something that the audience can relate to. The film tics all the boxes on bigger than life issues with the world at stake, a super villain who's hand hovers over the detonation of it, and a group that acts above the law, with the good of the world at mind, to stop it.\n\nHowever, what makes this film truly a gem in the genre of Action/Comedy is the relationship between Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and the rest of the cast. He goes through the character arch of a young man trying to find his place in the world. He uses his surroundings to explain his failures, but when given the chance to prove himself he strives to make his mark.\n\nThe film does well to keep you entertained with a main character having a different perspective on an environment than the people he's with. The action is top notch with gadgets and fighting scenes. Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Kick Ass, Stardust) have scripted another outside of the box film that is clever and entertains.\n\nIf you're looking for a film that above all else entertains; and, is well written, with a good plot and strong characters take a try on Kingsman and watch how \"Manners Maketh Man\"."

The recent bond films have all been about action and no gadgets, but they have lost all the fun elements. Kingsman is the new bond and I do hope they bring out a sequel which is as good if not better.\n\nNow the bad..... well... I dunno. True its not one of the great films of all time.

Is it a comedy, is it a drama, action pic, etc? I'm not sure they knew.\n\nIn the end, it felt to me like it was lacking so much, and what was lacking they tried to make up for with over-the-top extras which didn't add to the movie in the slightest.\n\nYes, it was an \"R\" movie, but when the language ... seriously? It didn't add to the movie at all (took away from Jackson's character with me), and just was overbearing. Add to it the absolutely idiotic sex scene at the end (was she really that pathetic?) and it felt like they didn't know how to end it.\n\nThe comedic death sequences seemed extremely childish as well. Maybe they were aiming for a particular target audience ... but the \"R\" rating cuts down on the number of 15- and 16-year-olds in the theater.\n\nThe group I was with when I saw the movie all said the same thing - if you're going to have that over-the-top profanity and the gratuitous sex bits at the end, at least spend a moment or two reviewing it so that it adds to the movie and doesn't detract from it.\n\nWithout those, this would've been a much better flick in our opinion, worthy of the mid-8's. Instead, a solid 7 for us.\n\nJust my opinion in the end, though."

Make the villain a science fiction, black computer nerd billionaire -- a grown-up Urkel/Blankman if you will -- for the icing on the cake. Kingsman pushes all the right buttons for aficionados of 60s action/spy thrillers with all the up- to-date hilarity of Austin Powers. There's never a dull moment here.\n\nThis amazing film moves with the pacing of a Bond flick, and not without good reason. Political correctness spells doom for the Bond franchise as we know it, so this will be a series that can be milked for at least 20 sequels, and I will be sure to watch all of them.

        "review_detailed_main": "Manners. Maketh. Man. So says the dapperly-dressed secret agent Harry Hart (Colin Firth), right before he bars all exits and proceeds to glass, stab and maim an assortment of goons in that most British of locales, the pub. Kingsman, the latest film from Layer Cake (2004) and X-Men: First Class (2011) director Matthew Vaughn, and his second collaboration with comic-book writer Mark Millar (after 2010's Kick-Ass), is both completely preposterous and ridiculously entertaining, simultaneously mocking and paying homage to the traditional idea of Britishness in an ever-changing society, and no doubt infuriating many a Daily Mail reader in the process.\n\nHarry Hart, a Harry Palmer-like gent, is a Kingsman; a highly secretive and unaligned ring of spies and agents who dress sharply and certainly know their manners. After an operation to rescue Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill) from a possible kidnapping plot sees one Kingsman agent disposed of in a particularly gruesome fashion, Harry is tasked with finding a replacement to fill the spot. The son of a former agent who saved Harry's life years previously, Eggsy (Taron Egerton), is now growing up in a council flat with his layabout mother and abusive stepfather. After a joyride lands him in the police station, Eggsy calls the number on the back of a Kingsman medal given to him by Harry when he was a child, and he is bailed.\n\nHarry enters Eggsy into the trials to become a Kingsman agent along with a bunch of upper-class toffs who refer to Eggsy as a 'pleb'. The group of youngsters must perform a series of tasks under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong), involving escaping from a flooded room and shooting a dog in the head. Meanwhile, Harry investigates links from recent strange events to internet billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a flamboyant man with a lisp and a fondness for wearing caps indoors. whose upcoming deal to offer SIM cards with free calls and internet to everybody for free reeks of conspiracy and may be related to an incident involving an exploding head.\n\nWhen Harry and Valentine have their inevitable face-to-face sit-down moment, the two munch on Big Macs at Valentine's hideously decorated mansion while discussing the joys of the ludicrous Bond movies of old, when things weren't taken so seriously. Kingsman is an obvious Bond pastiche, with deadly gadgets, a henchman wielding an unconventional weapon (in this case - knives for feet), and an outrageous villain. It even comes as a surprise when Firth fails to raise an eyebrow while delivering a double entendre. It shows that these kinds of movies can still be fun without the shadow of uber- seriousness seen in the Daniel Craig Bond's and the recent Bourne movies lurking overhead, while telling the people who will be inevitably offended by the spurts of shocking violence to get a grip and remember that it's only a movie.\n\nHowever, it did little to prepare me for the movie's key set-piece, which involves a church in Kentucky inhabited by a group of bigoted, right-wing religious types - and Harry - indulge in what can only be described as a pub-brawl massacre. I have never witnessed a scene that would usually be portrayed as a tragedy executed with such glee, with Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird blaring out while men and women are stabbed, shot, bludgeoned, set on fire and, in one particularly grisly moment, get slammed into a wall so hard it snaps their spine in two. It seems to go on and on, but it's an absolutely thrilling moment stocked full of cartoon violence, and will no doubt making some viewers expecting a light and funny experience wholly uncomfortable in the process.\n\nIt's sadly not all great. Eggsy's recruitment and training is formulaic and none of the tasks are particularly original or clever. This period of the film also keeps Eggsy and Harry apart for most of it, when their few scenes crackle with chemistry. But ultimately, Kingsman is an intriguing experience. bending to generic tropes while seemingly playing by its own rules. Firth displays a comedic willingness rarely seen and Egerton, who has popped up from nowhere, is a real find as the swaggering Eggsy, a baseball-cap wearing yoof who calls people 'bruv', who in most actors hands would have come across as extremely annoying. Kingsman dabbles in enough extreme violence to cause most viewers to question what they really enjoy seeing on screen, and it's a throwback with a modern twist, celebrating the days when movies could be fun, inexplicable and inconsequential, Just don't watch it with your nan."

        "review_detailed_main": "We have got eight more months until we see Spectre, which we be Bond's next outing on the silver screen. If there in anything in these eight months that would entertain us while waiting, Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the closest to your calling.\n\nFive years ago, we got Kick-Ass, a spoof superhero movie that unleashed a new cinematic language. It was rather one of the most irresistibly entertaining films of the past few years. It's ultra-violent structure and bar-over-topping scale of profanity and humour proved that director Vaughn could be a genius at this stuff. The plot focuses on a teenager who decides to become a superhero. Basically for me, even though it isn't one of my favourite films of all time, the film feels like an instant classic.\n\nNewcomer Taron Egerton plays Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin, a cockney teen from London. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is a secret agent who works for Kingsman (a secret spy service similar to MI6) on a \"Diagon Alley\", like London street. He finds 'Eggsy' and recruits him to stop an evil mastermind, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). He wants to take over the world with an evil plan (the typical baddie plot, hey?). But before doing so, he needs to complete in a few life-risking tasks with other opponents (sounds familiar to you? Hunger Games? Divergent? Yes, most of the young adult books seem the same these days. Don't you agree?).\n\nMark Strong and Michael Caine play supporting roles alongside Firth in the service. Even Star Wars' Mark Hamill pops up (as a professor, not a Jedi in case you were wondering...) and clearly and obviously, at 63, looks different to how he looked four decades ago. Let's see how he revisits as Luke again in \"The Force Awakens\" this December.\n\nThe jokes arrive agreeably but not as quickly as I was expecting. The film deals with themes such as dysfunction families and bullying. These are serious issues so some ways it has a more mature nature than Vaughn's previous film (Kick-Ass). Vaughn's tone hasn't changed which is a relief. Even if it takes time to register, it's pretty funny stuff. Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman also throw in Bond references as well which add to the fun.\n\nThe lacking of ultra-violence is really the only disappointment. There's an overlong entertaining church fight sequence, and the climax at the finale is overblown (probably one of the biggest key references to Bond throughout the whole film). There's also a noticeably clich\u00e9d but really fun pub battle. Other than these, there's not a huge amount of action.\n\nYou can't help thinking that it might be a mirror image of Vaughn's previous film as it's done by the same director and writers. But after a while, you get used to the different structure of the film itself.\n\nCould Vaughn be an expert at spy movies? I can't answer this. It's a question only for you to answer. Myself, I consider it to be perhaps the best and most clever spy spoof since the Johnny English films. So my answer would be that he would not entirely be an expert at spy movies but one at these style of spoofs. Having done a superhero spoof in 2010 and a spy spoof in 2015, we'll have to see what handle he'll give us in another five years."

The film stars Taron Egerton as Eggsy, and Colin Firth as Harry Hart.\n\nThis film feels like an early James Bond flick, with all the wacky villains and plots one would expect from such a film. However, it really has modernized the message and approach, with extreme, if goofy, violence and lots of modern gadgets and goodies. There is a lot of charm in this film, and it makes me feel like a young boy again, watching flicks like Thunderbirds or Agent Cody Banks or Spy Kids.\n\nEven so, this is not a film for children. It just has that slight fantastical feel that many children's spy films are graced with.\n\nThere is a ton to enjoy in this film. The spy genre is done well, with intrigue, gadgetry, and Bond-esque suave/cool. The actors are superb, with Samuel L. Jackson making an appearance as a particularity interesting character. There was also good, taught emotional drive throughout the film. I was superbly impressed with this film.\n\nOn a minor note, the film did have some corny/kitschy elements which did not always work. There was one scene in particular near the beginning, in a log cabin, which I thought was a bit much. These scenes were relatively small in number, however, and did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film.\n\nThis movie was great, and deserves to be cherished as an excellent new addition to the spy genre. I look forward to more from all the actors involved, and especially Mr. Vaughn. I would love to see this become a James Bond style series of films as well.\n\nThis film is highly recommended.

        "review_detailed_main": "Kingsman: The Secret Service is directed by Matthew Vaughn and stars Taron Egerton as young Eggsy, a teenage street kid that is recruited by a spy organization, and must compete with other recruits in his class in order to become the next Kingsman, a gentleman like spy. Upon being recruited, he befriends an older Kingsman named Galahad, played by Colin Firth, that teaches him the ways of being a Kingsman, and, more importantly, being a gentleman.\n\nI actually didn't want to see this movie. I've never been too hot on espionage films, and wasn't looking forward to Kingsman. However, this movie proved me wrong in so many ways. I had an absolute blast watching Kingsman, and so regret not seeing it the theaters. Near everything about this film entertained me, and I was on the edge of my seat through every single action sequence. Kingsman was one of the few movies of recent years in which I had white knuckles through every single action scene, and even most of the talking scenes. Kingsman was an amazing movie, and had great aspects about it.\n\nThe best thing about Kingsman is the actors' portrayals of the characters. Prior to watching this movie, I doubted Colin Firth as an action hero, but he was fantastic as this gentleman spy. I read that he did 80% of his own stunts, and it really paid off. Taron Egerton was the highlight of this film. He displayed Eggsy's large character arc near perfectly, and delivered every single one of his lines believably. Samuel L. Jackson played a great villain, and was another great attribute that Kingsman had going for it. He pulled off the \"evil plan\" clich\u00e9, while also acknowledging that it was a clich\u00e9.\n\nThe direction by Matthew Vaughn was amazing as well. The way he manipulated the camera to film at varying speeds while weaving in between characters, mid fight, during the action sequences was excellent. He brought every scene to life so vibrantly that Kingsman sucks the audience in after watching it for only 5 minutes. All of the direction was great, and brought the film to new levels of expertise very quickly.\n\nThe score was the third thing that really pulled me into the scenes, particularly the suspenseful ones. Without going into too much detail, the parachute scene was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in recent years, and the music had a great part in it. All of the music throughout the entirety of Kingsman was astounding, and sucked me into the film so easily that I felt like I was there, in the film, rather than watching it.\n\nThe only problem I had with Kingsman was the ending. Not particularly how the film ended, but some subplots that weren't wrapped up like I had hoped they would've been. This is most likely due to the presence of a looming sequel (Kingsman: The Golden Circle coming in 2017), but I still would've preferred some closure with certain characters and stories that the film presented. Besides that, however, I loved Kingsman.\n\nOverall, Kingsman: The Secret Service was a great movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys action, espionage, or just good movies all around."

Could have Eggsy's part been better played by anyone else, may well have... Samuel L Jackson as a comic villain just about does an okay job. Initial fight scenes were classy, a touch of Tarantino I find there, the church scene was great, but the action sequences towards the end by Eggsy were more video-gamish, the CGI was pretty bad there. Overall still a treat to the eyes, I go with a 7/10, thoroughly entertained..."

A scene in which dozens of people's heads explode to Land of Hope and Glory, with fireworks thrown in was both a high point and pretty typical of the humour involved. If you would find that distasteful then watch something else. Otherwise... its great.\n\nAnd actually its really not that gory. Yes, people explode, are shot, sliced in half etc. but there is actually very, very little blood - so it is actually fantasy. The violence is cartoon violence. Think Tom & Jerry.\n\nBut leave that aside - the story is brilliant. As others have said, this is how James Bond SHOULD be. Gadgets and gizmos, jokes and one- liners, twinkles in the eye, good guys and bad. But it also undermines the type in so many fun ways.\n\nAll action, the near two hours flew by.\n\nI was left wanting more - but PLEASE let there be no sequel. No way a second film could be as good as this."

Jackson, Mark Strong and Michael Caine.\n\nThere are heaps of pop culture references throughout the film, the fight scenes are a cross between the 1960's TV show 'The Avengers' and Black Widow's fighting skills, hilariously funny and a lot more violent than I thought it was going to be (no complaints here!).\n\nI don't think I have one bad thing to say about this film and I could have easily turned back around and watched it again.\n\nI WILL be seeing this again when it's released in cinemas and it will 100% be a day one purchase, when it's released on Blu-ray!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Full court press with a British action thriller served up with a generous dollop of humor, this very successful film is based on the comic book 'The Secret Service' (writers Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons) and transformed into a screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughan \u2013 that guy responsible for 'Kick-Ass', X-Men: First Class', 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' 'Layer Cake', 'Stardust'.\n\nFor those of us who are not comic book fans or have not heard of the comic book on which this fantastic movie is based, the following is an explanation by Colin Firth's character in the script:' 'Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed the world's most powerful individuals. In 1919, a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I. That meant a lot of money going uninherited. And a lot of powerful men with the desire to preserve peace and protect life. Our founders realized that they could channel that wealth and influence for the greater good. And so began our adventure. An independent international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion. Without the politics and bureaucracy that undermine the intelligence of government-run spy organisations. A suit is the modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.'\n\nAnd that is only the explanation of the Kingsmen title. The film is blessed with a superb cast. The plot is all over the place and the action speaks louder than ideas of words. It tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Among the featured actors are Colin Firth as Galahad/Harry Hart, Michael Caine as Arthur, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, unrecognizable Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold, Sofia Boutella as the lower extremity enhance weapon Gazele who assists Samuel L. Jackson as super bad guy Valentine, Jonno Davies as Lee, and the very impressive new face hunk Taron Egerton as Eggsy. Cinematography is by George Richmond, and the musical score is by Henry Jackman, Matthew Margeson with a bow to Sir Edward Elgar. Great special effects and an ending to end all endings make this a full evening of pleasure."

        "review_detailed_main": "After his father is killed in the service of his country, \"Eggsy\" (Taron Egerton) lives with his mother and her low-class boyfriend with little opportunity for upward mobility. However, he still holds onto a locket given to him as a young boy with an advisement to call an inscribed number if he ever needs serious help. So, one day after fighting off some local bullies and being subsequently arrested for stealing the gang member's car, he makes the call. To his surprise, he is immediately released, and the charges are all dropped. It's then that he learns that his father was a member of a clandestine organization in the British government known as the \"Kingsman\" and he is encouraged to join. However, it isn't nearly as easy to graduate from the program as he would like, and he watches as the other people selected begin to drop out one by one. Meanwhile, a crazed billionaire by the name of \"Richmond Valentine\" (Samuel L. Jackson) who has come up with a plan to save the world from greenhouse gasses by killing almost all of the people who inhabit it. And with very few agents available to investigate, Eggsy is called upon to help out before everything and everyone is killed. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an interesting movie which raced from one exciting scene to the next in a very smooth manner. Unfortunately, the director (Matthew Vaughn) chose to take the low-road and utilized an over-abundance of vulgarity for the sake of some cheap laughs much too often. And most of it was simply unnecessary. In any event, this grew rather tiring after a while and seriously limited the movie's overall appeal. But even so, it was still entertaining to a certain degree, and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

        "review_detailed_main": "This easily blends the fast-paced and unbelievable action of a comic book film with the absurd, dry British wit of excellent veteran actor Colin Firth. He is Harry Hart code named Galahad, a member of a secret international espionage and intelligence organization called The Kingsman. He recruits Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a young 20 something petty criminal who's the son of a friend that died saving Galahad years before.\n\nEggsy is competing with other young recruits, most of them young people from British aristocratic families, for the spot to become the new Lancelot. At the same time, tech billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a strange lisp and Yankees hat) is plotting a dastardly world takeover with comic villain aplomb by kidnapping or recruiting wealthy aristocrats, politicians, and other people with spreading around money and influence to further his plot. A large part of that plot is the global distribution of free WiFi-enabled sim cards.\n\nThe Kingsman have the unique guise of posing as tailors to Britain and the world's wealthiest and influential people. They operate out of an enormous underground complex based out of an above ground tailor shop. They're independent of normal government oversight and restriction, having operated since the early 20th century shortly after WWI ended. \"We are the new knights,\" is how Galahad explains their mission to Eggsy shortly after his recruitment.\n\nMatthew Vaughan and comic book Mark Millar who previously worked together to bring Kick-Ass and Wanted to the big screen, once again collaborate with even better results than these previous films. This is easily Matthew Vaughan's best film since his British gangster film days. What really makes this film work so seamlessly though is the performance of Colin Firth, he's the perfect gentleman spy and he gives a perfect credibility to the all the gadgets, martial arts and intense action scenes."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is this a spoof? I can see why it's getting described this way, but Kingsman isn't really all that different from its James Bond source material. Yes, there's the occasional mocking reference to James Bond, but the overall effect is more a slightly cheekier James Bond clone than an actual spoof. It's also not more than mildly amusing.\n\nBut it is entertaining, mainly because of some terrific action scenes, some of which involve a woman amputee with swords instead of feet. These scenes are beautifully choreographed and often involve finding imaginative ways to knife and shoot people.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie is a little too in love with this stuff. At a certain point no amount of fancy choreography could distract me from the feeling that I had just seen something similar 15 minutes ago.\n\nThe story is a rather messy one involving an evil billionaire fought by a mysterious spy organization made up primarily of lookalike square-jawed upper-class white guys bravely considering hiring a lookalike square-jawed lower-class white guy or a square-jawed upper-class white woman (who isn't lookalike because there's no one in the movie for her to look like).\n\nI kept wondering if the movie would make some sort of comment on the archaic nature of the organization, but since it didn't one tends to assume that the makers see nothing wrong with a powerful, secretive organization of white preppy guys. It makes an interesting contrast with the only important black character being a terrible person.\n\nOutside of that, I didn't really think much about the politics of Kingsman, although reviews like The Guardian's point out that it's pretty right wing overall. But because the movie is about 10% reactionary politics and about 80% stabbing people in the eye (the other 10% is for male bonding and dog walking) it's easy to ignore all that.\n\nFor me, the issue with the movie is not its politics but it's inability to curtail its impulses. Watching a guy stylishly kill about a 100 people at once is pretty entertaining for about the first 25 people, and then feels like punishment. Cutting between a big action scene and a suspenseful high-altitude sequence sucks much of the pleasure out of both. The final battle's disco concept is clever but the flashy lights take away from the action.\n\nStill, Kingsman works more often than not, and while it's not consistently great, it has a decent mix of great and good moments and not that many bad ones. So overall, if you want mindless, violent action, this is worth watching."

It also has more than its fair share of violence (the odd use of the upbeat song \"Pomp and Circumstance\" in a particular scene is bizarrely unforgettable). Yet it still comes off as entertaining and enjoyable.\n\nLike the James Bond films (likely an influence), the gadgets and special effects add much to the entertainment value. Firth also brings along his dependable amount of class and talent especially in a scene when he must verbally defend his actions in a redneck, hate-filled church. Having Michael Caine in the cast is the icing on the cake."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kingsman is the first of many spy movies coming out this year (Mission Impossible, James Bond etc.) and it is pretty awesome. We have Colin Firth playing a smooth gentleman spy/killer and we've got Samuel L. Jackson playing a hilarious, weird villain. I mean, this is enough reason to go see this right?\n\nThe story is loosely based on a graphic novel so it's not entirely original, but it is definitely not any Marvel superhero movie. The story and plot are a little different than most movies, but it is still straightforward and fairly easy to understand. It is a really cool concept to; extremely proper, dressed up gentlemen spies/killers going out to stop this maniac of a villain from destroying the world. Speaking of the villain, this guy doesn't always seem like an obvious villain because sometimes you see his point. And he's very funny too; for example how he can't stand the sight of any violence. Kingsman is not only a gory action movie though, it also has plenty of good humor. So basically, the story is very humorous, genius and well paced, while the plot is different but still easy to understand.\n\nIn the acting category, this movie strives. Colin Firth is awesome and fits his role perfectly. Samuel L. Jackson is also perfect for his role as the villain; he really brings his character across as a hilarious dude, but also an evil maniac. And the main character is played by newcomer, Taron Egerton. Man is he great. He was funny, but also did some great action stunts. Literally, the casting guys on this movie nailed it.\n\nI loved the music on this movie as well. It had this really great theme, but in between, it also had some great pop music that really fit well with the action scenes. Now this isn't you're usual pop music that comes on the radio 1,000 times per day. No this is just fun lyric-less pop jams that help give the movie a humorous tone.\n\nCGI is another category that was present in this movie. Though a lot was done practically there were some visual effects in here as well. And most of it wasn't bad. But some of it was quite bad. A few of the shots were just so apparent that they were CGI, that it was almost cringe worthy. Other than that, the CGI wasn't bad, but it was far from perfect.\n\nAction was a big part of this movie so I will touch on that a little bit. First of all, it was very fun to watch. It was very stylized, with shaky camera movement and slow-mo. There were also a few shots that vaguely resembled some Matrix camera moves, which I loved. I was very pleased with the action and the way it was shot. That being said, this movie was extremely over the top especially the action. Some of it was unrealistically unrealistic. If that makes sense. But I love over the top action so it was great.\n\nIn the end, Kingsman was a fun spy action/comedy with great acting and a cool story. While some of it was not so great, it still delivered what it was supposed to."

A combination of bloody hardcore scenes, very funny parts and a little bit of dramatic situations made this masterpiece. Watch it and have very good time, trust me.\n\nWe all know the spectacular actor Colin Firth is, and watching playing this \"different\" role suited him perfectly. Personally I really liked the boy's performance, he could do well in his next projects, he really nailed it with this one.\n\n(Sorry my English)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a fan of spy films and an addict of Bond films. Must have watched each Bond film multiple times. However, I also like the good old spy films like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\n\nBasically, spy films according to me are of two types - the Bond type and the non Bond type. Bond type is where the plot is thin as a wafer and there are fast cars, gadgets, comic book villains, big action set pieces and sexy women.\n\nThe non Bond type is exactly opposite of the above. Solid story minus the glamour.\n\nMatthew Vaughn just turns the tables. He and his writers create an excellent and delicious cocktail of the above types that left me high for a long while.\n\nSo like Bond films there is a comic book villain (played deliciously by Samuel L Jackson), a bit ridiculous plot, some cool gadgets, good action sequences and a couple of hot women which includes a villain's henchwoman who has blade feet and cuts people apart literally.\n\nIt also has the story of who are Kingsman, an independent spy agency and how time on time have saved the world from crisis. Kingsman can be looked as a coming age of film of a young man who is wasting his life who turns into a spy and gets meaning and purpose.\n\nSo you have the writers who spoof Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer and all the major spy movies we have seen till date. However, its not like Austin Powers and Johnny English which were out and out spoofs. Here Vaughan ensures that things are in control.\n\nIt also helps that he gets in a good bunch of actors to play key roles. What attracted me to this film was Colin Firth playing the role of a spy and doing action sequences. Frankly, Firth is a marvelous actor but never seem his doing an action film. After watching Kingsman, I say man please do some more action films because Firth is a pretty decent action hero. Check out the pub and church scene.\n\nEgerton is also a star to watch out for in the future. He is talented and nicely plays the part of young drifter who turns into a good spy. Jackson is brilliant as usual and Strong does a commendable job.\n\nHowever, the only thing I didn't like abt the film is the blood shed. Well, killing people with guns and bombs in fine. But here Vaughan is very inspired from Tarantino's work. So there is lot of blood spilled and the church scene is a classic case.\n\nIf you are someone who doesn't like blood and gore stay away. However, if you love spy films and don't mind the blood spill...you'll enjoy Kingsman. I hope there is a sequel for it."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's easy to create an action movie based on big guns, big men screaming, and big name actors. Not this movie. This movie had a style all of its own. It was fresh, fun, and exhilarating. Something that this movie does differently than other action films is actually use the camera in its advantage. Instead of having the camera be something to put on a tripod while waiting for the special effects to happen, the camera is used to portray fluid motion. You can see every punch, gunshot, and stab easily; and the camera compliments them perfectly. If I were to complain about something, it would be the characters. I feel that the characters weren't anything special, and they all seemed to be the same person played by a different actor. However, that doesn't necessarily matter, for what they lack in characters, they succeed in a surprisingly interesting story. The antagonist wasn't the run-of-the-mill mad man who wants to take over the world: the antagonist had solid reasons for what he's doing, and the film explains it fairly well.\n\nEssentially, this was a very fun movie, and I highly suggest it if you're in the mood for a brand new type of action movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "You come away from \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" a little breathless, but more-so down to its bounding energy and sheer brashness than because you feel you have just seen a great film. For sure, the film is a colourful, kinetic experience; a series of brutal body blows which pulls you left; right and centre - across genres and through homages, but that did not stop me from feeling pleased that it was all over when it was.\n\nIn spite of whatever \"Kingsman\" does well - the good choreography; the want to see the characters make it through their odds; the amusing villain - there is an annoying feeling of puerility to the film, or of immaturity. When Matthew Vaughn released \"Kick-Ass\" in 2010, the cover of a popular British film magazine depicted one of the characters in full superhero garb and the headline 'Say Hello to Your New Favourite Film', and there is that same aggravating, even adolescent, sense with \"Kingsman\". It is difficult to put into words, but I am sure you know what I mean - the film is far from being your typical brain-dead blockbuster, and one cannot fault its ambition, but it lacks a certain nuance or sense of subtlety.\n\nThe film tells the double-stranded tale of a young London lad getting out of one world and into another alongside a suave veteran of espionage who senses his time is coming to an end as comrades die around him and world threats seem to intensify. Colin Firth plays said veteran: a secret agent by the name of Harry Hart, who operates as Galahad in an all-action British governmental group running in covert operations - try to imagine James Bond's 'Double O' section on steroids.\n\nParallel to him is the story of Taron Egerton's character Gary, colloquially referred to as 'Eggsy', whose father was part of the same eponymous secret service group Galahad is in until he was killed in action some twenty years ago. Raised fatherless, both he and his mother have since fallen on harder times and Gary, now in his early twenties, finds himself occupying a flat in a seedy part of London whilst periodically falling out with his mother's sociopathic new boyfriend and dodging potentially fatal gang warfare.\n\nGary and Galahad's worlds collide when the latter loses yet another agent during a mission in snowy Argentina, wherein a scientist specialising in global warming has been kidnapped and a rescue attempt is botched. Galahad's boss, played by Michael Caine, is losing patience: this particular agent, discovered and groomed by Galahad himself, did not live up to expectations. Gary, meanwhile, is living on even less borrowed time and comes into contact with Firth's character through some relatively convoluted means in order to begin, in true \"Men in Black\" style, his inception into the universe of this elite secret agency.\n\nProviding energy to the piece is Samuel L. Jackson's wonderful villain Richmond Valentine; a politician hating eco-terrorist with a speech impediment who has made his name operating in the technology industry and flinches at the sight of blood. He has his henchwoman, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), take care of the more murderous side of being a super villain - think a more nubile version of Richard Kiel's Jaws character, but with legs and feet replacing teeth...\n\nWe have seen films like \"Kingsman\" before, and we have previously enjoyed narratives similar to what is depicted therein, but Vaughn is canny enough to construct the experience in such a way that has us feel like this is our first time. The film is not manipulative in this respect, but it is brash. As was the case with \"Kick-Ass\", it takes absolutely no interest in whether or not it is offending you or even wearing you down - like it or not, this is the route it's taking. Through whatever means, the film manages to balance both revisionism and convention into a congealed, post-modernist package.\n\nThe way the film eventually comes to fuse the execution of a dastardly plan Valentine is hatching; Gary undergoing his training and the Kingsman agency uncovering a series of strange occurrences around the world of army militias conspicuously turning on themselves is satisfying. Midway through, Vaughn plummets us headfirst into a steadycam sequence of one of these militias fighting one another in what is a quite striking scene outlining in equal measure both precisely what is at stake should our heroes fail and that the makers of the film have an eye for raw flair and constructive carnage.\n\nDespite being an incredibly striking film, this sequence to one side, I am unsure as to whether \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" amounts to much more than a well-made actioner with a familiar tale of a farmhand leaving behind his domestic set-up for world-saving greatness. It deals, mostly, in stereotypes: the fascist American southerners; the suave Westminster Londoner; the Scandinavian blonde and the Millwall Football Club yobs. Meanwhile, you get the feeling there was meant to be a message embedded in the film somewhere to do with the danger of phone/tablet technology, and what it is turning people into, but it gets a little lost.\n\nIrrespective, there is enough in \"Kingsman\" to recommend it - it executes what it wants to do with a certain unbridled brazenness and does what it wants with a level of enthusiasm where many other action films too often feel like they are going through the motions. This is not the case here."

Sam l Jackson Colin Firth and Mark Strong have had lengthy and great film careers and create an all-star cast.

Jackson is the opposition who has a half- baked plan to end global warming. He is protected by a prosthetic wearing hench-woman who is a stand out in the film. You will find yourself thinking, \"I didn't expect her to do that!\"\n\nEggsy is instantly likable protagonist. At first glance he is a misguided teen; but extremely loyal to his friends, little sibling, and mum. It is the loyalty quality and another underdeveloped talent (gymnastics) that make Eggsy an excellent candidate for the Kingsmen. Thanks to the same Kingsmen (Colin Firth) who gave Eggsy's father a chance years earlier, Eggsy jumps at the opportunity to try to become one. The transformation from thug being raised by his 'emotionally lost' mum and her nasty boyfriend to a debonair secret agent is completed through humor, teamwork, trust building, high tech gadgets, and loads of violent choreographed action. A must see!"

The trailer seemed boring, so I was not expecting much, but the first ten minutes was great and it set the tone for the rest of the film. What I truly loved about this is even though its a spy movie, it still had fresh, original characters with great personalities, mainly Valentine. The plot is great and the events are played out so well, even though anybody could think of this plot. But it is the action sequence and dialog that makes this film a memorable one. Its truly British so it was great to finally see a culture other than American, especially one as charming as the Brits. Kudos to the director for this amazing work. I am not sure why it got an R rating though, the blood and gore seemed okay to me, not over the top but still so very good. I was pleased to see fresh faces and Samuel L. Jackson playing a chill role. The biggest surprise was Colin Firth, I never knew he could kick so much ass ! I am never going to forget his role. Finally, the best thing about the movie is the absence of over the top explosions. The 'big' scenes are all hand on hand combat (with appropriate gear) and it was fantastic ! I have never felt more alive or joyous to see people get brutally killed and have their limbs hacked off or their brains splattered out as I did in this film. Maybe its how the Brits do it, but for the first time, I didn't see the badass girl wearing skintight clothes that barely cover anything or having a supermodel pose throughout the film... the girl with the legs was a complete badass and I am in love. Its a great film that you will enjoy."

I think it's that mix that actually made the movie so fun.\n\nSo if you're offended by a little ridiculous violence or strongly believe that movies strictly need to fall into binary of serious or comical, then perhaps it's not for you.

The film has plenty of action, great fight scenes,Firth is excellent. The story does start to fall apart a bit around the last half hour of the movie , it was like the script writers tried to inject a lot of humour and they ended up overdoing it. The main villain I thought was weak,and the movie does suffer to an extent for these reasons. Still, kingsman is enjoyable if you don't mind over the top action, and if you just take it for what it is, you'll like it."

Not a must see or avoid at all costs, average = worth watching when you've nothing better to do for a couple of hours."

It's a James Bond satire with comic book flair and an overwhelming amount of British hooliganism that made us love flicks like \"Attack the Block.\" This movie is near perfect and I can't stress enough how much you'll love a mashing of spy movie, comic book movie, camp movie, Tarantinoishness, zombie movie (hello, church scene) and flat out action. I wish this came out 10 years ago... not bc I've waited to long, but so my crush on Eggsy would be more appropriate..."

Nothing went wrong. First of all this movie kinda proves you can do action scenes/movies without exploding everything and anything. Second of all plot of the movie is extremely tasty. It is not like your original bad guy is trying to do evil with evil means. Samuel Jackson's bad guy gives you mixed feelings. It is like you love to hate him or hate to love him kinda situation. Movie shows extremely diplomatic action on hand like dinner table conversations and convincing people are worth more than removing them from the game. My other compliment is for Mark Strong fans. We all seen him as convincing voiced bad guy but Mark Strong keeps rising from that streotype to charming mentor/voice of guiandince all the time. As for action scenes, man i haven't had fun since my early childhood Jackie Chan movie this much. Well coordinated little absurd also you gotta love the songs running on the background. All actors executed their roles superbly even though in some scenes you can feel they are not really into it.\n\nThis movie in not a generic spy movie. Yes we get that fancy futuristic toys/tech impossible moves and all but this movie is simply showing us hope. Hope that movie industry can evolve and hope that someday our kids gonna have a tasteful movies to watch"

I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this \"getting out of hand\", being unrealistic/over the top.\n\nBut that's it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it's always on some other level \"flying\" around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.\n\nIf you can deal with that and don't mind this being \"British\" to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you'll enjoy this. After an initial resentment against the young lead here, I grew to really like him. A very good achievement. Also hearing Samuel L. Jackson lisp - just amazing"

Also, it's revealed that the British Royal Family (the list says all their names) accept the villain's plan. Just...think about that during the implant scene near the end. On the whole, it is a perfect subversion of spy movies and gentleman spies, but those with a weak stomach might not like the church scenes or the ending."

A great film, it out bonded Bond by a long way. I don't want to go into the usual over the top orgasmic reviews, some of you should certainly get out more. I cant find much to criticise, the plot of course, is as usual for the genre, totally implausible with more holes than a colander full of colanders, but ..............that is par for the course. Plausible plots in spy films haven't risen their heads since Harry Palmer and too much reality in films is hardly ever good for the box office."

        "review_detailed_main": "Expect cheeky man whore spies and equally convoluted spy movie clich\u00e9s? Kingsman: The Secret Service is not that type of spy movie.\n\nSlated for an American release in February amongst the lame romantic comedies and other dud-like films released in the dead of winter, Kingsman: The Secret Service shocks all by being quite a great movie.\n\nKingsman is the name of the super secret espionage agency that polices the world and England in anonymity and without recognition. Only the most intellectual, moralistic, and talented are able to join this selectively reputable group. And, of course you must be invited and pass their highly competitive and rigorous training program. For this year's recruits, Galahad (played by Colin Firth) chooses Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a rough around the edges hooligan with promise, to represent him amidst the rest of spy- hopefuls. Meanwhile a new 'bad guy' is ready to unleash his evil twisted plan and effectively destroy the world.\n\nWe've all seen a spy movie, and if you haven't, you just simply must let me know where you found your rock. Gone are the tactical plot points and character archetypes, and instead Kingsman: The Secret Service is a refreshingly good, novel and entertaining film. The plot is linear, unlike most spy movies of recent time, and it makes for a very clean and captivating film.\n\nWhat is a spy movie without a protagonist, villain and killer action scenes? Colin Firth makes for the quintessential 'seasoned' spy while Taron Egerton makes for the perfect 'cheeky' anti-hero. Both have amazing chemistry and play well off one another while being engaging enough to continue garnering the audience's attention during solo scenes.\n\nAnd now, for the action. At first I thought Colin Firth had somehow managed to nonchalantly steal the award for best fight scene in an espionage film and then Taron Egerton showed up, a secondary dark horse in the running. The fight coordination is fast, concise and without flourish but stylized for a flare seemingly unique to Kingsman: The Secret Service.\n\nAdmittedly, I was on the fence about this film going in. The trailer looked sick, and Colin Firth has never known to make a heinous misstep\u0085but a spy movie in February that was more superficial and light than its dark and edgy peers? I was happily proved wrong, if you will, and Kingsman: The Secret Service is sure to entertain. I just hope there is a sequel/prequel.\n\nPlease check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

(Sidenote: it's great to see Egerton is getting more and more roles now like Johnny in Sing or Elton 'Hercules' John in Rocketman) The action is brilliantly shot and edited, Sam Jackson plays a great villain and Sofia Boutella a great evil assistant. All in all, this film is FUNNY with GREAT ACTION and AWESOME ACTORS/ACTRESSES! I can't begin to explain my sheer love for this film, so if you want to know why, check out this 2015 masterpiece."

The brilliance of the movie rests in the hands of the writers and their tongue in cheek jokes poking fun at the James Bond franchise, as well as American culture, it's nothing short of amazing. They basically were saying that can do everything the Americans can do (action/over the top fighting), but also while maintaining a high level of sophistication while doing so.\n\nThat being said, the action in the movie looked pretty great, lots of fluid/continuous action shots with some nice choreography. Surprisingly, almost all of the great action choreography comes from the Colin Firth's character! And of course like any spy movie out there, there need to be cool gadgets for our heroes, and Kingsman is no different. Everything in this movie is 'cool', from their clothing to their weapons (bulletproof suits, bulletproof umbrellas, grenade lighters), the Kingsman are basically the new James Bond.\n\nIn the end, the movie knows exactly what is is trying to do, poke fun at classic spy thrillers while at the same time maintaining a new hip attitude, something today's younger generation would appreciate. And this is not your typical mind-numbing action thriller either, though not terribly original, Kingsman has a certain amount of style and flair to make it something special (that something special might be its political commentary). Kingsman is sure to be one of the best action movies of the year, no question about it!"

And it includes a spy academy section where recruits perform bizarre and impossible feats.\n\nBut not all spoofs are equal. This one is a bit mashed together, ranging from James Bond references (with Colin Firth playing that kind of spy in a suit) to kids being kids (racing cars around or taunting each other like they are in high school). There is a plot, for sure, and Samuel Jackson plays a quirky bad guy with a lisp out to ruin the world via everyone's cell phones.\n\nThings never get slow. Fight scenes are over the top improbable, not in the Jason Bourne way where skill prevails, nor even the James Bond way where cleverness and a couple of gadgets comes to play, but a combination of these with entertaining excess. One woman on prosthetic legs manages to leap, fly, and cut people in half with gymnastic (c.g.i.) aplomb.\n\nThe principle character is one of the recruits, played by young British actor Taron Egerton, and for me he lacks screen presence. But we are meant to relate to him, for sure, a troubled kid with immense talent who gets a chance to fix his life by becoming a super spy. OK overall.\n\nBottom line\u2014a great fun movie for people who already like spy movies. I'd compare it to \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" but that movie is far better than this one\u2014funnier, better effects, better spoof referencing. \"Kingsman\" has lots of clever twists, so give it a go. But you might have a feeling along the way that it's all kind of \"stupid\" and a little disappointing. And you might give the parallel, zanier \"Spy\" a serious (and non- sexist) try...I liked it a lot."

        "review_detailed_main": "My brother had told me about this a month or two before it was to come out and I watched the trailer and found myself really looking forward to the film. I love action films and the fact that my brother had described it as \"Alex Rider but better\" set my hopes pretty high and I was not disappointed.\n\nMatthew Vaughn is a great director and it is an unspoken rule in my house that if \"Stardust\" is on TV, we must watch it and I also loved \"Kick Ass\". This film had the slight gore of the latter, which is fine by me since I've always watched films like that, and the characters and aspects that don't turn out to be how they look on the surface. In my opinion, the perfect balance has been achieved between comedy, violence, action and even tragedy/seriousness. The actors used are amazing in their parts and it is a star studded cast of Michael Cain, Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson and Mark Strong but I think that Taron Egerton gives an amazing film debut performance.\n\nI've read some reviews where it has been described as \"laddish\" and brash but what else can you expect from a 15 rated spy film based on teenager from South London? In fact, Eggsy's contrast to the typical gentleman spy is what makes this film so good. We need more films that are like this one and push boundaries on the genres that we are used to.\n\nI came out of the cinema desperate to talk about it with my friends but none of them have seen it so I will have to think about how good it is by myself. It is also the first film that I have come out of cinema desperate to actually buy a copy of the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "After successfully dipping his toe in mainstream-friendly fare with X-Men: First Class, exuberant filmmaker Matthew Vaughn returns to non-PC mode with a subversive and sardonic flick that does for the spy genre what Kick-Ass did for the superhero genre. Attempting to deliver a genuinely great espionage flick whilst simultaneously parodying the genre it belongs to, the key to victory for Kingsman is its impeccable balancing of tones. Although Vaughn's arrogant gusto \u2013 displayed from the opening shot as we zoom up to an exploding Middle Eastern mansion \u2013 is a major contributor to the high level of entertainment on offer, the praise must be shared with regular screen writing collaborator Jane Goldman. The pair not only dish up witty, foul-mouthed banter and regular, cheeky movie references, but they also unleash gleefully irreverent commentary on subjects ranging from Westboro Church-style religious extremism to the ridiculous behaviour of the one-percenters. Even the action is hilarious. Vaughn designs his set pieces with equal parts flair and brutality; the violence is cartoonish yet graphic, the choreography is over-the-top yet exhilarating and a church-set rampage is one of the most downright awesome action sequences of recent times. The contrasts don't stop there either. Colin Firth is calm, cool and collected as gentleman spy Harry Hart and Mark Strong is unflappably controlled as fellow agent Merlin, whilst at the other end of the spectrum British youngster Taron Egerton is brash and self-assured as Firth's apprentice Eggsy and Samuel L. Jackson is in colourful lampooning form as megalomaniac Valentine. There are a few flaws that will irk those who don't appreciate Vaughn's cocksure direction, but with such inventive ultra-violent action, a rip-roaring soundtrack and adult humour aplenty, Kingsman is a big-screen delight."

Surprisingly there were also some elements from the one TV show that Ian Fleming did. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. in the 1960s was originally titled Ian Fleming's Man form U.N.C.L.E.\n\nWhere the movie fails is the level of violence. Scenes showing necessary violence to advance the plot go on much too long.\n\nColin Firth was great as a classic Ian Fleming style agent. He would have made a great James Bond. Taron Egerton is excellent as a young man Firth mentors.\n\nMark Strong who has a \"Q\" like roll and Michael Caine who plays the \"M\" like role in the movie are also excellent.\n\nIf you like James Bond or the Man from U.N.C.L.E you should like this movie."

The script is well written, so tight and connected ... complicated yet so easily understandable. when you see the Genre is \"Action | Adventure | Comedy | Crime\" well it is literally all of that combined and each has it's tangible Obvious part in the movie. Didn't have so much Fun and Excitement like this in ages !!! The first fight scene is amazing... the scene of the church fight is spot on ... the last fight of Eggsy my goodness, indescribable. Eggsy's facial expressions were priceless.\n\nOut to the cinematography and visual effects .. Just WOW ,, the video game camera like !!! new and successfully used ,, the Slow- Motion scenes were PeRfEcT,, i honestly only saw something like it in Sherlock Holmes movies fight scenes and as one would think it would make the movie slow and boring .. Gosh it made it look Original and even more precision and perfection,,, even the soundtracks and SoundMix... In the last couple of scenes my god they're brilliantly genius.\n\nAs for the Cast ,,, Bravo... So many Names ,, didn't see that much of names since .. i don't know !!! Ocean's thirteen movie !! ;) and every and each one of them done his performance in a wholeness . Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Michael Caine, Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp :D !! Oooh you can clearly see how the Production invested so much in this movie ,, 20thC Fox, MARV, a Cloudy thank you for paying whatever you payed to make this movie happen :D\n\nand sure not forgetting the new talent, Taron Egerton , who's not gonna stop counting awards this year for this role ,, and who knows !! maybe he's gonna become the new British version of Josh Hutcherson, He kinda even looks like him a bit :D\n\nOverall,,,Hold on to your Manners and stop reading reviews like yesterday, and go watch the Movie like A Gentleman because As a Good Friend Once Said Manners Maketh Man. ;)"

This one sentence explains everything you need to know about Kingsman; a gloriously over the top tribute, that takes huge risks due to its audacious attitude, and thankfully the risks pay off. From the director who made an 13 year old girl say THAT word in Kick Ass, it's not surprising that Kingsman is just as foul-mouthed and ultra-violent. With Vaughn's signature style of a comic book look and feel, he cranks up the coolness factor and puts you right in the middle of the action from start to finish. Vaughn directs with such enthusiasm and skill, it's hard not to love anything he does. Colin Firth is superb as the well groomed but deadly Harry Hart. He sheds his stiff, British exterior and embraces his new role, clearly having the time of his life. Firth's chemistry with Egerton is that of a father/son relationship and is truly lovely to watch. Taron Egerton is absolutely brilliant as the teen hooligan Eggsy. With his cheeky accent and potty mouth, he's perfectly cast and cements himself as a promising newcomer of 2015. Kingsman not only looks good, but is hugely entertaining, stylishly written, obscenely filthy, extremely funny and brilliantly British.\n\nPlease vote for me (Jordan Thornell) in Vue Cinema's film critic comp on their website!!!"

I never had him pictured as an action hero but he pulls it off brilliantly!\n\nThe film is just plain enjoyable... It takes all the greatest Bond Movie Tropes and turns them into a thoroughly entertaining movie... While at the same time throwing a lot of real life questions into the mix... Not going to go too much into that as it would spoil the movie.\n\nSo for an Excellent Movie - Why only a 7?\n\nWell, yeah there are bad points and here its the old classic of Shaky Cam... I can forgive it as this was 2014 and this was pretty much a staple of most movies back then, but it makes fight scenes very hard to follow.\n\nThe action IS enjoyable, but also somewhat too chaotic at times...\n\nAnd some of the editing is DEPLORABLE!!! Why have 3 cuts when you can have 15?\n\nNo Seriously!!! Some of the action scenes cut between two different scenes up to 15 TIMES!!! The Church scene cuts between Samuel L. Jackson and the main fight over and over and over... And to be honest there is just no need for it!\n\nWith that said, its a brilliantly written comedy, and has a reasonably good pace... A must see if I am honest."

Instead of seeing an experienced spy, it was a much younger group of new recruits who would go through training to become the one of the experienced elite ones. It was cool to see the beginning times for an agent in the secret service.\n\nEggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is one of the young recruits for the Kingsman Secret Service. His father was a former spy for the Kingsman, but he was killed during a mission that went wrong. Eggsy was recruited by his father's partner Harry Hart, played by Colin Firth. Hart felt obligated to look after Eggsy because of his father's death.\n\nThe training challenges were pretty intense and demanding. They were fast paced and rapidly built to high suspense. The fighting choreography was extremely innovative by mixing in parkour throughout the scenes.\n\nOverall, this movie surpassed any expectations I had for it based on what was shown in the previews."

Megabucks have clearly been spent on the fight scenes and CGI. Colin Firth and Mark Strong are visibly enjoying letting their hair down (Mark of course is bald), although Michael Caine looks as if he's uncomfortable slumming (not for the first time, Michael: we haven't forgotten Jaws 3D, hardly your finest hour).\n\nTaron Egerton, more Bourne than Bond, appears to have been cloned from Daniel Craig. Samuel L. Jackson's lisping zillionaire philanthropist and would-be world dominator Valentine is presumably spoofing Javier Basrdem in SKYFALL. Valentine's female sidekick runs on Pistorius-like blades that are more lethal than Oddjob's bowler hat, of fond recall.\n\nThe death toll is like a war movie. The level of violence and the f-word quotient are probably way too high, but KINGSMAN is firmly pitched at the teenager in all of us; it certainly found the teenager in me and my companion, both of us clearly not kids but more clearly still kids at heart."

The movie's plot and screening seems so stupid that the director would have been better off creating a spoof for a James Bond type movie instead. Anyway such movies always get made, but what I am most disappointed about is the fact that the IMDb reviews & ratings were completely rigged. IMDb you need to watch out for such flaws in your feedback system 'cos that will bring down the rating of your service in process. My suggestion if you are really really still interested in watching this movie then wait for a couple of week and it should be on TV for a free time pass."

First we get some back story, a brief introduction to the Kingsman and how they kick-ass while wearing a suit (totally useless in real life fights, with all ties that can be pulled and pants that prevent any high kicking, but extremely awesome in movie fights). Than we meet Eggsy, a down on his luck kid that shows a hidden potential, and how he wants to turn his life around. He gets chosen and bam! Training. I just love training scenes. From Jackie Chan doing sit-ups upside down or Luke carrying Yoda (Mark Hamill is on this movie), give a few good training scenes and I know the master is a bad-ass and the student will become a bad-ass.\n\nThis film wouldn't work if we didn't connect with Eggsy, but Taron Egerton does a fine job. Not only him, but Colin Firth is great as the \"Mr. Miyagi\". I've never seen him as an action hero, but he takes part in the best fight scenes in recent memory. Part of the credit though goes to Matthew Vaughn and his great directing. The way he plays with the camera, not using all that \"shaky cam\" that is all the rage these days, but actually immersing the audience and showing the important parts makes the punches all the more enjoyable.\n\nAlso, Kudos for Samuel L. Jackson for the role of the megalomaniac villain, and all the supporting cast like Mark Strong.\n\nAnd last, but not least, the story is amazing. The script is simple in the beginning, with the underdog story we all know and love. There is nothing wrong with going for the known archetypes, you just have to do it well. And this movie nails it, while also creating something new. The ending of this movie is just delightfully surprising. A great way of twisting the spy genre.\n\nAll in all, a great movie experience. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "A lisp speaking billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine poses this question to a gentleman-spy Harry Hart, currently in disguise; which results in the smartest and funnest conversation you will see this year. From every frame of this film the love for old espionage and old James Bond films is tangible and mostly it is in this scene where the protagonist and and the antagonist of this film profess their mutual love of \"far-fetched theatrical plots\". Also a point is raised that the adventures were as good as the villain. The love for making films, having fun and letting yourself loose in the whirl of ideas can be felt throughout the whole film.\n\nThe strength of any film is to have rightly cast actors. Taron Egerton, the most important piece of the puzzle, is the most promising talent to appear in the film since Jack O'Connel in Starred Up. He is charming, witty and just straight-up lovable. If the audience would not like him or sympathize with him the film would fail. Luckily, that is not the case. Colin Firth's talent is finally being used in the proper way. I finally started to enjoy Firth as an actor in last year's Woody Allen's Magic in the Moonlight and here he plays completely against type. The idea behind his casting was \u2013 \u0084Who is the least likely people would imagine as a spy?\" Colin Firth is delivers the performance of his life as the typical British gentleman with incredible fighting skills. Mark Strong is fun and entertaining as ever, this time differing himself with a Scottish accent. Samuel L. Jackson is the funniest and funnest villain you have seen in a long time. Matthew Vaughn decided to turn the villain formula on its head and Jackson spiced things up with a speech pattern, which results in the most ridiculous bad guy I have ever seen. I also always enjoy a villain with a noble cause. Sofia Boutella as Gazelle, Valentine's partner in crime is a great play on the typical henchman we see in the movies. Her having blades instead of legs is one wicked idea. Michael Caine of course is a national treasure and it is such a pleasure to see him in any film because no one has a screen presence as him.\n\nThe camera work in Kingsman is the best I have seen since Bad Boys 2. The cinematography is fluent - no furious cuts, steady - no shaky camera, and is usually done in one take. The pivotal and arguably the bes scene of the film is the people are calling the 'church scene'. That scene is when everything cuts loose, people go berserk and generally mayhem ensues. This is the most violent, bloody action sequence you will see this year and it is all done in seemingly one take.\n\nThat brings me to the highlight of the film. Since the film is not censored by American studio executives Matthew Vaughn was completely in hold of the reins. He could cut himself loose. Therefore one of the film's biggest appeal is its ultra violence. Now, I don't want to sound like some blood-lust psychopath but having people be killed in a movie without any blood or the consequences shown is wrong and it hurts the viewer's enjoyment (if I want to see Sylvester Stallone film I expect blood, which wasn't the case with Expendables 3) and it hurts the psyche of a potential young viewer who might get the wrong impression of violence.\n\nVaughn's taste in music is very similar to mine. I have always dreamt of hearing Dire Straits's 'Money For Nothing' in a film and that is the song the film starts with. I was immediately in a paradise. The brilliantly put together soundtrack continues with Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' and KC & The Sunshine Band playing at the most inappropriate times resulting in a great comedic effect.\n\nMatthew Vaughn is ,for me, one of the smartest directors, since he is always is in sync with the audience's taste and its demand. So run to theater as fast as you can to see the best action film in years and the best movie of this year. I guarantee that you won't regret having an amazing time with this ultra violent, mega fun, self-referential spy action masterpiece."

It had an intelligent script and had me laughing out loud more often than teens text \"LOL\" or tweet random nonsense with hash tags. The fight scene choreography and the accompanying music blew me away!!! Be jealous other so-called action- comedies, be jealous. I've never seen a movie in theaters more than once, but I just might make an exception this time... yes, it's THAT GOOD. You will NOT be disappointed. The opening sequence alone made my jaw drop.\n\nWARNING: This movie is NOT for the squeamish. If you can't stomach blood and guts, don't go."

        "review_detailed_main": "(67%) It doesn't break any new ground, it's very childish, silly, cartoonish; and overall just yet another throwaway action movie. But dear god it's superbly entertaining right from the very beginning to the very final frame. This resembles everything that the awful Avengers (not the Marvel one) movie should have been, with its touches of the Austin Powers movies, and of course the Bond films. If this had been released at around the same time as the poor Quantum of solace movie then it would have been the only case when a part spoof picture would have actually been better than the film being spoofed; but as Skyfall was fantastic then this doesn't get that most rare accolade. The cast is strong, I warmed to the characters, the direction is solid; while the action sequence in the church is worth the ticket price alone. All in all a near perfect spy popcorn movie with plenty of tricks up its tailored sleeve."

This production tweaks the Bond formula with some polished style, a lot dark humor and a bit of well-groomed action. As with \"Kick-Ass,\" there's a strong underlying nastiness but also a wicked sense of fun. This can create some dissonance for some people finding it uneasy to laugh at violence at a point and then find out a character they like was killed in the next sequence. The violence is over the top for the most part, and rapidly cut with a lot of blood to keep it all at a safe distance."

There clearly is a very big love and respect for the spy genre and they clearly have very good control of their references to earlier works like James Bond, Jason Bourne and others. It is a very classic English spy, spiced up with some young British talent and an American villain wit a lisp :)\n\nAll of the actors do a very fine job, the guys with the routine, Colin Firth, Michael Cain, Mark Strong and Samuel L. Jackson all do a fine job and they are playing parts that we don't experience them in every day, but it fits them very well. The young Taron Egerton who takes the lead role is also doing a fine job and we will be seeing more of him in the future, I think."

The movie doesn't take itself too seriously (which is good) and that was supported by the fact that Samuel L. Jackson's character, Valentine, had a laughable lisp.\n\nThe Kingsmen are a group of elite English spies. They are extremely secretive and unknown yet they are probably the most effective group of spies and killers on the planet. As members leave or die off they are replaced by qualified spies and gentlemen. This movie is about an unlikely person for the role of gentleman spy getting a shot to prove himself while the Kingsmen try to stop a plot to cleanse the world of people.\n\nThere is a lot of unbelievable action, jaw-dropping fight scenes with surprisingly little eye candy. Being that it is a British spy movie I expected the token beauty whom the super spy seduces. That's not to say that they didn't throw in any gratuitous nudity, they just waited until the very end to do it."

In fact, it wouldn't be half the movie it is without the humour - it would just be another generic spy movie. The cast are terrific, Colin Firth in particular delivers an excellent performance as spy agent Harry Hart.\n\nKingsman is a fun movie that fulfills its action comedy tag brilliantly. If you're looking for a serious spy movie though, this isn't it. Watch James Bond instead."

        "review_title": "A Surprise Hit and Perfect Start to 2015's Slate of Spy Films",
        "review_detailed_main": "I am a major unapologetic fan of the James Bond franchise and, as much as I love the latest serious Daniel Craig run of the series, KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is apparently the 007 film I've been craving since Roger Moore finished his run in 1985. It takes all the most playful elements of Moore's 007 films, gives them modern sensibilities, and ramps up the stylized action under the direction of Matthew Vaughn. I've enjoyed Vaughn's work since LAYER CAKE and I'll admit I was worried about KINGSMAN. Leading up to its release, I'd seen little to no promotion for it and it was apparently based on a comic property with which I was unfamiliar. To top it off, it was scheduled for release in the month of February, a notorious cinematic dumping ground. But, man, I was wrong to doubt it. Turns out, KINGSMAN is one of my favorite movies of 2015, a year swamped with spy films. The Kingsman are a secret organization of wealthy gentlemen dating nearly a century and their mission is to keep the world safe from danger utilizing seemingly endless resources. Cool gadgets and impeccable style without the hindrance of answering to the government and MI6. Each agent is code- named for one of the knights in King Arthur's court, and they operate out of a tailor shop on Savile Row in London. As the movie begins, a threat emerges in the form of a world-famous tech billionaire whose plan for saving the world from environmental destruction means eliminating its over-population problem.\n\nIt all begins with the kidnapping of a famed environmental scientist/university professor, played by none other than Mark Hamill. A botched rescue attempt leaves a Kingsman agent dead and we then jump into the process of finding a new Lancelot. Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth) recruits young Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin (Taron Egerton) and convinces him to go through the recruitment campaign where he will compete with nearly a dozen other candidates for the position. This proves to be a challenge for Eggsy, as he's a street thug (albeit one with above average intelligence and Olympic-level gymnastic skills) going up against Ivy Leaguers with stiff upper lips and wealthy backgrounds. Hart feels compelled to care for Eggsy because it was Eggsy's father that saved his life by giving his own on a mission years earlier in the Middle East. Hart becomes a sort of surrogate father to Eggsy, teaching him in the ways of acting a gentleman and giving the kid confidence to compete. Firth and Egerton are a solid team in the film, and Firth's performance leads me to believe he could've been a fantastic 007 if he'd been given the chance. With support from Mark Strong as the Kingsman's tech wizard Merlin and Michael Caine as the commanding officer of the organization (dubbed Arthur, naturally), this movie's got some serious acting chops in it. But a proper spy/action film is only as strong as its villain and, when that villain is Samuel L. Jackson, you know it's going to be fun.\n\nKINSGMAN has a perfect blend of action and humor. It's definitely a lot edgier in the comedy than 007 films have ever been, seeing as how KINGSMAN totally embraces its R-rating. At the end of a 007 film, we get a tender embrace under the sheets, a cheesy pun, and an \"Oh, James\u0085\" from the leading lady. In KINGSMAN, the gorgeous woman prepares for mounting like a dog in heat because, well, he did save the world as promised. This movie is a jacked-up love letter to the fun 007 movies of the Connery and Moore eras, parodying elements with a knowing nod and taking everything a step further because they can. The violence certainly takes full advantage of the R-rating, with a church slaughter halfway through the film spilling loads of blood and establishing itself as the most fun scene of any movie in 2015 (fantastically set to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Freebird\"). The Kingsman may not appear to be much of a threat in their tailored suits with their proper manners, but these dudes can open a can of whoop a**. I would never expect much from Colin Firth but he's got a few scenes in this movie proving that Galahad is not a man to be trifled with. I could go on about KINGSMAN but I'll sum it up with this: the movie is just a crazy amount of fun and there is extra enjoyment to be had for fans of classic 007 who'll see a lot of the tropes toyed with here.\n\nOne last note: I really, really hope KINGSMAN 2 brings in Roger Moore in a supporting role, either as the villain or the head of the Kingsman. It would just be perfect."

The Cast is Excellent and the Director Shows No Signs of Losing His Edge.\n\nRecommended for Open Minded Art and Political Satire Lovers. As it Parodies the Real World of Politics, Religion, and Global Disarray Spiraling Out of Control.\n\nBehold...This is Art Imitating Life with a Swagger and a Smirk."

        "review_title": "An Uncensored Bond, for a New Generation",
        "review_detailed_main": "Comic book and graphic novel adaptations are something of a speciality for Director Matthew Vaughn. He has proved his worth with the ultra-violent 'Kick-Ass', the superior 'X-Men First Class' and now the stylish 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. He is in my eyes one of the most original Directors working today. 'Kingsman' sees him at the top of his game and with the upcoming release of the twenty fourth Bond film later this year, what better time to release this spy parody.\n\nNow, the English have had a poor track record when it comes to spy spoofs. If 'Johnny English' was a guilty pleasure then 'Storm breaker' was definitely a disappointment to say the least. But 'Kingsman' works so well on multiple levels and even the plot is pleasurable.\n\nWith the untimely death of two Kingsman agents, the others working in the field must find two suitable replacements. One of the candidates happens to be the son of a Dead agent from a botched mission that took place in 1997. He is Gary Unwin or 'Eggsy' if you are his friend. First time actor Taron Egerton who plays him with edge and conviction, if this is his first role imagine what he could accomplish in the future. The candidates participate in the \"most dangerous job interview\" they will ever get. Eventually Gary takes up the role of a Kingsman agent who is taught their prestigious ways by the smart and very talented Harry Hart played by Colin Firth. Whom still proves that he has got it, even if he is in his mid-fifties. I have heard that the majority of the action scenes he undertook himself and therefore I have to hand it to the man.\n\nOnce the agents are assembled they must take down Valentine a villain with a lisp. Samuel L Jackson takes up the role. I would have thought that he would be unable to impress me as he is always able to outshine other major players. But, he proves that he is still one of the most dependable and bankable actors of this generation. Valentine hatches a plot to rid the world of those whom he deems are less than worthy to inhabit it. As he realises that the population is increasing the rate of global warming and must be taken care of. He wishes to carry out this plot through biological warfare with the help of amputee Gazelle whom has razor sharp legs that can pierce human flesh with ease. What follows is one of the best spy films and parodies ever created. This is because every single detail and element is handled with grace.\n\nOne of the most important factors for a parody is the laughs. 'Kingsman' always delivers and makes me ever so thankful that the BBFC did not butcher this film and make it a 12A instead of the intended 15 certificate. It would lose half of its essence and almost every gag would land flat. Thankfully they do not and I had to use my arms to keep myself sitting straight and stop from falling face forwards onto the floor. Whether it be when the film takes the mickey out of the James Bond franchise, Valentine struggling with his ever so obvious lisp or the song that the villain plays to commence the end of the world, the film never falters where jokes are concerned.\n\nI will be brief here because with Vaughn behind the camera you know that the cinematography will be dazzling. But, also he is a Director who knows how to orchestrate fight scenes well, which is becoming increasingly rare for action films. One of the techniques that he uses to maximum effect is speeding up and slowing down the action. We get to see reactions more clearly and the full power of a single punch is never wasted. Rest assured the action is photographed spectacularly well and never descends into unwatchable shaky camera.\n\nThe whole film maintains a sense of joy that is palpable throughout the two hour run time. The film is a sugar rush of the highest class. For the faint of heart it may be too much to handle; with the majority of characters free loading F bombs in every other sentence, heads exploding like shrapnel (to be honest it does have hundreds of deaths) and jokes about sex. But for others it will be a thrill ride that no other film can replicate or capture.\n\nFor all action and spoof fans to miss out on 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' would be sacrilege to your country. Suit up, relax and freak out as Vaughn delivers a high octane, frequently funny and incredibly entertaining treat for teenagers and over around the whole globe. This is a younger, more daring and uncensored Bond for the new generation. If this was to be the next super spy franchise it would be joyous cause for celebration indeed. When it comes to furious action and elating energy, nobody does it better than Vaughn."

Colin Firth was very good, he played Colin Firth (with extra added spyness) to a tee and was very enjoyable. I found Samuel L Jackson's lisp a little bit annoying but if he hadn't had it he would have been WAY more scary as a villain! He was very funny, too! The scenery was impressive and there were great swooping shots and you could actually see what was happening (not too fast).\n\nI really liked the whole 'knight' thing and that they had Arthurian code names.

        "review_title": "Bond Meets Ender's Game Meets Trading Places Meets 2012: Has Good Moments But the Violence Was Insufferable",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Kingsman\" is not only a story about a young lad being trained in an ultra-secret service agency similar to Mi6 of the James Bond universe. Kingsman is also about satirizing Bond and other similar action fair. Other films are directly or indirectly referenced in \"Kingsman\", sometimes to good effect, other times with mixed results. So is the film about it's story/plot or its references to other cinematic shoot-em-up films of similar ilk? Rather depends upon how you look at it. For my money, the endless references to action cinema did become a bit overdone.\n\n\"Kingsman\" incorporates two plots which become intertwined by the end. The first, and most interesting, is the training of a youth on the eve of adulthood. \"Eggsy\" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is the son of a Kingsman who sacrificed himself to save his colleagues on his mission when his son was only a toddler. One of the operatives, code named Galahad (Colin Firth) gives the toddler a medallion. The late father was code named Lancelot. The film then fast-forwards many years later and now Eggsy is near adulthood but not very mature. He encounters Galahad who offers him a spot in a program with other recruits designed to train future kingsmen, in particular to fill the vacant spot of Lancelot. The training program I thought was the strongest part of the film as the coaches/trainers use no-win scenarios to challenge their recruits into finding creative solutions.\n\nThe other story involves a billionaire, Richmond Valentine (Samuel Jackson), who has some strange ideas about defeating global warming. He makes endless speeches to both audiences and individuals with a lisp. Also in Jackson's service, as either an employee or slave, is Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) who sports razor sharp blades in place of normal feet. I started to guess when she appeared in scenes without Jackson, an extra or three was going to encounter the business end of Gazelle's \"shoes\".\n\nUnderneath Valentine's seemingly innocent philanthropy in which he offers free internet and cell phone service through his network is a calculated plan to eradicate global warming. Trouble is, the plan involves causing people to engage in Godzilla-like violent behavior. He also implants computer chips into peoples' necks in which they become mindless minions in service to Valentine. Eventually, we see a demonstration of Valentine's plot in action when he decides to off the congregation of a church of far-right congregants in Kentucky who make Mussolini and Stalin look pretty democratic. The violence in the church was so over-the-top and grotesque, I found I was not enjoying it and wanted to fast-forward out of the scene.\n\nWhile I definitely liked the youth's introduction to Kingsman through Galahad, and I thought Jackson made a good baddie, the endless references to Bond-like cinema I thought was overkill. Not only are Bond films and \"Trading Places\" referenced, but there's parallel's with \"2012\" and there's even an indirect wink to the film \"Pulp Fiction\", which also starred Jackson. Also, the combat scenes were gratuitously violent for no apparent reason. This film is billed as an action-comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing when people's limbs were chopped off. When either Galahad or Gazelle rip into their victims, they literally come apart at the seams.\n\nBy the end of \"Kingsman\", I wasn't sure what I had seen. Was this a comedy? Kind of. A spoof? Maybe. An homage to action cinema a la the 1960's variety? I guess so. At one point Jackson and Firth talk about those films from their youth, and Jackson even says \"It's not that kind of a movie\". And I think I had to agree. I wasn't sure what kind of movie this was in the first place, and I was still confused by the end."

I enjoyed it so much!!\n\nTaron Egerton is one of the best new actors (I personally think), probably not as cool as some teenager stars, but he suits the character and he is awesome! (Chance favors only the prepared mind)\n\nColin Firth gives one of his most surprising performance (I didn't know he could fight before, but he could, and he did such a good job!)\n\nLove this movie anyway!! I love the firework head, love all the fights with proper suits, love that cool umbrella, love this active Colin Firth, love \"the young man with potential, who wants to do something in his life\", love this movie sooo much!!\n\n\uff08This can be Uncle Barney's favorite movie - all men suit up and fight.... Lol xx\uff09\n\nGo to the cinema, genuinely! There is no reason you can ever miss it!"

Since I never see it in real life, I find anyone wearing a baseball cap sideways in movies really distracting.\n\nYes, there is violence in the movie. But, it is the type of over the top violence found in movies like Superman and Batman. There may be a bit more gore to the violence in this movie, but it still reminds me of the superhero stylized movies.\n\nStill, I would recommend it to a friend."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kingsman: The Secret Service tells the story of Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin(Taron Egerton). Eggsy is an unrefined but gifted street kid with a lot of potential. However, Eggsy uses his intelligence & talents to get himself into sticky situations. A spy named Harry Hart/Galahad(Colin Firth) who is part of a secret spy organization, sees Eggsy's potential & recruits him into the organization's cutthroat training program to become the next Kingsman. Meanwhile, a tech genius named Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson), has twisted plans that could put the whole world in serious danger.\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is an outstanding & flawless film. I haven't had this much fun watching a movie, in quite some time. This movie is full of action, witty one-liners & is also thrilling & suspenseful. Kingsman also has numerous memorable quotes like, \"This is not that kind of movie, bruv\". Basically, this movie is a complete package. The action sequences are intense, realistic, slick & stylish. This movie has tons of violence & gore & is not meant for the faint of heart & people who get squeamish at the sight of blood. There is one set piece in the movie that is out of this world! I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Matthew Vaughn has outdone himself. Kingsman: The Secret Service is better than Kick-Ass & is on par with X-Men: First Class. A note on the performances. Colin Firth is spectacular as Harry Hart/Galahad. Firth shines in his first major action role. Taron Egerton is brilliant as Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin. Egerton is extremely likable as the unorthodox lead of the film. Samuel L. Jackson is hysterical as Valentine. Jackson's antagonist is one of a kind & beats several Bond villains. Mark Strong is brilliant as Merlin. Michael Caine is great as Arthur. Sophie Cookson is good as Roxy. Sofia Boutella is impressive as Gazelle. The supporting characters are amazing too. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a must watch, especially for action-comedy & spy movie buffs."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Kingsman: The Secret Service' walks a very fine line between parody and homage, never straying too far to one side or the other. Its tongue is certainly in its cheek, but never sticking out toward the audience.\n\nClearly director Matthew Vaughn was attempting to fashion a spy film that brings back a sense of fun reminiscent of the James Bond films of yore; even going meta on occasion to drive the point home. But even though it wears its absurdity on its sleeve, 'Kingsman' still manages to sneak in a genuine character arc and by the end we genuinely want our heroes to save the day. It's a heck of a balancing act Vaughn has done here."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you said that 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was like a 'Bond film' then you'd only be partly right. Yes, it's a 'spy movie,' yes you have a 'super villain' trying to basically take over the world and, yes, you have a 'gentleman spy' ready and waiting to stop him. Yet, for all its 'Bond-like' traits, I just can't really liken Kingsman to a Bond movie. It's not better or worse, just a different beast altogether.\n\nIt's different because \u2013 unlike Bond \u2013 it doesn't just concentrate on one area of the spy genre. Our gentleman spy in question is played expertly by Colin Firth and, if the film-makers had chosen to do so, they could have easily concentrated on his efforts to stop our (lisping!) super villain, Samuel L Jackson, from getting away with his dastardly plans. However, like I say, that's only part of the story. Mr Firth, Colin Firth, decides to take on a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the form of a young lad from the rough end of London and train him up in the ways of the Force (in Star Wars terms, anyway). So, not only do we have a spy movie, but with a large helping of teenage coming-of-age thrown in there (oh, and the obligatory teenage romance to satisfy the 'Twilight generation'). Now, if you're already picking up on my distain for twinkling vampires and schoolgirls who don't seem able to smile or close their mouths, then you're probably right. I'm not a fan of teenage love stories and Kingsman could quite easily have fallen down here in my estimation. However, luckily, it's not the case and the 'teenage element' is actually done pretty well and hopefully won't alienate too many of the older generation (like me, for example).\n\nI won't go into too many details about the plot. If you've seen one Bond film (or any other spy movie worth its name) then you'll know. The plot isn't important, only that you know that it's done very well. And, I should mention a special nod to the 'action scenes.' I'm not entirely sure how they're done, but they're damn awesome and stylishly put together.\n\nIf you like the slightly tongue-in-cheekness of old 'pre-Daniel Craig' Bond then you should enjoy Kingsman. It has decent performances, stylish action, over-the-top baddies (seriously... a woman with giant razor blades for legs has to be straight out of the Dr No era!) and even a touch of humanity and uplifting character development. A surprise package."

However, she is not feeling very sociable and snaps at him, which results in Hart giving the medal to her son Eggsy (Alex Nicolov). Hart points out a phone number engraved on the back of the medal an tells Eggsy mother to use it and tells her the coded message she should use.\n\nThe movie then jumps some seventeen years, and sees another agent, Lancelot(Jack Davenport), killed by a female assassin known as Gazelle(Sofia Boutella), who works for the billionaire (Richmond Valentine (Samuel L Jackson). Meanwhile, Eggsy (Taron Egarton) is finding life hard, living with his mother, young half sister and nasty stepfather.\n\nDespite having many qualities, Eggsy feels disillusioned and opts out of his training with the Royal Marines. He ends up being arrested for car theft and rings the number on his medal, which finds him being released. Standing outside the police station is Hart, who invites Eggsy to a local pub for a drink. Hart tells Eggsy about a secret organisation known as Kingsman that he and Eggsy's father worked for. Hart informs Eggsy that Kingsman have a vacancy for a new agent to fill the space left by Lancelot. After dispatching several thugs with his umbrella, Hart takes Eggsy to their training headquarters, where he is greeted by Merlin (Mark Strong) and several other potential candidates. Eggsy fails his final test, which results in him leaving Kingsman and a girl named Roxy (Sophie Cookson), being made a fully fledged agent. However, Eggsy returns to Kingsman and discovers the leader Arthur (Michael Caine, as been secretly working for Valentine. Eggsy, together with Roxy and Merlin, then feel obliged to go and shake things up at Valentines secret hide out.\n\nThe Kingsman is an action movie directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Kick Ass, X Men: First Class, Stardust). The movie takes you into a gadget filled make believe secret service organisation. The sets are quite impressive as are the weapons and gadgets. The movie will undoubtedly appeal to the fan of the Bond movie."

Though some of these moments were not always too my liking, it's hard to deny the pleasure you have watching this movie. The makers of the movie were all in great form: Millar's script is craziness at its best, and it is paired with Vaughn's superb eye and perfect pacing.

This film also holds one of the greatest action scenes in cinematic history with the infamous \"Church Scene\".\n\nI thought all actors were great and played their role perfectly especially Samuel Jackson.

        "review_detailed_main": "Matthew Vaughn wants you to know that the spy movies today are too serious. They are too dark, too long, and too exhausting. He fancies a time back when spy films had a sense of humor, took chances, and were over the top because, in his eyes, that made them something he feels these films were born to be....fun. It's hard not to agree with him. Some of my fondest memories watching the old Bond films of Connery and Moore were how over the top they were. The cheesy villains, gadgets, and one liners. They made you roll your eyes but you didn't care because you were enjoying the hell out of the movie. Now in in my opinion, the darkness of recent spy films, especially in the Bond franchise, has greatly improved the genre. While the old spy films are fun, they became almost too ridiculous and repetitive to the point where they were just bad movies. Kingsman: The Secret Service is Vaughn's homage to the old spy film. Reminding Hollywood to try to have a little fun once in awhile.\n\nThe story really is pretty formulaic throughout the first half. You have a mission from the past where something goes wrong and an agent goes down and that agent just happens to be the father of who will be our hero Gary....excuse me, I mean \"Eggsy\" (Yeah...I don't get it either) played competently by up and comer Taron Edgerton. Years pass and Eggsy has become the young lost soul who can't see to find a place in the world while trying to protect his mother and baby sister from an abusive stepfather blah blah blah. But again, much like those old spy films, you aren't seeing this film for the story.\n\nThe film really gets rolling once we get more familiar with Harry Hart, Eggsy's mentor and certified bad ass in one of the very best performances of the early year by Colin Firth. When you think of the casting going into the film, Harry is the most crucial. He is used to embody that old school spy who is one part bad ass and one part distinguished English gentleman. Firth is an English gentleman by nature but the risk of casting him in the role is he is just about the least bad ass type actor you and even HE can think of. You'll read this same thought in any other review of the film but that point really can't be overstated. Any director worth anything can make someone look like they can kick ass with effects and such (cough...cough...Tobey Maguire), but if the actor isn't believable throughout the rest of the film as a force to be reckoned with, then the film suffers. Firth talks the talk of the gentleman and kicks ass as the spy. He is smooth, funny, and blows up the film with his swagger. A performance not to be forgotten any time soon.\n\nThe rest of the casting is fitting. Samuel L. Jackson was the ideal choice to play an over the top villain because....well....what hasn't he been in his career if not over the top? Probably my favorite thing about his Valentine character is that I was originally going to write about how it was a little difficult at times to understand what some of the British actors are saying due to their thick accents. Vaughn gives a wink to the audience (especially the American audience) by giving the American Valentine a lisp that makes him sounds ridiculous AND gives him a line calling out the issue Americans have with Brit actors \"You Brits...Y'all talk so funny\". Well played Vaughn. We also get some solid supporting performances from Mark Strong and Michael Caine (playing a real ass hole in films lately) to round out a solid cast.\n\nIf you're going into Kingsman: The Secret Service and expecting Skyfall the you're going to be disappointed. Kingsman isn't about being dark and serious with some powerful societal message to go along with it. Kingsman does what Matthew Vaughn intended it to do which was to give you a fun time. It's got violence, comedy, and some great music adding up to a great time at the movies. So turn your brain off for a bit, enjoy the chaos and don't bother trying to hide the smile you'll have when you walk out of the theater....we all saw it."

But those franchises while still amazing don't always manage to retain some of their more sillier aspects that made them so unique but Kingsman The Secret Service is able to be a modern spy/action film that feels like it could be a 1960s spy flick and was on elf my favourite movie of 2015. The cast is the movie ranges from unknowns to veterans but they all bring something to this movie, Taron Edgarton was the perfect lead for this movie not only is he really funny and entertaining but he had a great arc to him that made you love and sympathise with him and made excellent chemistry with Colin Firth who was also Fanta in this movie I loved seeing him to something different, an action heavy and suave spy and he really stole this movie for me. The action sequences are so good in this movie Matthew Vaughn did a really great job at directing this movie, you feel every punch and bullet in every fight scene and the church massacre is without out a doubt this films greatest action set piece. The villains in this movie were really entertaining and perfectly balanced of the Spy leads. Samuel L Jackson was so great in this movie I loved his lisp it made him seem more vulnerable and is again a reference to 1960s spy flicks. But by far a more on the nose reference was his female assistant Gazelle I loved her. The sword legs were a really nice touch that made her all the more bad ass. The training sequence of this film is a great way to set up this world of the Kingsman, I loved seeing Eggsy over come obstacles and put up with the spoilt rich kids. I really liked the character of Roxy in this film I thought she had really good chemistry with Eggsy and I really hope that they'll explore their relationship more in the upcoming sequel. The overall plan that Samuel L Jacksons character has is completely far fetched but works for this films more comical and silly tone and made for an excellent final battle.\n\nKingsman The Secret Service perfectly blended modern aspects and older throw backs and was great way to kick of a potentially great new action franchise.\n\n94%/A"

As much as I try not to have any expectations going in, there's only so much you can do to avoid that. And because its hard to get a gauge on your outside influences, it can be hard to know just how much not loving a movie was because you had it over-hyped, and how much is because its just not your thing. I had the same problem with Gone Girl, and, like Gone Girl, I'm gonna assume it was predominantly the former and not the latter, and bump it up from three starts to three and a half by the skin of its teeth. Now you may have noticed that I said I \"didn't love\" it rather than \"it was garbage\". That's because I liked it, I really liked it and there is a lot you'll carry out from Kingsman that you'll hold on to for a long time. Matthew Vaughn is an absolute goddamn MASTER filmmaker, Colin Firth, Mark Hammil, Sam Jackson, Michael Caine, Mark Strong and Geoff Bell all get to flex their acting muscles here, and that is never gonna fail to get me stoked. You may not have heard of Taron Egerton or Sofie Boutella before, but mar my words, after their performances in this, you're gonna start hearing about them a lot, real damn soon. I'm calling it now, unless they somehow start making some monumentally poor decisions, household names by 2018. I did like Kingsman, and I feel obliged to tell you it earned the right to hold onto the top five box office for over a month, and its appeal is, while not universal, still broad. It may well be the best film of 2015 thus far, but it's also not so glamorous as most would have you believe."

Kingsman: The Secret Service is an exhilarating original spy adventure with great touches of comedy and glorious stunts! I love how Samuel L. Jackson is in hundreds of different projects over the last several decades. So epic the church sequence that should be praised more! Love this glad I own in 4K."

Eggsy (Taron Egerton) really excels in this movie and is truly an underdog worth cheering for. I loved the soundtrack and the use of color throughout the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.\"\n\nKingsman is director Matthew Vaughn's fifth feature film and there was a lot of speculation over this movie considering he had chosen to direct this over the sequel to his highly successful X-Men First Class. He was also in talks to direct the new Star Wars franchise, but Vaughn wanted to adapt Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons' comic book \"The Secret Service\" instead. A comic book I had never heard of, but Vaughn's dedication to the material is inspired by his love for the old James Bond films, and this adaptation plays out as a love letter to those former movies with fascinating villains and a far fetched plot. Kingsman is rich in style and the film is beautifully directed by Vaughn who has always proved his abilities behind the camera. His 2004 debut, Layer Cake, starring Daniel Craig might actually be the reason why he has now become the new James Bond. Vaughn, who had produced some of Guy Ritchie's films, was heavily influenced by him in that first film, but he has established himself now with his own personal style. My favorite film from Vaughn is still Kick-Ass which felt fresh when it first came out and established itself as a refreshing parody of super hero films. My expectations for Kingsman grew when I heard that this comic book adaptation was written by the same person who wrote the Kick-Ass comic because I was a huge fan of that film. However, the idea didn't feel as fresh this time and I had some issues with a couple of violent scenes that took me out of the movie. Kingsman does do to spy movies what Kick-Ass did to super hero movies, but if you saw that film you could expect some of the dark turns and twists that were going to come here. It is very similar in style and some of the characters go through the same fate but it is still fun and entertaining.\n\nKingsman centers on a British spy organization run by Arthur (Michael Caine) that is trying to stop a global threat from a billionaire tech innovator named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). When one of the spies dies during a mission, the agency decides to recruit a new one. Each one of the spies chooses a young candidate and Harry Hart (Colin Firth) puts his eyes on a street kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who shows a lot of promise. The recruits have to go through an intense program under the guidance of their instructor Merlin (Mark Strong). Meanwhile Harry continues to investigate Valentine and try to discover what he is up to as several celebrities and government officials begin to disappear.\n\nThe film felt bipolar at times. There are incredibly fun action sequences that are directed very well by Vaughn, but at the same time there are some disturbing violent scenes that take place in a church. The violence is cartoonish, but there are instances where it does feel out of place. I don't know why some of those scenes took me out of the movie because Vaughn is just having fun with the action scenes, but they just felt out of place. The things that did work best for me in Kingsman are the strong performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth who play off each other extremely well. The scenes they share together are wonderful and their self referential movie talk is hilarious. Valentine has a lisp which reminds us of some of the physical dysfunctions that the early villains from the Bond franchise had. Vaughn introduces small elements like this as he pays homage to some of those entertaining films. Newcomer, Taron Egerton, also delivers the good as this young street smart kid who is learning the ways of becoming a gentlemen. His scenes with Firth are another highlight of the film. Perhaps the most entertaining thing about Kingsman is the recruiting process the kids have to go through. One of the other potential candidates is Roxy who is played very well by Sophie Cookson. She shares excellent chemistry with Egerton. Mark Strong might be my favorite character in this film and he also gets plenty of screen time. Sofia Boutella also delivers a memorable role as one of Valentine's sidekicks. Kingsman is highly entertaining and has many positive things going for it, but there are a couple of disturbing scenes that felt out of place. Despite this, Vaughn is still five for five and a director I will continue to look forward to.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Kingsman: The Secret Service is the next awesome spy movie that is very alike to the James Bond movies, but in a action/comedy humor way. I was very amazed by how the cast was made to have the actors portray the characters they were casted as in the movie. Honestly,Taron Egerton did an outstanding job portraying his character Eggsy Unwin (who is a teenage boy from the streets to the agency of Kingsman) and he learns the way of Kingsman from his mentor Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Eggsy and Harry come along very well in this movie. As well as seeing Samuel L. Jackson portray as a bad guy which his name is Valentine, I was in wow by how well Samuel L. Jackson did in portraying this certain villain throughout the movie. This was my very first time seeing Samuel playing a bad guy. Overall, I enjoyed Kingsman: The Secret Service and my favorite quote from this movie is \"Manners Maketh Man\". This is a one-of-a-kind spy movie that makes me want to watch all over and over again. It's a fun, action-packed thrill ride that everyone will enjoy."

The characters are build to make you feel in the team and at the same time keeps the individuality of each one of them, making them unique in some way.\n\nTo me Kingsman was born from the desire of creating a modern age Bond with a different english accent, a different tone. Still, this movie doesn't shine because of its plot, or a excentric villain, known for a long time now, but because the action scenes actually makes you get up the chair and enjoy what you see. It's not written as a remarkable novel but a well engineered way to watch and feel action and tension. It doesn't need more, but of course I would apreciate a good written and a new-look to this genre.\n\nI would totally recommend it, as one of my favorite spy genre movies."

You both can and can't take him seriously. Even the idea of Samuel L. Jackson being cast as a villain who feels sick when he sees even a drop of blood, that is hilarious.\n\nThe action scenes were amazing. They were little hard to keep a track on, but the little details showed kind of made up for that.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing: it's modern electronic action soundtrack meets classic spy movies meets Kick-Ass.\n\nThe feeling I got afterwards is: I want more. I want more movies like this. Kingsman was fun, exciting and it had a certain charm. Amazing movie, everyone who loved Kick-Ass needs to see Kingsman."

To begin with its flaws, the movie at times seems a bit choppy and some scenes seem as if they're just placed chronologically for the single purpose of exposition and expanding on the plot. In addition, a few key characters aren't developed as well as I think that they could have been. One final flaw is in a few scenes, it was slightly noticeable that green screen technology had been used, since you'd be able to notice how the background and the characters aren't quite in the same shot. But that's it for the biggest flaws.\n\nAs for its pros, the movie as I mentioned is extremely enjoyable with exciting and well-choreographed action scenes as well several instances of funny moments and lines. For the type of film that Kingsman is, its flaws don't take away much from the movie itself, since it is made solely for enjoyment and excitement and not for a perfect script and a completely original story. It's a entertaining film and strongly recommended for anyone just looking to watch something simple and fun."

He manages to hold together a mess of megalomaniac contradictions: both immensely inhibited and freewheeling, he subverts our expectations at nearly every turn.\n\nI like the film, but find something of the method of the Kingsman training deplorable even if eventually explained. However I accept the harshness was meant to instill a sense of life without \"safety nets,\" and to touch a nerve of the real behind the simulation, much like the film's confrontation of the play acting of movie tropes versus how conflict really plays out \"in the streets,\" so to speak.\n\nFinely done!"

It is also meta in many ways, a celebration of the genres that inspired it.\n\nThe main flaw in this movie is the villain. In the movie they refer to the Bond-movies only being as good as their villains, and if that was the case with this movie, it wouldn't be that good. Jackson is charming as always, but the character itself is not that interesting. Luckily, the heroes are more than enough to keep you entertained, and the grand plot really does not matter that much.\n\nAnd wow, Colin Firth really shows a new side of himself in this movie! Another thing: I am a bit uncertain about how the movie tries to convey an anti-elitist message. The main character is not born into luxury, but was it not for his father then he would not end up in the position he ends up in. And he does not seem to mind the privileges his newfound occupation gives him."

I don't think I looked at my phone once.\n\nI can't recommend this enough, even if like me you don't usually go in for these kinds of films."

When he goes to tell the wife he leaves a present for his son (Egerton). Years later they two meet up again, this time Harry is a recruiter. Together, along with the rest of the Kingsmen. they must stop the global threat Valentine (Jackson) has set up. Before I really looked at the rating for this I was expecting a teenage Cody Banks type movie. After seeing it was rated R I was confused. The movie is very much geared toward the teenage crowd, but the fact that there are over 100 uses of the f-word take it out of the teenage crowd acceptability. The fact that the movie is about a younger agent takes this out of the older crowd's desire to see this. Colin Firth is very good and this is a different part for him. The main problem is that the swearing and violence push it out watch-ability for the crowd it is intended for. Had the movie been the same without the swearing it would have found an audience. As it stands its in between those that can't see it and those that don't want to. Overall, adding the unnecessary swearing really hurt the movie badly. I give this a C+."

It starts out the neoclassic, early-Bondesque, spy-thriller-meets-Hunger-Games mash-up the trailers make it out to be. The plot and characters are compelling enough that you want to hang in, suspend disbelief and see where this is going. But it hits a wall in the last 30 minutes or so; from the conclusion of the church scene on, it's Austin-Powers-meets-Jackass-meets-Spring-Breakers-Gone-Wild. Screenplay, direction, production values all tank; it's like Vaughn got pulled off to another project and left the sum-up to his high-school interns ... or the guys at his car wash. And the camp factor comes too late and too abruptly to pull this into \"cult\" territory. The Vaughn fanboys will disagree, of course, and there are plenty on these boards. This movie suits the adolescent boy-fantasy mindset; if your standards are at all higher, you'll be disappointed. Pity, really. If I'd walked out after the first hour, this could've been a good 7-8 film."

His maniacal portrayal as an over the top eco-warrior was nothing short of brillant and stole the show. HE SHOULD HAVE WON THE OSCAR FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR!\n\nFinally learning that the organization has been compromised Merlin and the \"new\" Lancelot place their trust in Eggsy to help save the day. My objection is that the \"Academy\" wouldn't know a show stealing performance if it bit them in the backside."

It felt like instead of making a more quality story they went for the cheap thrills with a lot of four letter words, violence, and needless sexual overtones.\n\nIn one particular scene it was non-stop over the top violent. I don't know what they were going for but everyone in the theater seemed to get tense. We were all wondering what the hell we just saw. Was this supposed to be funny or dramatic?\n\nAnd in the James Bond films (which this movie tries to spoof at points) the sex scenes are sort of implied, good enough, but this one became weird. Several people, mainly ladies, walked out on the film early.\n\nOver all fairly entertaining, but felt kind of cheapened by attempts to make it too edgy and contemporary.."

        "review_detailed_main": "Over the years I have seen many spy-thrillers. The more obvious being the James Bond films based upon the Ian Fleming novels. Each James Bond film has a unique maniacal villain with world domination as his main agenda.\n\nThis film is no different. Here we have internet billionaire Richmond Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson) who leads a paranoid and selfish existence. He believes the world is doomed by global warming - and the only solution is a worldwide cull. And so, he sets about his plans in gusto.\n\nThen we have hero of the film, young Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin(Taron Egerton) who leads a sad existence in the ghetto. The death of his father gives him an opportunity to join Kingsman, a secret intelligence agency that fights against terrorist threats.\n\nIn the film we have the typical gadgets or gizmo's that your average agent needs. We also have the kill sequences similar to the Bond movies, however with updated C.G.I. effects in all their glory. The main factor that makes the film work is that the script is well polished, the action and acting is thoroughly controlled, the cinematography and sound-effects are superb.\n\nSome actors shine more than others, here we have Samuel Jackson and Colin Firth as one of the best. Mark Hamill has a small cameo as Professor James Arnold. I hardly recognized him at all. Just by looking at the end credits did I realize that he was in the film. Taron David Egerton makes a good leap from TV into mainstream Hollywood.\n\nMatthew Vaughan has made some good films in the past like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) and directing the films Layer Cake (2004), Stardust (2007), Kick-Ass (2010), X-Men: First Class (2011). He has some similarity in style with other directors like Chris Nolan and Paul W.S. Anderson.\n\nVerdict: definitely a good way to pass one and a half hours. But I wouldn't watch the film again. Typical toilet paper film.\n\nYou may also like: The 39 Steps 1959, North By NorthWest 1959, Torn Curtain 1966, The Ipcress File 1965, The Odessa File 1974, Firefox (1982), The Fourth Protocol 1987, The Bourne Identity 1988, The Russia House (1990), If Looks Could Kill (released in the UK as Teen Agent) 1991, Mission Impossible 1996.\n\nThank you for reading this review. Live long and prosper."

It's got suave heroes, unbelievable stunt-laden action, natty high-tech gadgets, a megalomaniacal villain with a cool mountain-top lair, a deadly henchwoman with an unusual pair of weapons, and oodles of extreme violence, all delivered at a cracking pace with stunning visual effects by Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn. It also features the best use of Lynyrd Skynrd's Freebird in a movie since The Devil's Rejects (during an incredible fight sequence in a church). A well deserved 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "'KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nMatthew Vaughn directs yet another action comic book movie (following 'KICK-ASS' and 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS'), which is again adapted from material written by Mark Millar (the creator of the 'Kick-Ass' comics; as well as other popular titles like 'Wanted', 'Civil War' and 'The Ultimates'). It was written by Vaughn and his usual writing partner Jane Goldman. It stars Colin Firth as a highly skilled secret agent who recruits a street-smart young man into an elite secret agency force. They must do battle with a brilliant billionaire eco-terrorist, played by Samuel L. Jackson. The movie also costars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Sophie Cookson, Sofia Boutella, Mark Hamill, Jack Davenport and Michael Caine. Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed.\n\nThe Kingsmen are a special spy organization, in London, that recently lost one of their best agents. They begin a very tough, and highly competitive, recruitment process; to find his replacement. Agent Galahad (Firth) decides to give a young street-smart criminal a chance, named Eggsy (Egerton). Eggsy is the son of an old Kingsmen agent, who was killed on an assignment, with Galahad, in the Middle East; 17 years earlier. Galahad made a promise to help out the deceased agent's family. The agency is also preparing for a dangerous mission; to do battle with a rich tech genius, named Valentine (Jackson), who's threatening to kill millions in an insane population control plan.\n\nThe movie is everything I expected it to be; it's full of witty characters, spouting off clever dialogue, in cool and very stylistic action scenes. It's also got a lot of excessive, and very over-the- top, violence and it's even more gory than Vaughn's, and Miller's, own ultra-violent 'KICK-ASS' films (I'd say). Firth is great in the movie and it's also a pretty funny British spy spoof too. The only real flaw (I can see), in the film, is that the main young hero isn't that likable; sure he's relatable, and a believable British punk, but he doesn't have a heck of a lot of character or charm. Firth make's up for what Egerton's character is lacking though and it's still a pretty awesome action flick; as a whole. I'm sure it'll become another beloved cult classic, for Matthew Vaughn and Mark Miller lovers!\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o"

Very much a James Bond parody but up to date and obviously much younger, the character of Eggsy portrayed in this film is recruited, by a senior Kingsman Agent (Colin Firth) to take the place of a recently deceased colleague. Along with a whole group of other trainee agent Eggsy must battle to prove his worth and become the newest agent. With Samuel L Jackson playing the maniacal baddie, we see a standard good guy, bad guy action movie with quite a few laughs thrown in for good measure. There are some excellent fight scenes and a splendid musical spectacular which completely stole the show. It's refreshing to see a good well written plot combining new gags, up to date technology, reference to established genres and not forgetting Colin Firth in a most splendid British stiff upper lip action role. I hope this is the first of a series of these films. Highly recommended viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kingsman: The Secret Service is a film that is far better than it has any right to be. What could of been a by-the-numbers parody of the recent Mission: Impossible, Bourne trilogy and Daniel Craig Bond flicks, though each of those respective franchises are great in their own right, is in fact something truly special.\n\nKingsman gave me the same feeling as last year's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' unpretentious, well directed and fun yet clever. Kingsman works on a number of different levels that make it a joy to behold. For one, it's an intriguing premise. A young boy living on a council estate in London is recruited to join a secret intelligence service working to preserve peace and order in the world and from there, must face a deadly megalomaniac who is intent on bringing about a new world order.\n\nFor one, Kingsman is flawless in it's acting, Taron Egerton is sure for high heights, Colin Firth embodies the brilliance of Roger Moore's Bond but gives a far more lethal edge. While Mark Strong, Samuel L Jackson and Micheal Caine all shine in each of their respective roles.\n\nThe film is also incredibly slick, the design on the film from the fact all of the Kingsman wear suits to the nostalgia fantastical plot is all a homage of sorts and yet Kingsman is profoundly original in a sense, it blends humour with a plot that is intelligently self aware all the while will still make you actually care for the characters and has enough curve-balls to make this seemingly predictable romp be far smarter than you were expecting.\n\nThe music is great, a fight scene to 'give it up' by KC and the Sunshine band was a highlight for me and while the CGI isn't the big Hollywood Blockbuster standard, it still has that visceral punch to it that makes it a beautifully aesthetic and 70s feel to it.Whilst it's violence, though shockingly brutal is just stunning. Never before have I seen an action scene that is so well shot and paced and disturbingly amazing! If you have seen the film, I am sure you know what I'm talking about.\n\nIt's a controversial film, that wears it proudly on it's sleeve, it's not afraid to offend and is something that many films lack the bravado to do so. It is also incredibly funny, with some great lines and still has some heart and emotion at it's center with a fantastically British flair.\n\nKingsman is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, whilst Award season is currently progressing, with films that only possess depth or tackle big themes and overly convoluted, complex characters only being nominated. It's so refreshing that a film that is at it's core: fun whilst still being great is finally bursting into Cinemas. This is one of the rare films that I do hope is successful in order to warrant a sequel, if not, then it'll be a shame but what Matthew Vaughn and his creative team have done, is made a film that I will watch again and again."

You might see it as a fun, over-the-top cross between Quentin Tarantino and James Bond, with the best damn ending you've ever seen; or you might see it as a crude, fake-looking mess that has one of the worst endings you've ever seen. People seem pretty split about it. As for me: I'm in the former category. I freaking loved this movie! I can really enjoy a self-aware campy gore-fest like this. But, if you don't like it, that's fine. I can see why some people would be disappointed. Though, this movie is not at all worthy of 1s and 2s. You aren't going to sound contradictory if you give a 6/10 and say you still didn't like it. I can admit that Big Hero Six was a good movie, but I still didn't like it as much, and that's perfectly fine.\n\nSo, if you enjoy seeing Colin Firth kicking unfathomable amounts of ass, it's definitely worth seeing. But, if you aren't a fan of over-the-top action and gore, then go ahead and give it a pass."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a time when celebrities mysteriously started to disappear and environmental damage caused by human overpopulation became the top agenda for a tech tycoon, a small gentlemen's tailor shop in London stood as the last defender against rising evil. For decades, the Kingsman secret service operated as an independent international intelligence agency in the guise of the tailor shop. Its meticulously dressed agent Galahad proudly defines the agency to a recruit, \"The suit is a modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights\". Matthew Vaughn ('Kick-Ass', 'X-Men: First Class') provides the campy seriousness of a James Bond villain's threat but also has slick, bloody action that shocks they way 'Kick-Ass' did. This spy thriller is a patiche of several franchises but with Vaughn's bold, ruthless and stylized action sequences, it creates a genre on its own. The more ridiculous it gets, the more fun it is.\n\nHaving the guilt of losing an agent during an unfortunate mission, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) aka Galahad offers aid to his family. Years later, the son Eggsy (Taron Egerton) grows up in the East end with a middle class upbringing and when his immature acts led to his arrest, he used his wild card and contacted the Kingsman. Harry bails him from prison and offers to recruit him as an agent. Any doubt in Eggsy's mind is laid to rest when he witnesses Harry taking down some rogues in a fast reflexive, stylishly canny brawl at a pub. The recruitment for the one agent who will become a Kingsman will see six youngsters in Hunger Games or X-Men type tests to determine their worthiness. From a flood in their dorm room, to keeping a dog constantly by their side and to dive from the skies to land on target while avoiding radars. Meanwhile, Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), the lisping tech tycoon who dresses up like a rap artist is the opposite of the suave secret agents. His evil plan for saving the planet from degradation is to cull the population of the dominant virus. With an app that triggers a micro SIM card installed in each subscriber, he can force aggressive behaviors in humans anywhere on the planet with the help of a satellite. The Kingsman must attack his stronghold and disengage him and also destroy the satellite that would transmit global ruin.\n\nThe action is stupendous in parts. The pub brawl is only an introduction to Vaughn's style of slick, fast paced action but it is the precursor to the final mission, that is Harry's solo rage war in a church that stands out as one of the most brilliantly choreographed action sequences in recent memory. This one can be more astounding than what was witnessed in Kick-Ass. Throughout the movie, Vaughn pushes the clich\u00e9s to new, darker levels that are crazily entertaining. \"This ain't that kind of a movie\".\n\nAlgerian babe Sofia Boutella is the stunning steel prosthetic leg bearing human cleaver who dances her way through some shocking action scenes. As Gazelle, she is a threatening supporting villain who aids Valentine by doing all the dirty work. Samuel L. Jackson is a wickedly cool villain. After playing Nick Fury for so long, it is great to see him in a role where he can really open up and be at his expressive best. Michael Caine also gets to step out of his norm of being the gentle elder in the story and his stubbornness as the head of the Kingsman instigates suspicion and despise at the same time. Quite an unusual way to feel about Alfred. Mark Strong is excellent as Merlin, the resourceful Kingsman agent who sees the recruits through their testing stages and plays a critical role in the climax. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as Prof. Arnold who witnesses the bold rescue attempt in the beginning of the movie by an unlucky Kingsman agent. Taron Egerton is impressive. He plays an East-ender with the same natural ability as he plays a Kingsman with a suit on. Among his best scenes is certainly the one where he hesitates while pointing a gun at his pup 'JB'. Egerton remarkably holds his act well in the midst of such powerful actors. If Daniel Craig can be the hard faced serious agent, Egerton will be the earnestly entertaining one who can still kick-ass.\n\nColin Firth is a veteran of a different genre of films. Therefore, to see him play such a lead role in a movie that mocks a spy genre and involves action that makes even 'Kick-Ass' look amateurish, is just difficult to grasp. Yet, he does so with such ease and finesse. The double-breasted suit was just tailored to perfection for him and he pretty much defines what a Kingsman agent is all about. Kind in his words, gentle in his behaviour but occasionally, needs to let off some steam in a crazy manner. He delivers an equally serious performance as he did in 'The King's Speech' in a movie that is overall just funny and crazy. That, precisely, is his strength as an actor.\n\nMichael Vaughn drew inspiration from Mark Millar's comic book series titled 'The secret service' but quickly altered many aspects of it to add his story-telling style that occasionally goes from stylish to outlandish but it never stops being immense fun. Vaughn pays tribute to the entertaining spy genre but uncannily, forms an alternate one where slicing victims with prosthetic leg blades, exploding heads and stylish gadgets will be common dealings for the Gentlemen who will save the day. Even James Bond would smirk at this job offer."

Kingsman is just loosely based on the original novel so i didn't bother reading it...Movie started with ecstatic visuals and some hard core action...First half is just the routine a crazy villain wanting to save the world making his plans and sorts...and there is always time for some recruits to get scrutinized.... Second half as it unravels villain reveals his plans and it gets better and better..Movie has its moments and some dialogues just big LOL... Colin Firth as always is amazing.His role couldn't have been delivered more better.Samuel L. Jackson as his tagline is \"Mankind is a Virus.And I am the Cure.\"is as bad ass as a villain can be...From his appearance to his plans he is as nasty as it can get,\"Pick of the show.\" Well well well Taron Egerton,as much as i can get what he portrayed in the movie was all Christiano Ronaldo stuff from his facial features, rude look and gestures...I bet he is a big fan of CR7 and he knew similarity beforehand so he went forth with it but if he would only had acted better.Actor needs improvement and some facial expressions rather than being blank faced. Background music is OK...Storyline is the routine..Action sequences are excellent...But still if they make sequels it can only get better and better..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Comic book films have become a genre in themselves over the last decade. The well-known characters \u2013 Batman, Spiderman, Xmen, Avengers etc have been consistently successful which has led Hollywood executives to plunder the more obscure titles in search of the next big thing. Kingsman: The Secret Service is one such title based on the graphic novel, The Secret Service by legendary writer Frank Miller but the difference is this is not a film to take the kids to. But don't let that put you off, it's one of the most enjoyable and over the top experiences you'll see at the movies all year.\n\nKingsman kicks off in 1997 somewhere in the Middle East. Secret agents, AKA The Kingsman led by Harry (Colin Firth) are on a mission to extract information from a prisoner who duly blows himself up, killing one of their agents. It's Harry's duty to break the news to his widow and in turn meets young Egsy (played by newcomer Taron Egerton). Years later The Kingsman are looking for another recruit and Egsy (now grown up and in the midst of a local gang war) comes to Harry's attention.\n\nThe next hour of the film is a cross between The Apprentice and Full Metal Jacket as the potential recruits are tested in life or death situations and whittled down to find the best of the best. In the meantime we are introduced to token megalomaniac billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L Jackson) who is making it his mission to sell his \"product\" to all the world leaders in an attempt to save the Earth from extinction \u2013 of course nothing is ever as it seems and it's only a matter of time before the Doomsday clock starts ticking.\n\nIt's here that the film starts to have fun. The casting of Colin Firth is a genius move \u2013 always known as a gentle type of dramatic actor in his first action role, Firth is let fully off the leash and must've spent months in training for the two brilliantly filmed, and extremely violent fight scenes that are as good as anything similar you've seen on screen before. Taron Egerton \u2013 plucked from relative TV obscurity \u2013 does a fine job and this will no doubt be the start of a new career for him. Samuel L Jackson is good value and can play this role in his sleep and his henchwoman, Gazelle is straight from the Comics and slices up opponents with her blades that double as legs.\n\nThe director Matthew Vaughn (director of Kick Ass \u2013 the copied style of funny, ultra violence here is clear as crystal) is also on great form and handles the action superbly - clearly setting the tone to be an enjoyable ride whilst frequently referencing the old school James Bond films before he went all serious \u2013 gadgets, guns and girls are the order of the day. All in all, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a cracking piece of OTT cinematic excitement \u2013 Mission Accomplished!"

Okay, there were some funny jokes but the special effects I didn't like.\n\nI prefer rather the Johnny English series with Mister Bean even if there isn't so much woman sex appeal.\n\nI will not see the second part if there will ever be a sequel. I find the votes too overrated here. My colleague found it also not so top. For all these reasons I don't give more than 6/10."

It contains nice and lovable characters with some development (you can't expect too much here of course), a great villain and a good share of funny entertainment and some surprises one would not have necessarily pre-anticipated. If you like something like \"Red\" or as mentioned above the old James Bond style to first have some drink after waking up from being anaesthetised that is one to go for.

        "review_detailed_main": "Umbrellas have never been so badass.\n\nWhen I first saw the trailer for Kingsman: The Secret Service, it seemed like a bit of an eye-roller. It looked like a forgettable action comedy with stupid one-liners and standardized action built for people who like movies like Real Steel or Agent Cody Banks. I was wrong. More movies need to be like Kingsman: The Secret Service, and there are three reasons why.\n\nReason number one: It's rated R. This movie could have easily been chopped up and delivered with a PG-13 rating, good for all ages, sans balls (I'm talking about you, Expendables 3). It wasn't. The action here is fantastic, full of glorious head trauma, exit wounds, and broken bones. One scene in particular - set in a church - is one of the coolest scenes you'll see all year.\n\nReason number two: It's an original property. Yes, I know it's based on a comic book called 'The Secret Service', but it basically just borrows loose plot points from it. I wish more studios would take chances on unknown entities instead of churning out sequels, remakes and superhero flicks. That being said, I bet this gets a sequel...hopefully still helmed by Matthew Vaughn. When someone else takes over something that he made, we get crap like Kick-Ass 2.\n\nReason number three: It was fun. It took itself just seriously enough that it didn't border on parody, like the last two Pierce Brosnan Bond movies that nearly killed the series (The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day). There were serious, heartfelt moments mixed in with a ton of levity. It paid a ton of homage to classic spy movies while being a blast to watch. Rarely do I leave movies saying to myself, \"I need to own that\", but this one fit that bill.\n\nThe year is young, but I'm pretty confident that when 2015 is over, there will be no bigger cinematic surprise than Kingsman: The Secret Service. It's not perfect - it drags a bit at points and Samuel L. Jackson's lisp is eternally grating, but every actor aside from him is fantastic (including Colin Firth, which I never thought I'd say), the action is amazing, and the gadgets are fun. If you're into action or spy movies, Kingsman is a must see.\n\nMy final grade - A-"

This isn't another Austin Powers level parody of a beloved sub-genre, for better or for worse. While Bond has added the grit as of late, Kingsman tries its best to emulate it in the action and as a result, it's a film that panders too much and subverts too little. Its idea of what you least expect is a lisping Samuel L. Jackson who serves McDonald's for dinner. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable entertainment if your brain is firmly switched off. It has a nasty habit of plummeting characters into situations that are only really interesting in hindsight of their twists and as a result, they're unsatisfying until the reveal, including the now infamous church sequence. Matthew Vaughn is good at bringing a little bit of Hollywood back home so it is often cinematic though hit-and-miss with its sense of style. The film does do one thing intelligently and that's the illustration of class conflict. But the controversial joke near its end shows the standards its reaching for. Ultimately, Kingsman tries to be a franchise starter without starting with enough of worth. Beats a normal comic book adaptation I guess.\n\n6/10"

Great to see my Brits doing their thing - great writing, directing, effects, music, the spy thing, over the top Monty Python violence and humor. What a great movie!\n\nGrowing up in England, there were lots of British references, but I don't think they are lost too much on international audiences. The special effects are awesome. The music just right - including the best musical orgy of laughs I've ever had.\n\nThe British film industry is alive and well, and this is a spectacular example of the genre. The class juxtapositions were just right, and the use of extensive swearwords fit perfectly. A real treat."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film glorifies sodomy. It mentions \"global warming\" as if it's a real thing. It implies strongly that Margaret Thatcher was not a positive political figure. It portrays Christians as lunatics worthy of slaughter. The foul language is so gratuitous that one has to wonder if the filmmakers think it's clever or what point it is they're trying to make by taking that road. There are no heroes or any sort of virtuous characters to latch onto. The plot is full of holes. I could go on, but suffice it to say that this is low-grade filmmaking and a waste of everyone's time. My wife and I both disliked it and wish we had our afternoon back."

Colin Firth, perhaps one of the last active remnants of the aristocratic legacy of the Queen's culture and coterie at least on the silver screen , stars in this delightfully violent and overwhelmingly recreational movie.\n\nA deliberate digression from self-importance colours up the whole situational setting . We have out of the box action sequences. Seriously worded quips and one liners laced with characteristic dry humour of the Isles. An undercurrent of persistent comic reliefs both cultural and as well instinctive.\n\nThe movie is not shrouded in any contradictory , psychologically complex cryptic conceits . The tale is fairly direct and lucidly directed. One can argue that the movie a tad too long but the intensity of the scenes is such, that one does not deem prudent to as much as utter a pretentious sigh of fatigue.\n\nThose who do not relish violence may find the movie a little distasteful and gross . The kinship to Kick-Ass can be clearly identified in the thematic treatment of the movie. However, the anterior is visually quite different.\n\nThe most interesting and attractive part of the movie is that despite turning into a serious \"The Spy Saves the Day\" type of flick in various sequences, it doesn't in the least bore you.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson animates the cast . Mark Strong does a fine job with an interesting character sketch. Taron Egerton also exhibits fine acting skills .\n\nOn the whole a very entertaining movie . They should produce more such movies. Reduction in violence can qualify it to be a strong candidate for classic summer blockbusters of the 90's.\n\nI found the movie quite good ."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kingsman wants to be a lot of things. A James Bond homage mixed with The New Avengers and a touch of The Man from Uncle. Lets throw in Eastenders as well with scenes set in a council estate pub. Taron Egerton plays the young hero Eggsy and Samantha Janus plays his mum.\n\nKingsman is an independent spy agency with an Arthurian leaning which operates out of a gentleman's tailor shop. When one of the agent dies on duty, Colin Firth nominates a small time criminal (Eggsy) to be a replacement. Eggsy's father was also a Kingsman once.\n\nAll the nominees go through a tough selection process. At the same time the organisation investigates the mysterious disappearance of some celebrities and the actions of a well known philanthropist and cyber billionaire Valentine played by Samuel L Jackson who is concerned about climate change and wants to give away free sims, free phone calls and internet.\n\nValentine obviously watched that episode of Doctor Who where the dastardly villain used mobile phones devices to control people's emotions.\n\nDirector Matthew Vaughn as with the Kick Ass films uses strong humour and cartoon violence although in this film, the violence has a video game footage look about it. I do think an anal sex gag at the end was misplaced!\n\nThe film is entertaining enough, makes you laugh a few times but lacks a lot of originality. Maybe the comic book it is based on is itself been inspired by many other film and TV sources.\n\nIn short its a fan-boy remake of a James Bond film from the Roger Moore era. However hearing Samuel Jackson describing spies and megalomaniacs also reminded me of the film Unbreakable which itself was about people with superpowers and super-villains and Jackson had a major role in that film as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is one of those movies that grabs you by the stones and doesn't let go until the credits roll. I haven't seen any of the spy films that it pays homage to, but if they're anything like this I'll get right on it. The basic story is about a young man, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who joins a super-secret spy organization, helps save the world, and becomes a better person in the process. The entire cast did an incredible job playing their characters. You have seasoned veterans like Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson. And then there is newcomer Taron Egerton, who is a revelation. He has a suave, cool attitude to him that really sold the character he played. Not only were the performances excellent all-round, the actors looked like they were having a great time, which spills over onto the audience as a result. The action sequences, an important part of a film like this, were also really good. Matthew Vaughn has a way with kinetic action (see: LAYER CAKE, KICK-ASS) and he delivers that here. Although the editing and camera-work pushes the boundaries of comprehensibility, the geography of each scene was never in question. The crown jewel of these is a scene in a church set to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird. If you aren't on-board with the film at this point, maybe it isn't for you. If there's anything that be said negatively about the film, the characterization of the villain might not sit well with some people. There also was quite a lot of CGI enhancement. And, there's one sexual joke/scene towards the end that could come off as crass, but I thought it was consistent with the type of film this was trying to be. Generally speaking, all of the complaints that could be made of the film have (to me, at least) a valid explanation. It's a highly entertaining film with a good story, excellent action, and a great sense of humor. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!"

I've always liked movies where the main character evolves into a bad ass better version of himself. The fighting in this movie is definitely above average violent. John Wick recently..i didn't love the movie, but i did appreciate that the violence and fight scenes were more graphic than usual. The scene in the church in this movie was very reminiscent of the scene in the Japanese restaurant in Kill Bill. Also worth noting....I remember reading that Tarantino had to make that scene black and white to get around the censors because there was \"too much\" blood in that scene. There is a scene towards the end of this movie where some animation was inserted in lieu of horrific graphic violence, which i thought was hilarious. There are also movie lines that stay with you for the rest of your life, \"I am your father\", etc... and this movie has might what go down as the single greatest line in movie history...taken in context..who said it...the situation, the fact that it was out of the blue and seemingly out of character for this person, and the other persons response to it...was just great. If you like Bond, Men in Black, Mission impossible, 24, etc....and you have an above average sense of humor, go see it. There are so many movies that are just recycled and lacking in originality...its nice to see a movie that contains elements you don't normally see."

I think they managed to come up with an entirely new way of shooting a fight scene which involves having many long takes that are rather rare in fight scenes.

But the final third is a complete riot, from the scene in the church onward - I guess thanks to the director's worship of Hong Kong action films. Colin Firth did his own stunts. LOL. The fights are a bit repetitive in style, although amazing to behold, and it goes full 007 parody in the end.\n\nOverall, though, it lacks the satire of the equally ambitious Iron Sky.\n\nThe problem I have is with the politics. This is a real London film - loads of money to deliver a stylish, full-on neoliberal message that Big Men Rule, democracy and liberty are sideshows. The members of the club might as well be sitting round the cabinet table in Downing Street.\n\nAt one point the hero says saving Thatcher from assassination was a pity, but Thatcherism runs right through this story. All that east-end stuff? It's a fantasy - a great chunk of London's population has been deported from The Great Wen tax haven in the last 10 years because of neoliberal policies.\n\nAt least there are clubbable heroes to save us from ... the corporate club.\n\nSamantha Janus is still a babe.

It gives the audience the perfect room for a perfect level of \"fantasy\" combined with reality (for instance, the tailor shop in London).\n\nThere was no mucking about in this film. You are not given the time or the need to try delve into everything that is happening. You are not asking yourself 'why' is he doing that? what is the meaning behind that action? That symbol? etc. The film does not require you to wonder beyond what is necessary. In most of the \"superhero\" films these days we wonder what the back-story of the hero is - why is he the way he is? I was surprise to realize at the end of the film that not once did I really try to fathom where all these characters CAME from. They were just there doing all these amazing stunts and looking so dashing in these suits and I really appreciate that about the Kingsman. It is just PURE FUN. You are given the movie to enjoy and enjoy is what you do.\n\nEverything is straight-forward. The story really does seem simple when you think back on it but at the same time, everything is done in such a DETAILED manner and that is what allows us to enjoy it as it is.\n\nI found this movie just completely refreshing and original.

Egorton) is certainly the most (or rather the sole) psychologically complex character in the movie because he is the only one undergoing an inner development from a Hooligan nobody to a Gentleman hero.\n\nHowever, they both are somewhat overshadowed by the lisping Samuel L. Jackson and this certainly just because of his funny lisping which makes him one of the most bizarre movie villains since \"Jaws\" in James Bond.\n\n\"Gazelle\" (Sofia Boutella), the razor-harp woman and bodyguard on his side, entertains as a dangerous mixture of \"Cherry Darling\" from \"Planet Terror\" and \"Gogo Yubari\" from \"Kill Bill\".\n\nPolitically incorrect killing sprees and fast-paced close-combat fighting scenes together with caricatural characters and one or two laughs constitute the fun factor of this movie which might not be enough for a more demanding viewer who has seen tons of movies like this one."

        "review_title": "High-octane, violent, and decidedly over-the-top in its roots, Kingsman is a clever spy action spoof blooming with witty humor and style",
        "review_detailed_main": "This spy action comedy sees English director Matthew Vaughn taking the classic James Bonds films and spinning them into a sweet, yet audacious comedic spoof. Following his success with 2010's 'Kick- Ass', which showcased a tongue-in-cheek approach at the superhero genre, Vaughn orchestrates a fast-paced action vehicle that echoes the classic 007 flicks, but with an over-the-top, stylized approach that allows for a reasonable examination of what an R-rated James Bond mixed with raunchy humor would resemble. Although the film proceeds with a mean- spirited streak and experiments with humor in unapologetic territory, Vaughn crafts his concept with wit and cleverness. There is rarely a moment that goes wasted in the final product. And most importantly, the film is fully self-aware of what it is and does not aim to take itself too seriously. That is the beauty of what makes Kingsman a hell of a lot of fun. This film follows Eggsy Unwin (played by Taran Edgerton), a young man in his early twenties, the son of a former British spy who was slain in a mission gone awry. Following his arrest for a petty crime, Eggsy come face-to-face with Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad (played by Colin Firth) who introduces him to a secret spy organization known as The Kingsman, headed by Chester King (played by Michael Caine). Their goal is recruit spies and train them to defeat an maniacal millionaire tech genius named Richmond Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). With a mind-controlling chips inserted inside the brains of millions of people around the globe, Valentine's evil plan is lead everyone on Earth to kill each other and start a new world order, and with Gazelle (played by Sofia Boutella), a martial arts woman with prosthetic legs with blades for weapons, on his side. So it is up to Eggsey and the rest of the Kingsman to stop his diabolical, or face an unspeakable global disaster.\n\nMatthew Vaughn clearly has his tongue in his cheek when approaching the classic spy genre, with characters spewing references of James Bond sporadically throughout the picture, along with the various action elements owing homages to the British spy of cinema. Does the director's comedic approach work? In many ways, absolutely. The movie follows a plot that is almost never meant to be taken seriously, as opposed to the more darker elements that escalate a few scenes. When the action kicks in, there is plenty of violence and a wild barrage of raunchy dialogue and humor taps at the funny bone, while echoing the bold comedic-style of 'Kick-Ass'. It is hard not to indulge in the fun of Colin Firth beating down the bad guys in a bar, while admiring the slick, stylized execution of the action. In the process, the director always keeps things moving and almost never lets any jokes go to waste. There are a few moments where Vaughn tends to push the envelop with his comedic streak, particularly for the conservative right. Easily the scene that best demonstrates this is one involving a violent massacre at Baptist church filled with a hatred-spewing congregation, apparently paying homage to Westboro Baptist. On the other hand, this film never fails to have a good time while allowing you to turn your brain off. Colin Firth demonstrates a humorous streak with subversive dialogue and raunchy jokes. Mark Strong, playing an ally of the Kingsman gets the job done. Samuel L. Jackson, playing a maniacal villain with the persona resembling Dr. Evil from 'Austin Powers', shines with suitable over-the-topness of a villain with a morbid, yet humorous energy. Then there is Taran Egerton, playing a naive young man going from zero to hero, who evolves with solid charisma.\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is a high-octane spy action comedy blistering with rewarding comedic energy and fun that is simply irresistible, at least for those who can skim past the questionably bold humor. Matthew Vaughn lives up to his directorial talent, surpassing the over-the-top superhero spectacle that was 'Kick-Ass'. To say the least, this movie is a total blast in the realm of graphic novels."

They just didn't show you the training as you have to understand that's the boring part. The saving the world was the storyline and what was important.\n\nPeople just need to pay more attention to understand that time passed. The tests they showed were to prove they were worth continuing on in their training.\n\nAnyway, this film started strong and went through the entire show strong. The humor is subtle and again, you have to actually pay attention and it all makes sense. At the end my husband was like, I can't wait for a sequel! I had to agree.\n\nI love the twists and turns and it kept us wondering what the evil guys game plan was. What did his invention do?"

        "review_detailed_main": "My wife and I watched the trailer for this film two weeks ago and she wanted to see it and I didn't. Seemed a silly sendup of the spy genre badly miscast with Colin Firth in a lead role and shot in a frenetic style. Surprise, surprise. This is the most fun we've had at the movies in a long while now.\n\nColin Firth is exactly right for his part. He deftly wavers between dead serious and quiet amusement. Not once did I think even for a moment that anyone better known for action movies could have done half as well. He's very entertaining and in a lot of ways the film revolves around him to its benefit.\n\nI found Samuel L. Jackson's lisp a bit distracting and a little off-putting, but no deal breaker. The character I was most intrigued by was Gazelle the villain's henchwoman played by an extremely comely Sofia Boutella who would make an impressive Bond girl. Throughout she's a delight to watch doing evil despite her having no feet.\n\nThere's humor here and a good sense of fun. But I can't say I'm that enthused about a sequel though the main character here, Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is quite good. His transformation here is pretty impressive, but he's awfully young.\n\nOf course, I started out thinking the movie was going to be boring, and I was quite wrong about that. I could be completely wrong about Eggsy in a sequel. I do know they've racked up enough goodwill with me that I won't be able to resist taking a look."

The movie brought unpredictable twists that surprised an audience that is used to know the whole story by the trailer and guess the end by the first 20 minutes of movie. But, really, those were conjunctures that didn't bring anything new to the structure, I feel like we saw the same Hollywood things, just under a well-confectioned mask."

Still, with some productions, it makes sense to know beforehand. With Thor: Ragnarok, I knew that Taika Waititi was directing and that it would be completely different from the previous MCU productions.\n\nKingsman bears the signature of Matthew Vaughn, who was responsible for Kick-Ass, among others. And in the end, Kingsman is similarly twisted, as if a British Tarantino had been allowed to shoot a new James Bond film persiflage with Taron Egerton, Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nThe less seriously you take the film, the more entertaining it is. It has a lot of details, a dope cast, great production design, is bloody, brutal, funny, and has almost no boundaries. There is a reason why it is rated R. Thumbs up."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't know this movie existed before I went into the theater to watch it. I hadn't read reviews, I hadn't seen trailers and I didn't even know it was based on a comic book (which I haven't read either). I just happened to stumble upon it in my weekly trip to the cinema and, since there wasn't anything else worth watching (that I hadn't seen) at the moment, I decided to try my luck...\n\n... Glorious, if I'm going to use one word to describe this film, it is that one. After having watched, in theaters, a string of depressive dramas and offbeat comedies (mostly last year's Oscar nominees and some art-house movies) in the past few months; this movie reminded me why I love the seventh art so much: it's just shameless, stylized, escapist and balls- to-the-wall fun.\n\nThe first thing I want to comment on is the acting and I'm not going to focus on the veterans (it's pretty much a given to expect amazing performances from Firth, Jackson, Caine and Strong; even if, in the case of Firth and Jackson, their roles are quite outside their comfort zones) but on our protagonist. Egerton plays the role with panache, comfort and emotional depth unusual for someone who is pretty much doing their first big role and in an action/comedy flick no less. There's no moment in the movie in which I could say he isn't Eggsy. He clearly threw himself to it and had a blast, there's enough conflict, audacity and (to use Merlin's words) \"cheek\" to spare. And he also did most of his stunts to boot.\n\nThat leads me to another fantastic asset of the movie: the stunt work. The action setpieces are just things of beauty and although everyone mentions, and with good reason, the church scene; my favorite moment occurs at the end and it involves a lot of parkour. It's mesmerizing.\n\nThe comedy is also spot on and perfectly timed, Galahad's line in the church is flawless in every sense, and that's just one moment.\n\nThe soundtrack, both the compositions for the movie and the pre-existing songs, fits like a glove and sets the mood of each scene seamlessly. Of particular note is one of the most inspired uses of \"Free Bird\" I've heard.\n\nIn the director's seat, Vaughn does a great work of letting us see all this in the smoothest way possible, he has an eye for genial moments that he puts to great use.\n\nHere's hoping it gets enough money to warrant a sequel and this one isn't messed up like certain other of director Vaughn.\n\nAll in all Kingsman gets a 10/10 from me (and it's the sixth movie I've ever watched to get that rating). I'm not claiming it is a landmark masterpiece of cinema but, as far as escapism go, this movie does achieve perfection."

        "review_title": "A Terrific Blockbuster Sometimes Marred By Its Violence",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard not to miss the early days of James Bond, when the adventures were colorful, 007 was spryly unserious, and the villains were ready to rupture with their European shaded, cackling madmen personas. Such wondrous cool exploded in the early Bond franchise that it isn't unrealistic to watch \"Goldfinger\" over and over again. Cheekiness goes a long way. But now we have the \"modern\" Bond (introduced in 2006's \"Casino Royale\"), who is as sophisticated as ever but is hardly the Technicolor nympho he was in the pre-Brosnan days. He's become a spy grizzled and cynical, more quick to grimace as he goes through the motions, a smirk completely unheard of. I like \"Casino Royale\" and its sequels (\"Quantum of Solace\", \"Skyfall\"), but I miss the days when British spies weren't always well-oiled machines of slickness \u2014 agile, action-packed ridiculousness is much more satisfactory in the long run.\n\nI suppose I wasn't sitting around and waiting for a movie like \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" to come around and sweep me off my feet, but it's the kind of blockbuster needed to invigorate the incessant rut of superhero franchises/gritty action movies. Here is a movie so cartoonishly brash in its thrills I couldn't help but reflect back on \"The Avengers\" and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\". Cheesy yet impressively tactical, both were 1960s spy shows fully aware they were telling comically insane stories most of the time \u2014 but through a competent use of gaudy violence and disco ball flashy characters, silliness became sly while everyones tongue remained firmly in cheek.\n\n\"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" is a parody of sorts, self-aware in its cocktail infused kookiness but ready to pay homage when it comes time to hearken back to the days when Roger Moore was kicking every bad guy's ass as he held an unrealistically sexy woman at close quarters. This film's biggest issue is its violence \u2014 while oft comical, there are several gratuitous scenes of bloodshed that hardly match the snickering tone of everything else \u2014 but when \"Kingsman\" succeeds it manages to soar; it's a puff of crisp air following the pollution of its staling super-suited counterparts.\n\nWith a lively wicked performance from Jackson, \"Kingsman\", like one of its characters suggests, is as good as its villain: exaggerated, bombastic, agreeably oily, though a little too violent. Indeed, the majority of \"Kingsman\" is an amusing take on what the Bond franchise could have been, had 007 been seventeen and let loose in a maze of rated-R obstacles \u2014 but sometimes, the film goes too far, a shame when so much of it sits a cut above other modern blockbusters.\n\nMy most prominent issue lies in the constant profanity and the sometimes disturbing violence. Though I don't liken myself to the most prudish of people, tonal issues arise through \"Kingsman\"'s inability to figure out if it's joking or if it's a bit sick in the head. The fight scenes are astonishingly well-choreographed, haphazardly exciting in their fast-motion dexterity \u2014 but somewhere during the halfway mark, the film sours once it sets a mass slaughter in a church.\n\nThe scene, finding its setting in Kentucky, serves as an introduction to Valentine's new technology, which causes even the most peaceful of people to become violent with just the click of a button, thanks to their Valentine designed cell phones. Unfortunately, Harry Hart is visiting, ending with him killing every single person in the building. Vaughn, who directs most of the film charismatically, decides that such an act is excusable as long as the people are despicable (think the Westboro Baptist Church) \u2014 but the murders are less cutely \"Kill Bill\" and more gory horror movie violent, the acts mostly shocking and not thrilling. The scene ends with a man getting a stake stabbed harshly from the bottom of his face to the top: are we supposed to laugh? Irritating is how much more focus is put into these scenes of gratuitous terror being placed upon innocents while the post-credits sequence leaves Eggsy's beating of his stepfather off-camera. Personally, I would rather my screen violence be justified rather than simply there to be cool. But that's just me.\n\nIf my review sounds negative, don't pay any attention: the previous two paragraphs exist as one giant complaint. Fact is, I liked \"Kingsman: The Secret Service.\" Taron Egerton, reminiscent of a snarky young Guy Pearce, has serious potential to become a movie star. You certainly won't look at the normally smooth Colin Firth the same way again. And Vaughn (\"Kick Ass\", \"X-Men: First Class\"), for the most part, gives us a strictly fun action movie, full of terrific lines and thrillingly choreographed brawls. I just wish the film had an understanding that violence has to match tone, and for a movie so ready to charm us, we shouldn't have to buckle up and grab our barf bags right after we gleam during a witty exchange. I wouldn't want to have my martini stirred instead of shaken, now would I?"

There is violence but it is comic not Quentin gross. The good thing is the sense of humor that stays throughout the movie. The gadgets are inventive. There is a variety of settings and scenarios that keeps it interesting.\n\nTaron Egerton in the lead role is likable and his cockney accent is understandable. Unlike some of recent British comic action movies in the past like the Guy Ritchie movies, all the accents are quite easy to make out thank goodness. Good supporting actors with Mark Strong, Michael Caine and as well cast Colin Firth as a mentor. He is best in these kind of supporting roles. Samuel L Jackson plays the villain with a lisp.\n\nDefinitely worth a watch - especially for those who aren't watching 50 Shades this President's Day weekend."

Perhaps my biggest praise for the movie was it leaning into the R rating; for the type of movie it is, I'm shocked they even went for R. The frequent profanity never felt forced and the blood, although lamely CGI'd, was appreciated. Of course, the whole stereotypical villain plot of world domination via some insane ploy was cringe, but I guess that's what they were shooting for. Unfortunately, given the prevalence of humor, or at least the outrageousness of the plot and Samuel L Jackson's annoyingly silly character, I couldn't take any of the dramatic moments seriously. Still, entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "The last time that my dad tuned the channel to BBC, he shut off the TV, claiming that the Brit mentality had tired him out in less then five minutes. My poor father, as I'm a big fan of British television, especially of comedies like Mr. Bean and Blackadder. It might be for the funny accent as I found their sound very fancy, but it may also be for the mindset on how they process ideas. With Doctor Who and The Avengers (not the Marvel heroes, but a spy series). I've always seen their thinking as more out of the box and oddball. Who else but the British would have come up with something like Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\nOne of their most well known properties are the 007 spy movies. They too had that British set up as we had a super human that had a lot of strange gadgets, cool vehicles, and an actor that can both kick butt and be very suave. The course of the films have gone from being realistic to almost science fiction-like. This had put fans at a crossroads of where something like Skyfall would fall. For those that want a return to the more outrageous should come to Kingsmen: The Secret Service.\n\nWhile on a mission in the Middle East, secret agent Harry Hart (played by Colin Firth) witness a fellow agent killed by enemies. He visits that family back in London where he gives a young boy a medal that has a phone number to call should he need help. We cut to years later as the boy has grown into Eggsy Unwin (played by Taron Egerton), an unemployed youth whose intelligent was once training in the royal marines. He's arrested for steeling a car and finally takes up the phone number to see what happens.\n\nEggsy get's released from jail, as paid for by Harry. With a vacant slot open, Eggsy is recruited to apply to join. He sees what Harry is capable of when he fends off a set of drunken ruffians with his fighting skills and an umbrella with gadgets. Eggsy meets up with the other possible candidates while Harry investigates billionaire Richmond Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson) with the too good to be true free cell phones and Wi-Fi he's giving away. Eggsy meets up with the head of the agency, \"Merlin\" (played by Michael Caine) but fails his next test, sending him home. But when something goes wrong and Valentine may be looking to take over the world, Eggsy may be needed to be a kingsmen after all.\n\nKingsmen: The Secret Service made me realize that it's been a while since I've seen a spy film like this; one that totally embraces the tuxedos and fine taste along with the high tech weapons and machines. The Bourne series was a more realistic spy movie and the 007 movies still have the strangeness, but relies on being more of a blend of the old and new ideas.\n\nKingsmen: The Secret Service is more of a comedy-action movie then anything. Oh there are some action scenes (some really good ones!), but I was surprised with how much fun I had with the spy sequences and the witty banter.\n\nColin Firth is one actor I would have never pictured as an action hero, but I now see that no one else could have played this guy as well as he did. Samuel L. Jackson is great as always, really loving his role as the villain. Newcomer Taron Egerton is a force as he had movies like Bond and a sassy mouth that could also lead him to be a comic star. He could go wither direction.\n\nI'll give this ten umbrella guns out of ten. The Kingsmen: The Secret Service is another British creation that I hope both strikes a cord with American audiences and sparks a series."

The film is also fun because it has excellent action choreography, unrealistic yes, but excellently over the top and satisfyingly brutal. In this movie, one man can fight a hundred, often quite literally, as shown in a glorious church scene where our man ends up the last man standing in a church riot. Although the plot is quite fantastical, the film still manages to retain an audiences attention because it is tautly paced and well acted, especially the performances of Eggert and Firth. All in all, a delightful adventure which should not at all be objectionable."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was absolutely PERFECT! So much action, so hilarious! It makes fun of cheesy spy movies while also adding parts of them into the script! Incredible actors make this movie the greatest spy movie ever! I have already seen it 3 times in cinemas and I do plan on going as many more times as I can fit in before it ends, I'll be pre-ordering the movie as soon as I can! Such an amazing movie, I would give it PERFECT scores no matter how the ratings were recorded, 1000000000/10! I recommend it to everyone (as long as they're over 15, some parts are a bit bloody)!\n\nI've never seen Colin Firth in an action movie before and he should be in so many more, he's so great at being a spy! The other actors are also amazing, and the movie wouldn't have been the same without them! I hope there are sequels because I would watch this movie a million billion more times before I even got slightly bored (I probably won't ever get bored of this movie)."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie started off pretty well, but it soon went downhill when I realized what kind of movie this was. Such troll, would be how I would describe this movie. The jokes are so corny that it just felt too ridiculous. OK, it was quite funny at times but not enough to make up for the rest of the ridiculousness.\n\nThe story itself is also a little typical. We have the bad guy, corrupt people in high places, the good guys, and the novice spy who becomes a professional during a crisis. And though I should be glad that this film did not have a typical romantic ending, in this case I will make an exception.\n\nThe character of the bad guy played by Samuel Jackson is just so offensive that I can't believe it. First off, he is of dark skin, which wouldn't really have made a difference except that in this case he had a lisp. So on top of being overall racist (black person playing a bad guy), they are emphasizing that racism by giving him a speech impediment (black people can't speak). I am hoping that this is the result of them so subtly bringing to light issues/ stereotypes by blatantly showing it.\n\nThe swearing and the gore. Oh my goodness. Really not necessary and adding to the ridiculous factor. I'm not a fan of swearing at all, but in some cases I concede that it actually helps to get the point across. But overusing it is definitely too much. The gore in fighting scenes too was a little much. The fireworks is ridiculous.\n\nThough the gore was too explicit, the action scenes were actually pretty good. In fact, they were great. The camera work, fighting, editing, all worked together to create great action scenes. The music helped too.\n\nThere is a lot of big names in this, and they all played their part relatively well, but it does not change my mind about what I think about this film. I am also thinking that a lot of the humour in this film is 'British' so it is subtly but in a blatant way, showing all the things wrong in cinema or the world today. I don't know. Please let it be satirical.\n\nRead more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

It wasn't a movie I was dying to see, but I was bored and thought I might as well give it a shot.\n\nI'm so glad I did!\n\nIts a funny movie, but action packed, and a bit gory at times but the filmmakers managed to combine all of it together and pull it off really well.\n\nTaron Egerton did a fantastic job and really made the movie what it is, and that end scene... OMG couldn't stop laughing!\n\nI would definitely recommend seeing this film and it's really open to all ages 15 years plus."

Samuel Jackson played an antagonist but with caricature . and his claim for the notoriety wasn't much established ."
