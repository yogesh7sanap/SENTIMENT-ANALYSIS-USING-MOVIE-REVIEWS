        "review_detailed_main": "After watching this movie, I just couldn't stop talking about it. Mind you, not in the sense that someone can't stop talking about a great book or show, but more along the line of how someone can't stop talking about their colonoscopy during a diner conversation. In other words, after seeing this you can't help but try and remove the stain it left on your very soul by vomiting out the experience onto others.\n\nThis movie entered with the tag line of being \"written by two of the six writers of 'Scary Movie'!\" What they forgot to mention is that the two who wrote it were only responsible for writing the credits and all the jokes deleted for the sake of not causing mass suicide. Put more delicately, this movie almost makes Pootie Tang look Oscar worthy, which ironically enough was made fun of in the last Scary Movie for being horrid. Coincidence? Yeah, not even some sort of Karma dealing fiend would wish this movie upon the world.\n\n\"So,\" you ask, \"What makes it so bad?\" I bet your thinking that all of the funny stuff was in the previews, right? No, actually there was no funny content in the previews at all, it just seemed that way when taken out of the context of the movie. Much the same way \"Hogan's Heroes\" was funny to people who weren't in Auschwitz during the Holocaust, the previews are funny to those who haven't seen the movie. When you actually see the movie, you start to ask, \"Why was that funny in the preview?\" The answer: You can see pretty flowers if you ignore the fact that they are growing from the corpse of a man who died during a freak green house accident.\n\nDo yourself a favor, rent a History channel documentary on the history of documentaries and hit yourself in the head with a hammer. It'll be twice as funny, make three times more sense, and be only a fifth as painful."

Some of the parodies seem completely out of place and don't even fit into what little plot there is.\n\nI couldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even those I hated."

        "review_detailed_main": "I will admit I didn't see this until a couple of days ago, and I was really hesitant of seeing it, after reading a lot of negative reviews on the film, and after seeing the excrement that is Disaster Movie. And let me tell you, after seeing this travesty for myself, I can't agree more with the negativity. While not quite as monstrous as Disaster Movie, Epic Movie(more like Epic Dud) is a truly terrible movie. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities here. The humour just isn't funny. It is crude, vulgar, over-familiar and even contrived, and the constant flashing of breasts was way overdone. The acting was really amateur, Jennifer Coolidge and Carmen Electra get my vote as the worst actresses in the movie, and believe me that is not saying much. The Willy Wonka spoof was just as tired as the movie itself. And as a parody of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and chronicles of Narnia, it falls well short in terms of sophistication. The writing is unbelievably bad, the characters are annoying and the plot just isn't there. The music was awful, and the pirate rap was torturously bad. I will say right now, that I don't like any of the recent Friedberg-Seltzer movies, merely because not only do I feel that there is a complete lack of comedic talent in their films, but also their films come across as a complete waste of time. And just like Disaster Movie, I seriously was considering turning the film off 20 minutes in, that's how painful I found it. All in all, probably not quite the worst movie ever, but along with movies like Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Freddy Got Fingered, it is close. A complete disaster of epic proportions, and one to avoid, even if you're thinking of renting. I'm not trying to sound harsh, I am just trying to explain as much as I can what I feel about the movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

Although, I did get a good chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway mark.\n\nIt's hard to meet the minimum post-length requirement for this movie, because there isn't much to say about it.\n\nI didn't find any of the gags clever. Nor did I find them funny. I did think some of the set designs looked okay. The casting directors also found someone who looked surprisingly like Jack Black, although sadly the script didn't give him anything funny to do.\n\nJust avoid this. It's not even worth a rental."

I ended up slightly laughing to some of the pathetic vulgar stuff. Even the potty humor in this movie was really really bad. ( Worse potty humor ever!) I am a pretty big fan of potty humor and immature stuff ... but what this movie had to offer was sadly disappointing with what was presented. Aside from the humor there was many rap music type scenes where the characters were participating in a lamed down style of a MTV music video... many of these scenes were unnecessary or too much and far from entertaining. They were more or less not enjoyable and far too many like them. Now to the good parts of the movie ... trust me I'm trying hard to find em! Many movies were parodied and you will probably recognize most of them and there is an occasional scene where they throw characters from other movies in for the hell of it just to have them in the movie. I also liked the rap dance scene (only one i liked) where they were doing a Pirates of the Caribbean rap dance. It reminded me of Captain Dan the Hip Hop Pirate..I wonder if they were trying to parody that guy? Well folks there wasn't much more to this movie other than a waste of time and disappointment."

And only a few minutes longer than a regular TV show except without interesting commercials, it is highway robbery to make anyone pay to see this half-baked movie where writers, producers, actors and directors have only put half an effort to do something that at least would be satisfactory. And half is giving them too much credit. Unfortunately for Kal Penn, Jennifer Coolidge, Faune A. Chambers and Crispin Glover (you waited for this movie to return to the big screen? where were you last couple of years? in detox?), I won't be running to the theatre any time soon to see one of their movies any time soon.\n\nStudio decision-makers have to take a stand against these movies-and so does the industry. Pre-teens, teens and young adults have shown that they have interests in seeing well-written, acted, developed and intelligent movies. Don't take the easy way out to do these useless piece of junk."

Why Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge would be in this I have no idea. But Crispin Glover?

Perhaps someone could find it offensive if one of the movies they are joking about is your favorite. But this is the main purpose of a parody, to cut up other films. I really enjoyed how they tied in so many different movies into the one. It was cooling seeing the doubles they picked to act as famous actors, in all honesty they did a great job with portraying who they were pretending to be. I personal enjoy parodies for what they are, over the top silliness that makes no sense other then to cut up other films."

Wait, scratch that; Hollywood doesn't just hate us; they think we're stupid, insignificant creatures of habit, too. That we're nothing but a bunch of mindless apes willing to throw our hard-earned bananas down on any old piece of crap they manage to squeeze out that week. And it saddens me to acknowledge that to a large degree, they're right. We do throw our bananas down on just any old thing, as proved by \"Epic Movie\" being number one at the big B.O. opening weekend. How could we be so stupid as to fall for a film boasting a lame concept written by a bunch of comedic hacks who think \"I'm Rick James B***h!\" jokes are still relevant--let alone funny? I feel sorry for people like Kal Penn, Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, and Crispin Glover who seem to have become so jaded with their careers that they could confuse accepting this cinematic skidmark on their resume as something remotely resembling a good idea. Especially in Penn's case, as he's on the verge of shattering the Kumar image most people still associate with him.\n\n\"Epic Movie\" is supposed to be a comedy, but there's nothing funny about it. Every joke falls flat due to either being poorly executed, uninspired, or just plain irrelevant. I'm all for parodies, but this film is so unfunny; it's not even funny.\n\nOh, and next time--God forbid there is one--for \"Epic Movie II,\" why not try parodying truly epic movies? \"Spartacus\" or \"Citizen Kane\" or \"Battlefield Earth?\" At least try to follow your own stinking premise...for once."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't expecting much when I paid for my ticket to see this film, however this was the first time I actually considered leaving the theatre in the middle of a film because it was so bad.\n\nThe main issue about this film is originality. This movie is merely a re-shoot of all the films it parodies with different actors. There is no originality in the script, the writers seemed to just bundle a whole heap of scripts of the movies they were parodying together and added childish slapstick bits here and there along with repetitive MTV references that never varied. This made the film boring.\n\nThe main parody of the film is The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Those who have seen the film want to see a clever parody not to see every scene in the film re-enacted by terrible actors. If the movie had been any longer than 90 minutes I swear I could have shot myself.\n\nThe film also recycles old jokes used in other terrible Friedman and Seltzerparodies. For example, Peter, Edward, Susan and Lucy are meant to be siblings and have the same parents yet are portrayed as a mix of black and white actors. This joke was used in the abysmal Date Movie, as the biological family consisted of a black father, Indian mother,and white and Chinese daughters. This joke was not funny in either of the films.\n\nNot Only does the film recycle old jokes from previous parodies but also recycles jokes within the movie, Jayma Mays kicking the beaver wasn't funny the first time, so why do it again.\n\nI just hope Friedman and Seltzer run out of genres to make films about.\n\nThe film does nothing but expand on the trailer, I recommend that if you want to see the film, watch the trailer and save the money you would've spent on the movie ticket."

It was so flat, even the actors seemed embarrassed. Obviously the studio was planning on hyping the movie knowing that the first weekend is all the movie was going to have. Yes, there were a few (and I do mean a few) funny parts, but this entire movie could have been condensed into a MadTV skit that would have been just perfect. I literally fell asleep during the movie. Now, how many people do you know that fall asleep during a \"comedy\"? I absolutely will not be attending another movie from these guys until after the first few weekends. I know if you were like me you would have to go see it for yourself and make your own determination, but please, I beg you, do not see this movie, do not buy or rent the DVD. If we support garbage like this, they will continue to rush out these terrible movies hoping that dopes like me will rush out on opening day to see them. We need to send a message. I know they made the entire investment back the first weekend, but good god almighty."

The theater was quieter in laughter than when I saw Children of Men! There were a couple of funny parts in the movie and that's why I'm giving it a two.\n\nOverall, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!

I choose to watch this, I will NOT dignify it by calling it a film as I don't want to sully the word, this thing out of morbid curiosity at just how bad a bottom 100 rated thing on IMDb could possibly be. I was not ready for this inept 'spoof' film that is cringe-worthily unfunny The lame pansy ass shots at movies actually spells out what the spoof they're doing is from!!! So it's not only vastly unfunny, it also treats the audience like some severely mentally retarded sloths (which, I'll concede, is in likelihood the coveted demographic they're going after). EVERYone involved in this soul-sucking piece of rancid dog feces should not only be deeply deeply ashamed of themselves, but should actually be sentenced to do community service of some kind. I think it's current standing of 43rd worst thing of all time is actually way to optimistic, as it's not one of, but THE worst supposed comedy I've EVER seen in my life. Trust me I've seen a lot and suffered through many a bad film. But in all sincerity this thing is as painful an experience as having a gravel enema, while your eyes are held open by rusty priors forced to see grandma provide fellatio to a sickly dog who gets so exited his bowels go and he defecates in a baby sister's mouth which she gulps down with delight. No wait, this is worse MUCH MUCH worse. Now i'm not a movie snob in the least. my tastes range from Shawshank redemption to Polyester. From Die Hard to The Toxic Avenger. I love spoof films like Airplane, Naked Gun, Kentucky Fried Movie and Scary Movie (the first one).But I sincerely do NOT want to meet anyone who even chuckled once at this abomination. It's utterly and supremely horrid in every single conceivable way, from the wanna-be Anna Farris, Jayma Mays to the proof that Kal Penn in Harold and Kumar was his highest achievement in life to the brain numbingly so called 'spoofs'. David Carridine, do you need the money THIS badly? Carmen Elektra, what in the hell were they holding over your head?? must have been supremely embarrassing indeed as you were married to Rodman. Fred Willard, where the hell did your career go??? Poor poor Kevin \"Kids in the Hall\" McDonald how could you slum this badly?? Lastly (and i DO mean lastly) to Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer: How can you hate all of humanity with such a passion as to inflict these travesties on us. Every single film you've done thus far, and likely in the future, is complete and utter sh*#. You've totally bypassed other horrible incompetent film makers as Uwe Boll, and others that names escape me at the moment. You're both the worst.\n\nMy Grade: F"

No. This movie even made Darrell Hammond look like an amateur (and I think he's a pretty gifted comedian). What the heck was up with 'Samuel L. Jackson'?\n\n2. Topicality. The previews showed scenes borrowed from some pretty recent flicks. -Er... Punk'd? Scarface? 'I just saved money on my car insurance'? What, no Tom Cruise jumping on a couch?\n\n3. Touchstone cameos by 'real' celebrities, ala Dr. Phil in Scary Movie 4. -Nope. Nada. Zilch. Unless you count Crispin Glover doing a bad Johnny Depp doing a bad Johnny De... wait, see, I told you these spoofs were eating their tails.\n\n4. Alright, I'll admit it, I expected LAUGHS.

Epic Movie failed horribly at any of this, and didn't even make me smile. I think my favorite part, and the best parody was the Queen's MySpace, only because I have a strong dislike for that website, and it captured so many pages I've seen far too well...\n\nSo anyway, it's a large disappointment, as the last Scary Movies/as Date Movie has been; looked funny from the outside, terrible when actually seen. The writers could have done better than to string poorly done, over-used, unfunny jokes together for a...SHORT film, may I call it! Fair enough if you're making a long movie, I can see it a little hard to make every joke good. But this wasn't even a long movie - and not even one joke was funny. Sheesh.

Why was it successful? Are you all insane? I borrowed this movie from a friend out of sheer curiosity and still feel ripped off. He even warned me that it wasn't worth watching. And I liked Space Mutiny.\n\nDo anything besides watch this movie apart from self mutilation and you'll find it more enjoyable. Not even recommended for bad movie survivalists."

This is perhaps the only movie I've seen with less intentional laughs and less artistic merit than Battlefield Earth. An achievement in and of itself, well done I suppose. If you want a more pleasant experience than watching this, perform some major surgery on yourself or throttle a loved one to death whilst listening to the Spice Girls.\n\nIf this movie had a plot, characters or anything else that goes towards making some sort of coherent piece of cinema I missed it. The best acting by the people involved was done during the interviews in the run up to its release and on the red carpet during the premiere when they pretended they didn't want to cover their faces in shame.\n\nIn summary... spend your money on something more worthwhile, like burning it."

I find it funny how they are supposed to be parodies of the clich\u00e9s in movies, yet become clich\u00e9d themselves. Just add some pop-culture references in and you have yourselves a comedy!\n\nSome scenes in this could have been funny, but were too long and overdone. Some jokes and scenes can make someone simply giggle or smile, but overall, none are truly laughable. These types of movies have no use in this world, honestly. Why are there people spending money on these movies? Or, an even better question yet, why is money being spent to make these movies?\n\n'Epic movie' is an 'Epic' failure.

I totally agree with it's abysmal 2-star IMDb rating but I fail to understand why it's not in the Bottom 100. Everything about this movie is stupid. The gags were hideous. Not a single point in the movie that I actually found them funn...er..'funny'. But (suprisingly) I actually found one thing funny about this movie. It's the attempts for laughter. The film makers spent like a year pointlessly trying to whip up laughable script jokes to entertain the audience, when in the actual film, they ended up not delivering. How dumb?! And the film characters that they were 'trying' to mock! Narnia, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean?! I mean come on!! You're just mocking yourselves! Overall, I'll sum it up by saying the film makers wasted a year of their life trying to make this junk and every bad word in this word describes how lame this movie is. One of the worst films I've ever seen. Epic Movie? Should be called Epic Failure!"

There is a line to be crossed with that kind of 'comedy' and it was definitely crossed. All it seemed to be about was sex, half naked girls, racial jokes and general lameness. I don't think I laughed at all but maybe smiled at one point. Some parts of it seemed to be completely random and irrelevant. Maybe it's just that American comedy isn't funny, or that this movie took it to a whole new level of dumb. It's also very short, which I suppose is a good thing because any longer and I might've walked out. The person I went with agreed that it was rubbish. I think that'll do.

They must now defeat the White B!#ch from her plan to destroy Gnarnia and create a Super-Continant. As i have said before a lot of the jokes fell flat, this would have to be worse than Disaster Movie, as the only thing that i enjoyed here that wasn't present in DM was a story, all in all this film has simply 20 minutes of hilarious jokes and then 60 minutes of bad ones.

That's one of the many things this movie gets wrong, a reference is funny only when you put the right spin on it. Nobody in the real world will laugh if I just say the word: Spider Man. Because I refer to a Marvel superhero but say nothing funny about it. That's how most of the movie's references work. The ones they try to make a parody out of are just ruined one way or another, and without a proper storyline with actual effort put into it, that's really all the film is hanging on.\n\nThe film is terribly unfunny from start to finish and all I could think of while watching it, was: \"Make it stop\".

Secondly, making jokes about other bad movies like Nacho Libre is sad and really makes you realize how little effort was put into this production. Next, we come to the mediocre acting, I could have done a better job if I had been high on quaaludes while reading a script backwards. This film is a striking testament to the stupidity of our nation and the lack of innovation in American Cinema.

I laughed exactly four times throughout the whole movie, which is a rather bad quote for a comedy.\n\nThe main problem is that although the imitations of the original movies are rather well executed and the famous-actor-look-alikes really look similar to their counterparts, the directors somehow confused simple references to famous movies with being funny. Their interpretation of a gag consists mainly of people/animals getting hit, preferably in the crotch. Gets pretty dull after the, erm, 20th time? In conclusion, the movie is so boring it's not even worth watching it for making fun of it. Doesn't work, just a wast of time. Really.\n\nPS: As this movie was a box-office success (!), expect more of this crap in near future. Which probably will become another success due to a huge marketing campaign...

It's not even bad enough to laugh at. In comparison to another bad film, Snakes on a plane, was humorous as it was so poorly done. This however is just lame.\n\nRating 1/10 ( There was no 0 option)"

        "review_detailed_main": "When you hear the title Epic Movie and also hear that its a spoof, you automatically assume that it will be spoofing such movies as Lord of the Rings, Lawrence of Arabia, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven etc. In this respect when I first heard the title I will admit I was a tiny bit intrigued. And then the trailer was released, my respect for the movie and its concept went dramatically downhill from there until now I sit before you having seen a movie that really, really, really is the most excruciatingly example of poorness that you will ever find on the cinema this year! You see Epic Movie decides to spoof such movies as The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lione, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Snakes on a Plane, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest, Superman Returns, X-Men: The Last Stand, Borat, Nacho Libre and oh way too much more as well. I can accept movies taking the mickey out of other movies, admittedly I quite like the Scary Movie franchise, sure Scary Movie 4 was a bit of a letdown, but that movie at least has some inventive ideas around it. This movie didn't have one half decent or remotely funny idea at all. When you sit there wishing you were watching the real Nacho Libre when you're watching the Nacho Libre spoof on this you know there's something horribly wrong with the movie. This fails at everything, the idea is pathetic, the cast are pathetic, the jokes are pathetic, hell even the sets are pretty pathetic. And that's the key word for this movie, pathetic. Its like a hyperactive five year old jumping in front of you for the entire movie, its basically screaming at you for attention, and no matter how much you ignore it it just keeps coming back for more. Its a mesh of horrid jokes ranging from slightly (and emphasis on slightly as I didn't even smirk) funny, a beaver getting kicked, to pretty bad (a Mystique scene where a man wants her to become a fat woman), to excruciatingly awful (the horrible Kribs sequence) to just plane suicidally awful, the Punk'd spoof. Epic Movie is neither epic, nor funny, its just a wretched thing that's wondered onto cinema screens and unfortunately the morons of our society have decided to lap it up, which undoubtedly means Epic Movie 2 is being wrote as we speak, god help us all! The major problems with Epic Movie fall into the fact it is not funny at all, ever, not even a teensy weensy bit amusing. And another fault is that it dares to take the mickey out of things that are funny in their original movies. Borat for example, now the mickey take here is ludicrous, and actually I'm still baffled as to how Borat got into this movie at all. But sure enough a man trying to act like Borat shows up, imagine Borat but without a joke and that's what he's like here, just simply walking on for the hell of it. The movie also decides to laugh at Johnny Depp's performance in Pirates 2, except here it seems like a man doing a poor Keith Richards impersonation more than anything else. The scenes where he waddles about singing an odd Pirate rap didn't make me laugh, they just made me sit there with my mouth hanging wide open as to why I am enduring this monstrosity. Then it tries laughing at the movie Click, I haven't seen Click so I can't really comment, but I still don't understand how they tried to take the mick out of it. They even repeated the slow down time to see a woman run joke in this movie, and it was lame here. But the movies ultimate, ultimate mistake is daring to try and laugh at Snakes on a Plane. It falls flat on its face, dramatically so. Whoever let these people try and write something funny about Snakes on a Plane needs to be forced to watch this movie back to back! I mean, what's even slightly amusing about a man trying to be like Samuel L Jackson and repeatedly saying \"I've had it with these goddamn snakes on this goddamn plane.\" And saying it at least ten times in a row! My other big moan before I call it a day and try to recuperate from watching this thing called a movie, I will basically slag off the actors as much as possible. First up is Kal Penn as Edmund, now he's probably the least eye gougingly annoying of the lot, but by the time he's on screen with Jack Swallow (the annoying version of Jack Sparrow) you get sick of him. Adam Campbell is definitely the worst male in the movie, he is just ridiculous. He does a brief Superman parody that irritates more than anything else, and the fact his ludicrous English accent just sounds well ludicrous made me despise him even more. The two lead girls are equally as awful and both deserve to stand in a corner, and bow their heads in shame. But the two cast members I'm still amazed that signed on are Crispin Glover and Jennifer Coolidge. Glover is in a disturbing but unfunny parody of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Coolidge tries to scrape some laugh as the main villain, she fails dramatically. Why these two talented actors signed on is above me, and why they even read the script still amazes me as well.\n\nEpic Movie is another front runner for worst movie of 2007. I thought Employee of the Month was bad, Employee of the Month looks like a masterpiece compared to this wretched movie. Avoid at all costs, no burn every cinema showing it down, it made stop the spreading of this plague like film."

This movie was totally garbage and whoever made it should be ashamed of themselves. Hollywood is turning out some real crap these days. There are enough problems in our world today.

Though you know most of the parodies, they are slightly different. It is an okay film but too short, it might be one of the shortest movie. When you watch it, you hoped that the directors had put more action, parodies, made it funnier and longer. There are some slight parodies like the \"Superman\" scene, it is just only for one part, it is been wished that the directors could extent the parodies. Overall, this is the first parody movie I like, others like scary movie and date movie were crap. You might not want to watch it in cinema but at least watching it on DVD."

I regret ever even thinking of seeing this movie and figure anyone who does like it should be shot and buried. I like most comedies and have no problem with tasteless humor, but this movie just wasn't funny. It was just tasteless and boring. Utter garbage that seemed to take hours to play out. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, but it never did. Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. If I could get all the writers and director of this heap of turds on film, I'd have them tortured and killed. This would at least be a little bit funny, unlike this movie."

I am a fan of dumb, low-brow, stupid movies, but this didn't even make me crack a smile. The best part of the movie was the trailer for Reno 911: Miami. Please don't support this trash. My friends and I walked out of the theater wondering how this movie actually got made. What movie executive could have thought this was funny. It's obviously a big-budget movie with expensive sets and effects. It was number 1 over the weekend which just proves how many idiots there are out there. There were even a few funny actors in this, IE Fred Willard, even he couldn't save this awful, terrible movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "You can see by the overall user comments what a steaming pile of manure this 'movie' is. From the moment of David Carradine's humiliation (his lowest ebb on screen for sure)in a skit on The Da Vinci Code trundles on to screen at the start, you know this will be a train wreck. In my long history of watching films, this is without doubt the worst thing I have witnessed on the big screen. I hear Disaster Movie was pretty awful but 'Fool me once...' and all that, I dodged the bullet of watching it.\n\nThe whole mindnumbing experience is simply a series of pathetic spoofs of blockbusters, with the merest thread holding the weak storyline together. Basically, there is no point going into what little plot there is as you would need a death wish to watch it after the sound advice on this site. Of course, some of you will watch it to see if it is indeed as bad as people are saying. Trust me - it is. And it's not funny in a 'so bad it's funny' kind of way. This is no Plan 9 From Outer Space! Oh deary me, no. This is a *ahem* 'comedy' which , unless you are stoned out of your mind, drunk to the eyeballs AND under 10 years old, will sit stony faced throughout. In fact, you will likely sit quietly seething, grinding your teeth and clenching your fists.\n\nThe idiots responsible for this detritus should be imprisoned for crimes against humanity. As for the actors, it will be a stain on their careers for as long as they live, and sadly even longer. If you want more high brow laughs and entertainment, go and poke a dog turd with a stick."

The plot is ridiculously boring and there aren't even jokes. To me it seems like the writers did not even try to be funny here.\n\nThe movie begins with a parody of Willy Wonka, which sets the tone for the entire movie of badness. From there on, the movie consists of a bunch of people getting hit in the face over and over and over again. Most of the movie parodies The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe with stabs at The Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, Harry Potter, Click and some others. None of which are really that funny (There is a funny line about Harold and Kumar go to White Castle and that is probably the only funny \"joke\" in this movie.) The whole thing is rather pathetic on all ends. Even most of the cinematography was awful.\n\nPlease do not go see this movie, because it just encourages them to make more. Heck, any movie that this one parodies is much more worth seeing than this waste of film."

I usually stay to the end because I keep hoping that something will happen to make it worth it, but this time, I just couldn't do it.\n\nThe acting was horrible. It looks as if the script was written by the writers by simply going on a drinking binge then eating a lot and then throwing up, looking at the random chunks, and then trying to visualize letters that formed words, and then writing those imagined words down as the script. Then what you see on the screen, is the end result.\n\nI love spoof movies. Naked Gun series was excellent. The Scary Movie series was pretty good as well. Scary Movie 1 was excellent; number 2 was good, 3 had a few good moments but wasn't that great, and 4 was about as good as number 2.\n\nI do love a good spoof movie and had hight hopes for this movie. The trailer made it look great (as they are supposed to do) but in the end, it was simply worthless. I can't even believe it got the green light to be made. Another disappointment is that they had some good actors for what they were doing and they still couldn't pull it off. Jennifer Coolidge, the White Bitch, was great for that role. She is good in these types of roles but it didn't help. Really, she is the ONLY one that was any good in any of the roles.\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie yet, DON'T GO!!! Don't even rent it on video, it's not even worth that. I know there are a few people that have given this a rating of 10. I would say that they were either joking, being sarcastic, or slept through the whole thing and didn't want to admit it.\n\nSimply put, don't bother!!!!"

I only laughed at a few parts and I left the movie disappointed. The vulgar language was annoying and I heard other people who went to see the movie discuss how disappointed they were as well. I do not recommend this movie, it was a disappointment and not funny at all just boring, stupid and offensive. Fairwarning, I am going to tell you a spoiler so don't read beyond this point...\n\nThe movie is basically The Chronicles of Narnia just redone to incorporate other movies such as the x-men, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Carebbean, the Divinchi Code and more.

The plot line was stupid making parodies at box office smashes such as 'Harry Potter' 'Narnia' and 'Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory' and it is not a patch on other parody films like any of the 'scary movies' or 'shaun of the dead.'\n\nI walked into the cinema thinking it would be quite a good laugh but 20 minutes in i was ready to walk out - but my 11 year old sister wouldn't let me. I also felt there was a lot of wasted talent in the film. Jennifer Coolidge is a brilliant comic actress but her performance in Epic Movie was cringeingly bad. Overall the funniest bits of the film were in the trailer and only 4 months into 2007, i can safely say this is the worst film of the year!!"

Jackson, Mel Gibson, and especially Johny Depp as captain Jack Swallows. That guy that played him (captain) should get some award for the impression.

        "review_title": "A sign of the Apocalypse",
        "review_detailed_main": "The fact that this horrid piece of trash got the green light is definitely a sign of the apocalypse. I'm a big fan of the parody, as a genre. We've seen great examples of it in films like \"Airplane\" and \"Kentucky Fried Movie.\" Fast forward about twenty-five years later and what do we have? \"Epic Movie.\" How anyone can laugh at something this juvenile is completely foreign to me. First of all, it's supposed to be a parody of \"epic movies,\" and almost no epic movies are parodied! Do you consider \"Snakes on a Plane\" to be an epic movie? Do you consider \"Nacho Libre\" to be an epic movie? And many of the films being made fun of aren't that great in the first place. The first rule of the parody genre is to poke fun at \"good movies\"! You don't insult bad movies, because a bad movie is an insult within itself! Duh! The filmmakers didn't even make honest attempts to make each gag funny. In the parody of \"Snakes,\" an amateurish black actor plays Samuel L. Jackson and repeatedly yells out \"I'm tired of these G.D. snakes on the G.D. plane!\" Obviously, he didn't say \"G.D.,\" but the point is in the real movie he says, \"I'm tired of these motherf**kin' snakes on the motherf**kin' plane!\" But of course, that can't happen because ooooh, then the film will be slapped with an R-rating. The idea of people under the age of 17 not being permitted to see this trash is positively frightening to the studio. If you ask me, no one with an I.Q. OVER 17 should be permitted to see this movie. What I'm basically saying is the joke doesn't work because he's not even saying the same line! The joke would've worked if, first of all, the directors hired a much better actor who does a much better Sam Jackon impersonation, and second of all, used the line that was in the original movie. Because there has to be a \"truth\" to every joke! Speaking of bad actors, the cast consists primarily of amateurs. The directors probably could've snagged better actors from a high school play. There are some exceptions like Kal Penn, Tony Cox, and Fred Willard (who has the one funny scene in the movie), but obviously they're not given much to work with. I assumed at first it was Crispin Glover that played Willy Wonka in the parody of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" but then I said to myself, \"No! Crispin does a movie, like, once a decade.\" Sure enough, it was him. Say what you want about Crispin's real life persona, but he usually has much better taste in films (i.e.: \"Back to the Future\" or \"River's Edge\"). He must've been horribly desperate for a paycheck when he volunteered to participate in this amateur hour. Hector Jimenez, the actor who played Jack Black's friend in \"Nacho Libre,\" also has a role in the film. It makes me glad that his character said few lines in \"NL.\" Obviously, English is not Hector's first language, and he butchers every line of dialogue with his strained delivery. I always say it's important when you do comedy to hire actors who speak English as a first language. If that sounds racist, I'm sorry, but unless you're playing a Harpo-Marx-type role, comedy is all about inflection. Watch the movie \"Chasing Papi\" if you want to see a good example of an American comedy being executed badly by actors who don't speak the language very well.\n\nAbout the only incentive to watching \"Epic Movie\" is getting the chance to see Carmen Electra prance around half-naked throughout most of the flick. But even that welcome eventually gets worn out, since we later get \"treated\" to a scene where Carmen transforms into a fat woman with a unibrow. What is this trend with making Carmen do something horribly unappealing in every comedy she does? In \"Scary Movie\" there's a scene where she farts. In \"Scary Movie 4\" there's a scene where she takes a gigantic dump. Is this a conspiracy to stop men from fantasizing about Carmen? Sheesh! If crude, brainless gags about puking and peeing is your cup of tea, then \"Epic Movie\" may be the film for you. But I do suggest if you do enjoy it...please schedule an appointment with a therapist. Or make an appointment for a cat scan, at least."

For SOME INSANE reason my friend wanted to see this movie in the theaters. Well after seeing that I vowed to NEVER watch that movie again.\n\nI was at another friend's house one day and they had RENTED this for some reason (I must have some retarded friends or they at least have TERRIBLE tastes in film I guess...at least some of the time). One of them wanted to watch it. I ended up having to sit through a majority of it a second time. Well it turns out the second time was the \"unrated\" version (it just had different takes of the same shots where they said the F-word instead of what they said in the theatrical version of the film). It was no longer. Thank God. It sucks that it wasn't made shorter though because this film is TORTURE to sit though even ONCE.\n\nUp until seeing Epic Movie, the \"worst film I had ever seen\" title went to a movie my friend showed me one time called \"Malibu Beach Vampires\". I have seen parts of \"Malibu Beach Vampires\" since watching Epic Movie and \"Malibu Beach Vampires\" doesn't look like such a bad movie anymore.\n\nI'm serious, I have NEVER EVER seen a movie that I just absolutely HATED the entire time I was watching it, but THIS is the first. I have disliked movies, I have not been able to stand some movies, but there has NEVER EVER been a film I just completely hated before I saw this film. They try to make everything so wacky and it's just SO BADLY GRASPING for laughs that (when I saw it in theaters) no one was laughing! They think that the more retarded hip hop musical sequences and midgets there are in this movie, the funnier it'll be. Well I'll say it was more and more clich\u00e9, stupid, and annoying the more it went on.\n\nThe film relies more on parodies than it does a cohesive story or any jokes that are actually supposed to be funny. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer I cannot stand you two. I hate to say it but you two SUCK. Your previous films have been \"parody\" comedies (if you can even call them comical in ANY WAY) and just recycle previously used jokes. A joke is funny when it's the real thing, not when it's a rip off, generic version of the same joke that was previously told in a better fashion.\n\nJason and Aaron, I hope that you two never make another film again (even though sadly they ARE making another film) because your movies are unoriginal, generic, filled with horrid acting, reused jokes, and just abominations in the eyes of God and all of his people (which includes the entire human race). I'll say it again, before seeing this movie, I have never EVER just outright HATED a film but Jason and Aaron, your movie SUCKS! I intend to be a filmmaker myself and I can say that the few shorts I've made will entertain people more than this piece of trash.\n\nDO NOT see Epic Movie if you want to keep your soul in one piece. After watching this trash, I feel that a part of me has died and I want my money back for having supported this horrifying abomination. If Jason and Aaron expect me to see their NEXT film, they will have to pay ME because Epic movie was one of the WORST things I've ever witnessed in my life and will be one of those things I will shield my kids away from seeing some day. I hate this film."

At the time I saw the trailer, I wanted to see it but had no idea that this was created by two talentless hacks. I did kinda look funny in the trailer but again at the time I had no idea how bad this would turn out and the worst part about this is they made even more of these godawful parodies and I even made the same mistake again and even saw Meet The Spartans. While that film was slightly better, it was still pretty damn awful. If I had a time machine I'd travel back to 2007 and warn my 18 year old self not to see this movie and that it is awful and downright unfunny and that he could spend his $5 elsewhere, maybe on some fast food meal, anything than this godawful film. A word of warning, don't buy this, rent it, watch it on Netfilx, or even YouTube for that matter. It is not worth your time, in fact rent Norbit or Jack & Jill instead. Yeah both films are still pretty awful, but they are watchable compared to this piece of crap film. In fact, any comedy not made by Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg is better than this film, no matter how bad they may be. Avoid like the plague OR ELSE!!"

Especially when that joke is usually someone getting hit with, something?\n\nThat sounds about right."

And sadly, these previews were probably the only parts of the movie that could be shown on TV. This movie was raunchy, rude, disgusting and just plain foul. I suppose if that is your sense of humor, then it will go over very well for you. However, for me, it was all in very bad taste. I wasn't one bit surprised when the family in front of us with 3 young boys under the age of 13 left the theater about 15 minutes after the film started. This was certainly not intended to be a kid's movie. I don't even think I would let a teenager watch this one. It took one of the best kid's movies ever made and turned it into a nightmare. We felt it was so bad that we immediately had to go see another movie to get the bad taste out of our mouths and the horrible images out of our heads. Parents BEWARE! This is not an appropriate movie for anyone under the age of 21!! And even then, I wouldn't suggest it. For those of you who actually liked this movie - I feel sorry for you and your sense of humor!"

When Edward, Peter, Lucy and Susan each follow their own path, they end up finding themselves at Willy's Chocolate factory. Walking through a wardrobe, they discover the world of Gnarnia, which is ruled by the White Bitch. Meeting up with characters such as Harry Potter and Captain Jack Swallows, the newly reunited family must team up with Also, a wise-but-horny lion to stop the army of the White Bitch.\n\nSo two of the six writers of Scary Movie (as we keep on being reminded in the trailers so we don't forget) have come up with another 'parody' movie, but is it really necessary? The story is awful and lacks just about everything. The characters are made to be dumb for cheap laughs (yet again), the acting is a joke as none of the cast could act if their very lives depended on it and the direction was torturous. The worst part is the jokes and the funny scenes, they weren't even funny at all. There really is nothing to review since the whole movie is just a joke.\n\nI watch these movies to see whether it can get any worse and they do. I still can't believe they were involved with the Scary Movie series. Epic Movie is nothing more than a comedy that anyone below the age of five would find funny. Terrible.\n\nRead more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

It's an Epic Failure for Jason Friedberg. I don't think I watched the ending because I was so bored. It is a stupid movie with people who cannot act to save their lives. There is a lot of crude humour which normally I don't mind but it wasn't that funny when they said it. I really do not recommend anyone to see this because after watching this you will feel so angry for wasting your money."

Its childish immature humour makes the film sound and look like it was written by a 9 year old child.\n\nThis is the only film i have ever walked out of the cinema while watching and the only comedy I can remember where i failed to laugh at all, not even a slight chuckle. the jokes are horrendously awful and they even go as far as steeling...THEIVING from Laural and Hardy a joke that only they could make funny(its the \"OUCH you standing on my foot\"/DA vinci code bit) awful i hope you agree.\n\nI am trying really hard to think of a reason why studios make films of such a consistently low standard. parodying films that are much better (borat) and films that are a lot better but still not that good (snakes on a plane-most unfunny parody of all time). The reason is that the make money and there is indeed a market for them, that is perhaps the scariest thing of all.\n\nover all id say this film is a disaster there are times where i may say \"not my thing\" or \"I can see why people like it\" but no. I find it hard to believe that an actual human could find this funny but then again A LOT of people must have. DEAR OH DEAR!!\n\nIF you are thinking of watching it, DO!! so then you can inform everybody of the horrors that EPIC MOVIE has to offer.

Fact is we had to turn the movie off because it was just so horrible we could not watch...... that has not happened since White Chicks which we left the theater on during the first 20 minutes.....

Willy Wonka parody but hes drinking river of poo!!! Narnia parody but the sick man/goat is giving the male beaver a sloppy wet kiss (with tongues)!!! The English guy has a hot girl (not even that hot cause she's blue) in his bed but he is wishing to change her into flabby granny arms and \"junk in the trunk\"!!! And there is more endless vomit and toilet humor!!! Horrible, sickening excuse for a film!!!"

I think I made it to the scene where Crispin Glover started break dancing before I blacked out completely only to be woken by the screaming of my cat.\n\nAfter putting the cat down (I couldn't let it suffer) I resolved to finish the movie in the same way I was determined to survive those terrible years at the Hanoi Hilton. To my surprise the ending credits did not usher in Armageddon and since burning (it took several attempts) the DVD and scattering the ashes the migraines and nightmares have ceased entirely. I hope this works for you.\n\nEpic movie is by far the worst parody movie ever made. I can't think of another attempt at comedy as insipid as this. Period. It's as bad an attempt at parody as George W Bush's attempt at a presidency was. Please stay away. Go watch Airplane instead. You'll feel better about yourself in the morning."

How these guys keep managing to make more films (Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, and now Disaster Movie) amazes me. The only half-way funny parts are when Kal Penn mentions \"Stiffler's Mom\" and says he thinks he's been to White Castle before. American Pe and Harold and Kumar were good comedies.

Not children, considering how many unfunny, vulgar potty jokes and sleezy sexual gags are in it. It couldn't be made for adults, since any reasonable adult would turn it off in disgust after 10 minutes. I'm not easily offended and usually really like spoofs and silly, juvenile humour. I laughed my fool head off at Naked Gun, Airplane, Dumb & Dumber, Hot Shots! and others in that vein, but the difference is that they're FUNNY.\n\nI thought I had seen the worst movie ever when I watched the Wicker Man last week. Wrong! Epic Movie hits lows never before seen. In comparison, The Wicker Man is Oscar worthy, and it was a million times funnier.\n\nIf badly done, crude gags about pustule popping, testicle smashing, vomit and poo/pee make you laugh, this is the movie for you. If not, don't see it, not even for free. Whatever you do, do not pay to see this or you'll want cut your throat afterward.

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this film for the first time in September 2013, with my wife, broadcast on TV quite late at night. Not paying to see the film, not seeing it in 2007, and seeing it after some of the actors have become more familiar provides an altogether different perspective, and possibly this film's reputation deserves some rehabilitation.\n\nThe fact that we only started to watch it during the 'Nacho Libre' scene and didn't change the channel immediately I think has to be a sort of recommendation. In fact after settling into it we managed to watch it through to the end. And it wasn't completely terrible!\n\nThere's a mixed bag of humour, from very obvious visual gags, contemporary cultural references and parodies, and the whole storyline is creatively stitched together in a kind of absurdist humour, reminiscent of Monty Python.\n\nIt was quite nice during the character introduction to recognise actors like Jayma Mays, Kal Penn, and later Jennifer Coolidge, from their later appearances in hit US comedy shows: Glee, How I Met Your Mother, and Two Broke Girls. But of course six years ago they were still relatively unknown, and so that dimension of familiar recognition would have been lost. Shame. But it speaks highly that the casting director picked out such talent back then, and they each play their roles quite well.\n\nAs a TV movie it definitely works, and approached with low expectations can be pleasantly surprising. It doesn't look 'cheap': the indoor sets are very creative and well finished, the photography is pretty good, and as mentioned the talent also delivers. It doesn't take itself seriously, at any point, and frequently breaks the fourth-wall to remind you of the kind of movie that you're watching.\n\nEven the cultural references have a kind of a point now. This films dates itself very firmly by references to the source material of the time (all of which I saw back then) so it was nice to be reminded of those other great films that I did enjoy, six years ago. I doubt I'd watch it again though. I certainly would not have paid money to see it, but then professional film critics never pay either..."

I knew the title was just as abysmal as the content!\n\nThe funny thing is, I haven't seen any of the movies ranked lower than this. It's officially the worst movie I've ever seen.\n\nSince I'm obliged to say why it's so bad: The jokes are distasteful for any age group, the parodies are weak, the cast literally could not be worse together, and the plot is so aggravatingly predictable and boring (from what I can remember -- I refuse to watch it again).\n\nCongratulations to my brain's waste management system.

Watch clips online, because any money you could spend on the DVD would be a colossal waste. Makes me wonder why they continue to tape these.\n\nWithout a doubt, a model for what Golden Raspberry prospects should aspire to."

In fact, I will go ahead and say the producers are not good at all. They think of the most random things to make fun of and jam it all into one movie. In the end, it turns out that the movie makes no sense whatsoever. It also includes very immature \"jokes\" where someone gets hurt, such as getting hit by a car. If anyone should enjoy these movies, it should not be any teenager/adult. People need to stop watching them because the producers see that the people will buy tickets to see their movies and they keep coming out with more crap."

Throwing a character in from one movie and having them a) fall down b) engage in a crude toilet humor or c) make a joke out of the original punch line IS NOT FUNNY Example: ---Superman getting shot in the eye and the bullet hurts him, wow incredibly hilarious ---Samuel Jackson repeatdley yelling a derivative of his infamous line from \"Snakes on a plane\" ---The appearance of Borat, that movie was already funny you idiots! ---Nacho Libre? WTF? That was already a dumb comedy, you don't make a joke about a dumb comedy! Many of these movies weren't true 'epics', Borat was not an epic, neither in content nor length, Snakes on a Plane is not epic (and is already a parody of B-Movies) And all the movies were from the last two years, what is that? Finally, cramming way to many references into one film is just stupid, stick with one genre/movie Only see this if you want to rant about how terrible it is"

If we take a look back at \"Airplane!\", we actually see some timeless jokes, and overall a funny movie. This, however, is the circumcision and a mockery of parody movies. I honestly cannot watch a parody movie now because of the scar that these filmmakers have left on me with their epic piece of crap,\"Epic Movie\".

I ended up slightly laughing to some of the pathetic vulgar stuff. Even the potty humor in this movie was really really bad. ( Worse potty humor ever!) I am a pretty big fan of potty humor and immature stuff ... but what this movie had to offer was sadly disappointing with what was presented. Aside from the humor there was many rap music type scenes where the characters were participating in a lamed down style of a MTV music video... many of these scenes were unnecessary or too much and far from entertaining. They were more or less not enjoyable and far too many like them. Now to the good parts of the movie ... trust me I'm trying hard to find em! Many movies were parodied and you will probably recognize most of them and there is an occasional scene where they throw characters from other movies in for the hell of it just to have them in the movie. I also liked the rap dance scene (only one i liked) where they were doing a Pirates of the Caribbean rap dance. It reminded me of Captain Dan the Hip Hop Pirate..I wonder if they were trying to parody that guy? Well folks there wasn't much more to this movie other than a waste of time and disappointment."

Epic Movie trades in good plot, character development, proper story telling, and creativity for more and more efforts to try and get a laugh, but it doesn't work. Not only is it unfunny, but they do a lot of references in the movie. I like subtle references, but Epic Movie is not subtle with it at all. There's one part in the movie where Harry Beaver tells them, \"I'll meet you at Aslows. May the force be with you.\" How on earth is that funny? Epic Movie does a lot of obvious references attempting to be funny. It doesn't work. There's also a lot of pointless montages, like when Mr. Thomnas shows his house on Cribs, or when Willy Wonka tortures the kids, making candy out of them. (I'm not making this up.) How does this benefit the story? This movie doesn't care about plot or anything not named comedy that can make a movie good. It only tries to be funny, and fails miserably. Why was this even made?"

I'll explain the best I can. I saw this movie when i was younger in the theaters, and i was with many of my mischievous friends. We were in that stage when being the biggest menace to society and crude as possible was cool and fun. We sat down and watched this movie in the theater, and laughed our butts off. Wanna know why? Because we were kids who didn't care about the \"plot\" or anything like that. We just wanted to laugh and have a good time. And the crude jokes just made that easier for us. We didn't expect to see some \"work of art\" or something like that, we expected to see a batch of crude jokes and stupid spoofs of movies we have seen. I guess you can call it immaturity. But thats what you need to enjoy this movie. Any person can realize just through the trailer that this movie is going to be obnoxious, so you don't need to expect some \"work of art\". Instead, see it with your friends, enjoy the crude jokes, and chill out with all of the preppy critic stuff."

AND IT WORKED!!! if u just relax and laugh at the stupid jokes they actually begin to be funny!!! if u walk into the theater thinking this movie is going to be a piece of sh*t then it will be, but if u just think \"this is going to be a stupid but funny movie\" then it will be. after i saw scary movie 4 i left the theater demanding my money back, but after seeing this (with my good attitude) i was laughing still 20 minutes after the movie was over! i gave it a 7/10 because it didn't make itself its own but instead did many jokes from other movies but it was still enjoyable and funny. but i do suggest renting it when it comes out because even though i liked it, i still wish i didn't spend $10 on it."

        "review_title": "When will they make 'Funny Movie'?",
        "review_detailed_main": "My Take: A one-joke movie? I never thought there were any jokes at all!\n\nThe tag-line of the posters of EPIC MOVIE (as well as its infamous predecessor DATE MOVIE) says that it was brought to us by 2 of the 6 writers of SCARY MOVIE. Why couldn't they have picked the two good writers? Okay, finding two 'good' writers in any of the SCARY MOVIE films need a little miracle to pull off, but why did it have to be Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? To make this question far more simple, hear this: Did the world really need a disaster that is DATE MOVIE?\n\nWell, enough blaming it all on J&B. As long as this things are making money, this guys have a job. And believe me, this is the worst job you can ever land on a Hollywood affiliation. Exhibit A: EPIC MOVIE. After the 'success' (money can do everything, you know?) of DATE MOVIE, J&A felt \"Hey! People got sucked into that one, why not make another pile of crap... I mean movie?\". And so it is. This time, the choice of parody are big 'event' blockbusters. Not sparing STAR WARS, the film also parodies scenes and story lines from THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, THE DA VINCI CODE, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 2, including lesser not-so-epic films as NACHO LIBRE, CLICK and BORAT. There are more, but it's only a waste to list them all down here. Why is that? Of all the scenes it lifts and references from other movies, none of them really are funny.\n\nJ&B really have to know that, in making a movie parody, it's not enough to simple get the scenes and re-paste them right here, they have to make them funny. And when I mean funny, I mean hilarious. Not gross, icky and poor excuse for a sex joke. But the real term of funny doesn't seem to be on the J&A vocabulary. In fact, I bet if they even try to look it up, they'll end up with the same old fiasco of EPIC MOVIE. Apparently, their taste of humor are far different from the audiences. Still, what baffles me more than this films being god-awful disasters, is the fact that these films actually make money. Seeing this film actually going somewhere after opening night is a sign of the Apocalypse. Has the standards for entertainment really have gone into this?\n\nLooking at the bright side, I bet any of this films won't see the light of day after many years. Someday, a guy runs up to you and asks \"Hey! You remember that movie called EPIC MOVIE?\". And after answering with a \"No\", the guy replies \"Of course you don't! I don't either.\" EPIC MOVIE isn't the kind of movie that stands the test of time. In fact, any movie under the shadow of the infamous J&A will never see light in a matter of years. I'd like to make my testimony of hating this film a little longer, but I have a couple more J&A films coming soon, and I plan to save whatever speeches and adjectives I can think of right now for later. For now, I say don't see EPIC MOVIE, and when I mean don't see it, don't wait for it even when it comes to TV. Unless if you, like me, haven't seen a bad movie for a very long time, and really wanting to hate something real bad. Then, in that case, EPIC MOVIE is a movie for you.\n\nRating: 0 out of 5."

Edward (Kal Penn) who has just been thrown out of the monastery, where he's lived all his life, after insulting the cooking skills of the monks. Susan (Faun Chambers)who, on her way to Namibia to meet her adopted parents (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie), get's thrown out of a plane. And Peter(Adam Campbell), a mutant who goes to a Mutantschool and gets picked on by the other mutants for having comically small wings on his back. They all get hold of four \"Golden tickets\" that gives them a guided tour of an eccentric billionaire's whimsical candy factory. In the factory Lucy finds a magic wardrobe that leads to an enchanted fantasy land called \"Gnarnia\" (for legal purposes), and so the \"epic\" adventure begins.\n\nJason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are two lazy writers who must have seen many Zucker movies but never bothered to stop and think about what it is that make people like these movies or what actually makes them funny. Their formula for humor seem to be that bad special effects, obvious stunt doubles, randomly thrown in hip-hop/musical numbers, low brow potty humor and movie references are by themselves always hilarious no matter what the circumstances are. A few jokes made me chuckle but it's not enough to save this train wreck. It would had been better if they had settled on a main theme like \"fantasy\" and limited it to: The Chronicles of Narnia, Harry potter and the Lord of the rings movies. That, plus a story that is not dependent on the Friedberg and Seltzer formula of \"humor\".\n\nThis is a very bad movie. If you want a good spoof movie, see the \"Hotshots\" movies, \"Airplane!\", \"The naked gun\" movies, \"Top Secret\" or any movie not made by the two hacks that made this \"Comedy\"."

I wont tell you what they are for I hate doing spoilers, but there are a few jokes in there that work and that can make you laugh. PG-13 just doesn't work with these type of spoof and reference movies. The first Scary Movie worked because it's R rated and it works better as gross out spoof comedy and not a toilet humor PG-13 movie. Only see this movie if you want to laugh out loud a few times. If that's not good enough, don't see it all...period. Not as bad as Date Movie, but so close."

        "review_detailed_main": "Earlier this year, probably while \"Epic Movie\" was playing in theatres, I can't remember how, but I came across its page on this site. I had never heard of it beforehand. Seeing that it was in the Bottom 100, I did not intend to go and see it on the big screen, but after it came into stores, I rented it. In the end, I was not left wondering why this parody movie was so hated, and I'm now joining the thousands of others who have given it the lowest possible vote on IMDb, 1/10!\n\nFour orphaned teenagers, Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edward, all win golden tickets to go on an epic adventure! However, while in Willy Wonka's factory, they learn that he wants to use certain body parts of theirs to make candy! They manage to escape, but the evil chocolate factory owner is after them, so they must all find a place to hide! Lucy finds a wardrobe to hide in, but after she enters, she soon finds herself in the land of Gnarnia! Soon, the other three also end up in Gnarnia, and all four of them find themselves in more danger! Their new enemy is the evil ruler of the land, the White B*&#%! Unfortunately, Edward is fooled by this villain and becomes her prisoner, so the others have to try and save him!\n\nWhy is this parody of several movies from recent years so bad? Well, basically because it's incredibly stupid! Now, comedies can be incredibly stupid in a good way, but \"Epic Movie\" is in a very bad and frightening way! Not every single moment of this movie is absolutely disgusting, but a lot of it is! I usually don't have a problem with crude sex jokes and toilet humour, and there's plenty of that kind of humour in this movie, but here, it's done extremely poorly! Terrible \"gags\" include Willy Wonka wanting to use the main characters for candy (especially the \"nuts\" part), a pregnant Hermione (from the Harry Potter stories, but portrayed a lot differently in this movie) farting, Susan throwing up all over the place, the sex scene with Peter and Mystique (from \"X-Men\"), among others! Some of these may be worse than they sound, and the gags that are not outright bad are simply mediocre, so they are of no significance.\n\nI haven't seen every movie satirized (I don't know if \"satirized\" is the right word, more like \"ripped off\") in this spoof, but have seen a handful of them, and they're all better than this, even if some are not that good. Not that good is better than horrendous! The ones I haven't seen, I would probably MUCH rather watch any of them than this stinker! Spoof movies can be very funny, and one can enjoy them whether they're a fan of the movie(s) they parody or not. However, with this 2007 flop, it's the opposite! It doesn't matter what you think of the movies lampooned here, because this horrible excuse for a movie is unacceptable either way! What was everyone involved in this steaming pile thinking?! Trust me, if you have any taste whatsoever, and the word \"intelligence\" means something to you, you do NOT want to watch \"Epic Movie\"! I don't know how long this will stay in the IMDb Bottom 100, but for however long it stays there, it's a good place for it!"

Well, I like some plain, shallow fun sometimes, its a great relief from everydays worries and stress.\n\nSo, although warned by all kinds of reviews, I went on to see this one after all. But, what do you know, they were actually right for once! Not only are the jokes not funny, but the movie totally lacks a proper story. It's basically a big pulp of sketches that are done randomly, then stitched together in the hope they will form some kind of movie. They try to make fun of movies who are already more crazy than this one, like the Borat movie, and it just does not click.\n\nurgh, no, I wasted too much time watching the movie already, so no point wasting more time writing about it. Do yourself a favor, just don't watch it. And this is coming from someone who really like this type of movie..."

Epic Movie and Scary Movie poke fun at blockbuster movies from the past year or so and feature dumb (and not likable) characters. At least the Scary Movie series had a good amount of clever humor doses in it, because Epic Movie had next to nothing funny about it. I went into auditorium #9 (one of the largest at my theatre; also a complete mess to signal the target audience of Epic Movie) with high hopes. I left feeling dumber than the two of the six writers of Scary Movie series who directed this masterpiece. Then again, I can only blame myself, as the trailers looked dreadful and it was by only 1/3 of the Scary Movie team (probably the ones who took a massive pay-cut).\n\nThere are a few funny moments in Epic Movie: Borat appearing in the end was funny, as he says in broken English, \"Yes a-man,\" or whatever that funny thing he says in Borat is. Seeing him in the green thong was disturbing, but funny. Jack Sparrow (hilariously titled Jack Swallows here- please notice the sarcasm) makes an appearance, providing some funny scenes; at least the directors knew that the best part of Pirate's of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest was the wheel fighting scene, and they took advantage of that by including it in Epic Movie.\n\nNow for the rest of the film\u0085ouch. Directors Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer and their team of crack heads try so hard to be funny, but the only people who should be laughing are little kids and people who are smart enough to avoid watching this movie. Barf and snot aren't funny; they are repulsive and immature beyond words. Maybe if a bored, perverted little kid directed this movie it wouldn't be so bad. But the directors here were grown men. Some examples of the genius-level humor used in Epic Movie is as follows\u0085 the White Witch is now the White B!tch. A man who sucks at life grows small chicken wings on his back and makes pathetic, whining noises. Need I go on?\n\nIt really says something when the best part of the film is a fake Kazakh man and watching my friend next to me text throughout the whole movie. What was she texting about? Think about it, it's not that hard\u0085\n\nGood) Borat (for the good 10 seconds we can here him talk) Bad) extremely immature, doesn't take advantage of the great idea, bad imitations of movie characters Recommendation) Advise your enemies to go see this movie"

There were so many mistakes in this film, I think some were done intentionally though and people were kinda going crazy on them.\n\nFour orphans go to a chocolate factory where they discover a closet, where the inside leads to the world of Gnarnia.

The four orphans discover not only that they are related, but that they are destined to take over the land and save the goat like people, with some other parody characters.\n\nEpic Movie is annoying, stupid, and immature, but I think people did jump a little too fast to just give it the most nasty review possible.

There were also parts that were just plain silly or boring. The acting wasn't too bad, but it could've been better. I think that the older orphans had the best acting. There is no script as you expect with spoof movies. But, who cares. The jokes make up for the lack of script. Also, there is nice scenery shots if anybody noticed. This movie is not as negative as everyone thinks. I rate this film a 8/10."

Just don't see it, it is not worth your money or time.\n\nAlso, the reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because there were a couple of occasions where they had super-model quality models in bikinis dancing around, and the girl that plays Lucy is just incredibly cute, and she made me smile, as in her the person, not the material.

I agree there are different types of humour and that one's taste in humour may be different from someone else's. However, I fail to see how this comment applies to Epic Movie, seeing as it has no successful humour at all.\n\nI liked the first two Scary Movies, sure they were crude but enjoyable nonetheless. They did have several funny moments. In Epic movie, the humour is completely forced and is not witty, surprising, clever or any of the other prerequisites for successful comedy. It is an endless sequence of ill-timed and poorly written one-liners, sight gags and unfunny depictions of other movie characters. Honestly, the script seemed like it had been written by a bunch of ten year olds during morning tea. \"Like, make it that, like, Harry Potter's really old, and, like, it would be real funny!\" \"Yeah, and Hermione can be like, pregnant and smoking a cigarette! Ha Ha Ha Ha!\" I don't think so.\n\nPlainly, sxc bst has a serious humour deficiency. I suggest they see a humour specialist immediately, to reduce the risk of seeing other awful movies."

The entire theatre seemed to feel the same way, I only heard a couple of chuckles throughout the movie, and I am not even sure it was the movie they were laughing at.

Enough said.\n\nNow about the movie: When I came in and saw the movie the first thought that went into my mind was.... \"Oooooookay, was this supposed to be funny in this part?\" Now mind you barely some parts were stupidly funny (As in teasing the movies they used) Most of the actors were poorly picked for the parts we god awful as well, except the man who played Captain Jack Sparrow, or rather in the movie, Captain Jack Swallows, did actually sound close to Johnny Depp. Personally I feel Carmen Elektra would do any part to make money for anything when she played Mystique since she might be close to bankruptcy, you never know.\n\nOverall put, the movie....not funny. The movie tried to be \"too funny\" to be funny at one time. If you ever plan to see this, take my advice...don't go! Poor cheesy quality jokes, Very sick humor, A plot line that could of been good if only they would have had different writers for the movie. If you enjoy senseless jokes and talking, or just simply spoofing movies senselessly watch it. If not, then steer clear of it then just pretend you have never heard of the \"EPIC\" Movie..."

        "review_detailed_main": "My opinion whether a comedy is a good comedy is fairly simple - even laughs throughout, and in having at least one sequence to make me chuckle so hard that my tears will roll down uncontrollably. I don't care if it's physical slapstick, witty dialogue or crass toilet humour. So long as my tears roll, it's a winner. But sadly, Epic Movie failed to meet the mark.\n\nIt's plain boring. Drawing its material from some of the largest \"summer\" blockbusters, like The Da Vinci Code, X-Men, The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Borat, Pirates of the Caribbean, Nacho Libre, Click, Snakes on a Plane, Fast and the Furious, Harry Potter and Superman Returns, Epic Movie follows the formula of taking a mickey out of genre movies. Written and directed by two of the many writers who gave us Scary Movie (a dig on horrors, thrillers and slasher flicks, the strongest of the franchise and still going), and Date Movie (one off bomb, taking a dig on romantic movies), Epic Movie is uninspiring, and the jokes are very lame.\n\nIn fact, I found myself yawning at the juvenile antics on screen, playing up plenty of times at the expense of sexuality - big boobs, kinky names, and countless gyrating female bodies. Even Stifler's Mom Jennifer Coolidge makes an appearance as the White Bitch, as do many other celebrities having themselves spoofed at by lookalikes - P Diddy, Ashton Kutcher, Mel Gibson, Paris Hilton, Michael Jackson, Samuel L Jackson, James Blonde, I mean Bond, even, and various Star Wars characters . Even theme songs from the movies get parodied, the most obvious being Teriyaki Boyz's Tokyo Drift theme.\n\nThe only kudos you can give to the filmmakers, are how they try to gel all these skits into one coherent movie - having all the different movies put together into a common thread is indeed a challenge, and you can't deny the effort. The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe forms the backbone of the story, while the rest are scenes which tangent off, or brought together into the world of Gnarnia. The sets too from the movies it adapted from also get recreated, probably on the cheap, and they do look as good as the original (if not gotten from them).\n\nTo really make your money's worth, stay throughout the end credits which run pretty long, where you'll see three sequences at various points, and you can bolt out of the door once you see the jab on Mel Gibson. For those who want to give this a miss on the big screen, a word of advice, don't even rent it on VCD unless it's free."

Hip Hop comprises the majority of the soundtrack, with some songs re-used throughout.

Jackson) from (Snakes on a Plane - 2006), (Johnny Depp) form (Pirates of the Caribbean), (Jack Black) from (Nacho Libre - 2006), (Paris Hilton), (Borat), the (X-Men) team, and the worst of them all, the one who did (Johnny Depp) from (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - 2005); he was unbearable and creepy!\n\n_The parodies are totally meaningless. Some parody movies, the smart ones, used to mock at real bad points in other movies. But here, forget it. So I didn't even smile at the (Harry Potter) segment. Simply, they selected this time not impersonators to do the job, but old people. That could have meant anything if the actors in the original movie were actually older than their characters!\n\n_It mocks at the image goofs of the movies; with the stuntman, of the lion-man king, is so visible as Asian. Or using a doll as a body double; like in the cell scene. But that was outrageous and very embarrassing itself, since the movie is replete with great number of its own goofs. For example, someone is dead then comes back to life, someone is torn-apart then be complete in the next scene, someone is stabbed then no wound of any kind is appearing, Ahhh, the list is awfully LONG; which makes me ask, what kind of nasty drug the movie's 2 writers and directors were on?!!!\n\n_When it's as wretched as that; throw in sex jokes. But even if, the ones in here are no less wretched themselves. It hit the rock bottom of cheap triteness, being perversely adolescent, or wildly disgusting, all under the name of comedy?! This is disturbed and disturbing!\n\n_The dated jokes about insignificant things, such as ads, TV programs.. etc. Namely, it isn't enough to produce slight gags that only few, only American, viewers, who would understand, No, they must be dull too, so no one would laugh!!\n\n_The plot: It's surrealism meets serious idiocy. This movie says a lot about how writing a parody movie has become so easy job to do. It takes only a viewing to some \"actual\" movies, then re-assembling them horrendously. Still, the surprise is that this easy horrendous movie is produced by major studio?!! I know homemade videos that are extremely comic compared to (Epic Movie) and no Hollywood producer cared about them, even for making good money or good comedy!\n\nWhile it is a spoof, it needs a spoof. On second thought, it doesn't deserve the efforts. It's where the only thing with work behind it; is (Carmen Electra)'s make up as (Mystique)!\n\nFairly, I loved factors from it; (Jayma Mays) is one. There is a magically delicate secret about her in this movie; the line between childhood and femininity, she danced on it attractively. Some motion in the first sequence of presenting the main characters seemed good. And the (Punk'd - 2003) part; at last, someone punched (Ashton Kutcher) on the behalf of us, taking revenge from his annoyance. But none of this or that could make up for the painful rest!\n\n(Epic Movie) is a course for anyone who wants to make a comedy; as the consummate guide of \"Don't do that again\". Let alone that it fits perfectly as a comedy, a black one, about the production system in Hollywood lately. And finally, it solves the mystery of (David Carradine)'s death. The poor thing must have watched it, then hanged himself right off regretfully!"

This whole movie basically abuses some big talents in small cameo roles in the hopes that stars like; Crispin Glover, David Carradine, Carmen Electra, and Jennifer Coolidge will draw a crowd. Trust me when I say the talent was wasted. The highest point in the movie is the Harry Potter spoof but that didn't take more than 3 minutes and it was over. None of the other parodies made a lasting impression on me. Most of the jokes delt with sex and beastiality on a very immature level. Who is to blame? Writers and Directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, they dropped the ball."

As a pretty average 15 year old, i found this film just stupid and silly, i paid a fiver of my money for this movie, and by the end, sitting at home with my cat, watching it assault its tail, was much more amusing! The actual quality of which this is filmed is appalling for a 21st century movie. I could have filmed this in my back garden for that matter! The stunts are so tacky and fake, and at one point it was blatantly obvious that they were using dummies to depict a fight scene. OK well maybe that was one of the jokes... well that was absolutely hilarious.\n\nThey say that this film was made from two of the writers of scary movie. Well that explains a lot. Scary movie itself was a hilarious film, with so many laughs and hilarious gags, but not great, and with the writers who probably let down scary movie in the first place, they let down this.\n\nThinking about it this movie had a chance, but that chance was ruined, my advice is to watch this only to see a really bad film!"

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, it was the dumbest movie I have ever seen and I wouldn't want to torture myself by seeing it again. I don't see how this could be a \"funny\" movie. There weren't any good parts except for maybe the Paris Hilton part (which was the one part that made me chuckle). The Willy Wonka part was disgusting, the Superman part was stupid, the Da Vinci Code was pointless, the Snakes on a Plane was extremely stupid with that guy just repeating the same line over and over, and the Pirates of the Caribbean part was not even funny and perverted (which is why I'm glad I didn't go with my parents). It was all stupid/elementry school jokes basically the whole time during this movie.\n\nOverall-It sucked more than I thought it would.\n\n...They said it was from 2 of the 5 makers of Scary Movie??

As far as the acting goes..........ummm lets just say this isin't going to win any Oscars. There was absolutely no plot to it. I think that any good spoof should have a plot to it. Even if it is a silly one. These people just don't know how to make good spoofs anymore. But I am sure they are going to make more for there are always people between the age of 11 and 14 who eat this stuff up. Even though I am 12 and I hate it.

If anyone takes exception to the Also character (and he WAS pretty objectionable) I don't think the writers intended it as a blatant attempt to offend us.\n\nTaken on its own merits, don't go see the film if you want some intellectual stimulation.

Walking through a wardrobe, they discover the world of Gnarnia, which is ruled by the White Bitch. Meeting up with characters such as Harry Potter and Captain Jack Swallows, the newly reunited family must team up with Also, a wise-but-horny lion to stop the army of the White Bitch.\n\nIf you've seen 'Date Movie' then you would pretty much know what to expect from this movie. Again like 'Date Movie', this movie is quite disappointing. The impersonations are fantastic to watch, especially with Darrell Hammond as a version of Captain Jack Sparrow. His voice and movements were spot on. Unfortunately, the jokes are quite disappointing. It's better if you had good knowledge of the movies and characters being spoofed, as you would find it funnier, but there are not a great amount of laughs. Some sequences are even embarrassing to watch. Enjoy anyway.\n\n\"Yo Bitch! That's pretty much the plot of 'Superman Returns'.\" - Bink (Tony Cox)"

These two are the equivalents of Ewe Boll when it comes to 'comedy' film making.\n\nI'd put spoiler alert on here, but there's nothing to spoil. I won't even go into the plot, I'll just say: Avoid Epic Movie.\n\nOther than the god awful script (I mean, just awful rehash of a bunch of movies thrown together), the less than great acting and the poorly executed timing..........well, okay, this movie's got nothing. I laughed, nay, chuckled once at something that wasn't actually funny, but it hit me enough to elicit a small chuckle. I can't even remember what the bit was, but it wouldn't make SNL these days, and we all know how bad that's been the last decade.\n\nNow, I'm of the school that Date Movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I still stand by that assessment and this one is actually better than that one. But, by better I mean bottom 20 and and not bottom 10 of all time. If there's something good to be taken from this it's this: if you're a young filmmaker (or going to school to be one), this gives you hope that you can get something green lighted by someone somewhere. If these two guys (who might be the worst comedy writing team since the dawn of man) can sucker people into green lighting two of the worst scripts the world has ever seen, than anyone can get their idea made into a feature length movie, even if it's near Ed Wood quality.\n\nSome thoughts on the actors: I do admit that the Mays chick is kinda cute-ish, but I'm partial to redheads. She's not fantastic in any sense, just cute-ish. Meanwhile, Kal Penn is losing his humorous touch, I think. Between this and the apparently awful Van Wilder 2 (I was spared that one, thank you Satan), I think he's just about finished, which is almost too bad, but then, how far can you go being a one trick pony? And the Campbell guy........I really just haven't gotten his appeal as an actor. He's goofy looking, he has very odd facial expressions and isn't much with the comic timing, so it's not hard to see how he's been in two of the worst 'comedies' of the last 2 years.\n\nOh, and Carmen Electra does her usual slow-motion body rub that would win some AVN awards but will never do her any good in the mainstream acting world. Can't go without that, right?\n\nIf that's a spoiler, than standards are too low. See it if you must, but trust a man when he implores you that this is one of the worst movies he's ever seen. I'd give it a -5 if I could....."

No, I won't even say 'parody', more, references ENTIRE scenes to recreating these comedies, of course emptying these scenes of any of the far funnier jokes that were in the original. How clever of them to basically rip off (NOT parody) comedies far superior to the movie itself and derive it of any of the redeeming qualities. It's just so logical too! I'm not going to review this any longer, if you can't get the picture that this is a crap movie from the dire review on IMDb or indeed any review from someone with half a brain cell, then I suggest you do this, push someone over so they fall and shout tedious derogatory words and you might get an idea of the various horrific punchlines used to substitute for the lack of clever scriptwriters.\n\nIf you can't comprehend these warnings then I'm sorry to say, you're incredibly low in intelligence and probably need to see a doctor. Meaning, Epic movie is just for you! For the love of god, just avoid."

Every chance they had to make some type of knock off they did, regardless of how funny it actually was. Also, there was entirely too much slapstick - like the producers though every person getting hit in some weird way would automatically make the movie more funny. **\n\nI feel very comfortable saying that I got my money's worth from finding out that Reno 911 was getting its own movie. The previews were by far the best part of this horrid flick.\n\nMy final thoughts: If you really want to see this movie, just wait till it comes out in the discount theater (if you have them.)

I laughed once in the entire film (perhaps due to a sugar high from the vat of coke) and although my friend and I raised the average age of movie-goers in the cinema by about 15 years, none of the kids were laughing either. With so much material to choose from, the decision to focus on The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe for 90% of the film was misguided and oh, how it dragged. If we hadn't paid London prices for our seats, we would certainly have walked out, and frankly both regret we didn't. I want to sue for 83 minutes of my life back.

What made these films classic were the nonstop assault on the funny bone with continuous sight gags, wacky comments, and ridiculous situations. This movie just stumbled from the get-go and left the audience to try to find any bit of humor in any manner they could from what they were being presented on the screen. Any joke that was offered was grade school humor and was overplayed and extended to the point of being annoying. How many stupid spoof rap videos can be randomly inserted into scenes of a movie? How many times can one person get kicked between the legs? It was if the movie intended to be played by second graders in a school pageant! And even that would have been a major improvement! As for the actual acting (if you can call it that), it seems that the cast just wanted to get over with filming and collect their pay. Someone else described this movie perfectly, as being a really bad extended \"Saturday Night Live\" skit.\n\nWith that said, you can take this review as being useful or not.

If you were expecting Battleship Potemkin, you were looking in the wrong place.\n\nThe actors are all in top shape, and all do great parodies, especially Borat and Rosie O'Donell. I think Horatio Sanz was also remarkable, as if he's ever NOT remarkable. It should be nominated for a Palme d'Or of LAUGHTER!\n\nI had the chance to watch this hilarious movie on the plane back from Orlando, and Tammy couldn't stop laughing, i was afraid the air marshal will ask us to stop laughing, you know especially after 9/11 and all. Even Tammy's friend Larisha loved it and she didn't even like Barber Shop 2! This is the funniest piece of cinema of all year after Mr. Woodcock\n\nit reminded me of early Chaplin."

At some points It would show a spoof for 50 seconds or so. But I still laughed. I think it was the best \"Movie\" that the makers of Scary Movie have made. A lot better than Date Movie, And more of a plot than Scary Movie. There were some parts I say that could've been made a lo better. I especially thought that the Willy Wonkas factory could have been much longer. It didn't go on for very long. And the characters could have appeared more in the movie. If you do not plan to ever see this movie... I Suggest YOU DO, and If you do plan to see this movie... STAY DURING THE CREDITS!!!!!"

This was evidence to me that they clearly had no clue what they were going to see.\n\nAny time a film is not made available for critics before being released you should know it's not the greatest movie ever made.

It is a spoof of other movies which, although not groundbreaking, at least tried to entertain above the waist. This movie is just a series of excuses for toilet humour, tired innuendo and the odd bikini clad babe. The script is plagiarised, diluted-with-sewer-water nonsense; the acting, even for this questionable cast, is plank-like at best; all in all a waste of your life and breath to watch. Not a single smirk passed my lips.\n\nSeriously though, it is a travesty that this kind of thing still not only gets made, but gets general release, while so many other more worthy efforts go straight to DVD, or are never released at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Obviously, I am not going to be the first person to crap on Epic Movie. It is a sweltering turd, and you absolutely should not watch it. Now, it is worth point out that I am a giant fan of kitsch and camp, and love gems like \"Troll 2\" and \"Freddy Got Fingered\". Sometimes, if a movie can stretch itself too being ridiculously absurd, it can actually manage to develop its own sense of charm. This simply is not the case with Epic Movie.\n\nAnd honestly, I expected it to be a bit more likable as camp. After all, cult favorites David Carradine and Crispin Glover appear in it. However, their appearances are little more than cameos, and neither are given an opportunity to camp things up appropriately.\n\nSo what makes this movie fail so detrimentally? For one, the writers spend too much time explaining their jokes. They should take notes from the Coen brothers on this one. They obviously feel the audience is completely retarded. But since this movie has an IMDb overall rating of 2, they apparently misjudged the audience. Second off, it would help if the jokes were funny. The typical joke for this movie is making a pop culture movie reference (may or may not be from an actual epic movie), point out where the reference came from, and turn it into a fart joke. I honestly laughed at no more than two of their jokes, and those laughs were more light chuckles. There simply isn't any sense of invention here.\n\nIt is clear there isn't any intent to make quality cinema here. I mean, there is NO intention of any kind. I'm not sure what the business model is, maybe they are making this on a low budget and getting a lot of sponsorship money and then making enough on ticket sales to come out in the green over all? I don't know, but the mind certainly boggles that these guys are able to continue making films. It is really surprising they are not getting financed the same way Uwe Boll does in Germany. However, the bottom line is: avoid this. Even if you think it might be funny to watch as a bad movie to make fun of MST3K style, don't do it. Because this isn't even unintentionally funny. It's just not funny, and it sucks. Stay away. Do not watch this movie. Seriously."

On the other hand, it did give me some laughs, so I can't say it was an entirely bad movie. It actually has humor in it, but it can also get a bit disturbing.. I suppose this movie was meant to be utterly stupid.. so you just have to be the kind of person that is able to laugh at this kind of stupid stuff, and make a fool of other movies (even if you do love the movies it makes fun of.) In conclusion, this movie kind of sucked, but it can cause a few laughs. To be honest, I WOULD watch this movie again, but only for a few bucks. This is one of those movies that I'd see again if I can either pay 3 bucks for the DVD or watch for free on something legal like Charter on Demand.

Umm, no. But it did entertain me a tiny bit for a little while. So to everyone out there thinking this is going to be a fantastically hilarious movie, think again.

So rushed that the makers of this movie did not even bother to conceal equipment used (like dummies to replace untalented actors) in the film.

Every time someone laughed in the theater, I died a little inside. Seriously, 4 year olds can come up with better material. Even my pals who dragged me to see this hated it and their standard for a good film is way lower than mine. They apologized to me when it was over. I did not immediately forgive them.\n\nThe visuals/special effects are dated but that doesn't really matter as this is (emphasis)supposed(/emphasis) to be a comedy movie. No comedy here though, so you will notice how bad all the acting, effects and everything else are.

Now, at least scary movie had decent acting (Anna Faris) but there is not a single actor who can save this film. The jokes are stupid and totally not funny. It sure makes you laugh, but you laugh at how stupid this film is. As usual, this movies like to make fun of good films. Scary movie spoofed great horror films like Friday the 13th, A nightmare on elm street, etc. This one spoofs Charlie and the chocolate factory and some other comedies, but in a sad and extremely boring way. Do yourself a favor and skip this film. A totally worth 1/10."

I force myself to watch a film at least three times before I review it. Yes. This film was included in that. Brace yourself, this one hurts. This is probably the only film I will ever address like this....\n\nNormally I would break the film down here, but this is a parody of other films so all the visuals and images are substituted from the base content. They don't tell jokes in this. This isn't a comedy movie. This is a film that aims to repeat, verbatim, everything the source material said to the point it becomes excessive, boring, and gives you a headache. I disliked Date Movie. I haven't seen a Scary Movie since the second one and from what I hear, I left it behind at the right time. This was the worst attempt at parody I've ever seen in my life and I've seen Reality Shows parody Human behavior. This was BAD bad. You can't even get a good riff going. It isn't bad on purpose. It feels like it was written by an unfunny twelve year old, whose parents had lied to them telling them they were funny, only motivating the little pr*** to keep trying. They shouldn't have kept trying. This cinematic abortion is probably the worst movie I've ever seen on all scales. I've seen The Room. I found humor in that. I've seen Dragon Wars. I found humor in that. This was just...crap. An attempt to take films that did fairly well, cash in on how recognizable the characters were, and then just repeat scenes shot for shot. This isn't parody, it's plagiarism. It isn't satire, it's copyright infringement in the worst of ways. I support free speech, free press, and free expression. That being said, this degree of stupid shouldn't be permitted to have Theatrical Releases. People paid money for this. I wouldn't buy it from a dollar bin. I wouldn't accept a dollar to take a DVD copy of this film. Don't see it. It isn't worth it. Try making a drinking game with the dumb scenes and you'll die of Cirrhosis before the first Act concludes. Don't buy this. Don't support it's official release, unless you plan on lighting any and all physical copies on fire. Kill it dead, bring it back, and kill it again."

Then the snakes in the plane scene was also hilarious, although xmen and nacho libre and harry potter spoofs were kinda dumb.

And during the credits the mel Gibson spoof had be on my all fours howling away.the also guy was also funny, and the white bitch nick had me rolling away. The sudoku spoof was also great.\n\nAll in all 6/10 !!"

This is a painful hour and half of jokes that were scrounged from the garbage bin from the writers of MadTV. It's really nothing more than a series of sketches loosely strung together, making fun at all the biggest movies from 2008ish. Oh look! It's Iron Man! Oh no, he got crushed by a cow! Because y'know, there was a cow flying around in the movie Twister...people remember Twister right? Cows flying through the air in a tornado? No? Anyone? OK, how about Batman? He has a growly voice...that's funny right? Oh, what's that? Saturday Night Live already did that...ummm... OK how about Beowulf making gay jokes? No? Death-metal singing chipmunks? hello? How about some Dr Phil jokes, or Amy Winehouse, y'know, 'cause she liked drugs...oh, that feels really out of date? Oh right, she passed away and now it's just uncomfortable...Michael Jackson in the trunk of a car with a monkey? Oh, right, he's dead too. You get the idea, these jokes are like an episode of Family Guy, so topical that the pop culture jabs are horribly dated six months afterwards. This is a pathetic, horrible pile of crap and one of the worst wastes of time ever. I won't get that time back. I will never watch another 'film' from these horrible hacks.

I have no idea.

Unfortunately Aces wasn't playing anywhere locally and I said oh well I'll go see this. Worst decision ever. The entire movie was stupid slapstick 4 year old comedy. Not even one intelligent joke throughout the film. This was the first film I've ever walked out of and the hour I gave it was the biggest waste of my life to date. I honestly had a better time when I broke my wrist. I could think of 100's of horrible things that would be more enjoyable than this film. Otherwise there's not much else to say about it, awful movie I absolutely hated it."

The movie it self is good, it is great how they put so many films into one movie and have it make scense. First things first is I loved Kal Penn in HAROLD and KUMAR but in epic movie he acts a little stupid.\n\nFor all the fan that liked date movie I strongly recommend this film but for people interested in a reel comedy DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! Me I love comedy its the spice of life. But when u watch stupid comedy it really not funny.\n\nI suggest u wait until it comes out on DVD because its not worth going to movies and paying money to watch. TRUST ME IM A BLOODY MOVIE ADDICT."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am an aspiring filmmaker and when I see all the endless scores of promising indies being lost in the festival pile it's tragic because I can relate to their pain, and their anxiety at not knowing if they're going to make it. \"Hollywood is incredibly competitive, there are a million talented people out there trying to do it.\" So they say. And so I've grown a healthy jadedness about Hollywood, but do occasionally enjoy a good mainstream satire, even if it promises to be Sophomoric. But this film was so atrocious that it invites several questions, all along the lines of \"How the f--- did this film make it so far?\" If they had taken any writer from any decent TV show and said \"you have a week to make a parody of every trendy film from the last year\" they would have all come back with something better than this. How the hell did David Carradine, Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge attach their name to something so atrocious? Are Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer living in a complete f---ing vacuum? They don't have other writers that they can ask for advice? Friends? Family? Janitors? Is everyone they know completely mundane, ignorant and juvenile? At first I thought, \"whatever, I was stoned, laughed a couple of times, only ten bucks.\" But then I thought about the moral irresponsibility of leaving so many filmmakers out in the cold and welcoming this garbage into Hollywood and it made me furious. Constant kicking of things around, breast jokes, fart jokes, vomit jokes, deus ex machina's, poor production choices, dishonest satirizing that doesn't even seem to understand what elements of the films quoted are worthy and appropriate for satire.\n\nI really, really hope that Seltzer and Friedberg throw in the towel, or have their feelings HURT out of over bad reviews and really change their perspective and philosophy on film-making."

I think that the people reviewing this movie should have that particular sense of humor associated with parody movies.\n\nI am one of those people and i loved the Scary Movies, my favorite songs are my Weird Al Yankvich and i was in hysterics for a lot of Epic Movie.\n\nSo a word of advise for people who review movies... Of course there are going to be bad comments if the person doesn't enjoy the genre they are critquing, so give every movie a fair go and let it be judged by the true fans of that genre. We are the only people who could really judge the quality of one parody movie to the next.\n\nThankyou and goodnight."

It manages to cobble together a coherent storyline, and hilariously mishmashes characters and settings from the blockbuster movies of 2006. I am actually glad these trite, mediocre, yet inexplicably lucrative movies are made fun of and torn to pieces by \"Epic Movie.\" The movie is definitely weird, filled with careless non sequiturs, shoddy editing, and strange, inappropriate hip-hop songs and references; yet it is because of, rather than in spite of these poorly-done and weird cuts, that \"Epic Movie\" is so enjoyable. One of the best scenes involves a fight scene with a kung-fu body double that looks absolutely nothing like the main actor. Dismembered limbs magically reappear as though the character was not hurt. Comedy needs to be weird, over-the-top, and nonsensical. \"Epic Movie\" is all of these, and as a result ends up being a classic of weird comedies.\n\nThe actors are actually competent and very funny. The beautiful Jayma Mays is excellent as the exaggeratedly stupid, goofy, and childlike Lucy. She clearly understood how to make this character weird, surreal and memorable. Faune Chambers is somewhat of a foil for Lucy's antics. I loved the credibly cowardly character of Peter. Crispin Glover, master of the bizarre is wonderful as a creepy and unnerving Willy Wonka. Darrell Hammond is absolutely spot-on as a parody of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow; he has an eye for detail and mimics the character perfectly.\n\nThis movie is not well crafted in terms of a smooth plot line or story structure, but it's weird enough to work. Give it a shot; it's far from the worst movie in the world."

It makes way to many references to brand names and celebrities, and not at all with the talent of the South Park crew. They are still my benchmark in comedy. I will let you in on the part where they mock Harry Potter; it is the most sidesplitting part of the movie.\n\nNow some of you may be thinking that it is disrespectful to mock the \"Epic Movies\" noted in the film.

Imitations are to make a copy of; reproduce closely (dictionary.com).\n\nAll-be-it mostly unfunny, Saturday Night Live is still best at doing satirical parodies. They know how to take the situational or character flaws of a celebrity or news figure and exploit them to the point of enjoyment. (There are many gems coming out of the SNL camp, like new heroes characters and Andy Samburg's digital shorts).\n\nAn imitation will use an original as a template, or if extremely lazy completely just rip off the source material. Since we're contrasting imitations with parodies, imitations in this case usually put a twist to the source. For example, Mr. Tumnus in Epic Movie is played by the actor who brought life to Nacho Libre's tag partner/ Napoleon Dynamyte's friend Pedro. In order to make the character funny, they just made him look really weird, essentially he played the exact same character of Mr. Tumnus in Narnia- the first time.\n\nEpic movie also put a FULL 5 minute imitation of MTV cribs. Yes their observations on rappers and scarface were true, but it was funny the first 4 years of my life I saw it on SNL, Mad TV, any other show that actually takes itself seriously in the form of Cribs.\n\nEpic movie also put a FULL 4 minute imitation of the Chronicles of Narnia song that came out --( notice my imitation of paragraphs)------ oh I don't know, over 1 year ago? The Chronic-What-cles of Narnia is technically a comedic parody in itself: it parodies hard rap and nerds that really want to see an epic movie like Narnia. RULE: Never Ever Make A Parody of a Parody. It was virtually the same beat, with a new movie title put in.\n\nOh and if you make an Epic Movie --- make sure all the movies IMITATED are Epic. I don't think Talledega Nights is considered epic, nor was it a blockbuster. Neighter was Borat, or Nacho Libre. --- And Paris Hilton isn't epic."

Both were (and still are) hilariously funny to me and while I knew they both were spoofing certain genres and even certain movies I never thought it was essential to see the original sources in order to get the jokes. Also, while the gags were the thing, I also think a little more attention was paid to both characterization and plot. As a result, little dated either one. Watch something like Epic Movie, however, and you can't help but think they've thrown everything (from various TV shows and movies) but the kitchen sink (and no sink is literally thrown as far as I can tell). This results in such a hodge podge of parodies upon parodies that the plot gets interrupted constantly and characterization (what there is of it) is violated for cheap laughs (of which there were few on my side). I did like the performances of Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge. Otherwise, this was mostly a waste of time for me."

I wouldn't be so hard on this movie, if not for the fact that the writers show no signs of stopping or improving.

Cheesy, I know. However, the film maintains this level of teenage slapstick very consistently, portraying an almost Mad TV-esquire production. A decent job is done by the lead characters, with each persona more irreverent and comically oblivious than the last.\n\nI found the parody involved, at times, simultaneously mindless and brilliant. The sheer inanity of the connections truly exposes the adolescence of the writers, and the audience, if not overly obsessed with perfection in film, SHOULD take this nonsense for all it's worth. It takes a certain humor to appreciate parody, no matter how high-brow it may be; apparently, this humor is lost on today's society, where we believe that only the likes of SNL can spoof current culture.\n\nAdmittedly, this is quite a non-intellectual film. If one expects to engage in an intriguing, subtle, convoluted plot which engenders debate for hours afterward, might I suggest that one turns swiftly around and purchases a ticket for \"JEEZ, LIGHTEN UP.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, all I have to say to sum up this movie is this: \"Epic Movie\" is one of the worst films of all time, and certainly the worst comedy of all time. I could leave it at that and hope you take my advice and save yourself the $8.00, but I know many of you will see it anyway. \"Oh, but the trailer looked so funny,\" you'll say. I almost thought about asking for a refund, and not only that, but also my hour and a half back, and my lost brain cells. I will explain the reasons this film is a literal piece of garbage, and should be buried thousands of feet beneath the earth where it will rot away, never to be seen again.\n\nThe trailer promises hilarious spoofs of films ranging from \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", to \"X-Men\", to \"Narnia\". I tell you this; the only funny scenes in this film are in the trailer. So watch the trailer a couple of times and you've seen the movie. Every other scene is boring, retarded, unfunny, and horribly made. How the studio actually ended up OK-ing \"Epic Movie\" is beyond me. The acting is dreadful, granted it is a spoof, but even spoofs need semi-good actors. The continuity is non-existent; the stunt people will play the characters in a fight scene on full on display for the camera. I think the directors thought it would be funny to show bad continuity, and it isn't in the least. I'll wager that the writers all got drunk and said, \"Ok, everyone say something funny.\" \"Let's have Captain Jack dance!\" \"Great! Let's go film the movie dudes!\" Anyone could make a movie like this, absolutely anyone. What's funny in their stupid mind isn't funny to the smart, movie going public. I should've expected this since they are the same guys who made the horribly unsuccessful \"Date Movie\". In fact, it is apparently so bad it made IMDb's 100 worst films of all time list. \"Epic Movie\" will undoubtedly make it as well. It is the worst film of the year, and next year, and probably the year after.\n\nSo save yourself and your brain cells and don't see this sad excuse for a film. It is rated PG-13 for crude humor, and language."

There are a handful of amusing lines, but not enough to make it worth the ticket price. Several supposedly well-respected actors appear (no, not Eugene Levy), making you wonder if they did it out of friendship with the directors, or if the directors perhaps possess incriminating photos.\n\nAt one point, the Peter character calls for mercy on the \"White Bitch,\" and decides that she will be tried by a jury of her peers. Hopefully, the same will happen to everyone involved in this train-wreck, who will decide whether or not they can be trusted with more movies in the future."

I don't really have a favourite character in this movie, however I did love Jennifer Coolidge as \"White Bitch\".

Well, is it bad? For me, obviously not. It was much better than \"Date Movie\" and you can tell the filmmakers that they actually changed some of their plans to make this movie funnier. And it is.\n\nI would compare this to \"Monty Python's Holy Grail\" because this film has its shares of laughs and unfunny jokes. The good thing is the movie is really quite refreshing in a way. Why? They never actually spoofed fantasy movies before. Does it make a difference? Yes, it does.\n\nWhat gets better in this movie other than the jokes are the elaborate costumes, the extensive (and wonderful) set designs, special effects, and score, if you care to know about any of that. Although you may think it's a bigger budget than \"Date Movie\", it's surprisingly the same, if that interests you.\n\nThe jokes in here are funny because it mocks other films, makes obvious clich\u00e9s and surprisingly turns them the other way, one continuing joke which I found really funny even if it goes throughout the film, a joke they continued from \"Date Movie\" (the obvious stunt double and dummy), and the randomness.\n\nThe target audience is apparent: Those who have and liked \"Date Movie\" or have seen the films spoofed in here, including \"Nacho Libre,\" \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,\" \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" the \"X-Men\" pictures, \"Superman Returns\", \"The Da Vinci Code\", and a lot more. More or less, put that down to teens.\n\nSo, if you're a wise adult, you probably wouldn't be surprised not liking this movie. I, on the other hand, am a teen, and it's not surprising enough that I enjoyed it very much so. Also, I like to applaud Jayma Mays for her very funny role and others like Jennifer Coolidge and Faune A. Chambers.\n\nIf you're a person who doesn't like stupid comedies with some immature and childish jokes, unlike \"Knocked Up\", you should stay very far away from this. Why would you see it? You know what to expect. If you're a person who's in their teens or just like to have a good short time, then watch this. There's no harm to go through it for a short 80 minutes."

Funny tidbits and some interesting movie veterans, I think, gives it a good excuse to kill an hour and a half of fun. This does not look like a direct-to-video type, but still Hollywood has not come up with enough material anymore for circulation so they must know most audiences will enjoy a spoof of other movies that were nothing more than box-office hits, and the ideas they were didn't matter. We all enjoy making fun of one movie to another, snd this one was pretty good."

Also, I saw the boom mic a total of 5 times throughout the movie; you'd think if it was meant to be seen, they would've drawn attention to it. Don't get me wrong, I chuckled maybe a grand total of 3 times, but that was being generous. Plenty of the people in the theater were laughing, but they were all children. If you're wondering whether or not to see this movie, wait a few months and pick it up out of the $1.99 DVD bin at Walmart. Overall, it was an 86 minute lesson on how not to make a funny movie."

Date Movie was an atrocious film that is a disgrace to spoof movies everywhere, so, naturally, I wasn't expecting much out of Epic Movie.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWhile it is nowhere near the level of some of the great spoofs of the last 3 decades (Airplane!, Wrongfully Accused, Mafia, Hot Shots, Scary Movie, etc.), Epic Movie certainly has it's moments.\n\nThough it contains a lot of the unfunny, ridiculous drivel that is apparently a feeble attempt at spoofing that we saw in the last film, it has quite a few worthwhile, funny moments.\n\nIt starts off quite unfunny, but don't give up on it too early! It does go somewhere, and the film really gains steam as it progresses.\n\nThe highlight of the film is Darrell Hammond's GENIUS spot-on parody of Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean. He truly does a masterful job spoofing the character.\n\nPlease note that you will have to be sitting through the numerous spontaneous hip-hop numbers that appear in Date Movie, but they're mercifully few and far-between.\n\nOver all, I'd give Epic Movie a 6, purely for it's spirit, and Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg's drastic improvement in quality from the last film.\n\nI'd say that the next one might actually be a decent comedy film."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the horrendous Date Movie, I was hesitant to put myself through Epic Movie. It looked nearly exactly what the preceding film was, had a few of the same actors, and the same writers/directors. But the more I missed it, the more I felt the dire need to see the film. And after sitting through the whole film, I almost wish I did not even bother.\n\nIf the film was merely titled \"Pop Culture References of 2005 and 2006\", I think it would have been a lot more of an appropriate title than Epic Movie. The film lampoons not just epics like The Chronicles of Narnia (where the film finds its key references), Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter, but takes jabs at the likes of the X-Men series, Borat, Snakes on a Plane, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Da Vinci Code and Nacho Libre (going so far as to cast that film's supporting character H\u00e9ctor Jim\u00e9nez in a key supporting role).\n\nBut like Date Movie before it, the film does not parody the films it references as much as it directly steals right from them. Whole lines and sequences are lifted directly out of movies, and even TV shows like Saturday Night Live and Chappelle's Show. Surely either Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer (the still advertised \"2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie\", as they have yet to prove themselves to truly be box office gold) know that the general population of people who would even give this film the time of day would have watched the films and shows these two steal directly from. Or maybe, as this film suggests, the only people who want to watch this movie are people who watch MTV, as the Cribs, Punk'd and numerous music video references would seem to idealize.\n\nI think what is most disgusting about this abomination of a film is that these two filmmakers (if we even want to refer to them as that) are plagiarizing the work of others. In the Scary Movie series (and going so far back as the work of Mel Brooks and David Zucker's earlier, non-Weinstein produced work), despite some of the films being worse than terrible, the filmmakers still attempted to give some semblance of originality to the references and parodies of films they were doing. They were simply not copying and pasting someone else's work and calling it their own. In the real world, if someone does that, they can be fired or expelled from school, and are practically blacklisted for the rest of their lives. Why is it that Friedberg and Seltzer are somehow allowed to do this criminal act? Has Fox somehow given them a pardon just for the fact of giving them some cheap profits in the Winter movie season, and a rather easily profitable Unrated DVD release? Well, Meet the Spartans comes out on DVD in a few weeks, and it looks to be on about the same page.\n\nBut it could also simply be for the fact that the jokes Friedberg and Seltzer come up with themselves are almost not funny at all. I smirked at the preppy school X-Men send-up, and a few other choice scenes, but the majority of what I could tell was original work, was not funny at all. Maybe Fox gives them a pass on stealing other people's stuff just because their own work is not funny? Or maybe they are just being duped into thinking it was original, and not copyrighted by somebody else? They must know that work is being stolen. Why else would the White Bitch character (played by Jennifer Coolidge) talk about her evil plan, only to have another character joke about how it was directly ripped nearly point for point from Superman Returns?\n\nWhat I found peculiar was that for such a ridiculously written film, so many recognizable faces showed up to \"act\" in it. Coolidge, Fred Willard, Tony Cox, Crispin Glover, Carmen Electra, David Carradine and Kevin McDonald have all acted in some really funny movies, and somehow, it seems that bringing them all here might give the movie some sort of credibility in being funny. Only their acting leaves a lot to be desired. Yeah, Willard tries for a bit, but no one else seems particular enthusiastic that they are a part of this production. They look like they are waiting for their money, and then are going to run off with it.\n\nThey also seem to have put more money into sets, costumes and music too (when it is not just being taken from the top chart of 2006). I was actually rather amused by how much work went into some of these things, and how it looks like the filmmakers were given so much more money to make this movie than they were for Date Movie. Did Fox really have that much faith in them?\n\nI digress however. I got actual laughs in the film courtesy of a completely unrecognizable Darrell Hammond as Captain Jack Swallows (a parody on Johnny Depp's Oscar-nominated Jack Sparrow). He is pound for pound, the funniest thing the movie has to offer, and nails each and every moment he has with an amount of perfection completely devoid from the rest of the production. I am unsure if Friedberg and Seltzer wrote Hammond's lines (they look more improvised than anything), but if they did, I concede that they might have some sort of talent if they get the right actor to read them off. I laughed a lot during the bloopers shown through the credits as well. It just looked funnier to screw up the terrible lines than to actually say them.\n\nAnd if the bloopers are the funniest thing about this so-called comedy, I think there might be a problem. Hopefully Meet the Spartans has more originality, and less plagiarizing. Otherwise Friedberg and Seltzer should be looking at some fines to pay.\n\n1.5/10."

Historically, these types of movies have been reasonably successful, and most of them rate at least a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. But the uniqueness of this effort allows it a rating that only few producers can have nightmares about.\n\nSome of the adolescent, and pre-adolescent audiences may find this story, and all of it's gags, to be funny. But not enough to make it successful. For most adults, however, this film probably misses the mark by a mile. With all of the gags being hinged together so loosely, and with no credibility or sensibility attached to pull them off, one can only hope the movie ends as soon as possible. In comparison, the first few installments of Scary Movie were funny, proving that the concept and format has a chance. But unless you have about an 8 year old mentality, and then are willing to let anything pass for entertainment, you may think twice about paying to see it. This gross, and raunchy type of humor is for children who get their parent's okay to watch it.\n\nUnfortunately, the theatrical trailer is better than the overall production. There should be a warning for those kinds of things."

We measured', you can almost certainly conclude that its probably a film to miss. I was right. Anyone above the age of 14 can come to an instant deduction that it is a terrible film. The 'plot' jumps around, following a group of high school children, who embark on a supposedly epic quest, making parodies of various other films along the way. However, after the first 20 minutes or so, it becomes all to clear that the film relies heavily on the frequent use of crude toilet humour, and persistent references to feces. I am all to sure that a pack of 12 year olds will think that the height of all wit has been reached in this film, and would have spent majority of the time watching the film, rolling on the floor, giggling away at the references to the male genitalia, and laughing out loud at the abundance of slapstick humour that features throughout. Luckily, the people who will 'love' this film, (children aged 8-12) are those that feel you are incapable of stringing an amusing sentence together, without unleashing one of their newly discovered swear words, or making some sort vulgar reference to fart jokes. It makes me somewhat scared that if the latest crop of 8-12 year olds are so captivated by swearing and any form of slapstick and toilet humour, they fail to think of anything original and funny themselves. Is that really what the future holds for comedy? All jokes making some sort of allusion to excrement. I think you can probably guess by the 'two star' rating that this is a film to miss. It, I know, it is a generous rating, but, though ashamed to admit it, I did laugh twice, partially fulfilling it's role as a 'comedy'. At least now 'HMV' will know which genre to place it under, making the film all to easy to find for those 12 year olds, so eager to grasp hold a copy of possibly the worst film of the year.\n\nE.S"

No, on second thought, the above mentioned scenario would be more inspiring and fun.\n\nI was excited about this movie. It wasn't funny. It wasn't inspired. It wasn't even fun to watch. Just go rent all the original movies on DVD and you will be satisfied. Save yourself the pain of seeing this clumsily thrown-together plagiarized nonsense."

One sees the trailer, and is mislead, thinking that they are going to spoof of those movies, how wrong they are. The \"segments\" in the trailer is pretty much all that particular spoof is, they last no longer and have no more jokes. The only movie they seemed to make fun of was Narnia, and even that was done somewhat poorly. Not to mention the string between all the movies was weak and made hardly any sense. The budget was also pretty cheap, and was silty reflected in the film. Not to mention the movie seemed to be strung together pretty quickly. And finally, it has too much humorless physical violence, lets face it, no amount of hits in the cock is going to make the movie any better. So if you are planning to see this film, do yourself a favor, save some money, and just see the trailer on the website.\n\nMy Rating: 4.5/10"

With all that's going on in the world these days, that's a precious and valuable commodity, and I don't think people should scorn it. I think one of the reasons this is the most popular film in theatres right now is that it's just plain funny and people like to have something to laugh at. While I liked Borat, which all the critics are apparently ga-ga for right now, I thought this movie was a lot funnier, had more plot, more gags per second and was less cruel to real people.\n\nLook, if you're looking for the latest depressing Clint Eastwood directorial effort, this obviously isn't it, but if you're looking for some ridiculous silly humor, this is a great way to spend a few hours in my opinion"

They must defeat her to save the world and free Gnarnia.\n\nIn this movie, we see one parody after the other, but done so in an unfunny, tasteless, overly-crude and overbearing way. What follows is a boring story with silly characters and dumb antics. What renders this movie to borderline annoying is the use of excessive rap songs in a number of scenes. Put in some political puns (Fake Saddam Hussein or the real WMDs?), this movie was sure an epic travesty. I got to mention that my one favorite scene in the movie is the \"Paris Hilton\" sequence, where she is squashed by a falling Susan.\n\nOther than that, don't bother with this film.

The film is 90 minutes of unbelievably mature poopy, pee-pee, penis and va-jay-jay jokes that will most likely be the best film you've ever seen -- if you're in second grade. The movie would be tolerable if they wouldn't take a joke too far, which 'Epic Movie' does every two minutes or so. The only really humorous scene was Mr. Tumnus' home sequence which spoofed MTV Cribs. That was funny for the first minute or so of the joke, but became annoying after the five decades the joke continued into.

The TRAILER is funnier than the MOVIE because the trailer has almost every funny scene in it. From watching the trailer, you can predict what scenes are coming up in the movie. The movie was too clich\u00e9, and what you thought would be funny (e.g. Gnarnia) was NOT funny. I can't believe I had the will power to sit through two hours and watch the most horrible comedy in the world. This movie is a disgrace to all spoofs! People were leaving at the middle of the movie, and they weren't even paying attention to it. The theatre was FULL of people, who, by the end of the movie were gabbing on their cellphones and chatting with their friends. The beginning had a few laughs, and there were minor laughs through out the movie but I forgot to laugh. It was that funny."

I didn't even sit through it. I sat through Alexander and i couldn't last 20 minutes through this before my friend and I walked out.\n\nI've never before walked out of a movie theater and felt dirty, and ask myself...\"how the f**k did they get movie rights??\" This is proof that ANYONE can make it in Hollywood.\n\nPlease don't even pay to see this movie... don't even wait for it to come out on DVD. In fact, don't even download it. Its a waste of your life and if you really wanted to see it, STEAL it. Why steal? Because the thrill of taking it out of a store and risk of getting caught is MORE exciting than the movie is. At least then you might get something out of it."

It's as if the movie was directed towards 3 year olds with mental disabilities. I was impressed to see how low and senseless comedy could get. When I went into the movie theater to watch this movie, I was expecting a semi-original comedy in the likes of Scary movie....WRONG! I honestly can't describe how disappointed I was to see this piece of crap on the big screen.(and I think I'm speaking for the majority of people) Not to mention how sick Date Movie made most people feel also. It looks like crap comes in pairs, just like the two writers from the Scary Movie series that decided to write this load of trash."

I know that it may look like a funny movie in the previews on TV, but believe me people, it's horrible & it's not even funny. Just look @ the ratings that were made by the public, they prove my point. The beginning of the movie even starts out stupid & each person comes from an already stupid movies that Epic movie is making fun of. This show really didn't need to go ahead & make any more fun of those movies because they already did the job of that by themselves. & the movie that they based it on was good & I don't think that they should have made fun of it. Also, the characters in this movie were really stupid & nothing in this movie was even the least bit funny. What a horrible movie it was. Honestly I think it could've been a funny movie if they had had funnier lines, better movies to make fun of, & better characters."
