It has not got the same power as the first 2 but is still very emotionally tought and strong and sends across a message like the other movies. Stallone like he always has been is great with the part. The script really does have its moments of splendour and with sadness. Scenes such as Balboas recolections on the past and his time with his friend and coach Mickey. Extremely emotional movie but of course only in scene such as that and also when his wife tries to pur across he devoted love for the boxer. Its powerfuls and tought like the whole series is.\n\nThe films are the most realistic film series based on true life. True griet. True feelings and love. Now, Rocky loses his money plus gets brain damage, just how bad can a life get. Now not been able to box becomes a coach but soon gets betrayed by his student as another promoter with more money and power takes control of him and leaves Rocky all alone with nowhere to go.\n\nAlthough there is no ring fight, do not worry as there is a more personel than ever with more strenght and skill in a tough and rough and mean street fight. Definatley the least best in the series but still not bad and not as bad as what people say as it does contain all life based aspects. Very good and absolutley worth a watch more times than the very bad Star Wars."

Nice plot complications, if a little predictable.\n\nTHe climax is also a bit predictable, but well done. Great production values and good music.\n\nTHe Rocky movies in general have taken a lot of abuse, but Rocky V does not deserve the abuse it has gotten here. And it deserves better than a 4.0!"

        "review_detailed_main": "For some reason or another, certain movies achieve a reputation as being worse than they actually are. Rocky V is one such film that is affected by the \u0096 as I call it \u0096 Phantom Menace syndrome. This refers to Movies that are interesting in their own way but fail to live up to the hype or expectation of previous instalments, or simply do not follow the formula that everyone derided for being too predictable anyway. For me, Rocky V is the best of the sequels to the 1976 original, as it does not follow in the Rocky tradition of simply having a bigger guy to fight than in the previous film. Rocky IV was a great spectacle but it was more comical than anything to think that an entire Russian government could be funding one over-sized boxer who could kill a man with one flurry of punches, not to mention turn a blind eye to illegal doping. The fifth instalment in the anthology goes back to the more personal story of the character, and deals much more realistically with the aftermath of loss and the twisted nature of professional prize fighting.\n\nStallone recruited his own son for the role of Robert (Rocky's son) and the result is one of the best father son relationships ever committed to celluloid. The scene where Rocky realises that he has been a negligent father and must make his peace with the boy is affectionate and heartfelt and could never been as realistic without the real life history behind these two people.\n\nOK, there are some flaws and I am not too naive to suggest this movie is worthy of an Oscar. The casting of Tommy 'The Machine' Gunn could have been better as real life boxer Tommy Morrison sometimes appears wooden and is never really threatening enough to Rocky for the final fight to have any tangible tension. Similarly, aside from the final tune of Elton John's 'The measure of a man' the music does not measure up to the awesome and inspirational anthems that have accompanied previous instalments. Any Flick in the early nineties that used rap music as its primary soundtrack has ultimately dated for a modern audience.\n\nMy advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. There are some sad moments in this fall from grace story as well as few goofs in terms of weak acting. But it's not as bad as people say and as the sixth instalment nears completion it's about time everyone got back into the Rocky spirit for one more round.\n\nA good film. 7/10"

        "review_title": "Rocky V is not among the best films in the franchise, however it rescues the development of the characters and brings the melancholy atmosphere and the human facet",
        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky V was an attempt to return to the origins of the great Philadelphia fighter, Rocky Balboa. Five years after the release of the last issue of the series, which by the way was the one that collected the most at the American and worldwide box offices, Stallone promoted yet another fight for the career of his most famous character. But they did not warn the star that the public and critics would not approve the result of the feature, being released as the definitive ending for the story and characters. In this fifth episode of the franchise, Stallone's script seeks to bring a certain novelty, completely changing the focus of the narrative and addressing others who are part of the boxing show business and who had not been previously addressed in the franchise, but misses when taking the lead Rocky. In 1990, there was not much that Rocky Balboa could do. He had fought Apollo Creed twice, trained with the former opponent, faced the fierce Mr. T and practically ended the Cold War with his own fists by defeating Ivan Drago in the Soviet Union. For Balboa's fifth theatrical appearance, Sylvester Stallone turned to his old friend John G. Avildsen, who started it all by directing the first Rocky.\n\nAfter all these events mentioned above, it is more than understandable that Rocky starts the movie by announcing (again) his retirement from boxing. In the first four films in the Rocky franchise, the fighter played by Sylvester Stallone was seen as a potential champion, from his amateur phase in the first two productions, to the professionalization of the third and fourth films. Now, the novelty is no longer the opponent or the scenario in which the battle takes place, but the theme of the franchise: the fifth film decides to debate the issue of the transmission of knowledge between generations, as Rocky ages and retires. This chapter significantly transforms the saga. Before, the goal was victory or personal overcoming (of Rocky, of Apollo), now, history questions the impact of people on each other. This is probably the most psychologically complex film, but also the novelist, in the worst sense of the word, which ends up confusing the boxer's realistic melancholy in the first film with pure cheap drama.\n\nA sudden turn of events is created about the loss of money: suddenly, the rich fighter suffers a financial blow, being forced to return to the old house with his beloved Adrian (Talia Shire), his son (Sage Stallone) and his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young). It may be an unconvincing change in narrative terms, but it's great for the dynamics of Rocky as a whole. The return of John G. Avildsen to the direction is a decision made especially by the different moments that seek to honor \"Rocky\", building a nostalgic atmosphere that certainly finds echo in the feelings of the fans. Rocky V takes on the clear mission of evaluating the character's entire journey as if the boxer were on the couch. Following a good part of the classic narrative structure of the franchise (the beginning recalls the previous film, we have a fight at the end, etc.), \"Rocky V\" also bets on the return of the melancholic tone when bringing the protagonist facing health and financial problems, returning to a difficult life and, mainly, noting the passage of time and the decay of important places for him, like Mickey's abandoned academy, so while Steven Poster's photography direction helps to create this atmosphere through the choice of dark colors and gloomy environments, John G. Avildsen takes the opportunity to also insert the mentioned nostalgia, rescuing several elements of the first film that establish an immediate connection with the most nostalgic viewer, as when Rocky puts his black hat and glasses on Adrian. Confirming this strategy, Bill Conti's soundtrack also recalls \"Rocky, a Fighter\" by bringing the song \"Tack it back\", the slow chords of the classic theme song that pack his memories of his early career, among other moments. On the other hand, in \"Rocky V\" we don't have the famous training sequence accompanied by the exciting soundtrack present in the other films in the franchise. In fact, the soundtrack appears only occasionally, contradicting the presence so marked previously. Perhaps the excess of clips in \"Rocky IV\" motivated the choice of an economical soundtrack in \"Rocky V\".\n\nUnfortunately, the script ends up slipping at several unconvincing moments. First, the explanation for the loss of fortune is extremely forced and nothing justifies anyone looking for it to invest in advertising. Stallone realized that he should bring that naive air back to his series, showing a character of strange wits and conversations, as well as his little advanced intelligence. This was the original Rocky. Melancholic, emotional, tough and charismatic and not just a war cannon, as was being shown in the third and fourth parts of the series. One of the problems of this film is precisely its forced characterization, considering that the central characters completely change their personality, returning to the one explored in the first films, losing everything they conquered and acquired over the other films.\n\nStallone shows the weight of age well in the expressions of pain that accompany him, making Rocky even more fallible and human. In addition, his affectionate relationship with his son reinforces his charisma, especially when he realizes his joy at reliving stages of life through the boy, in simply beautiful moments. Even when he's nervous, Rocky doesn't lose his humanity and his good heart, as is clear from his first dialogues with Tommy. Not even the media and its voracity for controversial news can take him seriously. However, the possibility of reliving the adrenaline of boxing and being able to play the role of Mickey excites Rocky, who finds himself in that young boxer - or at least tries to see in that boy's struggle his struggle to find a place in the sun. So the disappointment is even greater when Tommy leaves him behind to take the easy way. At the same time, he neglects his biological son, who has no vocation for sport.\n\nThis turning point in the script is extremely predictable. We imagined long before Tommy will leave Rocky and give in to the harassment of the greedy businessman experienced by Richard Gant through signs that are not as subtle as the family conflict that his arrival causes - and, mainly, because of the performance of Tommy Morrison. Contrary to what we might imagine, Rocky starts to ignore his own son and wife (Talia Shire, in his farewell to the series) and to focus his life only on Tommy, in an attitude that he certainly would not have and that disagrees with the human character that we knew until then. The relationship between father and son (Rocky and Robert) changes suddenly. And later on it is resolved as if in an act of magic. In addition, Stallone's character returns to his naive and funny personality. Like much in the film, there is no time for events to unfold. Without nuances or details, the whole results without a more elaborate construction. And that is a fatal mistake. Add to this the son's natural revolt, the businessman's sneaky approach and the young fighter's evident ambition and we have the recipe ready for the change of character.\n\nEqually predictable is the confrontation between them, which obviously appears in the final act, but at least it rescues the energy that was lacking in the confrontation with Drago in \"Rocky IV\", still bringing an air of novelty precisely because it happens on the streets, in an almost primitive way. Keeping the camera agitated and close to the characters' faces, Avildsen manages to create the desired atmosphere without making us lose the geographical notion of what we see on the screen, which is very important. The confrontation is raw, full of repressed feelings that are thrown out and, therefore, it works. The expected outcome with Rocky's victory and his reconciliation with his family only confirm the idea of ending his film career in a simple but dignified way. Rocky V is so committed to regaining the amateur and raw aspect of the sport that he leaves the sporting scene, almost mandatory in a boxing film. The long-awaited fight represents the overcoming of the Oedipus complex: Tommy is forced to symbolically attack his father to become independent. On the one hand, this is the most important fight in the saga, because it pits the creator against the creature, as if Rocky were fighting against himself, younger.\n\nAbout 20 years after the film's release, Stallone said Rocky V, who he said was the biggest mistake of his career and only agreed to make the film out of greed. \"I'm very greedy. What else can I say? Rocky V was a big mistake, because the audience didn't want to see the character's decay. They wanted to remember Rocky at his best, and I should have thought about it. I think the movie ended for being more comical, \"said the actor in an interview. In fact, Rocky V is not among the best films in the series, along with the fourth episode, however it rescues some important aspects by returning to focus on the development of the characters and by bringing the melancholy atmosphere and the human facet so present in the best moments of the franchise. It was conceived as a golden key to the franchise starring Sylvester Stallone. In addition to the narrative seeking to complete the character's story arc, the final credits pay tribute to the previous works and all those who were part of Rocky Balboa's life in some way. If he had ended up here, he would have been honest - after all, Stallone did not imagine at that time that Rocky would return 16 years later with the great \"Rocky Balboa\". I'm glad he gave up on the idea."

For not having that passion so present that stood out in the first two and the entertainment so present in the fourth, Rocky V develops from a plot that doesn't build up to be as good as it should be, adds many sub-plots, which most are very poorly established, as well as an exaggerated drama and even characters that have already been established undergo changes in their personality, the main example is Adrian. Another problem is the antagonists, they suffer from the same issues that are in the third movie, which is not exploiting and developing seriously these characters making them strong and imposing figures when they're on the screen, passing the image of important individuals, instead, they're very superficial and boring. Something incredible and new from this one is the fact that even the fights aren't good as before, they're well choreographed and filmed, but fail to excite and far from being breathtaking."

It also really does have a father son theme in it. I felt sorry for his son. Tommy Morrison did a good job in playing his character. All the Rocky movies to me are the same because they all have there specialties. So yea in a way this movie is underrated and actually really sad."

Officially a sequel is most a rehash but happens to be a nice fifth chapter about Rocky saga with intimate Stallone . Two-bit fighter Rocky is now retired and has hit rock bottom , he lives from records but our hero returns as coach and to face off a daring contender . Reluctantly retired from boxing and back from riches to rags , Rocky takes on a new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who betrays him . As the champ's son must adjust to his family's new life on bankruptcy and being ostracized . Although he is homaged as one of the greatest boxing champions in the history also is panned as a down-and-out fighter , being nicknamed as the Chicken Stallion . But \u00a8The Italian Stallion\u00a8 comes out from retirement for fame and self-respect to combat strongest, youngest and faster contender , despite his own cerebral damage , through a rematch on the streets . While Rocky attempts to prove himself and his family , his wife (Talia Shire), brother-in-law (Burt Young) and his teenager son (Sage Stallone , real-life son plays Rocky Jr).\n\nThis enjoyable predictable entertainment displays splendidly the 'formula Rocky'. The movie works at usual manner, fitting appropriately to franchise , even though we know the plot the film works . This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness, dignity , feel-good style such as the initial outing . Great training montage and spectacular and climatic final bout . Writer-director-actor Stallone new entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling . Usual and nostalgic musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography by Steven Poster . The motion picture is lavishly financed by the producers of complete saga , Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and well directed by John G Avildsen who along Stallone created the six Rocky saga.\n\nWhile here the opponent is an invincible young fighter ,champ of the world, played by a real boxer named Tommy Morrison , in previous and subsequent entries the contenders were the following : \u00a8Rocky I and II\u00a8 was Carl Weathers ; \u00a8Rocky III\u00a8 after being dethroned by obnoxious , corpulent Mr T from A Team ; \u00a8Rocky IV\u00a8 against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren ; and \u00a8Rocky Balboa\u00a8 proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight . Rating : Good , being impossible to dislike , the result is deliciously corny agreeable and predictable amusement . Although we've seen it all before , Sylvester manages to make it work one more time and it works every way even better than subsequents Rockys"

It felt very forced, but so too would other elements to come. Rocky's relationship with Tommy Gunn always felt odd and there was no real on screen chemistry. The film also tried overly hard to make it seem like he was totally neglecting his son. The Rocky from previous films was certainly not this dense and would have been able to manage both relationships. Overall the entire story feels forced and the resolution in the end with a bar fight just felt like a dollar store version of what a Rocky film should be. You re never really rewarded with any complete resolution with his son either. After watching you wonder if this film really needed to be included. In truth, it could be removed from the series and nothing would be lost."

That boy would have been out the door before you could say \"ain't gonna be no rematch\".\n\nThey really lost the plot with this fifth installment. And by them I mean everyone involved with the film. In comparison to its epic predecessors, this is just a complete waste of everyones time.\n\nThe horrific thing about this film is that I could forget how bad it is quite quickly if it were not for that one, immortal, headache-inducing line during the climactic final battle.\n\nRocky Balboa Jr - \"Get him Dad, he took my room!\"\n\nJust writing it is enough to make me weep. Which is why this review is now finished."

Great acting, remember folks this a Rocky movie, a boxing movie, an American Classic!! Thanks Sylvester Stallone your a true hero!! I could watch all his movies over and over, anytime. The cast members are all great actors and will always be remembered in the hearts of millions of fans around the world. I can't wait to see Creed as it looks to really rekindle the fire from previous installments of the series. I highly recommend these movies to anyone looking to be entertained."

A movie about being able to distinguish true values in life from current goals that blur the mind. The movie is not excellent in any aspect, but the story is the most interesting so far. Rocky's son is portrayed by Stallone's son, which gives this father-son relationship more credibility. Music is not bad, but it cannot be compared with prequels, except for fantastic \"The Measure of a Man\" by Alan Menken, performed by Elton John. Definitely worth watching.\n\n7,5/10"

He betrays Rocky and hurts Paulie. Thankfully Rocky kicks his ass.\n\nWhat i didn't like at all was the fact that rocky ended up where he started, with nothing to show for what he had achieved in the past.

Okay, so it's not filled with Oscar-caliber performances, but it's well casted and very gritty.\n\nRocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) returns home from his latest victory, a 15-round slugfest with Soviet boxer Ivan Drago, only to find out that he's been victimized by a crooked accountant and has lost his entire fortune. On top of that he learns that he has suffered irreversable brain damage which will force his retirement from the ring. Rocky is then forced back to his roots when he moves his family back to inner-city Philadelphia. There, he re-opens what was once Mickey's gym and begins to train young boxers. Along the way he crosses paths with Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) an aspiring young boxer craving Rocky's guidance. Rocky, reluctant at first, finally decides to become Tommy's manager figuring that this could be his last shot at regaining respect for himself and his family. While all this is going on, Rocky's son Robert (Sage Stallone) is being bullied in school. Robert then begins to feel neglected by Rocky because of all the attention he's giving to Tommy and his boxing career. Soon thereafter, Tommy is enticed by a ruthless promoter (Richard Gant) who promises him a shot at the title. In the midst of this, Rocky struggles to regain the love and respect of his son while Tommy turns against his mentor and challenges him to a fight. The climactic streetfight is one of the more intense fights seen on film, not to mention Bill Conti's wonderful score. Sure, this is not the most inspiring film of the series, but it's one of the realist. It's tough, warm, and nostalgic all rolled into one. Notice the music and feel of the film and you'll think back to the earlier Rocky films (I and II)."

Rocky IV was hardly even a movie, but more a long series of music videos. Rocky V is the last insult, an unpleasant and implausible return to Rocky's \"roots.\"\n\nAll of the characters have been stripped of their good virtues. Instead of Rocky being endearingly dumb, he's now gratingly dumb; instead of Adrian being the silent but strong one, she's annoyingly shrill. As far as the new characters, Tommy Morrison has all the charisma of a leaky toilet. And don't even get me started on the ersatz Don King character!\n\nRocky's quick riches-to-rags story is so incredibly unbelievable. It's one thing to return Rocky to the setting of the first film, but you've got to wonder what made Stallone and Avlidsen think the fans would enjoy seeing the Balboas living in total squalor and ignorance. Like this would have ever happened anyway. Even in the pre-VH1 and E! days, Rocky could have stayed out of the poorhouse by selling his story to news and entertainment outlets.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg in a film that asks the viewer to make so many leaps of faith (Rocky Jr. aged 10 years while Rocky was in the USSR?). Even if you can make these concessions, the story that remains is so very unpleasant. It's obvious they wanted to make it \"gritty\" like the first one, but by 1990 Stallone and Avildsen had none of the heart and soul that made the series work in the first place."

And that is saying something because Rocky IV was just straight up propaganda. I got too bored multiple times and it was so tough to focus.\n\nPaulie getting punched is the best part of the film, then he pretends it wasn't his idea to help Tommy Gunn.\n\nIn the original film boxing was a necessary evil to survive the unjust system. In this one we get the pinnacle of glorifying violence. His kid learns virtue by learning to fight because that's the only thing Rocky values. And it culminates in a celebrated streetlight between Rocky and the boxer he trained like he was actually his son. Really not my tempo.\n\nThis series probably should've just ended after the first film. Everything that everyone hates about sequels is present in this one. Really only a cash grab as it's 14 years after Rocky was too old to fight in the first film. Unfortunately they didn't stop after this one but this is the last in the franchise that I have previously seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fifth Rocky movie has the Oscar-winning director of the first film, John G. Avildsen, returning to the series. There's nothing Oscar-worthy about this one, though. It's the worst Rocky movie hands down. There are things in it worth seeing for fans of the series but, ultimately, it's not very good. While he doesn't direct this time, Sylvester Stallone does once again write the screenplay. He attempts to return Rocky to his roots, no doubt hoping it would recapture the magic of the first Rocky film. He accomplishes this by having Rocky suffer brain damage from the Ivan Drago fight in Rocky IV (not unrealistic given the superhuman way Drago was portrayed in that film). Due to his injury he talks like a moron and can no longer fight professionally. To make matters worse, he loses his fortune and is now broke. So Rocky, Adrian, and Paulie return to the crummy Philadelphia neighborhood where they started out in the first film. Like I said, the hope was obviously to put the pieces back in place where they were at the start and hope for more magic. There is no magic here, unfortunately.\n\nThe story has Rocky coaching an up-and-coming fighter named Tommy Gunn, played by real-life boxer (and supposed grandnephew of John Wayne) Tommy Morrison. Rocky mentors Tommy but neglects his own son (played by Stallone's son Sage). As Rocky realizes the mistakes he's made, Tommy is turned against his mentor by flamboyant boxing promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant). Inevitably this leads to a climactic fight between Rocky and Tommy. This time the fight takes place on the streets of Philadelphia, not in a boxing ring.\n\nThe biggest problem (but not the only one) with this movie is the acting. Tommy Morrison is an absolutely terrible actor. Just awful. He has a constipated look on his face in every scene and his line delivery is cringeworthy. Richard Gant hams it up as the Don King-inspired Duke character. He's just completely over-the-top and grates on the nerves very quickly. He does seem to be having more fun than anyone else in this, though. Sage Stallone does a decent job. Probably wasn't easy making his film debut opposite his superstar dad in a successful franchise. So points to him for doing as well as he did. His character is much older than he was in Rocky IV, by the way. Talia Shire and Burt Young phone their parts in. Sly seems to be parodying himself at times but still provides the movie with its heart. Burgess Meredith returns to the series for a flashback cameo and outclasses everybody else by a mile. His brief appearance is the best part of the movie.\n\nBill Conti returns to provide music after missing Rocky IV. His score is good but the soundtrack of hip-hop songs, including the wretched \"Go For It,\" is weak. The final fight is exciting despite it not fitting in with the \"if Rocky fights again he'll die\" diagnosis given at the beginning of the film. I suppose the series had been increasingly depressing with the last two films killing off beloved characters, but the action and upbeat tone of the second halves of both of those films made it easier to take. This one is drab and ugly and, in the end, Rocky wins nothing more than meaningless bragging rights among the slack-jawed hoods cheering him on in a back alley brawl."

Looking back on it after having watched the new final film in the series, Rocky Balboa, I believe some of the extreme negativity came from two places - the fatigue that comes from watching a fifth installment in a movie series, and the belief that this would be the last movie in the series.\n\nAs the final film in the series, this movie was a disappointment - Rocky is a boxer, and he never steps into the ring. Also, it is a stylistic departure from the film that immediately preceded - V looks and feels much more like Rocky I than Rocky IV, which may have been jarring to some.\n\nRocky V works better as a fifth installment rather than as the final film. We can overlook the fact that there is no training montage and that Rocky does not step into the ring. We can accept the stylistic departure from Rocky IV because Balboa continues in the vein of Rocky V. We can get past the unrealistic plot point of Rocky losing all of his fortune, because we see he finds a way to get by in Rocky Balboa.\n\nThere are still some things that are simply bad in Rocky V that Rocky Balboa does not make acceptable, namely the fight at the end. Rocky V does not build naturally to a fight - this is a movie that is ultimately about overcoming hardship and the complexities of family life. The fight did nothing to conclude that story - it seemed contractually obligated. It is also strange that his son magically ages several years during the few months that Rocky is in Russia.\n\nStill, it is an acceptable installment in the series, if not an acceptable ending. Stallone gives a better performance than he did in III or IV, and it develops the father-son element of the greater story quite nicely."

The entries that Stallone directed had just as much visual flair (if not more), so what's really the point of hiring an outside guy again? Furthermore, the plot to this movie seems crummy. Rocky suddenly just loses all his money, when what now? Yeah yeah Paulie accidentally signed something yadda yadda yadda more vague movie reasons, on with the show. Back to his old neighbourhood he goes, whatever works. Then you have the new characters, who are just really bland. Tommy Gunn is by far the most boring boxer in the entire franchise, and Duke (not the same \"Duke\" from the previous ones mind you, was it really that hard to come up with some different name?) is such a cardboard villain you think you're watching a kid's movie. However, this shouldn't suggest there's nothing good about this movie. The bits with Rocky's son actually work well this time around, even though Sage Stallone can't really act. I'm also quite glad Talia Shire finally gets something to do besides looking worried for 90 minutes. Here it's just 80 minutes of looking worried and some good emotional speeches. \"Rocky V\" will probably always be the black sheep of the family, but it still has its merits."

Boy was I wrong. Tommy quits Rocky and joins Don King's clone. Does Sly enjoy having a big mouthed black nemesis in all his boxing flicks? Okay, 4 out of 5. And why they stick with Pauly the loser is beyond me. Rocky 5 is a testosterone overdose as Balboa ends up in a long overdrawn fist fight with Tommy in the streets as everyone watches. This time Rocky's son does the Adrian look as he watches the news showing it all on TV. I was surprised Stu Nahan wasn't there with the commentary. Rocky sounds as dumb as ever in this movie. Does all the years of leading with his head make him regressively talk even more like an illiterate idiot from New York?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Of the Rocky movies I have seen, this one is by far the worst. Never saw Rocky Balboa so I do not know how that one stacks up to the others. One of the many problems of this movie is its feel, it does not feel like a theatrical movie. It feels like a direct to video or maybe a television movie rather than a movie made for the theaters. I also did not like the way poor Apollo is now just an afterthought getting only one mention in the entire movie. It makes the fight against Drago just the setup for the brain trauma that Rocky suffers in this film that causes him to be unable to fight. This film also has the annoying guy doing the Don King impersonation that gets very irritating after awhile. So the story, Rocky loses all money and is forced back in to his old neighborhood where he meets and up and coming boxer named Tommy Gunn (played poorly by Tommy Morrison)who wishes Rocky to train him and gets mad when Rocky gets to much attention. Why he did not see that coming is beyond me. The movie does not really feature all that much ring boxing and the fight at the end is rather bad and not at all entertaining and the Mickey flashbacks are a bit creepy. Basically, a movie that would have been better off not being made."

So he heads back home to America to be welcomed as a big hero for the U.S. The press asks if he'll fight again, and a Boxing Manager name George Washington Duke offers Rocky an endless opportunity, but Rocky didn't give a straight answer to either one of those, as Adrian insisted that he's planning to retire, and got him out of there before any hesitation. Sometime later at Balboa Manor, Adrian finds out that Paulie gave their loan to a fake banker deal without realizing it. They went to the bank to try to straighten it out but, it was already too late. All the money Rocky has made was gone.\n\nRocky figures that if he fights again, he could win back what was lost. But Adrian tells Rocky, he must see a doctor on his condition. And after a brain scan, it turns out that Rocky has developed some brain damage. The effects are irreversible and will get worse if he fought again. Rocky didn't want to admit it being true, but for Adrain's sake, he's forced to retire. And the Manor was sold. Rocky, Adrian, and Rocky Jr. moved to Paulie's home to live in. Rocky is back to being the worthless bum he was from the start. He decides to reopen Mick's Boxing Ring and become a trainer like Mick himself. Meanwhile Washington Duke does all he could to get Rocky to agree with him to fight for him. But none worked, as Adrain would be there to defend Rocky's condition.\n\nTommy Gun, a young boxer has traveled all the way from Oklahoma to meet Rocky. And would like to learn more about his boxing moves. Rocky didn't know anything about professional managing but gave it a shot. And soon finds himself a new student to be taught about boxing. They soon became brothers, but little does Rocky know is that he's spending more time with his student than his family. Including his own son, who is losing faith in him.\n\nThis fifth installment to the Underdog story, isn't as bad as I've it was. Only reason why it's receive negative reviews is cause it's Rocky's down fall in boxing. Things might seem bad at first, but it does become satisfying by the very end. And the climax fight is one of the best parts. The Rocky fans might not like this one, but it's still a Rocky movie to see every now and then for my perspective. It'll be cool to see Rocky come back in the ring in the latest and final chapter: \"Rocky Balboa\"."

At the End of Rocky 4 we see Rocky is suffering from a Brain Truma inflicted from Drago's Blows Rocky is told he can never fight again and to do so would make him a vegetable. The Heavyweight Championship Title is stripped from him and Rocky announces his retirement. At the next moment he learns that his greedy lawyer has stolen Everything and Rocky is broke. He returns back to his old neighborhood and Rocky who was left Mickey's Gym reopens it and starts training a new generation of fighters Adrian goes back to work in the pet store and Rocky Junior must go to a public school where he must fight for his respect. Everything changes when Rocky is challenged by a dishonest promoter to fight the NEW Champion Union Kane Rocky refuses, At this time Rocky meets a fighter Tommy Gunn who wants him to train and manage him. Rocky begins to get his self respect back as his fighter wins fight after fight and attracts the new Champions attention. Rocky turns down the fight saying Tommy Gunn us not ready and Tommy turns on him. He becomes the Champion and the dishonest promoter becomes his mananger and he Confronts Rocky, A incredible Street Fight ensues and the movie winds down. This one is my favourite of all the Rocky films as it shows Rocky Down but not out. This movie has been unfairly knocked around by everyone from Stallone to the critics and yet it rings so true. Just try it you'll be surprised it's not your normal Rocky film it's better."

It was like they changed the focus back on the characters but somehow butchered it in the process. The result was just horrible.\n\nIt wasn't the lack of Rocky fighting or the fact that Tommy Gun was kind of an evil traitorous friend that used him and then walked away... it was how they handled it.\n\nIt could have been the start of a good story of Rocky as a trainer, but it ended up just being awful. The dramatic family dynamic was shot and it turned into a mess with a convoluted story that hinted at being decent, but always missed the boat.\n\nIt should have been the more personal story, but it stopped being personal the moment Tommy Gun walked on screen and it turned into a mess that didn't seem to know which way it should go.\n\nHowever... the same basic concept was used with Creed, and this time (despite it's FORGIVABLE faults in the script, it was done right). Partially due to the fact that Jordan is a far better actor than Morrison, but mostly due to the fact that it kept what it promised to deliver and the story was more coherent from start to finish."

I often think it would be nice to see what happens to the hero of films after the credits role, Rocky V is just a chance to see Rocky in later life. Stallone has clearly tried to go back to the roots of the original and in many ways it works, but what this film really lacks is anything to really get the viewer on the edge of their seat. In Rocky the whole film has you biting your nails waiting to see what happens, it also contains the two finest pieces of film EVER - 1. When Micky goes to leave Rocky's place and he realises he's forgotten his hat, this is so subtle and so touching i've never seen anything like it before or since. 2. In round 14 of the fight when Rock gets back up and Creed just can't believe it. Rocky 2 has the best training sequence with the whole WIN ROCKY WIN segment, as well as the fight itself. Rocky 3 similarly has great training and some really great moments with Creed and Rocky as well as a touching farewell to Mick. 4 is just pure mindless entertainment, not as clever or as subtle as its predecessors but great training sequences again and a good message.\n\nBut Rocky V, the final film(?!) just lacks anything that really puts it apart from the others, it tries but just doesn't quite make it on the same level. But hey I liked it anyway! Just because it isn't as good as the others doesn't mean it isn't good!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Like many others, I became a complete fan of the \"Rocky\" saga from original film on. All who have followed boxing know that the original was inspired by the New Jersey club fighter, Chuck Wepner, who fought the great Muhammad Ali and knocked the champion down. However, Wepner was also known as the \"Bayonne Bleeder,\" because of the amount of punches he absorbed, with his propensity to cut easily.\n\nThe original took this a step further, made the fight a \"split decision,\" and \"II\" portrayed Rocky's successful rematch with the \"Ali\" figure, Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed. After losing the title and regaining it from Mr. T in \"III,\" number \"IV\" turned pretty ludicrous. The death of Creed at the hands of the Soviet \"super-human\" indicated a lack of information and forethought on the part of those involved, even in the more secretive Cold War period. And Rocky's training on the Russian steppes in the dead of winter, and the whole bout in Moscow were also outrageous.\n\nHowever, \"V\" here, in my opinion, missed the mark others have accorded it. First, even allowing for Stallone's acting style, and some intended exaggerations in the Rocky persona, it is too far beyond belief that Rocky would undergo such extreme metamorphoses as his fortunes rise and fall.\n\nIn \"III,\" continuing after he won Creed's title in \"II,\" his dress, demeanor, speech, and overall sophistication, are on a level with, Pierce Brosnan wearing the $7,000 suits, in his Bond flicks. Rocky's grammar and speech patterns also seem to have improved from the original goon/dropout to those of somebody who may possess a degree from the Ivy League.\n\nBut in \"V\", his financial fortunes have taken a reversal. Rock seems to believe he has no alternatives between plush living and luxuries, Saville Row tailoring, and good diction and grammar --- and looking like his clothes came from Goodwill, living in a tenement, and speaking like a street person from \"Oliver Twist,\" sans accent, or William Bendix, the Brooklyn lug in an old WW II movie.\n\nEven a modicum of consistency in the lead character should have been maintained, despite his varying circumstances.\n\nI'd give the original 10*, \"II\" 9 or 10*, \"III\" 8 to 9*, \"IV\" 4* and this one the same. From what I've heard, the new film (\"Rocky Balboa\"), recently shown in advance premier, to be released several weeks hence, gets well back on-track. Hope so!"

But it doesn't stop him from coaching an up-and-coming boxer named Tommy Gunn, but when Tommy decides that Rocky isn't moving him up quickly, he soon leaves Rocky and begins his new training from Duke. Tommy wins the title he wants, but still does not gain the respect he want. He wants to take out his anger in a fight with Rocky, but as Rocky is now retired from the ring, a street fight would have to do for Tommy. A street fight which could risk Rocky's life.\n\nThe fifth 'Rocky' movie, which for a while was believed to have been the last 'Rocky' film, was slightly disappointing compared to the previous four movies. Although it had a good story for it to finish on, many of the characters we had loved in the previous films were missing, as well as Rocky fighting in the ring. Rocky has his fight out on the street but it's not as fun as a boxing match or even a normal street fight. The emotional from all the characters are still here, but overall, it just lacks all the fun from the first four films. Perhaps the change of director was to blame. Fortunatly, Rocky Balboa was released 16 years later, and gave the series a much well deserved ending.\n\n\"I've got to fight, OK. I've got a problem. I've got to fight.\" - Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone)"

You have to believe that a multi-millionaire couple like Rocky and Adrian would allow a loser like Paulie to have control over their finances. Never would happen. Then, you have to believe that if Rocky went broke, no advertisers would touch him because of a few youthful indiscretions. This, after he has been champ twice over the course of several years and just defeated a Russian champ in a fight seen by the entire world! He could have made millions with one commercial. After these two dishonest plot twists, it's impossible to take the rest of the film seriously. That's too bad, because a plot involving a still wealthy, retired, slightly punchy Rocky trying to guide a young prospect to the top would have been interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "Broke and brain damaged Rocky finds himself forced into retirement in this fifth installment only to have a triumph of heart this time not in the ring. Rocky feels in ways born again when he takes a young heavyweight prospect under his wing who no one cares about when the training of Tommy Gunn begins it is victory after victory but Rocky sees that you can't teach a young lion heart no matter how much muscle Rocky learns of the young and bitterness path that Tommy Gunn takes. Only to lead this Rocky film up to a great fight scene that being the streets something that Rocky knows a little bit about. Boy does Tommy get a piece of Rocky as the hero once again stands at the end. Rocky V is not the best of the series but not the worst because it has the action the emotions and drama that is so common to Rocky. And Burt Young and Talia Shire once again give great support to Stallone to make this good like the previous Rocky movies. It is just hard seeing Rocky in a retirement state and I never liked Tommy Morrison I know he was a professional heavyweight but his real ring life turned out to show that he had a weak chin and his Rocky character had a weak heart much similar to his ring life and his acting abilities are not much the arrogant attitude just never went well Tommy, Rocky V should have cast another boxer or actor because Tommy Morrison sure is neither. Sage Stallone fit good in this movie it proves that a father and son relationship is rocky but love and hard knocks conquers all. Listen close to the words of the song The, Measure Of A Man by Elton John played during the closing credits of Rocky V it gives a true meaning to the Rocky series and also is related to every-day people like me and many others it's just a great song with true meaning. Rumors and news continue to fly around that Sylvester Stallone will return to make a Rocky 6 I have read many entertainment reports that say it will happen. Room is left for improvement and a new start two new ideas to throw at you either Rocky 6 has Stallone to start training his son Sage into the second coming of Rocky or Stallone has his Rocky character come out of retirement and win the heavyweight title like George Foreman did. No matter what happens Rocky Balboa is a American hero forever. The Rocky series is one of the greatest of all-time!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The idea of making a fifth movie about Rocky Balboa was very risky. The story was already getting thin with third movie and the forth one is watchable only when you don't take it seriously. This fifth movie reunites Stallone and John Avildsen (The director of original \"Rocky\") together for the first time since 14 years . After the over the top \"Rocky 4\" this one was supposed to be a back to the roots. A serious drama.\n\nUnfortunately this movie is a failure. The direction of Avildsen is very cheesy at places (Rocky remembering Mick , the hip hop soundtrack , pathos in the final fight). Most of the problems come from the screenplay. The characters of Rocky , Paulie and Adrian haven't really changed and to watch for the fifth time the same characters acting the same way is just annoying. Not to mention that Stallone . Young and Shire overact in their dramatic scenes here. And \"Rocky 5\" does feel similar at times to \"Rocky 2\" (the money problems , becoming an ordinary person once again).\n\nThe story on paper looks good , but as a movie it's a cheap morality story about loyalty, greed and father-son relationship. The screenplay isn't subtle with dealing of all those things. It's hard to believe that Rocky would forget about his son so easily and gave everything to Tommy. Sure , I understand why he did it (because he was in that way still fighting on the ring) , but it feels just too convenient. Same goes for his conflict wit Tommy . The whole potential is killed by sappiness and morality preaching. Not to mention the black and white morality. Tommy Gunn is one-dimensional asshole through all the movie . He could be a tragic figure (he's got a troubled past) , but the one dinner talk is just too little . The boxing manager George Duke is also annoyingly one-dimensional villain.\n\nThe good things are the funny dialogues and as always the music by Bill Conti. Also , the fight scenes are done well and the movie isn't boring. All in all it's just too little to save this unwanted and unnecessary sequel . Thankfully , \"Rocky Balboa\" was a great farewell to Rocky. I give it 3/10."

Love the 80s decade and I regret I am born in 1990 and I have missed these great years for movies. The original is classic and all the sequels are some of the most entertaining sequels to a movie ever made. Kinda underrated maybe. Now back to the 5th which we thought is the last. Here we have an older Rocky with a son. A talented guy wants Rocky to coach him in boxing and he agrees, cause he thinks the boy may become like him and as a matter of fact, he sees himself in this boy while the truth is far from Rocky's understandings. He becomes obsessed by this guy and he coaches him every day all day long and the boy becomes a real boxer that cannot be beaten. Rocky forgets his family, doesn't have time for his son's problems and basically this is the new stuff here.\n\nWell, not bad. Don't like a son introduction, don't like the different Rocky which is kinda stupid, cause Rocky has never been so smart to realize that he is split between coach and a father. He listens to everyone and agrees. At least this is what I have noticed in most everyday life scenes from the previous movies.\n\nWhy it is the worst? Well, it is needless in my opinion. It's not Rocky who fights. In fact I thought that the whole 5th movie could have been made into 2 or 3 scenes and put in the previous movies. It has nothing to do with a progress in the plot except for the son. Anyway, I respect it a lot, cause it is simply Rocky.\n\n6 out of 10."

Along the way he trains a new fighter named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who represents Rocky's chance to regain some honor until of course a promoter steals Gunn away and turns him against Rocky which then leads to a street fight. Rocky V if anything else is at least better than the abomination that was Rocky IV, this one is a little more downbeat and depressing as Stallone regains his honor but none of the wealth he throughly deserved. My whole opinion on why Rocky V is rated so low is because it basically puts one of the most likable characters into such a sad situation which nobody wants to see. Rocky V despite what anyone wants to say does have it's share of slow moments but the training montage as well as the final fight sequence works in at least establishing this as a guilty pleasure. The acting is far better in this entry (The Razzies have a prejudice against Sly Stallone) and really it is at least a watchable entry. Although truth be told the trailer made this seem far better than it was in theaters. Also Rocky V is fairly clich\u00e9d and generally predictable and lacking in a serious villain. Plus Tony Burton and Burgess Meredith are wasted as they are barely in the movie. Although Meredith provides the best moments of heart in the entire movie. I refuse to give into the notion that this is the worst sequel because Rocky IV was far duller. Plus the final fight sequence is pretty exciting.\n\n* * out of 4-(Fair)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The ground that the Rocky films have treaded has become so visibly worn; so evidently eroded, that one might just as well usurp the Rocky statue perched at the top of those concrete steps over there in Philadelphia and entrench it beside the path synonymous with this franchise, so that whenever a screenwriter decides to traverse said path, may they be reminded just where they're headed. Then again, maybe those steps ARE indeed the physical manifestation of such a path, and the statue is in the right place anyway; a public thoroughfare whose appearance in these Rocky films is about as expected as the training montages and the 'final fight' sequence. It is pleasing, then, to be able to say that the positives outweigh the negatives in 1990's Rocky V; a very, very goofy film but not totally devoid of quality. What indeed appears to merely be old ground once again being traversed turns out to be a film mostly about a family and about relationships people have outside of the ring It is to this extent one dares to say that upon its release, Rocky V was the best Rocky film since the '76 original.\n\nThe film will kick off with Stallone's Rocky Balboa arriving back in America following his brutal fight with Dolph Lundgren's young Soviet that climaxed the last film. A national hero, Rocky is barely off the airport grounds before a press conference is called in a hangar such is the demand - but our eponymous boxer skirts informing them of the health issues he has due to his taking of all the Russian punishment and additionally shies away from a fresh challenge from an exuberant black promoter; their tough young runt fighter and a shady looking white agent. Actually, it is his wife Adrian (Shire) doing all the talking in this regard, and we're reminded again of the last film when Drago's partner did all of his talking at his conferences. Looking forward to retirement in his huge Philadelphia mansion chock full of mementos and his loving family, disaster strikes when it's revealed someone as reckless; knock-about and often drunk as Paulie (Burt Young, Adrian's brother and Rocky's brother in law) has botched all of their money away to an accountant and his bad real estate schemes. Leaving his financial adviser's office, Rocky and Adrian walk over a reflection on the floor made by a circular window just above them: the design has it look like they're walking through a sniper's crosshair as the elements zero in on them. With no money, Stallone troops his characters back to their greyer, bleaker beginnings \u2013 wherein Adrian worked in a pet shop and Balboa himself paid regular trips to Burgess Meredith's old sparring gym: there is a flashback of unrealistic proportions in length once he's back there when he remembers a little too much of a training session he once had with Meredith.\n\nThings plough on and Balboa's son, Rocky jnr (played by Stallone's real life son Sage), winds up at a school that sees him have to deal with a bully problem via his fists \u2013perhaps designed to echo how his father and Apollo Creed were once rivals until they came to mutually appreciate one another through their time spent fighting. Mirroring the realism in Stallone casting his own son to play his son is true-to-life boxer Tommy Morrison playing Tommy Gunn, a well-spoken and enthusiastic young fighter from Oklahoma who turns up looking for Balboa, his idol, to coach him into a being a professional. I even read that Morrison took up boxing after seeing the original Rocky film anyway reinforcing this more grounded, realistic tract the film has. There is this sense that, having gone through the pain barriers and having climbed the ladder culminating in a fight abroad with the likes of Ivan Drago, there is nowhere else to go after representing one's county. That final composition of Rocky IV that features a Stars-and-Stripes draped Balboa having conquered the Communist enemy, one of the franchise's more famous images, could be seen as the culmination of a man's career: where does one go from there?\n\nIn spite of the evident hypothesis, the film is not without its faults, although its positives outweigh its negatives. The strand about Rocky's son falling out with Rocky out of not paying him enough interest is weak: your father's working, leave him alone, while this manic idea the film seems to think is more substantial than it actually is, that Gunn is replacing Rocky junior as the son-like figure, is just silly. What tries to make itself apparent, however, is the notion of just how much Gunn hated his own father when he was younger, and if the film would like Balboa to adopt this fatherly/mentoring role for Gunn where he is substituting his own son, the later rivalry between the two carries with it this dynamic of resurfaced spite on Gunn's behalf.\n\nBut we enjoy the film overall, it feels more mature than the previous sequels; as if it's telling a movie about sports and those involved in sports instead of a movie with sports in it. This atmosphere of things shifting; things moving on is apparent by the hour mark, when Gunn fills in as the film's protagonist for a while and the young, Creed/Lang-lite black challenger from the opening has been pushed out of proceedings as the potential opponent for Rocky's latest bout. When the final fight does eventually come around, we observe the film's final act of resistance to submitting to hardened formula when it arrives in the form of a street fight more-so an official, ring set clash. Ultimately, the series has not been as toned down as this since its first film, and Rocky V is all the more better because of it."

        "review_title": "Some Iconic Franchise Scenes Built On A Shaky Premise",
        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky V is widely considered the \"black sheep\" of the Rocky franchise-drawing the lowest marks and practically disowned by Sylvester Stallone himself. While I'll certainly agree it's not an all-time classic, I do think there is enough entertainment and solid acting here to be entertaining and inspirational despite being built on a shaky premise.\n\nFor a very basic overview, Rocky V sees the title character (Stallone) having sustained brain trauma after the Ivan Drago fight and thus forced into retirement. When Paulie (Burt Young) makes a financial snaffu and the Balboa family loses their fortune, they must return to their roots in the rougher streets of Philadelphia. In re-opening Mickey's Gym, Rocky begins training a young, hungry fighter named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison), while a teenaged Rocky Jr. (Sage Stallone)-used to a life of luxury-struggles to cope with his new environment. Behind the scenes, shady Don King-esque promoter George W. Duke (Richard Gant) schemes to get Rocky back in the ring-on his terms, of course-one final time.\n\nLikely due to the notion-the film was subtitled \"The Final Bell\" until deep into production-that this would be the last hurrah for the iconic Philly pugilist, Stallone hands the reins back to director John Avildson and returns the character to his leather-clad, hat-wearing, down-on-his-luck roots. This is a pretty standard \"closing the loop\" narrative for a franchise and in specific scenes works extremely well. But overall, one can't quite shake the notion that \"something is off\" about Rocky V.\n\nThe biggest culprit seems to be the difficulty in scaling the character back from the more superhero-ish bend of the two previous flicks (IV especially). Sly can put on the hat and leather jacket again but it isn't the same actor or character from the 1976 original. When Rocky exclaims to Adrian (Talia Shire) \"did we ever leave this place?!\", it is a rare misfire from Stallone in understanding the character-because the answer is a definitive \"yes\". Had this been the final Rocky saga perhaps it all plays out a bit differently, but as it stands this is indeed a sort of \"middle child\" to the franchise at large.\n\nSimilarly, the angle with Rocky's son is brimming with potential and some of it is indeed realized-yet the young Sage was perhaps not the best choice for the role and the father/son bonding feels a little wooden throughout. Thematically it is well-constructed, but acting-wise it doesn't \"hit\" right.\n\nAll of that being said, Rocky V features some of the best contained scenes of the entire endeavor:\n\n-A flashback to a young Rocky and Mick (Burgess Meredith) in which the old trainer imparts some life lessons that are just now starting to come around. About as good of a old-character-returns flashback as you'll find in any film-period.\n\n-An Adrian monologue mirroring her exhortations in Rocky III. Though Adrian's spirit is always the fuel to Rocky's fire, she sometimes physically fades into the background of these films for long stretches. But when she unleashes an opinion or lesson it is always extremely powerful.\n\n-Rocky living vicariously through Tommy (slamming a heavy bag) during a championship fight on TV.\n\n-Though featuring the usual Rocky-ending schmalz, the climactic street brawl is highly entertaining and does a good job bringing all the film's themes together.\n\nOverall, if I ever watch a short \"sizzle reel\" of Rocky V's best moments, my immediate reaction is along the lines of \"this is a great movie!\". But when watched from beginning to end, it loses-via the odd character/locale feel-a bit of that luster. By no means do I consider it a poor film, but I do still put it behind the grittiness of the original and even the more super-charged III/IV sequels."

The victory speech was nonsense as well. but rocky 5 was more of a low budget style of movie, it was back to Rocky's roots and training and family issues were also considered."

        "review_detailed_main": "As I got to Part 5, I was amazed that none of the Rocky movies were bad. Part 5 is the weakest of the entire series, but in a series this long there are almost always at least one or two that are just train wrecks, but the only really bad thing about Rocky 5 is that Stallone overacts so much. There is a definite feeling that by now we understand the majority of Rocky's life as an amateur and then professional boxer. By this point, it's not hard to watch the movie feeling like you know him personally.\n\nI think what made the Rocky movies so good and the Rambo movies so bad is that Rocky is just an incredibly likable person, while Rambo was tragically born without a shred of personality.\n\nIt seems that Paulie has unknowingly signed over power of attorney to their accountant, who did a little gambling with the Balboas' money thinking he could win big and then return it before they even knew it was gone, and ultimately they end up losing millions. They are forced to sell everything and basically start over back in the same neighborhood where Rocky lived before he fought Apollo Creed.\n\nThankfully, the son has been recast after they cast that goofy white kid in Part 4, although now he's a rich, geeky, spoiled punk. He has become accustomed to living the good life and sinks into depression when they have to sell all of their material possessions and revert back to the sad life that his father grew up in. When they move to the bad neighborhood his naivet\u00e9 makes me think of an ignorant prince gleefully attempting to mingle with the common folk, thinking maybe he can make friends with them by commenting on how charming and cute their poor lifestyle is. Dumbass.\n\nSoon Rocky is preoccupied with a promising and ambitious young boxer that he meets one day on the street corner. His son is preoccupied with the punks that keep beating him up at school but Rocky never seems to have time for him anymore because he's putting so much time and energy into training this new guy, curiously named Tommy Gunn. Unfortunately, things pretty soon begin to go south when the press keeps labeling Tommy \"Rocky's Pupil,\" \"Clone,\" \"Robot,\" etc.\n\nThe conflict of the film is centered on Rocky not allowing Tommy to fight for George Washington Duke, a major boxing promoter who wants to make Tommy his next prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The problem is that the conflict comes from Rocky telling Tommy that Duke doesn't care about him, he only wants to make money off him and then throw him away when he's no good anymore, but in the real world there's really no problem with Tommy fighting for Duke.\n\nYeah, Duke has no personal interest in the guy and no emotional connection, but all Tommy wants is a chance at a real career in boxing. He doesn't need a best friend or a father figure, he just wants to get recognized and make some money. And Duke could probably make that happen a lot better than Rocky could.\n\nBut Rocky is Rocky and we love him, so when Tommy disrespects him, taunting him and challenging him to a fight to prove himself once and for all, we want to see Tommy have his ass handed to him. Rocky, meanwhile, has developed neural damage from all the blows to the head that he's received throughout his career, making a prize fight impossible because no doctor is fool enough to give him medical approval to fight.\n\nFrom there, the movie goes in a slightly different direction. It's not as exciting and big as the previous movies, but is still a good ride. The biggest problem with the movie, however, is the son, who is not only a rich geek but also an arrogant little bastard with no respect for his mother or father or anyone else. He throws a hissy fit on Christmas Day and takes off with his little friend, and soon even shows up wearing this long, dangling earring and talking all tough to his dad. I haven't seen a kid in such need of a good smack since Stallone's other son in Over The Top. WOW.\n\nThe problem is that Rocky is too benevolent and too likable, so when his son acts like this, it is only natural to side with Rocky and wish he would just send the little punk off to military school or something, but instead Rocky works to earn his respect. The movie goes in a completely different direction than the previous films and is noticeably less impressive, but the heart's in the right place and when it comes to Rocky movies, that's the most important thing"

The storyline follows Rocky's return home from Russia to hear his medical report that he needs to quit fighting. He also discovers his accountant lost all of his money. They return to the streets of Philadelphia and Rocky starts running Mickey's gym. He takes on a new fighter who has a shot to be great and it creates a riff between Rocky and his son. Rocky tries to balance raising his son in the streets of Philadelphia, doing right by his new fighter and taking care of his family.\n\nThis movie is directed by John G. Avildsen (Rocky) and stars Sylvester Stallone (Rambo), Talia Shire (The Godfather), Burt Young (Chinatown), Sage Stallone (Daylight) and Tommy Morrison (Cybill).\n\nThese films always do a tremendous job of bringing back so many cast members. Sage Stallone delivers a solid performance and the relationship between father and son was well depicted. Stallone and Morrison play off each other well too. The entire film was well written, put together and interesting...until the Street fight ending. That became a bit cheesy, disappointing and ridiculous. The ending is one of those that likely sounded better written than executed.\n\nOverall, this is an entertaining addition to the Rocky universe that's worth a watch, but the worst of the series. I would score this a 5.5-6/10 and recommend seeing it once."

Anyway, perfect it ain't that's for damn sure. But for some reason this seems to have been labelled the worst sequel ever made and that's really unfair. The first 20 minutes are really great, they bring Rocky right back down to earth after the MTV video that was Rocky IV(although I did love that film, and it's probably still the ultimate 'man film' to this day). It gets a bit cheesy after this and it's just not as fun to watch Rocky train someone as it is to watch Rocky fight, I guess. But there are a lot of good moments in this movie and it tugs on your heart strings a lot more than the action movies that were 3 and 4.\n\nGive it a chance and it may surprise you, but it won't be your favourite."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is already well known that when a popular franchise starts making sequels well after the first trilogy, there better be something for new audiences and fans a like to enjoy. Although most producers do have this in mind, there's always that group that don't and make rehash after rehash after rehash of the same film. This has been seen in dozens of film series, some of which have pulled themselves out of mindless entertainment to crowd-flocking blockbusters and others from once respected initiators to abysmal box office bombs. The unfortunate thing is, most head down the wrong path. As for Sylvester Stallone's first entry into Hollywood with Rocky (1976), it struck such a memorable chord that Stallone ended up exploiting his fictional counterpart for a decade and then some. Sadly for many, if not all fans of this boxing franchise have found this entry to be the least enjoyable. Of which they are right but it certainly isn't garbage like some have said including Stallone himself shockingly.\n\nFor what it's worth, although it does have a couple more problems than Rocky III (1982) and Rocky IV (1985), this fifth entry isn't simply a rehash in plot like the last two films. After returning home from his fight with Drago in Russia, Rocky and family head home only to realize they lose everything when they discover Paulie (Burt Young) lent all of the Balboa savings to a shady accountant that ended up committing fraud on their behalf. Having to sell majority of their possessions to have cash on hand, the Balboa family moves back to Philadelphia hoping to start a new. There, Rocky reopens Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) boxing hall but is continuously followed and harassed by George Washington Duke (Richard Grant) who is looking to get him back into the ring to make one more check of big money. However Adrian (Talia Shire) disagrees because after visiting the doctor it seems as if Rocky has irreversible brain damage that could get worse if he continues to fight.\n\nTrying to stay out of the ring, Rocky discovers a boxer named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who he ends up taking under his wing. The writing, which was penned again by Sylvester Stallone although a little cluttered, at least has things to discuss. Unlike Rocky III (1982) and Rocky IV (1985), which were very straight cut and predictable this time there's things to think about. For those who are tired of the usual Rocky formula that consisted of \"promising to step down, but then is challenged by losing a friend and reclaims respect\", this film goes a different direction. The direction by John G. Avildsen (the same director of Rocky (1976)) here is more family oriented, which to be honest is what made Rocky (1976) so compelling. Sure the sports aspect was fun too but it was the human storytelling that worked best. The concept of having Rocky deal with a less publicized life and starting back where he came from is fine. The problems start when Rocky begins focusing more on Tommy Gunn than his own son played by Sage Stallone. Of course events like these do happen in real life but these kinds of moments aren't the changes fans want to see in the main protagonist. It's careless and makes Rocky look like a clueless father.\n\nEven with this though because the original human characters are of more importance, it is better to see a different focus. Although there have been plenty of persistent antagonists before that Rocky has come up against, Richard Grant is by far the man who chews up the most scenery in the series. This man has one the most hammiest performances; talking extremely fast without stopping and continuously showing his teeth to the camera. He isn't a likable character but he is fun to watch. The Tommy Gunn character is fleshed out but unfortunately turns from sympathetic to unsympathetic over time. Here's what's going to turn off people for those who enjoyed the first four films. The biggest change audiences will see is the amount of boxing involved. Believe it or not there are scenes that have boxing in it - but none of them involve Rocky in the ring. The matches still entertain and pack enough energy to keep it lively but of course for anyone looking to see Rocky fight, will be disappointed either way.\n\nAnother disappointment belongs to the director of photography. Instead of long time camera operator Bill Butler shooting for the production, this time Steven Poster took over. For Poster's work it's not that it was unwatchable or unsteady but it did not have the same feel as Butler's. For the last four films, Bill Butler's work contains numerous wide shots of urban and rural terrain and also concentrated on what was of importance for each installment. Here, Poster just feels like he's shooting because it's his job. There's no aspect to his shots that feel noteworthy of mentioning. Finally, the biggest blow was the music composed by returning veteran Bill Conti who scored every entry except Rocky IV (1985). Conti doesn't change anything, which is good but at the same time doesn't add anything other than updating the themes a tad by adding in a saxophone. Every other track feels like a cut and paste of other tracks Conti had composed from the other films. That's not to say they don't work but each entry should get some kind of an addition.\n\nIts direction is focused on the human characters more than the spectacle of the sport and although all threads don't head down the right path, they at least develop the original characters differently. Also Richard Grant as the antagonist is one hammy actor. But for those who are looking for the engaging boxing matches with Rocky involved, they will be ripped off. That and the music and cinematography are nothing special to mention either this time."

        "review_detailed_main": "...and just like with any other sequel of an award-winning classic like the original Rocky, expectations are high and it gets harder and harder to create anything original. However, this film is a departure from the previous films in that Rocky is actually a trainer throughout most of the film. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as a kid, but as an adult some parts of it are simply laughable.\n\nFor example, the boxing matches are horribly choreographed (as practically all the Rocky films are), making it seem like professional boxers simply take turns slugging each other, with an occasional slipped punch or two for variation. This is surprising, seeing that an actual boxer, Tommy Morrison, co-starred in this film. Some of the music in the film is kinda corny, but that could be said for some of the previous soundtracks as well.\n\nOverall, the typical Rocky themes are present here that are in the previous Rocky films. Rocky has to deal with betrayal in this installment of the franchise, and we get to see what we already knew about Balboa from the previous films: his character is just as strong as his iron will, which is one of the reasons this franchise has captured our imagination."

There are some logic errors. As an example, where is Russian Drago after big fight against Rocky? Or how did Cane got the title after Rocky? Worst thing this movie have is showing us a amazingly stupid version of Rocky. For me, that character has improved us he is smarter than we think by beating up his challenger with his intelligence in third movie. And series are contradiction with each other at this point. Despite these, Rocky V has good parts too. I think Paulie has always been a very underrated character and in this movie he improved this to us. I really liked that. Although it is so ridiculous, final fight was meaninglessly satisfying. But these aren't enough for Rocky V to not being worst Rocky movie."

There`s also other subplots that won`t appeal to a more cynical audience like Rocky`s son finding love amidst a tough school\n\nI will be honest and say that this sequel is far far better than ROCKY 4 which was basically an MTV video but did we really need a franchise involving a movie that deserved one sequel at most ?"

The fifth in the series is, well, absolutely terrible. It's boring and pointless no matter how you look at it. It's also very, very stupid. And inconsistent. And the climactic fight scene is just badly done. In fact, the only really good thing about this movie is the excellent acting, which might have saved it if Stallone had put just one good thing into his script (although there are a couple of good scenes early on). I guess this was just made during the time when Stallone was making duds, and he had to make the Rocky series join the crowd. That's all I can come up with."

All films have tried to demonstrate the power of a white Italo-American boxer, generous, kind with his wife, son and friends. But this Rocky V reminded me part of the sad story of one of the most famous all-time boxers, Joe Louis, who had to come back to the ring to fight against a young and strong Rocky Marciano. At that time Louis was far to be the one who was unbeatable during the 40s, he came back because suddenly debts were coming to him, nobody knows how, and he was simply compelled to fight for his survival. Everybody of that generation in US knows that Louis was simply killed in life for giving the championship \"sensationally\" to white Marciano. So nearly the same is what happened to Rocky in his end as a professional boxer, and he had to train a young and strong fighter who had no ethics and no human feelings. Unfortunately, life is like that. In this film there is also a very terrible manager, George Washington Duke, played by Richard Gant, who reminds me the person of Don King. The latter is well known because of his fight arrangements and other \"movements\" in the boxing area. Therefore I saw the film arranged with some pieces of true story of another great boxer (Joe Louis) as well as the problems of dirtiness of this professional sport, which should be prohibited one day in the future for ever."

Actually, it's not as bad as people say, but I understand why a lot of people didn't really enjoy it either.\n\nIt really lost base with the original Rocky movie and it seems like Sylvester's ego is just blowing up. As Rocky, he tries to train a boxer that has potential to be the next him, his name is Tommy Gunn, and Rocky tries to be the \"Mick\" to him. While it has so much potential, it just didn't have the same inspiration as the other films did. Every Rocky film normally ends with the big boxing match against a man who it seems undefeatable to Rocky. But we always had the optimistic ending of Rocky triumphing and holding his Adrien and screaming out his love for his kid, this time it had ended on a different note.\n\nWhen Tommy starts to get a big head, he leaves Rocky's management for a bigger one, but after all Rocky has taught this guy, can he defeat Tommy on his own? Over all, like I said, it's not as bad as everyone says, but I can see how this wasn't that popular. So my official ranking of the Rocky films: #1 is Rocky, #2 is Rocky III, #3 is Rocky IV, #4 is Rocky II, and #5 is Rocky V. But I would recommend it if you wanna finish the series or see the 6th installment next year. I'm curious, is Rocky gonna defeat some guy while he's in a wheelchair while taking his old man medications? :D Well, I guess we'll have to see.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was just all wrong. There's no other way to say it. Reading some reviews on here I'm suprised to see that some people can watch this movie and really like it. Now I'll admit, I see what they were trying to do by, in a way, revisiting the atmosphere and grittiness of the original Rocky...but this was just not the way to do it. Rocky gets injured and is forced to retire: I'm okay with that idea...seeing that he wasn't really prone to blocking during his fights.\n\nThe reason this film spoils the series is because it simply shatters everything that was built up in the previous four parts. Parts I through III all had good stories, making them pretty good drama/sports films. In pt I he's coming up just trying to get a chance, and does. In pt II he had gotten so close, he gets a rematch and finally wins the title. In pt III (my favorite) he stays on top but loses his hunger and his edge....so a hungry fighter coming up defeats him (Clubber Lang) and he has to go back to basics and regain the edge to climb back to the top. I was okay with those 3. Rocky IV was propaganda at its worst...USA vs the evil Russians, tasteless and preposterous. Here in pt V, Rocky can't fight anymore, but what's worse is that he loses all his money due to his deadbeat brother-in-law, so he's forced to go back to the 'hood where he came up; his wife, used to expensive jewelry and fur coats and sports cars now has to work in the same pet store she did in the original. Why was Paulie still allowed to hang around Rocky & Co after blowing all their money away? How did Rocky's son age 5 years between pt IV and pt V?? It was bad enough we were losing key characters as the series went along (Mickey, Apollo, hell we almost lost Adrian in pt II), but now in pt V we gotta see Rocky right back where he was in the original, wearing the same black leather jacket and hat, except he's more of a nutcase. That is VERY hard to accept after we went on a long ride hoping he succeeded...it's just very hard to swallow as a fan. If he had a couple more fights and then had to bow out gracefully for fear of greater injury and retire is one thing. Close out the series with him on top. But Sly and Co. somehow found it would be cool to strip away everything the Rocky character built in the previous 4 films, and this is what's most uncomfortable about Rocky V. Like Terminator 3, I just refuse to acknowledge Rocky V's existence in my mind. The most unnecessary sequel of all time along with T3 & Godfather III.\n\n* out of **** stars."

The son does not take it well and Rocky's obsession with a younger upcoming boxer is not helping his mood. The younger boxer then leaves, only to be shunned and told to get Rocky to agree to a match.\n\nThe film is great. It gets a great message across and is emotional and clever at delivering the desire of finishing the Rocky series off with a bang (It was originally the last movie before \"Rocky Balboa\" came out in 2006).\n\nOverall, a fan of Rocky who likes this less then Rocky 4 has obviously not gotten the film and if up to me there would be no Rocky 4 and they just forget about that one all together.

To be honest, I don't believe this movie is a 10, but I feel I need to give it that bit extra due to the very low rating this movie has polled on this site. Even though it will make next to no difference to the overall rating of the movie, it will at least make me feel a little better. I have watched the rocky series probably 100 times each and if I had anything to do with making them, I would feel offended that Rocky V is rated lower than Rockys III and IV. I feel that, going on best to worst, the order should be The original on top, followed by the second, then the fifth, then the third, with number 4 coming in last. The original Rocky is one of the best movies ever made, no question. By the second film, Stallone took over directing duties and done a decent job with it, apart from one or two corny things thrown in to it. By the third one however, all common sense in the series went out the window right from the opening montage. The fourth Rocky should have been titled Rocky 80's. If anyone over the age of 12 truly loves that movie, you should be ashamed of yourself. The first movie wasn't a sports movie, it was a drama which happened to be about a journeyman boxer getting to live his dream by fighting for a heavyweight championship. Rocky IV is just a big stupid fight scene, with the rest of the movie just filling in time. Why would Rocky turn down his prize money for this fight? Yes, he was doing it to avenge his friends death, but why not avenge Apollo, and make 10 million at the same time which he could at least give to a charity? The training sequence is stupid, why would there be any gyms at all if running up a mountain was better than all the best equipment available, mixed with steroids. The fight scene itself, which was really all they had, was obscenely ridiculous. There isn't a referee in the world that wouldn't have stopped the contest 3 rounds in. Rocky gets dropped a good 10 times that fight but keeps getting up, yet when he drops Drago once, the show is over. He somehow gets an entire nation to change from spitting on him at the start, to loving him, all in under 30 minutes, and all by punching there national hero in the head. And don't get me started on the speech he gives in the middle of the ring at the end, I'm cringing just thinking about it. The reason Rocky 5 is not so popular, is that people were looking for a sequel to Rocky 4, not another sequel to Rocky 1. Number 5 breaks away from the 80's crap brought to us by the previous 2 sequels. It goes back to its roots of a real story, and they brought the original director back for it. This again has made a drama set in the world of boxing, rather than just a 'boxing movie'. And for people who are just after the action, it actually has more boxing scenes than the other movies, its just Tommy Gunn for most of it instead of the title character, who by the way, was played by Tommy Morrison, who went on to win the World Heavyweight title in real life. The script is solid, the characters have depth and it underlines the corruption that is ruining the sport of boxing. If you really are a fan of either film or boxing, rent the movie again and tell me i'm wrong"

So this movie was a strange experience to watch but I guess it fits in pretty well with the series. I just saw number 2 yesterday, and I have seen number 3 and 4 but I do not remember them too well. Anyway, now that I have seen the whole series, I think it is quite an interesting story. However, some of the pseudo-stuff in these movies is a bit too stupid. Look forward to Rambo 5."

The fifth chapter in the interminable saga of America's favorite pugilist presents a kinder, gentler Rocky Balboa, down but hardly out after his flag-waving triumph against the Soviets in 'Rocky IV'. The new film was meant to be a return to roots, for both Stallone and his alter ago, but humility was never Rocky's strongest virtue, and his fall from grace barely registers as an inconvenience (notice how Rocky himself is innocent in his own downfall, and how the adulation of his fans doesn't waver, before or afterward). Even the suggested brain damage (is this something new?) never quite becomes an issue; it certainly doesn't stop him from beating the crap out of his rogue prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the climactic fist fight, actually more a street brawl than a boxing contest. Elsewhere Stallone's screenplay favors domestic soap opera over fisticuffs, with some predictably sloppy father/son bonding trauma lending it all the conviction of a Hallmark greeting card. It may be hard to believe, but the film is even more cheap and sloppy than its predecessors, if such a thing is even possible."

The forth instalment was something of a self-parodic apex for the series and there was no where left to go other than a fight between Rocky and Satan for the future of the world. Somewhat wisely sensing that perhaps the series had lost some of its original simple human drama and I do mean simple, original director John G.Avilsen was brought back to helm an instalment in which the cerebrally challenged champ is forced back to poverty when his accountant runs off with all of his money - hardly a problem you may think given the ease in forging a big X on the release papers. So its back to the old neighbourhood and Rocky takes on a cocky little upstart, Tommy Gun with the intention of living vicariously through him and getting back a bit of the old glory. When Gunn goes off with a corrupt Don King-type and forgets his old pal, the stage is set for yet another brawl, though this time its out in the street and the crowd consists of a few local drunks. The fifth and you'd have to say hopefully the last Rocky, is moribund stuff. Lots and lots of fairly middling family drama and the man himself can't even deliver the goods in the ring because of potential brain damage - not a problem in Rocky's 1-4 but again, nevermind. After Dolph Lundren the final fight is a major anti-climax, effectively a street punch-up and it all feels a bit like we're reliving old glories as much as the Stallion. A rather dull end to an otherwise enjoyable series."

I wish other films can have as great a fight scene as the one in this one. The cool part is Tommy Gun is Tommy Morrison a real life boxer. I only wish I can see Rocky slug it out with another fighter like Mike Tyson or even fight The Rock.\n\nThis isn't the best Rocky, but it's a very good movie. I still recognize it as being part of the series. All of the true Rocky fans should. My only problems are that the movie is too contemporary, Rocky has brain damage and how it keeps showing flash backs of the Drago fight. Rocky proved in Rocky IV that Drago was just a man and in this they take it back. It's like Drago is haunting him. Also how everyone looks too old, especially Talia Shire. And how the hell did the son grow so fast. I'm sure Rocky wasn't in Russia for years and why was Duke out of the movie so fast. He's a great character. In the end it shows photos from the previous Rocky movies to I guess say it's over. Please Sly. Make another Rocky. End the series with another great Rocky movie. Don't end the series yet."

        "review_detailed_main": "`Touch me and I'll sue,' says a boxing promoter to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) towards the end of `Rocky V.' Rocky hesitates, then reconsiders, clenches his fist and knocks the guy out. `Sue me for what?' he says, and walks away rather happily with his wife (Talia Shire) and son (Sage Stallone) treating him like a god.\n\nWell, how about assault? Yep, Rocky's brain ain't A-okay in `Rocky V' \u0096 his beating in the ring at the end of `Rocky IV' has gone to his head (literally) and now he can't fight again or he'll risk being the next Muhammad Ali. (Not that Rocky necessarily had any brains to begin with.)\n\nMost people complain that the `Rocky' sequels are repetitive. They forget `Rocky V': This one, rumored to be the final installment (but Sly wants to do yet another!), is totally different from all the rest. (Which is surprising, since John G. Avildsen \u0096 director of `Rocky' \u0096 returned only for this one.) I give kudos to Sly for going somewhere new with this film.\n\nExample? Unlike the predecessors, `Rocky V' takes its character out of training, throws away his fortunes, implies permanent brain damage, and basically tells us that this movie isn't going to be about boxing. Instead, it'll be about Rocky trying to adjust back to the gritty side of life. (Which isn't the perfect closing to a series that is all about a nobody becoming somebody. It's the essence of the series.)\n\nEven the final fight in `Rocky V' is wholly different from the others \u0096 it takes place outside, `on the streets,' where Rocky has an unrestricted fight with a guy two times his size. (Guess who wins.)\n\nUnfortunately, the slight originality of `Rocky V' doesn't win it any points \u0096 it is a poor movie by all standards, featuring Sylvester Stallone's worst performance as the titular character. At first it was realistic, then it sort of became comedic; by `Rocky V,' it was downright ridiculous.\n\nThe dialogue is stiff and wooden. The acting is worse. And the direction is messy -- more kudos to Sly for managing to write and direct all of the `Rocky' sequels (save `V') and maintain the focus of the first. Avildsen's return behind the camera harms the movie. Why? On the Special Edition DVD of `Rocky,' Avildsen explains that he told the cinematographer to mimic the style of the first film. `But that looked like a documentary!' he was told.\n\nAnd so `Rocky V' looks less like a gritty, realistic documentary and more like an MTV video presentation \u0096 during the final fight, the handheld pushes in on the faces of anxious spectators, causing instant nausea. Back-and-forth it goes, again and again, rapidly moving to the beat of some \u009190s rock/rap song.\n\nThe film chronicles Rocky's fall \u0096 Paulie (Burt Young) blows the family's fortunes, a new fighter becomes the Heavyweight Champion, and Rocky is left with the grim reality of\u0085nothing.\n\nHe takes a job at Mickey's (Burgess Meredith, who makes a flashback cameo) old gym as a trainer, which is where he coaches a new boxer, and ultimately finds a new villain to fight. The movie goes nowhere else \u0096 it isn't the bold character study that `Rocky' was, nor does it contain the uplifting, victorious underdog message.\n\nIf nothing else, this proves that Rocky \u0096 the character and the films \u0096 doesn't translate well onto the screen nowadays. With firmer grasp of direction, perhaps it would \u0096 which is why, to be totally honest, I'm not so disappointed to hear that another `Rocky' could be coming along soon. I'm sure it will be a more fitting conclusion to the series than this.\n\n2/5"

I watched it the next day and had that same feeling again.\n\nRocky 5 has the \"dodgy sequel effect\" on the previous films in that their quality is diminished by the fact that Rocky, our hero whom we look up to and admire for his iron chin and unbreakable spirit has been reduced to a broken down man who trains some punk kid and ignores his own kids in turn.\n\nThis is not the Rocky we know and love, this is a derivative piece of junk that is detested by fans (both hardcore and casual). It is a waste of a film. The only reason that this has a 2/10 and not a 1/10 is that the fight at the end is pretty well choreographed.\n\nHowever. You lucky people who have not seen any Rocky films and are considering purchasing the Rocky box set have the option of not watching this and instead watching the vastly superior Rocky Balboa instead.\n\nNote to Stallone, Still waiting for the following films from you: Rocky 7, another Rambo and Copland 2.

If this movie hadn't happened, if they hadn't shed cheesy jokes like the robot servant from part 04, the character could have never come back years later in additional movies and I think the character would have become a larger than life joke, rather than the piece of sacred movie history that it is now."

Sage Stallone (Sylvester's real son) plays Rocky Jr in this and he does a pretty good job, Tommy Morrison, a real life boxer who held the WBO heavyweight world championship belt in 1993 plays Tommy Gunn, Rocky's new protegee. He's not the best actor in the world but he does a fine job portraying Gunn, especially since this was his only big role ever.\n\nWhat makes this film so unique in the Rocky saga is how it goes back to basics but actually tries to have a plot, unlike 3 and 4 where the plots where not great this has a good plot, I won't spoil much but Duke is a good villain and is very greedy, something Rocky isn't.\n\nThere's not as much fighting in this one as in the others, and thankfully not as many drawn out montages like in Rocky 4 but the end fight is one of the most emotional in the series, and is a street fight so obviously is quite different to normal.\n\n7/10: The odd one out in the Rocky saga, but it's actually quite good and one of the better sequels.

The film is really caught between telling a traditional Rocky story where he becomes an underdog, trains for fight while dealing with interpersonal stuff and has a big fight and a Creed like story where Rocky transitioned into a mentor of a younger fighter. Neither story is told well and both suffer by trying to combine them. I still don't know why the screenplay felt the need to have the promoter character and Tommy's betrayal. There is a stronger simpler story of Rocky just training a younger fighter.\n\nThe family stuff is pat and ill advised. Paulie is saddled with a very dumb and callous (even for him) mistake in order to get the family back into a blue collar setting. Add in Rocky and Adrian never really get in an extensive fight with Paulie about his mistake and the whole conflict feels hollow. Likewise, the subplot of Rocky Jr. being bullied is resolved too easily. Nothing really gels and coheres in this film.\n\nThere are still a few touching and/or effective scenes in the film. Anything involving Mickey is great. The medical consequences of boxing at least are mentioned as a plot point. The training scenes with Rocky and Tommy showed promise for a different story dynamic. The final fight is absolutely nonsensical on the plot level but it is utterly brutal and it is fitting that Rocky has one fight like that in his career.\n\nThis could have been so much better.; It makes for a terrible conclusion of the original run of films."

But I think I could top that.\" That's when Lawrence Fishburn busts down the door and said \"Dude it was pretty bad, but there is no way in hell any movie you make can be worse then that pile of crap called \"Manos: Hands of Fate\" The bar was set, and in just a few days Stallone had a group of Community College actors together to work on the next installment in the Rocky series. The result of this all is on par with a Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen flick, minus the girls. Instead, just add a couple beefed up guys in really short shorts and a really awful Don King impersonator. This, like the Olsen flicks has a few minutes of crappy dialogue followed up by a music and flashes of sweaty men swinging at each other.\n\nI also know why this movie has managed to squeeze out a four on the ratings. It is the result of a quantity of disillusioned 40 year old Rocky fans who are sitting in their mother's basement with his high school letter jacket on his shoulders and a Keystone Light in his hands. Without these sad folks, Future War would be pushed aside and would be clasped to a ball and chain in order to roll out the red carpet for the single worst sequel of all time, Rocky V."

        "review_detailed_main": "I honestly do not understand why Rocky V isn't considered one of the best Rocky sequels. Not only that, its considered the worst even by Stallone, who chalks it up to his own greed. Rocky V is not only a beautiful film but a natural story and a refreshing change of pace to three sequels that have essentially been the same film.\n\nI only watched this film grudgingly because I had heard such bad things, but I was won over almost immediately by a beautiful exchange between Adrian and Rocky. She's his everything again, something that has been lost ever since Rocky 2, and it took John Avildsen's return to slap that back into place. Stallone's performance is by far his best in a while, probably because he's not distracted by directing anymore (something that benefited his performance in Creed as well). Avildsen provides some sweet throwback to the original Rocky with his good-hearted banter with Robert on the way to school reminiscent of his similar chat with Marie. There's some brilliant directorial choices - Adrian using a certain news article as bird litter, the use of Paulie as Robert's mentor to show the lack of a decent father figure in his life and the emotional manipulation of the audience to build towards the family rift. Rocky offhandedly passes things that should be Robert's inheritance to Tommy, to an extent that we as an audience should want to protest out loud.\n\nStallone's screenplay is better than his one in Rocky 4, with some great themes throughout. Rocky sees himself in Tommy and gets distracted by him at the expense of his son. This is built on themes mentioned in previous Rocky films about it being the only thing Rocky is good at. Tommy Gunn and Robert Balboa are both incredibly deep characters, with their actions having such natural consequences that they feel like real people. Gunn's transformation from friend to adversary is natural even though it takes place within an hour. Rocky's casually using of family phrases with Tommy hurts us just as much as it hurts Robert. That's not to say that the execution is poor in places, but as a whole the movie really works.\n\nStallone gets back to who Rocky is as a character in this movie, rather than just a beefy conduit for 90-minute training montages that were Rockys 2-4. Its a delight to see Talia Shire back doing things again, and she gets more to do in this movie than Rocky 3-4 put together. Her scenes with Stallone keep excelling off their unbelievable chemistry and some great writing. Burt Young pulls out the best Paulie performance yet, and his ability to see what Rocky cannot speaks volumes. I don't understand where all the Razzie nominations came from, the only one who might be worthy of one is the overacting Richard Gant as the caricature George Washington Duke.\n\nThe film's climax was a pleasant surprise for me. I was thrilled they didn't try to make it into a proper bout in the ring, because that would've killed all the buildup. Unlike previous films, where the story has served the fight, here the fight serves the story that's been building for almost two hours and the payoff is incredible."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was a massive fan of the Rocky films as a kid, and I used to hate this one. I used to marathon these movies every thanksgiving and would always stop after the fourth film. Recently though, I had the urge to rewatch them out of nostalgia and almost skipped over V, but I'm glad I didn't. Being older and watching them back to back I think It's a great close the the original anthology, focusing on his life after fighting and all the problems that come with it. It goes more into his personal life and the problems that come after hanging up the gloves. Obviously it's still pretty cheesy, but I think it stays true to the feeling of the previous four films."

The music which was so great in the first two movies (heck, I'll throw in \"Eye of the Tiger\" as well), thoroughly disappoints. Stallone wanted a street-feel to the music, so he (unfortunately) used rap and hip-hop remixes for some of the classic themes. Ugh. I kind of wish he'd make another, more satisfying movie to wrap up the series, but a 50 year old boxer?"

His kid getting the crap kicked out of him hilarious especially since Rocky just ignores it because he's training redneck Rocky and doesn't have time.

        "review_detailed_main": "Man, I don't really know what to say about \"Rocky V.\" Stallone really tried with bringing this movie back to the roots of the original movie. But he infused it with this really convoluted and cheesy plot of the obnoxious fight promoter, George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) causing a rift between Rocky (Stallone) and his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Tommy Gunn (real life boxer Tommy Morrison).\n\nThe most damning thing about this movie is that Morrison is the one who probably gives the best performance, and he was a boxer, not an actor. Stallone is just too much in this movie. He's charming in previous films, but I feel like Rocky is given way too many lines of dialogue here. Richard Gant as Duke is awful too. A completely obnoxious character that just brings the whole movie down whenever he's on screen. And Rocky Jr., played by Sly's real life son, Sage Stallone, is probably the worst performance from a child actor I've ever seen.\n\nI honestly don't mind the premise. It's interesting, but the idea of the Balboa's going bankrupt due to Paulie (Burt Young) signing power of attorney over to Rocky's accountant is pretty stupid. Like first off I'm pretty sure his brother-in-law wouldn't be legally allowed to do that. Secondly, the script could have easily had Rocky be the one who signed over power of attorney, Rocky is that clumsy and gullible of a character.\n\nThe whole \"Rocky with prot\u00e9g\u00e9\" story was done a million times better in the \"Creed\" movies, as it involves a character that the audience actually cares about. Tommy Gunn is pretty boring and literally just shows up out of the blue. The final street brawl is pretty dumb, but it is unique for a movie in this franchise so I'll give it to them.\n\nAlso I've seen some people complain about the hip-hop soundtrack, it's okay. The music in this movie is not nearly as good as the other movies in the series, the original song that plays during the end credits is pretty bad.\n\nThis movie is dumb. If you're a fan of \"Rocky\", just skip this and move straight ahead to \"Balboa\" and the \"Creed\" movies."

Tommy Morrison does ok as the character I guess, but he's just not really very well realised. I'd have happily watched another 15 - 20 minutes (at least) of the movie if they'd taken that time to flesh him out but his 'heel turn' is really sloppily handled. Maybe somewhere out there is deleted footage that DID build him out better? If there is, I hope it surfaces one day.\n\nUntil that day arrives, though, this is easily the weakest entry in the franchise. At least of the ones named for Rocky, I haven't made it to the Creeds yet."

His entire wealth gone because of a bad decision by Paulie (Burt Young)... is this even possible?\n\nTommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison, sporting a bad mullet) is a forgettable, personality-free opponent, especially when compared to the likes of Creed and Lang. Even Drago had more charisma.\n\nThe '90s rap/dance music is dreadful; what's wrong with the rock music of the previous instalments?\n\nRocky ignoring his son in favour of Gunn goes against character. I know he sees a chance of reliving his youth through Tommy, but it doesn't feel right.\n\nI hate the way Robert (Sage Stallone) goes from being the ideal son to a street punk in a matter of days (his dangly ear-ring gets on my nerves too).\n\nThe street-fight feels anticlimactic compared to all of the final boxing matches in the previous films.\n\nLastly, there are too many turtle-necks in the film.\n\nRocky V is still watchable thanks to Stallone and the other familiar faces (Talia Shire, Young), but it's definitely my least favourite of the series."

There is no fixing this kind of disappointment.\n\nThe only positive thing that can be said about this film is the quasi-inspiration, though prototypical, premise of sticking together and weathering the storm.

        "review_detailed_main": "'Rocky V (1990)' is widely considered to be not only the worst movie in its series, but also just a really bad movie overall. Sylvester Stallone himself gave this a zero out of ten when asked to rate it by Jonathan Ross. In all honesty, I don't understand why it's maligned as much as it is. Sure, it's definitely the least successful 'Rocky (1976)' sequel, but it isn't that much worse than its immediate predecessor. I think the problem may be that the movie's hard-left turn into the kind of street-level realism that made the original so successful understandably gives franchise fans whiplash when they're watching through the series in order. That's because 'Rocky IV (1985)' and 'Rocky V (1990)' are like chalk and cheese, as different from one another as you could imagine. The same is true of 'Rocky IV (1985)' and 'Rocky (1976)', but there are a couple of increasingly silly steps between those and that means the difference is nowhere near as blindsiding. This is to say that 'Rocky V (1990)', taken on its own terms in isolation from its forefathers, isn't a bad effort. It's a relatively entertaining experience that attempts to put its focus back on its characters, rather than grandiose spectacle, and it mostly works. The performances are generally strong and the story plays with some interesting themes. Though the screenplay is a bit wonky in places, especially when it comes to some of the dialogue, and the narrative culminates in a bizarre back-alley brawl that's totally out of keeping with the rest of the affair, the picture remains enjoyable and engaging throughout. It isn't great, don't get me wrong, but it's certainly good enough for what it is and isn't the disaster it's often made out to be. In a way, it perfectly embodies the spirit of Rocky: against all odds, it fights the good fight and loses with grace. Now that's what I call an underdog story."

Well Rocky doesn't have a boxing match at all, actually you could easily confuse Rocky V with the movie street fighter.

In this movie Rocky it's in troubles, but he have the enough courage, to win this round, one more in this large story. He will find a new opportunity , to regret to the top of the glory, but this is not simple. He must run in the street's, again. In this movie, the American people always love him, its a national hero, and it's not easy for a hero try to retire, and go home. The people want to see him fighting and fighting, for ever, but he is human, now his son needs his attention. He have problems with the money, he is not rich, like in the old times of glory.

        "review_detailed_main": "The overall story arc in Rocky V is actually quite good, and the movie had a lot of potential if it had been better directed and its dialogue fine-tuned. Sylvester Stallone and the original cast, including Talia Shire and Burt Young, act well. The classic cast manages to keep the viewer engaged throughout the movie, despite the horrible directing and cringeworthy dialogue that plague the film too often. Tommy Morrison is great, in my opinion, and the fact that he's a real-life boxer adds credibility to the role. Sage Stallone did a good job as well and channeled the necessary emotions effectively. The whole Rocky-son relationship was really the theme and heart of the movie, and I had no complaints about that.\n\nUnfortunately, the directing is just disastrous. In comparison to the first four Rocky films, which might have been cheesy at times but were still serious enough in their own reality to enjoy, this one felt like a mockery of everything the franchise had achieved up to that point. I think that if they wanted to make the movie darker and set Rocky back on the street, they should have revisited the magic of the original Rocky and incorporated those elements into the current story. The movie works great as a concept on paper. I like the idea that anything you've gained can be lost in a day, how Rocky is back to his roots, and how his son needs to learn to fight like his dad. I also like how Rocky goes through what Mickey must have experienced in his managerial position. And I like the story of Tommy Gunn's character and how Rocky, who has the heart of gold but isn't necessarily the sharpest tool in the shed, takes him under his wing.\n\nUnfortunately, the character of George Washington is extremely poorly written, and the movie falls flat toward the end. I'm not sad that this story was told, which is why I give the movie a 3/10, but it's not a particularly good film, unfortunately."

It also annoyed me a bit that he manages to become professional so easily, like it's really that easy to go from a street fighter to that in such quick time. The ending was also a bit lame and anti climactic, but I guess there wasn't much other good alternative endings. Overall this a pretty average movie which was expected as it's the fifth movie in the franchise."

It was a noble attempt and one its own Rocky V was a decent drama, even if Tommy Morrison's performance leaves much to be desired. To be fair to Morrison he wasn't a professional actor. Rocky V was a father-and-son tale with Robert getting ignored when Rocky gets a protege. The other side of the film was the question was what does an athlete do when he's forced to retire.

All of Rocky's things are auctioned to pay bills and he and Adrian move back to the old neighborhood in Philly to start over. His son, stuck in an inner city school, is getting bullied, but Rocky doesn't have time to notice because he's training a new up and coming fighter, Tommy Gunn. Rocky can't fight himself to help out because he has brain damage from fighting in the past and must cease that occupation.\n\nI realize this is just a movie BUT.... Celebrities don't go permanently broke by losing their money if the money they got was from something they did. In Rocky's case that would be rising from nothing to be a champion fighter. The people who lose their money and go back to absolute poverty are people like lottery winners where their money was their fame. With no connections, if they lose their money they have no assets. Celebrities usually have connections that open doors in the business world.\n\nRocky would be able to make five figures or more a speech right after the fight with Drago. He could get a book deal. HBO, Showtime, or ABC would hire him as a sports commentator. He could have done promotions of products. The whole premise of Rocky III was that Rocky was so busy doing such promotions that he forgot he was a fighter. So why was that not an option now? Because that was the lazy premise that the writers took to get the story where they wanted it. On top of that both Rocky's son and Tommy Gunn are whiny annoying characters. Put it all together and this is not a boring film, but it is ridiculous and grating at times."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky V starts strong but gradually gets sillier and more predictable. We open in the locker room immediately following the brutal beating at the hands of Ivan Drago and see that Rocky has sustained serious head trauma. He sits alone on a bench and asks one of his crew to get Adrienne. He tells her that he cannot stop his hands from shaking, becoming even more disoriented when he says: \"I wanna go home, Mick\". It is probably the most moving moment of the series. In the last three films Rocky is portrayed as a machine who seems incapable of being hurt. Here we see him in a state of vulnerability that has never been displayed. I was hoping that this was going to push the series in another direction, away from the cartoonish quality of the last three and back to the realism of the first. But as soon as the character of Tommy Gunn is introduced as well as the Don King style boxing promoter it becomes very predictable. Even the secondary story of his son's struggles to adjust to a less luxurious lifestyle that he had previously enjoyed holds no surprises. When the brain damage is reintroduced later in the film it is laughably handled. The film had potential but seemed to play it safe and pander to audience expectations instead of trying something different, ending with the obligatory Big Fight. If handled more realistically the central story of an older boxer mentoring a younger one could have been interesting, more of a slice-of-life film, but when a big box office profit is at stake a major studio wants to eliminate the possibility of a failure. It's a pity that film has become so money minded and lost that ideal to tell new and interesting stories. Sequels have become just carbon copies of their successful predecessor."

To make matters even worse, he mistakenly signed a power-of-attorney which gave his accountant access to all of his money. The accountant then proceeded to lose it all on a risky real estate deal which now leaves Rocky totally broke. So after years of physical punishment brought on by the best boxers in the world, Rocky has nothing to show for it. It's at this time that a young boxer named \"Tommy Gunn\" (Tommy Morrison) approaches him and asks Rocky to be his manager. Figuring he has nothing left to lose he decides to give it a shot. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this series has definitely featured some entertaining movies and I had hoped that this picture would be somewhat comparable. However, the drama wasn't nearly as pronounced and the action was also more restrained when compared to the previous movies. As a result, while I don't think this film was a bad movie, I also don't believe it had the same effect as its predecessors. Accordingly, I rate it as only average."

The late Sage Stallone does a solid job as Rocky Jr and his 'beat the bullies' story arc is reasonably engaging. Sly Stallone and Tommy Morrison however, are atrocious throughout this film and don't even seem like they really care about this tired plot. Tommy Gunn is comfortably the worst villain in all the Rocky movies and Morrison was a very poor casting choice.\n\nBut despite all this, Rocky V is reasonably entertaining.

        "review_detailed_main": "At the heart of Rocky V, there is a really intimate story about living in the past and being blinded to your present, but unfortunately that gets muddled with its somewhat convoluted screenplay.\n\nThe decision to take away Rocky's wealth with a cheap plot device is one that was not needed. Rocky has already hit rock bottom in his life, and ripping away all of his accomplishments makes his story feel like it's going backwards. The entire plot could have been just as effective if he was still at the top of the world.\n\nI think the decision to focus on Rocky's age and sudden loss of relevance is what really intrigued me with this installment. Rocky is no longer in fighting shape, and the one thing that made him Rocky was this fighting background. He gradually loses control of himself, not only as a professional but also as a man. This causes him to lose sight of everything in his life by focusing on gaining that fighting relevance back. This creates some really emotional conflicts with his son that feel impactful.\n\nThis film was on its way to getting 3.5 stars from me until the final twenty minutes of the film. It takes a somewhat grounded story, very reminiscent of the original, and turns it into a cheap gang action flick with a bar brawl. This felt incredibly out of place, and I think a more satisfying ending would have been Rocky leaving the fighting all behind without this physical conflict.\n\nJohn Avildsen's direction is back, with this film being the most reminiscent of the original. The acting is good all around, with standouts being Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, and, surprisingly, Sage Stallone, who was excellently cast across from his real-life father. Tommy Morrison was decent, but Richard Gant was just awful. He had such a campy presence in the film that was really out of place. I hated every time he was on the screen.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this installment more than most due to its more serious tone and interesting look at a post-boxing Rocky Balboa, but it definitely could have been much better with a tighter script.\n\nScore: 60% Verdict: Decent."

Avildsen and stars Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Sage Stallone, Tommy Morrison and Burgess Meredith.\n\nThis is the fifth in the rocky instalment and second directed by John G. Avildsen after the first movie.\n\nThe movie is not like previous rocky movies and focuses more on relations and bonding.\n\nThe plot is different from previous movies and gets predictable after some time. The screenplay gets slow but might not bore you. The acting is good.\n\nThe best part of the movie that it's different from it's previous parts and the worst part of the movie that it's previous from the previous part."

Naturally a fall from grace had to occur.\n\nSure the acting and writing wasn't great. It's the middle lull of the franchise. The drama of the original can't be beat, but number five does its job; it helped get the franchise to the great place that it is now."

But this happens by way of financial misfortune, so there's a cloud of misery that just hangs over the whole movie; calamitous instead of refreshing. It had promise in the beginning, Rocky having to come to terms with brain damage. But then we settle in for a predictable riches-to-rags story with an evil Don King and a street brawl. It's just such a downer."

I know there are lots of people who do not like Rocky 5 (1990), but even though it is not great I do not think it is as awful as people say.\n\nRocky Balboa played by Sylvester Stallone is good in this because I like that Rocky is trying to retire and is taking charge of Mickey's boxing gym. He goes through a lot of issues in his life, and it leads to him training someone named Tommy played by Tommy Morrison turning him into a pro fighter.\n\nI like seeing more of Rocky and Adrian, and they are talking about Rocky quitting fighting because of a diagnosis from a doctor saying he should stop fighting from the many hits to the head he took. I also like the father and son relationship between Rocky and his son Rocky Jr., especially since his son wants to be a fighter like him even though Rocky is focusing on training new boxer Tommy instead.\n\nThe fighting in the movie is good, but I especially like the third act street fight between Rocky and Tommy with a use of the well-known Rocky musical score. I know there are some issues with this movie, which is why people do not like this movie, but even with issues there are good scenes with good moments."

We're back to Rocky(Sly, charming) being an low-on-money underdog, because IV was ridiculous. Of course, him losing all of it just like that isn't much better. They were running out of reasons to get him to fight, and/or delay doing so without it being out of the question. He actually has physical consequences to the climax of the one before this. Though Adrian(Shire, sweet) early on insists that he's in the best shape. \"His strength and physical stamina are extraordinary. He has had a complete medical examination that showed only positive results. Actually, his blood pressure and lab results were astonishingly excellent.\" \"He will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\" ...wait. Still, if it were realistic, this really should open with with the funeral sequence of the previous major character. That's what Francis Ford Coppola threatened to do to to Pacino. And if you think he wasn't serious, just look at his Dracula flick. Clearly, he is, or was at the time, capable of inflicting severe harm with his directing.\n\nShe wants to keep him away from that, because they don't know what else to do with her. George Washington Duke is clearly Don King. There's a brief rant on his ethics. It's got the subtlety of a jab. Paulie is actually utilized this time, so that's something. Mickey gets a little emotional bit. It's nice. More so than he used to be. Of course, that could be the brain damage speaking. We get comedy with growth-spurted(9 to 14 in mere days. Must be Canadian) Jr.'s smarts and his puberty... burgeoning. I realize now it may have been a mistake to not take French. And he also has to deal with going into a bad neighborhood, after growing up rich. Just a matter of time before he'd get training montages, too. Can he get his father's attention, or will it all go to a new prot\u00e9g\u00e9? It'll be difficult if that man is a real-life boxer, a first for the series. Well, not \"is\", was. Freaking HIV. At least he didn't die *this* year. I'd almost bet money that before 2017 starts, at least one more celebrity will kick the bucket. And we should add \"spar\" to the list of words people in this series don't understand. Also, since it's now the 90's, there's rap on the soundtrack. A lot of it, actually. I'm relieved the flashy 90's editing was kept to a minimum. This is 96 and a half minutes without credits, and 100 with.\n\nThere is a lot of violence and a little mostly mild but occasionally strong language in this. I recommend this to those who feel they *must* make it through the series. 5/10"

The guy seems very unlikable and unreliable but Rocky is too naive to get that. One day, Tommy is dissuaded from working with Rocky by a professional promoter named Duke. He offers Tommy to arrange bigger matches and help him win the championship title. Tommy wins it, but right after the match, he is humiliated in the press conference with the claims of organizing an easy match and Rocky being much greater than him. He is frustrated, goes to find Rocky and challenge him. Things get ferocious afterwards.\n\nAt the beginning of the movie, there is a huge continuity error regarding Rocky's son. Although Rocky stays in the USSR for a few months, his son grows about 5 years older when he gets back to US. I also didn't like small kids talking and bullying each like adults. Otherwise, Stallone's acting is great. He does very well that local accent (to my understanding) and naive guy manners. He fights out of the ring this time, but it is still worth watching."

I like that the risks of brain injuries are raised for the first time in the series and the feelings of loved ones are contrasted with the greed of promoters.\n\nI enjoy the nostalgic moments of reflection Rocky has upon returning to his old neighbourhood and gym. In particular the flashback scene involving Mickey that produces a final franchise appearance by Burgess Meredith, who is fantastic in his cameo.\n\nRocky's arc of searching for purpose and reliving life through the character Tommy Gunn is a good idea in principle, but for me a lot of its potential is wasted as Gunn gets involved with the character Duke. These characters for me evolve into fairy grotesque and outlandish caricatures that take sections the movie down with them.\n\nRichard Gant is a very good actor (outstanding in Deadwood) who does a solid Don King impression, but Duke is written like a cartoon villain. Tommy Morrison is not bad, but his more aggressive exchanges of dialogue feel very one-note at times.\n\nSylvester Stallone is mostly good, but he cannot save his famous character here. Arguably Rocky's arc should have concluded at the first sequel, but it continued to a fairly entertaining pinnacle in Russia. He definitely did not require this contrived plummet from grace into more domestic melodrama. Sage Stallone is not bad, but the lack of continuity with the character's age in this film is a distraction.\n\nTalia Shire emerges from the production with the greatest credit. She is consistently excellent throughout her scenes and (along with Meredith) just about rescues the movie from being irretrievable in my eyes.\n\nIt does not help to have such jarring in-your-face visuals in certain scenes that feel out of place. The final fight, albeit having some nice action moves and being uniquely different from other Rocky conclusions, feels over the top in its silliness. The less said about those hip hop boxing montages the better."

If it didn't work for others, it worked for me. Instead of a new brutish challenger who threatens Rocky's title, this story is driven by a fall into destitution and a new protege whose ambitions lead to conflicts with his mentor. Perhaps the closest thing to an antagonist is the ever-present promoter Duke who has been relegated to a caricature, appearing on screen at regular intervals to pressure the other characters in the same way, over and over again. Meanwhile, a side plot revolves around Rocky's son being bullied at school and drifting out of his life. If it sounds like there's a lot going on in this film, you'd be right, and this lack of focus is what lets it down despite its tight focus. However, by the end, it all comes back together in a tense final fight in the streets that brings Rocky back to his roots from the first film."

Actually it's my favorite rocky right after The first one. And I'll tell you why. ROCKY III and ROCKY IV took Rocky out of his elements. ROCKY III HAD to do this as it showed how success affected Rocky. ROCKY IV had too many ideas going thru it. Man VS Machine VS Steroids And political Ideas running rampant. Rocky in an American Flag basically. Rocky IV is not a bad movie but I still don't take it as a serious Rocky movie. Rocky V on the other hand takes us back.\n\nRocky V opens as Rocky starts to feel the effects of Drago's super punches He collapses in the shower and as a frightened Adrian holds him he talks to her and he speaks to Mickey we can't see him. rocky is existing in both worlds the living and the dead. He talks about how mickey used to fight so hard that sometimes he felt like he broke something inside and how he now feels it too. They go home to a media circus where George Washington Duke A crooked promoter is trying to get rocky to defend the Heavyweight Championship against his fighter Union Cane. Rocky is tired and Adrian tells the press after this match against Drago rocky is now officially retired. a medical check up reveals brain damage from drago's punches. Putting a end to Rocky's career. then rocky finds out he's broke sending him back. It seems he had a crooked accountant that tricked Paulie into giving him power of attorney and that and the fact that he had not paid Rocky's taxes in four years leaves them penniless. the Balboa's find themselves back where it all started in Paulie's old house. Rocky finds to his amazement that Mickey had left His gym to Rocky. and Adrian has gone back to the pet shop. sometimes it seems like they never even left.\n\nthen Rocky meets a young fighter named Tommy Gunn. Tommy grew up idolizing rocky and wants him to train him and manage him. rocky takes him on and soon Tommy begins a quick rise to the top. But Rocky while living thru Tommy begins to lose his family.\n\nTommy soon falls under the influence of George Washington Duke and he turns Tommy against Rocky. Tommy Wins the Heavyweight Championship but no one takes him seriously comparing him to Rocky. forcing them into a street fight. rocky Wins and he realizes. He didn't need the money the fame and the glory/ all he needed is his friends his family and Adrian.\n\nROCKY V ends on a happy note. rocky is in a happy place and has his family back. And to me that is Where Rocky belongs On the streets of Philly not rich not poor but doing very Well for himself and inspiring others to do their best. Like I said ROCKY IV took him the furthest away from the roots of Rocky. Rocky V returns him to them.\n\nA Good solid story. and maybe the second best one in the series. at least for me. |"

It was a film about a underdog boxer who lived on the streets and never got a chance to take his shot...It was a very real story that Stallone wrote himself, and it was actually inspired in part to Stallone's real life story. Stallone himself wasn't doing well when he wrote Rocky...he wasn't a star, he was no one... Just like Rocky...Butkus was actually Stallone's dog who he had to give up because he was so poor, and then he was able to buy Butkus back.\n\nStallone continued to write and direct the entire series after Rocky 1. As it went on some movies became more fantastical and over the top. Rocky V goes back to the heart of Rocky and it's really only for people who understand what Rocky is.\n\nIt's not about boxing in the ring. It's more of an allegory for your own struggles, and the struggles of everyone around the world. You can't have a Rocky film without inspirational speeches, motivational speeches and pearls of wisdom... these messages are not to be overlooked, they are the core of a Rocky film...It's not about boxing in a ring as much as it is fighting for what you believe in.\n\nRocky is a real character, he's meant to be relatable, he wins, he loses, he gets knocked down, he gets back up. He's literally meant to embody a part of all of us at sometime in our lives. He tastes success, he enjoys it, it goes to his head, he loses everything, he becomes humble, he becomes wiser...\n\nIf you don't watch this series like it's an evolving character with a real story, real struggles...then you don't understand the Rocky universe. If you think that the character learns in the ring, or grows in the ring or that his fights or struggles are all in the ring then you really don't understand anything about these movies. Most of what Rocky endures happens out side of the ring... the fights in the ring...It's a drama... what happens in the ring is just a way to illustrate that, it's condensed into an allegory so that you can visualize and understand the struggle.\n\nRocky was never about BOXING or even winning. In the first movie he DOESN'T win and it didn't matter. It wasn't about an action star being the hero. It was about a man giving his best effort, to do the best he can in life. That's what life is about, \"It aint about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forwards...\" The first movie wasn't about being in the ring or a champion. It was about Rocky proving to himself that he could take the abuse and could go the distance... Again, this had a much more sophisticated message tied into the film's narrative than \" Rocky is a fighter\"...\n\nRocky movies do not actually have anything to do with the boxing ring... they never do, there is always a deeper message that is the real backbone of the film...Stallone didn't write these as one dimensional beat up action films. Rocky is a much deeper character than that.. Rocky V is a great movie , especially in the context of the entire series... I do include the two creed films as rocky films because they add to that universe and give it closure. Stallone also helped write those 2 films.\n\nReal fans of Rocky who understand the character and take away it's the profundity of the franchise should have no trouble enjoying this film especially in the context of what comes after and even before. You see Rocky as a very rounded individual, who has had ups and downs and who can relate to characters like Adonis Creed. You can see how time and experience has matured Rocky and made him wiser. In the later films you see that Rocky has a lot to offer other people even outside of the ring.\n\nThis film is grossly misunderstand, underrated and is a fantastic addition to the series. The pacing can be a little off at times but over all, it's no where near as bad as people like to think and it's every bit a Rocky movie that it could be. I never understood the hatred for it because at it's core it has a lot of Rocky-isms that the later films in the franchise even pay homage to... (I think Stallone is afraid to admit that he did enjoy this film and that some of it was dear to him...) Creed 1, 2 and Rocky Balboa all have references to this movie or pay it some homage...\n\nAt this point the entire franchise has been tied together in a beautiful, wonderful way. In light of Creed 1 and 2 it even feels more holistic."

The public always liked Sylvester Stallone's movies, but the fat cats in the media always rejected him, just like the character Rocky Balboa was always marginalize for the same reasons. Because Rocky IV is considered to be a patriotic movie, Rocky V got boycotted by the press mostly because the journalists are left wing and thought it is not ok to show Soviet Union in a negative way. Hollywood believes that you can only make social criticism against the right, against Christian religion, against conservatives.\n\nFor example, Rocky Balboa always asks for the Catholic priest to bless him, he always prays and do the sign of the cross, he cared criticize the Soviets, his best friend was an African American (in the leftist world, races are always segregated), he is faithful to his wife and never divorce her despite marital troubles. And he keeps uncle Paulie working for him despite him losing all their money, showing that family matters more than money.\n\nBy the way, in the movie, Rocky and son encourage tourist to visit the art museum in Philadelphia to see the historical paintings.\n\nSo he crossed all the lines that the politically correct people created."

It's about family, how it must be united, because you can't trust many people out there. The song The Measure of a Man, by Elton John, and the flashbacks of all the prior parts, are just great. Besides, that scene of Rocky going back to the old gym and remembering what Mick had told him about not giving up is just one of the best scenes in all the Rocky saga."

Rocky IV will always be the best in my opinion, mainly because of the excellent casting job. Another excelent quality was the performance by Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago.\n\nSo going into this movie I had my worries, I couldn't grasp how they possibly could have complimented the series by making one where rocky isn't the \"Great White Hope\". I was wrong.\n\nI think Stallone did an excellent job on the writing. This was a true rocky move, where as all the other films in the series were fun and exciting, this one went back to the basics of the original Rocky and stole back some of it's charm. Rocky is supposed to be about having the heart of a champion and the faith in ones self to pull through, this carries that same, seemingly forgotten, message.\n\nI did think some of the story was a bit over the top. I also felt the \"back to basics\" attitude, with Rocky being nothing of what he once had been, was rediculous at time. But I feel that overall the story was well written and well told.\n\nI exspecially apreciated the casting of Sage Stallone playing Rocky Jr. Who could have been better to play this role than Rocky's own son.I liked the fact that they kept all of the original actors, in some way or another, and that they allowed him to have a final moment of victory at the end.\n\nI must mention though that I hope this will be Stallones final effort in the Rocky franchise. He is getting a bit old for the role and I think they should leave it alone with him retiring on top."

        "review_detailed_main": "What's up with the negative reviews. If you saw all the other ones 1,2,3,4 and then think deeply about it, this ones the best, because it shows us the never before seen side of Rocky's life.\n\nHe is growing old and he must accept that fact. He thinks often of his past in the film. We see the sort of relationship he has with his son (played by his real son Sage Stallone). And this time for once in his life he listens to what Adrian has to say.\n\nAfter the fight in U.S.S.R. Rocky, Adrian, and Adrian's brother Paulie return from to their lavish Philadelphia home to find out that Paulie had Rocky unknowingly sign 'power of attorney' over to Balboa's accountant, who had, in turn, squandered all of Rocky's money on bad business deals and disappeared.\n\nHe quits from the professional boxing scene due to an injury he suffered in the match against Drago, despite his grim financial situation.\n\nRocky is humiliatingly forced to sell his house and watch all of his expensive belongings be auctioned off to the highest bidder. The only thing Rocky doesn't lose is Mickey's gym, which Mickey had willed to Rocky's son, Robert.\n\nWe see him cry as he remembers the time spent training with Mick. It is really heartfelt. The old gym in which he used to train with Mick now becomes his only source of income and the only purpose of his life.\n\nRocky's son is exposed for the first time to poverty. He is savagely bullied at school for the first time, but he perseveres and overcomes this. He does not get enough attention from his father and this creates a rift.\n\nTommy Morrison plays the role of an ambitious boxer wanting to be trained by the legendary Rocky Balboa. He sweet-talks his way into Rocky's heart. As Rocky cannot box due to the injury he sustained to the head during the fight with Drago, he sees the success of Tommy as himself being back in the ring.\n\nEnter the ruthless boxing promoter: a parody of Don King. He calls himself George Washington Duke, and he has a catch phrase \"Only in America.\" Duke tries (unsuccessfully) to arrange a boxing match between the current heavyweight champion Eugene Cain and Rocky in Tokyo. Adrian promptly intervenes and puts a stop to this.\n\nOnce again Duke tries to tempt Rocky. Rocky now wants to lift his family back up to a lavish life, but Adrian again comes to save him in the nick of time.\n\nTommy's impressive rise through the ranks catches the eye of Duke, who uses the promise of a title shot against Cane and Tommy's own resentment at being compared to his trainer to lure him away from Rocky. Duke pulls up outside the Balboa house with Tommy in tow, who has now been deceived into thinking that Rocky doesn't have his best interests in mind. When Rocky tries to convince his friend otherwise, an ungrateful Tommy drives off in a huff, leaving Rocky for good.\n\nTommy wins the heavyweight title by knocking out Union Cane in the first round, but is booed by spectators throughout the fight and hounded by reporters afterward. They insist that Cane was nothing but a \"paper champion\", because Cane didn't win the title from Balboa. Therefore, the public would never consider Tommy the real champion unless he fights a worthy opponent. With Tommy enraged by the press's reaction, Duke, sensing an opportunity, tells Tommy that he needs to fight Rocky man to man, and settle once and for all who is the best.\n\nDuke and Tommy show up at a local bar to goad Rocky into accepting a fight; Rocky initially declines but after Tommy hits Paulie, Rocky agrees, but instead challenges Tommy to a street fight on the spot. Despite Duke's warnings to keep the fight in the ring, Tommy accepts the challenge.\n\nDespite gaining the upper hand early in the fight, Rocky is eventually beaten down by Tommy and is seemingly out for the count. His head once again pounds with hellish visions of the fight with Drago and Mickey's funeral. He then hears his old mentor's voice urging him to get back in the fight, to go just \"one more round\". Rocky gets back up and, with his family and the entire neighborhood cheering him on, utilizes his vast street fighting knowledge to defeat Tommy, knocking him into the grill of a bus with his final blow. After the fight, Duke commends Rocky and tries to appeal to him, but Rocky has heard enough. Duke threatens to sue if Rocky touches him, but after a brief hesitation, Rocky punches him in the gut anyway, knocking him onto the hood of a car. The crowd cheers as the bankrupt Rocky shrugs and quips, \"Sue me for what?\".\n\nSuperb acting by Sage Stallone, also a special appearance by Oliver Burgess Meredith was very moving. Richard Gant is phenomenal as the boxing promoter George Washington Duke. Tommy Morrison puts in a convincing performance as Rocky's hot prospect Tommy Gunn. Burt Young is superb as always playing his familiar role as Paulie.\n\nBuy this superb film directed by none other than the legendary John G. Avildsen. You won't regret it.\n\nEmail me Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com for more movie info.\n\nThanks for reading."

So he picks up a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in young Tommy \"Machine\" Gunn (Tommy Morrison), allowing him to vicariously relive past glory. Along the way he reconnects with his young son and learns that what really matters is family. It sounds corny in an after school special kind of way, but it not only works, it works magnificently.\n\nROCKY V has long been called the black sheep of the series by fans (even Stallone himself), often because Rock never steps into the ring. True, this is not really a boxing movie, but boxing is never really what made the ROCKY films tick. It's always been the human angles, and for that reason, ROCKY V ranks as a solid addition to the series."

Plus they discover they have years of unpaid taxes. With Rocky's status, he would just need to do a few more fights to clear the money problems. But they find out that Rocky has suffered an irreversible brain injury that could be fatal if he continued fighting. So they move back to the ghetto and Rocky trains young upstart, Tommy Gunn, who is a huge fan of Rocky's. Rocky distances himself from his family and resentment from them towards him grows. When Tommy betrays Rocky, he learns he must fight once more. The first problem is getting Stallone's real son, Sage, to play his son in this. Rocky's son ages 5 years in 1 month. The next problem is how easily they moved back to the slums of Philly. Rocky is the biggest boxer in the world, so why didn't he do some commercials and other celebrity endorsements like he did in Rocky 3? These are the only problems I have with this. What makes this movie great and the most original is the distinct message, subplots, and final fight. In every Rocky movie, the message is to follow your dreams and don't give up. They are conveyed differently in each of them. This one's main message is the importance of family. As Rocky's trainings were growing stronger and stronger, the respect from his family grew weaker and weaker. When Rocky finally does wake up, that last bit has a huge impact. Also, the subplots were great too, just like the others."

If you take out the first and the final(ROCKY BALBOA) episode of Rocky's epic journey this movie stands by far the most compelling. The reason? In this No. 5 Rocky doesn't have to prove anything and still he proved that he's all about soul and keeping it intact when it comes to life. He had nothing on line... some might say his 'reppo' but if you take in consideration what were online previously (his rematch(ROCKY II), first tittle defeat to Mr. T(ROCKY III), loss of his new best friend 'Apollo'(ROCKY IV)) ...in this first of the final Rocky series Balboa makes you believe life still exists after the end.\n\nStallone plays the character of a modern day real life super hero with such easiness and talent that tears you up emotionally. Losing up all the money and being back on the roads isn't easy but Stallone makes you believe Rocky isn't about ups and down ..... he's about Heart and Family. The final street fight scene tells it all.\n\nI still remember the involvement of some window shoppers at a Circuit City store back in 2005 where it was being played on then new wide screen HDTV's. At least 30 some people were stood numb watching Stallone take on Tommy and all cheering as if it was a real-reel-re-shoot. Just unbelievable. ROCKY V deserves a moment of truth ...

        "review_detailed_main": "Only a 4.5 IMDb rating, I am shocked, Rocky V has been severely underrated. I thought this was as brilliant as Rocky I and II. Why I give this such a high rating is that Rocky V reverts to a similar formula of the first two of the story not just focusing on the boxing but the characters and that's what Rocky V does.\n\nThe basic story continues after the fourth with Rocky (Stallone) coming home after his fight with the Russian boxer. He and his wife Adrian (Talia Shire) along with her brother Paulie (Burt Young) are greeted by the media when loudmouth George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) who is a boxing promoter comes along with his boxer to challenge Rocky to defend his title but he refuses as he announce to the media he is retiring. Things become bad for Rocky as he finds out he had irreversible brain damage if he continues to fight, it could kill him. They get even worse when Paulie makes an investment with Rocky's money with a crooked accountant and they lose everything like their house and they have to move back to Philadelphia where they move back into Pualie's house and Adrian gets her old job back at the pet shop part time. Meanwhile a young up and coming boxer Tommy \"machine gun\" Gunn asks Rocky to be his coaching manager and eventually he agrees as the kid steadily rises through the ranks. Rocky spends all his time with Tommy therefore alienating his wife and particularly his son Rocky Junior (played by his real life son Sage Stallone). This develops a side story of his son starting school and going through a rebellious stage against his father. Later Tommy becomes frustrated with Rocky for not getting him fast enough up through the ranks to become the new heavyweight champion of the world so Duke who on several occasions tries to persuade Rocky to fight snatches Tommy who does win the title but is goaded by the public and media for not acknowledging Rocky's contribution to his win. Eventually after this Rocky and his son make up but Tommy wants to prove to the media and public who goad him about his easy win of the title that he is a true champion by challenging Rocky to a fight. He goes to where Rocky lives and they have a brutal street fight.\n\nRocky V is fantastic. Stallone gives his best performance to date. And for the first time you feel a real bond between him and his son. This makes it more authentic by the fact that father and son are in real life. There are some touching moments between them and it's sad to see his son rebelling but understandable because of his fathers rejection. Sage Stallone gives a engaging performance showing he has a great future ahead of him. Talia Shire as Adrian is excellent in this as ever and has more screen time whilst Burgess Meredith as Rocky's recent deceased coach has a small cameo in a flashback which he is terrific in. It's nice to see him again. Tommy Morrison as Tommy Gunn perfectly captures his character of a young man hungry for opportunity to progress after a bad childhood being beaten by his drunk father with a hot head as he is manipulated by Duke for money and power. There is more of a story to this as the true bond of family between husband, wife and son is felt. Throughout the films we have seen Rocky and Adrian transform themselves into more outgoing people who love each other and who we have come to care about as we have been with them on that journey. The final fight is brutal but inspiring. The film gives out a great and encouraging message that even though Rocky may have lost his career. He never lost his family or his respect as when he defeats Tommy Gunn, people chant his name. And that's what truly matters. Rocky V has heart and it's sad that Rocky Balboa (2006) is the last one, which I have yet to see and know it will a fitting end to a great boxing legend and cinema character icon. Rocky as a franchise is one of the best and strongest I've ever seen and I will miss these characters. Rocky is a legend that will never be forgotten. I certainly won't forget."

        "review_title": "Not the Worst of the \"Rocky Films\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rocky V\" premiered in 1990 to awful reviews. I have watched this film at least a dozen times and still cannot understand why some people hate this film. Granted, it's not in the caliber of \"Rocky\" or even \"Rocky II\", but it's definitely just as good as \"Rocky III\". First, the return of Mickey Goldmill in flashback sequences makes this film worth watching. The chemistry between Sylvester Stallone and Burgess Meredith is outstanding and was greatly missed in \"Rocky IV\". The \"Get up, you son a bitch! 'Cause Mickey loves you\" speech is simply touching. It's rare when a older man tells a younger man how important he is to him as he is to the younger man. Most child actors are annoying to watch, but Sage Stallone does an admirable job as Rocky's son Robert. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Rocky tries to give a crash course lesson on being \"street smart\" to his son and reminds him that they have to stick together because they are the \"home team\". Simple dialog like this adds to the reality of the situation. Father Carmine from \"Rocky II\" makes a memorable return and it was nice to see Mikey from \"Rocky\" return to Mick's gym like Spider Rico did in \"Rocky Balboa\". Here's some information that hasn't been written much. The original actress who played Little Marie from \"Rocky\" makes a sad cameo that was later edited out of \"Rocky V\". She became the \"whore\" that Rocky warned her she would become in the original \"Rocky\" film if she didn't start hanging out with better people. Talia Shire and Burt Young continued to perform well in their roles as Adrian and Paulie. John Avildsen returns to direct what was originally the last of the Rocky movies. My only problem with \"Rocky V\" is the silly street fight ending. I think audiences would of rather see the formula of Rocky training and beating Tommy Gunn in the ring. Also the character of George Washington Duke was too over the top for my taste. By the way, the main bully who takes Rocky's son coat is now playing Eric on the HBO series \"Entourage\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "In this fifth installment of the Rocky franchise our hero is out of luck. Brain damaged from the epic encounter with Drago in Rocky Four, he is unable to fight and in danger of going bankrupt, he moves back to his old neighborhood and begins training up and coming fighter tommy \"the machine\" gunn. For those of you who have heard the general conscientious that Rocky V is not worth watching I strongly advise you to give it a go, the criticism of this film is something that has never really made sense to me. It moves away from the traditional format, (which by the fourth installment had become a series of consecutive montages with badly dated music) and sees Rocky go truly back to his roots even wearing the hat again, add that to a return for Burgess Meredith in some bitter sweet flashback scenes along with a simple but decent storyline and you get a vastly underrated film. Rocky is persuaded by a young contender Tommy Gunn to step back into the world of boxing as a manager and coach. The pair of them get carried away with Tommy's success, Rocky begins to neglect his son and Gunn becomes lured by the riches promised to him by Richard Gant's George Washington Duke, an obvious ringer for Don King. Rocky V takes the franchise full circle and makes note of the obvious changes that have taken place in the world of boxing, and come to think of it, most sports around the globe. It brings a clash of the two types of sportsmen, the old fashioned and the new. The difference in Rocky 5 being that the new uses his skills seeking fame and fortune and forgets what truly matters, a mistake Rocky himself makes in the third film. The main difference however is that Tommy lacks one special ingredient that Balboa has, something that made Rocky endearing to us all in the first place, Rocky has got heart and so has this film. It's also worth pointing out that it hasn't dated nearly as badly as the third and fourth installments and aside from some dodgy late eighties-early nineties rap music it doesn't have much else that ages it. At the premier of the recent Rocky Balboa film I saw an interview with Sylvester Stallone he referred to Rocky V as a \"bad film\" and he also noted that when he bought the anthology he \"threw the fifth one out.\" Now i'm not going to kid myself and think that the great man is going to ever read this review but ill take the tiny chance that he might one day glance at it to say:- Sly, give this one another go its not bad, not bad at all. Rocky V is certainly not deserving of being chucked out of the anthology, in fact it deserves its place in there, it deserves to share a box with the rest, more so that Rocky Four anyway. While this film may not have the emotional punch of Rocky Balboa it certainly isn't worth disregarding. If your one of the many that skipped this one, go on, give it a go, you might be pleasantly surprised."

        "review_detailed_main": "As of January 3, 2007, \"Rocky V\" has a rating of 4.0. And I feel that it deserves better. It has the same feel as all of the other \"Rocky\" movies. It is a standard underdog type of tale. The story is realistic until the end kind of. And the 5th installment deals a lot more with Rocky Balboa's family life than his fighting and such.\n\nAfter the events in \"Rocky IV,\" Balboa returns home to the USA to great media and country applause. But that soon ends when Rocky is pronounced unfit to box and he loses all his money with a financial error by his lawyer. So he moves back to the old neighborhood in Philly with Adrian and Robert, Jr., his son. Paulie makes quite a lot of appearances, but it is unsure whether he lives with his brother-in-law's family or not.\n\nAnd that's when Rocky meets Tommy Gunn, a hotshot fighter who requests Rocky's help. He has enormous potential, but he is young and he refuses to listen. When Gunn wins fights, but craves more, he ditches Rocky for a big time promoter. But Gunn is always in his mentor's shadow as he learns after the fights and money don't bring him the love of the fans. For its like Adrian Balboa says, \"They love you because you won with heart, not your fists.\" But Tommy, not knowing that, feels that he has to beat Rocky with his fists to show he is the more superior fighter.\n\nWith plenty of good suspense and lessons, the 5th installment in the \"Rocky\" series is a winner, but most don't seem to feel that way."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, this is another Rocky movie using the standard formula, but it still strikes a chord. The story resonated with me, as it is representative of how decent people will devote time and energy to jobs, or outside influences that do not deserve it. There are important family issues addressed, and I think that is valuable as well. While this particular movie might not be the best in the genre, it still evokes a lump in the throat, and is easy to watch. I think that many of the reviewers were a bit harsh in their assessments. This movie represents a part of the story of Rocky Balboa, and contains interesting psychological commentary. It is possible that the values that are represented in this film were not fully appreciated in the 90's, but that are becoming more significant in the turbulent times of today. Perhaps Sylvester Stallone's timeless message about the importance of \"family\" needs to be heard again. This movie is well worth your time, at least once."

        "review_detailed_main": "Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to 1990's Rocky V.\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: Forced in to retirement, Rocky (Stallone) returns to Philadelphia bankrupt, he starts to train an up and coming fighter.\n\nSince the last time Sly played Rocky, rival muscle man Arnold Schwarzenegger was growing in popularity in the late 80's, whilst Stallones popularity was on the slide, following a string of movies that under performed (including a new Rambo) so he went back to his old pal Rocky to save the day and revive his career. Sadly this time it did not work.\n\nRocky V is possibly one of the most misunderstood movies in Stallone's filmography. OK he over acts at times, but the heart is back in to the franchise and Stallone is playing Rocky again, unlike IV, where it was just like watching any other Stallone flick. Sadly audiences didn't want to see Rocky lose all his money and end up back where he started and they stayed away in droves.\n\nIt has some great scenes. The Mickey flashback is a real high point, and the street fight (although awfully edited) is fun too. Bill Conti is back scoring the music to the movie, sadly a lot of 90's rap music is also present too!!\n\nStallone rates this Rocky 0/10 which I think is very harsh. I'm in the minority of people who thinks this is a better Rocky movie than the much more successful Rocky IV."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whilst I hold Rocky I and Rocky II as the best in the saga Rocky V for me easily sweeps third spot. People expected something different to what this movie actually produced and I get the feeling some people would have rather had a cheesy boxing film like Rocky III and Rocky IV and have Rocky take on an ultimately unbelievable opponent. Well sorry, not here. I like this heart filled and story oriented film, unlike Rocky III and Rocky IV this film isn't primarily about boxing, it's about Rocky trying to pass on his legacy to a young boxer who eventually stabs him in the back.\n\nIn training this young boxer Rocky neglects his family and starts to forget what means the most to him. Perhaps he feels that Tommy Gunn is the only way to bring the money and the flash lifestyle back to him and his family, but by the end of the film you will know that the only thing which ever mattered to Rocky was his family and his own self respect. This trumps Rocky III and Rocky IV in the fact that it had an emotional impact, which both of those films lacked. Mickey's and Apollo's deaths were played out within two or three scenes before Rocky is back with the cheesy music preparing to take on an unbelievable opponent in those films, you practically forget that those characters died. Where as in Rocky V after losing his money and then being convinced by Adrian not to fight (remember this line \"I don't care about the money, it's you\" or something similar?) that scene right there had an emotional impact. That impact played out for several scenes including the epic flashback scene in the old gym with Mick, which was probably the second most emotional scene in the entire saga after Rocky reading to Adrian whilst she is in a coma. With Rocky low on his chips, he trains an upcoming fighter who quickly replicates Rocky's style and hunger in the ring however eventually shows that he doesn't have Rocky's heart when he leaves Rocky for a selfish promoter weho promises Tommy fame. The film deals with what was a big issue in boxing and that is corruption.\n\nWith a damaged brain and haunted by visions of his previous fights Rocky is in no shape to fight but the ruthless Tommy Gunn persists and eventually knocks down Rocky's closest friend Paulie, to which Rocky can take no more, demanding Gunn meets him outside for the biggest and most emotional fight in the saga.\n\nEasily laying Gunn down in the first round Rocky claims his anguish at what Gunn had done to him stating that he and Gunn were suppose to be like \"Brothers\", hurt; Rocky makes his way back but Gunn isn't finished he sneaks up behind Rocky and attacks him cheaply in the street. Rocky dazed and confused takes Gunn's best punches, each one triggering flash backs to the powerful Russian beating Rocky. Eventually Rocky is put to the floor and Gunn cockily strides off with his promoter.\n\nBUT Rocky isn't down yet, his last inspiration comes in the form of a vision of Mickey who proclaims \"He's no machine, I didn't hear no bell! GET UP YOU SON OF A B|TCH! COS MICKEY LOVES YA\", no Rocky fan can deny that this line sends a tingling down their spine and a sparkle in their eye as Rocky rises and shouts to Gunn \"Hey Tommy! I didn't hear no bell! One more round\", Gunn obliges whilst his promoter who doesn't believe Gunn has what it takes to beat Rocky in a street fight shouts \"You lose you're finished!\". So this is it Rocky and Gunn exchange blows before Adrian and Robert arrive at street side to offer their support, when it looks like Rocky is losing their cries of support spur him on. Add to this the awesome music and you really have an epic battle."

Tommy Gunn betrayed and disrespected Rocky by being gullible, falling for Dukes malice and praising Duke for his success and not Rocky and also getting manipulated by Duke into getting Tommy to fight against Rocky. The fighter Tommy Gunn was a very powerful fighter with strong and very powerful punches and before the final fight against Rocky in the street at the last scene, Tommy Gunn came across as being a fearless and very powerful fighter with mixed personalities 1) a friendly guy, 2) A Cruel man who wants to betray a friend and think's he's the most dangerous man around. Even though Tommy Gunn was a very powerful fighter he wasn't aware that eventually Rocky would toughen up and knock the crap out of him. The tension in this film was there and there were some great flashbacks of Rockys past which made this film also dramatic and emotional.

However, Rocky isn't much help to his son whose always being distracted on reclaiming his fame through Tommy Gunn. Good stuff there.\n\nThe movie also stressed how good of a wife Adrienne was to Rocky standing by her man even when he lets out all his frustrations.\n\nI know many don't care for this movie and even Stallone isn't fond of it. But I always thought this movie had heart. If nothing else even for those who dislike it it played an important role in Rocky 6 and the Creed franchise in that Rocky was no longer living lavishly in mansions. The Rocky in Rocky 3 and 4 didn't really feel authentic. He's always more a down to earth guy"

        "review_detailed_main": "Guilty pleasure Rocky movie of mine by Stallone / Avildsen. Rocky V is not a bad Rocky movie, it is my least favorite in the Rocky movies. The movie is completely opposite what Rocky IV succeeded. It is a good movie but quality is terrible. Sly him self was very disappointed whit this movie, have gave this movie a 0/10. I don't blame him, seeing this film for the first time as a kid. I hated this film, but over the time it become quilty pleasure of mine. I like this film for a Stallone / Rocky fan I luke this film for what it is. I love Rambo: Last Blood, who come out this year so I like this movie. I love all Rocky movies. I will gave Creed II another chance I going to pick up 4K Blu-ray disc.\n\n\"You're a piece of garbage. This ain't none of your business. None of my business? He spit blood for you, put you ahead of his own family. And you bring these rat bums around here? Kill his dignity? Rocko made you your shot. He's the real champ. You're just a joke. Get out of here before I break your face.\"\n\nDirected was by John G. Avildsen who directed the original Rocky movie. The fifth sequel in the Rocky franchise is so bad awful film like The Karate Kid Part III. Sly wrote a script in which his character Rocky dies, but he was un happy with that decision so he decide to change the script. I watched all five Rocky's on TV in high school, (even the fifth one) I grew up with Rocky movies, my classmates loved Rocky so did I. All four Rocky movies are great, Rocky V is not near good as the first four. It is so bad that I love it, it for the saga, nostalgia. I watched this movie on VHS tape when I was in high school, it was the only Rocky movie I owned it. I always thought it is a good movie on it is own way. This movies I watched before Rocky Balboa (2006) come out.\n\nRocky Balboa is once again dawn on his luck, because of incompetent accountant Rocky loses all his money and he falls under bankruptcy. Rocky moves to a neighborhood he grew up. Since he has no money, he opens Mick's gym and trains some new boxers. A scrupulous promotor George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) offers Rocky a match of his life, against a curernt champ Union Cane (Michael Anthony Williams). Rocky refuses the match and he retires, because after his last fight he has a brain damage and he can become a brain dead permanently. This new unknow boxer name Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) comes along and ask Rocky to train him at first Rocky refuses. Second time around he tooks Tommy under his wing trains him to become number 1 contender, but his new student get's brainwashed from Duke, he betrays his best friend, mentor and turns against him. Now Rocky has to fight one final match of his life.\n\nThe good: Sylvester Stallone's performence is the only worth watching of this movie. The rest of the film is boring time waster. It is sad that Rocky stopped boxing. Street fight betwen Rocky and Tommy is really good. It is different than other four movies. It is not a boxing match it is a real street fight. Stallone and Tommy Morrison did an excellent performance. They really hit each other. I like that is a still sports movie. We see Rocky under the shower after Drago fight. Thank God we got Creed II with Dolph Lundgren reprising his role as Ivan Drago. Ivan Drago was only in archive footage so Lundgren wasn't in this movie. I like the final bell, Burgess Meredith reprise his role as Mickey in a flashbacks I love that. I love the soundtrack Go For It! (Heart and Fire!) by Joey B. Ellis. I love the training sequence between Rocky and Tommy. Elisebeth Peters as Jewel, Robert's friend was one hot sexy babe in this movie. George Washington Duke played by Richard Gant was more type of Don King and he succeeded and played the charcater well done. The first time we see Rocky smoking because in all four movies I don't remember except first movie.\n\nThe bad: Talia Shire's god awful performance she stinks at acting. Adrian is awful in this movie. I hate her god awful performance. Sage Stallone's worst performance as Rocky Jr. The story is awful. I don't care seeing Rocky been a ritered boxer and a mentor to a new kid. I hate that song on the end of credits The Measure of A Man I hate that song I hate it so much!\n\nI like that Rocky fixes his relationship with his son Robert and fight's Tommy on the finale. Burt Young's performance as Paulie Is solid and excellent. It is different than the last four movies, buut I am glad we got this movie because we wouldn't got Rocky Balboa. When i watched this movie in 2000 when I was first year in high school I am really greatful that my mom was still alive that time. I am thankfull for this movie to happen. Rocky all five movies were part of my childhood and my high school years I went trough. Rocky IV Is a classic to me it is the best Rocky movie ever made. Rocky V was my second film in the Rocky movies I saw and it is a let down on many counts. This is the last time we see Talia Shire in any Rocky movie she did not return in Rocky Balboa. Rocky V is a guilty pleasure of mine I love this movie to death. Thank You Stallone for this awesome fifth Rocky sequel.\n\nR.I.P. Sage Stallone, Tommy Morrison, Burgess Meredith, Tony Burton they are all missed."

        "review_title": "This is the most unique of all the \"Rocky\" films. Does that make it good or bad?",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rocky V\" (1990), this movie is generally overlooked by most people. I just have to ask, why? Not only is this the most unique film of the entire series, it also has the darkest storyline. Which, to be honest, makes it all the more exciting to watch! \"Rocky V\" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story is that Rocky is forced to retire from boxing due to brain damage from previous boxing matches, especially from his fight against Ivan Drago. That's certainly a different turn in the series. Five movies in, it was the perfect time for a twist like this. Rocky takes over Mickey's gym and agrees to train a boxer named Tommy Gunn. That causes Rocky's son, Robert, to fall into the wrong crowd and then eventually withdraw himself from the family. Another unique thing about the plot of this movie is that the final fight isn't a boxing match, it's a street fight. That was a neat change of pace, because it's the only film of the series without a boxing match with Rocky himself! Talk about a dilemma, the storyline keeps you invested all the way through from beginning to end, which is what a perfect plot should do. As for the acting, it's stellar as usual from all the actors and actresses. We have a couple of new characters in this film; Tommy Gunn, played by Tommy Morrison and George Washington Duke, played by Richard Gant. They play the main villains in this movie and their performances are great. Both actors really make you personally hate their characters, which results in their eventual comeuppances being all the more satisfying. Of course, Sylvester Stallone is the shining star once again. One cool thing to point out, Rocky's son is played by Sylvester Stallone's actual son, Sage Stallone (R.I.P.) in the \"Rocky\" films, with the exception of the movie, \"Rocky Balboa\" (2006). His presence adds a whole new depth of chemistry to the characters! All of the sets/locations are perfect, they set the tone for the story and also give this movie a great atmosphere. As far as special effects go, there aren't that many. But, all that are utilized are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Bill Conti is nothing short of a masterpiece. Bill Conti is one of my top 10 all-time favorite film score composers, and this soundtrack is nothing short of phenomenal. This whole film score is fantastic, my personal favorite part of the soundtrack in this movie is the music during the final fight. It never fails to give an adrenaline rush! \"Rocky V\" is such an unfairly overlooked movie. It definitely deserves more praise than it usually gets. But, I'm not a common person who mirrors someone else's opinions, I'm always honest with my reviews. \"Rocky V\" is an excellent film! I can watch it over and over again and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen \"Rocky V\", what are you waiting for? Go and see it today. Or else, George Washington Duke will sue you!"

Maybe the reviews at the time were bad because people thought this was the last one? I could see why that may make it feel unsatisfying. But give this film a chance. It's brilliant."

This breaks from the traditional Rocky formula and bring us to a more down to earth depiction of the life of an aging athlete. There is a lot of Family drama, heart warming scenes and also some good old life lessons. If they wanted to make a soulless sequel, they just had to invent another big bad rival to challenge Rocky in a big climax for the tittle. However, they instead took the risk to make something different, and (even though that by itself doesn't make a great movie), in my opinion, the result was something that enriched the character and story of the previous films. It makes them feel more real. As stated before, it won't bring home any awards (although that is hardly to be expected for the fourth sequel of a saga), but it's really fun, entretaining and made with a lot of heart. I don't really know what else to expect from a movie."

Just not ready to see Sly be Mike just yet... I like Creed but not the 2nd, partly because of it been to for today's society. Its a shame Sly didn't direct it.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rocky V\" (1990) is a unique and introspective chapter in the Rocky series, offering a much-needed return to the gritty realism and personal stakes that made the original film so compelling. Directed by John G. Avildsen, the fifth installment in the saga takes Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) out of the ring and places him back into a more grounded, real-world setting, dealing with the aftermath of his boxing career and the challenges of life after the spotlight.\n\nIn this film, Rocky is forced to confront not only his physical limitations but also his role as a father and mentor. His relationship with his son, played by Sage Stallone, provides some of the film's most poignant and emotional moments. The tension between their differing views on life and the impact of Rocky's legacy adds depth and complexity to the story, shifting the focus from grandiose boxing matches to a more personal and relatable struggle.\n\nWhile Rocky V doesn't have the same high-octane energy of its predecessors, it compensates with a deeply emotional narrative. The film explores themes of family, loss, and redemption, with Rocky attempting to rebuild his life after losing his fortune and his health. The film's final showdown, a street fight with Tommy Gunn (played by real-life boxer Tommy Morrison), is a fitting and symbolic conclusion to the saga, emphasizing that the real battle is not always fought in the ring.\n\nWhat sets \"Rocky V\" apart is its raw, unpolished tone, which contrasts with the more polished, over-the-top spectacle of \"Rocky IV.\" While it may not be as universally beloved, the film stands as a testament to Rocky's resilience in the face of personal adversity. With a strong emotional core and a focus on the human side of its legendary protagonist, \"Rocky V\" is an underrated and thought-provoking entry that provides a powerful conclusion to the character's journey before the series reinvents itself in later installments."

        "review_detailed_main": "So, Rocky V is definitely the black sheep of the series, but it has its moments if you're a fan of the character. The story tries to shake things up by taking Rocky back to his roots in Philly after he loses his fortune and his physical health following his brutal fight with Ivan Drago in Rocky IV. This time, instead of Rocky in the ring, he's in the corner as a trainer to a young, ambitious boxer named Tommy Gunn. But things go south when Tommy's ego takes over, and he betrays Rocky, leading to a showdown in the streets rather than the ring.\n\nWhat's interesting in this one is how it deals with Rocky as a person who's lost everything and is struggling to reconnect with his family, especially his son. It's rawer and tries to bring Rocky down to earth after the crazy, larger-than-life battles of the earlier films. Unfortunately, though, it's missing some of the charm and grit that made the earlier movies so great. Rocky's journey from glory to struggles feels a bit forced, and the lack of an actual boxing match left some fans wanting more.\n\nStill, Rocky V has that Stallone heart and nostalgia, and it offers a real attempt at depth in Rocky's character, showing a side of him as he tries to be a mentor and a father. It's not the fan-favorite, but if you love the series, it's worth watching just to see Rocky in a new light."

It doesn't have to be the usual Rocky on a boxing ring, that was already played out in the last four Rocky movies.\n\nRocky had his shine as a boxer, it only seemed fitting that he became a trainer later to get betrayed by Tommy the machine Gunn and his sleazy Manager.\n\nTo me, the sixth installment of the series was the worse one. It was slow paced and didn't seem realistic. Rocky V still had the magic touch.\n\nRocky V is entertaining and under appreciated. 7/10 seems about right. Ignore the noise and give this one a fair shot."
