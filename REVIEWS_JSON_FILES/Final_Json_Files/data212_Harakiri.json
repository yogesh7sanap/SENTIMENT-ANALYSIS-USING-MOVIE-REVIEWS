        "review_detailed_main": "I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by \"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.\n\nThe film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of \"The 47 Ronin.\" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.\n\nVery gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.\n\nIt is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.\n\nThe psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like \"Downfall (Der Untergang),\" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.\n\nThe repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.\n\nThe over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to \"Harakiri\": \"There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own\". Masaki Kobayashi's \"Harakiri\" aka \"Seppuku\" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers \"Harakiri\" \"is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!\"\n\nThe film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, \"One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business.\"\n\nAt the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, \"Harakiri\" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.\n\nA Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, \"Harakiri\" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film."

I've seen one samurai film prior to this.\n\nFirst off, I had to check it was actually made in 1962, it felt way more advanced than that, the concepts and production.\n\nI thoroughly engaged with it, the story was fascinating, and where I expected it to tell a general story, the focus was pretty much on one single character, Hanshiro Tsugumo.\n\nSome of the pacing me be hard for some, the long drawn out scenes, I find very purposeful. The music is engaging, the acting terrific.\n\nI wasn't surprised to learn that the swords and multitude of blades used in this movie were real, and that I think is one of the film's most successfully aspects, its authentic, a story presented in a very real fashion.\n\nIt's a powerful story, 9/10."

Perhaps it took a non-Westerner, free of all of the cultural baggage and ridiculous associations, to see straight into the heart of the tragic mode and make it palpable and alive in the twentieth century. That is not all: the black and white cinematography is both formally assured and often outrageously daring; the soundtrack is one of the finest efforts of the greatest Japanese composer of the 20th century (or any century for that matter); the acting is demonically inspired; and the narrative is relentlessly gripping and involving. The film illuminates the relationship between the individual and society and between society and history. It is a tender meditation on familial love and the ties of friendship that transcend even death. This film will cut open your bowels, pull your soul out, and force you to stare it in the face. There may be other films that attain similar heights, but I cannot imagine any film, ever, being more perfect. Forget Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, the Godfather, etc. etc. all of those commodified canonical works that everybody raves about because everybody else is raving about them. Don't get me wrong, they're fine--but this stuff is 200 proof. See it today. Buy it yesterday."

        "review_detailed_main": "Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one's beliefs.\n\nEvery frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film's technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa's samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa's work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being \"a facade\" to directly quote the film.\n\nI say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan."

It is really a tremendous example of outstanding film making! The cinematography is absolutely exceptional! However it is the haunting plot of a samurai explaining the meaningless and worthless flawed belief of the samurai spirit which grips the viewer.\n\nTatsuya Nakadais mighty performance in Harakiri further proves for me, that he is without a doubt one of best actors in the history of film. This man takes on his roles with such prowess that it is easy for the viewer to forget that you have seen him play a different role in another movie.\n\nBy the way - The Criterion 2 disk DVD version is mint!

        "review_detailed_main": "Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.\n\nThe plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of \"Ran\", \"Kagemusha\" and \"Sword of Doom\") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think \"Wild Bunch with katanas\", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).\n\nKobayashi's direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai's performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.\n\nIf you're open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you've ever seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "The generation that came after the renown Japanese directors Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi is generally regarded as less talented. The main representatives of this generation are Kaneto Shindo, Kon Ichikawa en Masaki Kobayshi. Personally I would like to make an exception for Masaki Kobayashi, who is in my opinion the equal of Kurosawa, Ozu and Muzoguchi.\n\nKobayashi is best known in the West for his ghost stories \"Kwaidan\" (1964). The rest of his repertoire, among which the samurai movie \"Harakiri\" (1962), is not to be sneezed at either.\n\nA samurai movie is usually seen as a sort of Western of the East. Main ingredients of the Western genre are action and the battle beween the law (good) and the villains (bad).\n\nIn \"Harakiri\" (which literal translation is: hara = belly , kiri = cutting) in stead of the law there is the samurai code of honor (Bushido in Japanese). But this code of honor is not the good element of the film. Rather it is revealed as a force of ruthlessness and hypocrisy. In the film the Bushido is represented by the Li clan.\n\nIn \"Harakiri\" there is also little action. Only towards the end there is something that can be seen as a \"shoot out\". But in this shoot out the evil is not overcome, but only revealed as shallow (the idol of the Li clan is shown to be an empty armor).\n\nTranslated in Western movie genres \"Harakiri\" is therefore no Western. Maybe it can be categorised as a Court room drama. The heart of the film consists of main character Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) telling his sad story. This story is in essence a requisitor against the Bushido. The performance of Nakadai as a broken Tsugumo is brilliant. His requisitor is not only aimed at the Li clan, but also against his own past. Once Tsugumo also was a samurai.\n\nKobayashi was a convinced humanist all his life. Apart from \"Harakiri\" he also made the 9,5 hours epos \"The human condition\" (1959-1961). This epos is situated in World War II. For Kobayashi kamikaze was just another form of Harakiri and thus just another utterance of the old Bushido."

It did not have sub-titles, and as my Japanese is not very good, I made some assumptions about the characters, relationships, the plot,etc. When I saw it with sub-titles, I was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions I had made. That I made so few errors is no credit to me, but rather to how well the plot, character development, character relationships, and the overall movie were done.\n\nThe movie is not limited to feudal Japan, for it transcends this era. It has lessons, for those who look for this in art. For instance, just one example occurs to me now: It underscores the need for a person to stand on principle, and to maintain their honor, ethics, and dignity, even when those who are the political leaders have long since lost theirs. However for purely entertainment value, the realism, suspense, art, and action could not be better. Words fail to express how this film captivates and entertains. Few films can equal this one. It is a \"must see.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Seven Samurai is pretty great, but I think Harakiri is even better. This tale of a ronin seeking revenge and exposing the flawed samurai code is so close to perfection. The story is engrossing and despite the slow pacing it's never boring. What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera's slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant. The editing is great and purposeful too. There's not a single weak performance but Tatsuya Nakadai in the leading role steals the show.\n\nMy only complaints are with some of the pacing and fight choreography. There's a standoff scene in the middle that could have been cut (since it felt like a cheap way to build tension and it wouldn't make sense for them to continue waiting afterward) and the long flashback could have also been trimmed. The film is 2 hours 13 minutes but I think exactly 2 hours would have been perfect. From a fight choreography standpoint the one-on-one fight scenes were well done but climax was shaky. There were many interesting ideas and moments in there, but also several points where I was like \"okay, how did they not strike him there?\"\n\nHarakiri is an outstanding film that deserves more attention. If you haven't seen this film check it out. The Criterion restoration is absolutely beautiful. I intentionally kept this review vague since it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible. With a few thousand more ratings, this film would be pretty high up on the IMDb Top 250, and I'd be delighted to see it there."

The warrior Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsur\u00f4 Tanba) convinces the clan to force Chijiiwa to really commit suicide using his bamboo blade as an example to other samurais that would appear using the same pretext to receive coins from the master.\n\nTsugumo discloses that the lad Chijiiwa was his son-in-law that was forced to the situation expecting to raise some money to treat his sick wife and baby son. Further, Tsugumo had arrives in the house expecting to die not committing suicide, but revenging Chijiiwa, his daughter and his grandson.\n\n\"Harakiri\" is a heartbreaking and tragic story of poverty and revenge in a period when Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa clan and thousand of samurais lost their work with the fall of the clans.

The result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script, the perfection of the interpretation, and a very well balanced \"mise en sc\u00e8ne\" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression, a code transgression and an image transgression.\n\nMost of Shambaras take place during the Edo Period but rather late in that period (just before the Meiji Era) as most filmmakers try to romanticize and glamorize the period which marks the end of the Samurai thus playing the nostalgia card. Here Masaki Kobayashi transgressed the genre and decided to film a story taking place in 1630, 17th century Japan during the Edo period. At that time Japan was ruled by a Shogunate (Ieyasu Tokugawa). The Tokugawa Shoguns established Peace and continued to rule Japan for a remarkable 250 years. But such a long period of Peace had a price and Ieyasu Tokugawa brought the whole country under tight control. He cleverly redistributed the land among the more loyal vassals, breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands of samurai into poverty.\n\nIn the film an elder ronin, Hanshiro Tsugumo, the hypnotic Tatsuya Nakadai (Goyokin) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act of Seppuku as he can no longer stand his Life of Dishonor and Poverty. There, the administrator tells him about the fate of a young Samurai who committed the same suicidal ritual few times ago. But there is much more to this story and soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another. As the film progresses we witness a confrontation between two conceptions. One is based on a Human code; the other is based on a rigid traditional one.\n\nMasaki Kobayashi uses both symbols and raw images to show this confrontation. The film starts with the Display of a Samurai shining battle armor representing the feudal system. The armor is empty of anything human and strongly symbolized the feudal system. Can a code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging the Human condition? This is in essence the question raised by \"Hara-kiri\". We see this armor soiled and dragged but at the end of the film the armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened, as if changes in an given Society take some times to occur. Indeed social Progress has always been slow leaving Men and Women struggling with their condition.\n\nThe suicidal ritual, Hara-kiri reinforced the sense of cruelty. Raw images of Ronin opening their stomach with a sword were a transgression at that time (1962), still is today. In the film the ritual is portrayed in a non glamorized way and very realistically. It also symbolizes even for the Japanese audience the lack of sense in the act of Seppuku. In fact Hanshiro Tsugumo is the only one giving meaning to this act by motivating it with mixed feelings of Love, Revenge and Sorrow, in short with humanity.\n\nWith the film Hara-kiri, Masaki Kobayashi signed one of the greatest philosophical films. The script by Shinobu Hashimoto is a good example on how to make a story clear but more importantly sufficient enough for anybody to understand the drama, in one word universal. Also writer of J\u00f4i-uchi: Hairy\u00f4 tsuma shimatsu aka Samurai Rebellion (1967), Dai-bosatsu t\u00f4ge (1966) aka Sword of Doom or \"Hitokiri\" aka Tenchu (1969), Shinobu Hashimoto is among the greatest writers of the 7th Art.\n\nI can not recommend Seppuku enough, every single frame, acting, piece of music is irreproachable. The story is profoundly Humanist, timeless and universal. I suggest we all confront the codes of our respective societies in order to find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards a terrible social Hara-kiri"

Nor am I proud that not only have I spent so many years of my life in front of a flickering screen but that I actually know the number of films that I have seen.\n\nWith that said, \"Seppuku\" (\"Hara-kiri\") makes that whole trip worth while. For every hundred pieces of celluloid tripe you can be fortunate to find a diamond in the rough and for me that was my first experience with this Kobayashi masterpiece. Pure enjoyment, pure excitement.\n\nThe film is brilliantly constructed and multi-layered in such a way that the film defies genre classification. To call it a \"samurai film\" is akin to categorizing \"Psycho\" as a murder mystery. \"Seppuku\" could easily slide into the mystery, suspense, drama, or western genres and feel right at home. Perhaps an eastern film noir, if you will.\n\nKobayashi's telling of the tale incorporates elements of despair, tradition, fortitude, revenge but mostly love, pride and honor in a grand visual style.\n\nThe story's setting, direction and Tatsuya Nakadai's strong performance invite the inevitable comparison to Kurosawa and his favorite samurai Toshiro Mifune. All are of such high merit that I would propose ignoring the temptation to compare and appreciate the genius involved in \"Seppuku\".\n\nFor those who have not seen \"Seppuku\" of course I strongly recommend that you do so but I also suggest that you avoid reading any synopsis and take delight in watching the tale unfold.\n\n10/10 (and not too many of the 6,035 are 10's)"

While ruthless in nature, \"Harakiri\" does a wonderful job in conveying the history of ancient Japan, samurais and the Bushido code. While some people's knowledge of samurais only extend as far as the Disney film, \"Mulan\", \"Harakiri\" sheds a great deal of light on the underlying meaning behind the truth, strength and honor of the code. With a protagonist that is both relentless and appealing, \"Harakiri\" delivers special performances all over the board. While it moves a bit slow, there is an undeniable enchantment about this film. The story, while heart-wrenching, is so well done that you come out of it rooting for more. It makes you question history and the way it's perceived, just as I'm sure Mr. Kobayashi intended. With engaging choreography and near-perfect consume and set design, \"Harakiri\" brings you to a place and time that you otherwise may not have known existed. Kobayashi does a wonderful job at conveying the internal struggle between all characters, men whom have an obligation to their families, and those who have one to their code. This film challenges all the elements of revenge, redefinition and ritual. A job very well done."

It's a nice change, but ultimately boring.\n\nSTORY: If you've watched Japanese (samurai) film then the story is old. It's as simple as vengeance sought for some injustice, which isn't a bad thing. But after awhile, this becomes boring, if not useless. There is ZERO CHARACTER development here, which seems inconsistent with the (seeming) intent of the director. But I felt almost nothing for the characters, or their travail.\n\nACTING: Again, as to Japanese samurai film, it's fine. But there's NO acting that stands up, let alone out. Just dull, flat, mechanical. Aside from the perfunctory grunting, the dialogue is predictable.\n\nTEMPO: Very, very, very slow. Not atypical for the sub-genre, but brutally slow.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: The scenery is lack-luster, but at least tidy. Props are OK, but sparse. Sound is OK, but nothing interesting.\n\nDIRECTING: This same director churns this stuff out on script and cue. For the sub-genre fine, but doubt there's much transferable skill to other film genre.\n\nOverall, a slow-moving, run-of-the-mill samurai film. Dull. Pointless."

We are introduced to a cizudo character, who seems to have no emotions and someone who has been through a lot of things. Then, during a flashback, we watch the story of a young man who seems innocent and lost in life. It's a cruel film, which doesn't succeed in shocking you visually if necessary for the narrative. It's incredible to follow the protagonist's story and see him go through different moments in his life. Happiness, despair and revenge. Harakiri is a masterpiece of cinema."

Being Black&White and almost theatrical, it leads you to think rather than watch enchanted by the picture. It is not really a samurai action film, neither a film like \"Hero\" or \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (both of which I liked so much, for different reasons), although some scenes have common elements. I know not everybody will like it, it is a bit slow and also cruel but it has a point for both.\n\nThe picture was a little blur at times, but I don't know if it was the film's or the cinema's fault.

The protagonist is a ronin (a samurai without a leader) in a peacetime era in Japan's history. Coming to an estate, he hopes to take his own life, but this is merely the jumping-off point for a long, complex story.\n\nIn addition to the acting and directing, the viewer should pay attention to the sets. They're arranged so as to establish a mood. The Criterion DVD includes interviews with the director, screenwriter and star, all of whom talk about the challenges of making the movie. Kobayashi had anti-authoritarian tendencies, and these come out in the movie, with its challenge to militarism and entrenched power. Basically, to dislike this movie is to have no humanity.\n\nAll in all, it's no surprise that \"Harakiri\" often turns up on the lists of the greatest movies of all time.

Ironically a film that almost seems a scathing critique of Samurai culture seems to me to be it's most ideal representative.\n\nDespite what seems like a small budget, this movie brilliantly blends exquisite cinematography with excellent story and top notch acting in order to give you one of most powerful films you could ever see. This film was made almost sixty years ago, set in a time hundreds of years in the past, yet everything about it resonates with a common humanity that reaches through time and across all cultures.\n\nThis movie is a must see for anyone with a true passion for cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film left me thinking on the irrationality of many that have power. When on a position of power, we are inclined to keep it, to maintain the status quo and avoid its loss, or the loss of the tradition that justified that same power. Saito 's irrational rigidity speaks not so much about his control over the situation and the profound trust and loyalty he has on the symbols of his daimyos and of the bushido code, but on the fear of it disappearing. It is only when we fear for that disappearance and for the uncertainty of the future to come that we cling as much to the past and to the promises we made on the past, even when this may lead us to the extreme of irrationality and even inhumanity. Harakiri illustrates what most go through when faced to confront their beliefs and to question the legitimacy of what we swear is the ideal or best way of living/thinking/behaving; a lesson that can be applied in any situation especially if it involves a decision that, as in the film, will affect a third person directly. His inflexibility made me see his character as rather weak and stubborn, rather than loyal and centered."

Although a long movie, ''Harakiri'', keeps you in interest because of the good climax of the story and the flashbacks. Kobayashi proves us that he is a ''Cinema- Master'' and makes us sink deep in the story.Tatsuya Nakadai gives an Oscar- worthy performance playing the main character of the film.

It's easy to jump to conclusions in this movie, but it's like your whole impression of a character changes every 20 minutes. It's unimaginable as to how much controversy this film caused in Japan, especially coming from a Japanese filmmaker, but it really makes you think about the samurai culture and their position in society. It's truly one of the greatest examples of exploring humanism there is. Every character, even the protagonist, have their flaws that probably cost them a lot, but you're not left not understanding any character. You really can see the story from everyone's very different perspectives. It explores ideas that society never really stops to think about, like when is compassion more important than pride, or how literally should you really take things, and when do you really start abusing power. It doesn't force a message or moral on its audience, but just makes you stop to think about them, and show you what can happen when you take one side of it. You can watch this movie looking for every detailed meaning in it, or just watch it because it's a guy with nothing to lose and a lot of skills, going out for justice. Either way it's great and really a true example of what Japanese culture has brought to filmmaking."

        "review_detailed_main": "A veteran samurai arrives at a feudal lord's home to commit an honorable suicide ritual. Things take an unexpected turn when he starts telling his reasons to commit this act. I know the director Masaki Kobayashi from his The Human Condition trilogy, which is in my opinion the greatest movie trilogy of all time, with parts 1 and 3 being one of the greatest movies of all time. So naturally, I was really excited to see Harakiri, the movie many people call his magnum opus, and I can say now that is definitely for a very good reason. This movie was absolutely outstanding. First of all, I really loved the pacing of the story, and how it revealed information in a very suspenseful way, that created this amazing buildup towards the end of the movie. On a personal level, this story is very harrowing. There are many scenes in this movie that I would consider to be some of the most heartbreaking and painful scenes I've ever seen. These moments are highlighted with fantastic acting, especially by Tatsuya Nakadai, whose performance in The Human Condition is one of my all-time favorites, and his performance in this movie is also definitely up there. The movie also deals with themes like honor, especially in the historical context of the Japanese samurai code, and criticizes this authoritarian culture within the samurai clans, in a very thought-provoking and interesting way. I really liked the use of music in this movie, which is very minimalistic. The black and white cinematography was outstanding. Especially framing and camera movement were excellent. Harakiri is of the greatest masterpieces in cinema history, and Masaki Kobayashi blew me away once again. I haven't seen most of his filmography yet but I can already say he is one of the greatest movie directors of all time for me."

This film is one of the few I would personally break the scale for and give an 11/10. Beyond perfection. Pretty much to the point of transcending our reality as it has long since transcended the film medium to become the Ronin gospel. The lead actor gives a haunting performance that has lingered in my mind for awhile and is the main reason I am writing this review. It simply must be seen by anybody who likes good movies... that's everyone last I checked."

But I think the film just want to express---to live, to love. The most important thing to do is to live, can you despicable Chijiwa Motome? He just wants to get money to save his wife and son, Harakiri is the worst way to get money, but he still to do that. People have no reason to love and to life, it is necessary to love and to be loved, do not need any reason. I f you love someone, you still to find the reason you love him or her, your love is already crumbling, do you like this ramshackle life? So I really respect Chijiwa and Tsugumo, they love their family with no reason. The film is very political and depressive, their love is the only warming and touching point."

Tarnish the memory of a person considered 'nobody' by others, when he/she, on the other hand, was loved and loved by the people who surrounded him/her.\n\nHara-kiri is not just a film about Samurai, it is a film that tells about everyday life and how this is then inexorably declined for a system that works badly, that makes you remain alone, that kills even before a Katana with bamboo blade pierces you, with prying eyes and humiliation from those who believe themselves superior to such an extent that they can teach an exemplary lesson.\n\nThanks Kobayashi, you are the origin of the films I loved. Your cinematographic and at times theatrical direction is shocking, capable of making me fall in love with cinema again with a single zoom or with a single connection of gaze."

For years, I thought Akira Kurosawa was the end all for truly great cinema, but after seeing Kobayashi's opus in Seppuku, it is obvious that 1960's Japanese Cinema had two masters.\n\nSeppuku is certainly one of those flicks that makes you say \"Oh SH*T\" halfway through. A deep and enriching story that just keeps getting better as more of the movie is revealed to you. While it doesn't reveal itself to you in a normal unraveling, but rather with a wonderfully told and filmed flashback (while admiringly very long and drawn out - even characters in the film call it so).\n\nEverything from the beautiful camera work to the acting delivery is absolutely superb. The close-ups within the flick actually deliver a wealth of information about the scenes that spoken words could only touch on. Truly a masterpiece and worth the wait from Netflix."

Hanshiro, an old, impoverished, unemployed samurai, seeks use of their mansion to perform harakiri, ceremonial suicide that involves self-disembowlment and is an honorable death for a samurai living in disgrace.\n\nBut in a time of peace, Japan abounds with ex-warriors who threaten to perform this rite only to extort money from weak-willed clans. In light of such dishonorable conduct, the House of Iyi has adopted stern measures: Any samurai who threatens to perform this rite at their gate will be forced to do so. Thus a younger ex-warrior, Motome Chigiiwa, met his fate. Coming with the same request, this unfortunate youth was forced to carry out the rite with a bamboo sword -- \"an unsightly affair.\" The clan elder would warn the older Hanshiro away with the story of Motome's death, but the old warrior is resolved to die.\n\nThings, however, are not what they seem. Hanshiro seems to have more on his mind than suicide. And, as he relates his own lifestory to the warriors of Iyi clan, not only are their stern measures called into question, but also the very honor of which they are so proud.\n\nSeppuku is an awesome story of revenge told with devastating effect. By the time you know what the story is really about, you yourself have cast judgement on the characters. Then things turn on you, and nothing appears as it did before. In this film a tragic story, great sword duels, haunting atmospheric music, and an exciting final battle combine to form what I think is an overlooked masterpiece. Director Masaki Kobayashi does to the samurai genre what Sam Pekinpah will later do to the western in The Wild Bunch: He takes the samurai code and turns it upon its head. This film is great, and worth every repeated watching."

While many consider Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai to be the greatest Samurai film in history, many true enthusiasts believe this honour belongs to Kobayashi's Harakiri. A film which has not received as much attention due to its limited release in North America, is now gaining attention due to its tremendous criterion collection release.\n\nIt is an astounding masterpiece telling the story of an aging samurai on his quest to commit Seppuku (Harakiri). With storytelling and cinematography light years ahead of its time, it is difficult to leave this movie without a greater love for film and the filmmaking process. One of the few movies that will truly give you a full appreciation for the Samurai art form. An astonishing masterpiece is every sense of the word."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though the act of Seppuku, or \"Harakari\", was abolished in 1868, it was for a long time the true test of a samurai's honor and nobility. In Harakiri (1962), the ritual shows us humanity in its most raw and vulnerable form; perhaps, it is just before death when one's truest colors shine through. The film is a masterclass in portraying the human condition while showcasing some of the best cinematography and direction I've ever seen in a film. Literally every frame (with its perfect lighting, blocking and composition) is like a painting come to life, just perfect. Masaki Kobayashi paces this film perfectly and keeps you engrossed with one of the most beautiful and incisive pieces of human drama I've ever seen. Once the film receives about 1,000 or so more ratings on IMDb, you'll see this gem shoot up to the top 50 easily. It's truly one of the most beautifully crafted films ever made; What a masterpiece..."

I've seen this film a dozen times, in theatres and on television, and every time I am nearly exhausted by the relentless tension and drama -- even while knowing every scene. The photography is unsurpassed for composition and lighting, the direction is flawless. One of the greatest pictures, but hard to find in a theatre or video.

In a sense, the set piece is even more extraordinary than Kurosawa's best offers in YOJIMNO and SEVEN SAMURAI, because Hanshiro is outnumbered, doomed, a forlorn hope who fights until his last breath, a hero whose valor and integrity will not be extolled but buried, but when the dust settles, we actually feel triumphant for him, what a glorious death!\""

Angles and scenes are just perfect. Of course fight scenes are not as much brutal as we would see in Kill- Bill or other movies where people use swords, but the fact that in this movie they used real swords its frightening.\n\nThe main point of the main character to come and cut his belly is not just because of situation of his life but also to give honor for those who passed away before and also to point out the problem of dogmatic point of view of high ranked people which actually pointing some interesting thoughts about life in Japan at period of time when movie was made.\n\nIf amazing cinematography and issues that viable today are not enough to make you watch this movie than just watch it to know what is it \"To be Ronin\" or who are samurais and what was the time of samurais when Japan was extremely distant. I'm not saying that this movie tell the truth about Japan before 1615 but at least it give you a very interesting option of how it could be.\n\nMight warn you that movie is pretty long and mostly based on dialogs and flash-backs so if you want sword massacre then watch Kill Bill."

        "review_title": "'Harakiri' is A Potent Genre Film, that Contains a Moving Story of Human Tragedy!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Samurai films, like westerns, need not be familiar genre stories. They can expand to contain stories of ethical challenges and human tragedy. 'Harakiri', a shining example of the kind, is about one samurai who takes his time to create an unanswerable dilemma for the elder of a powerful clan. By playing strictly within the rules of Bushido Code which governs the conduct of all samurai, he lures the powerful leader into a situation where sheer naked logic leaves him humiliated before his retainers.\n\nThe story is set in a time when feudal Japan is at peace, and starving out-of-work samurai beg to perform ritual suicide or 'hara-kiri' at the mansions of powerful clans - a request they hope will lead to a charitable pittance or a menial job. One such lone ronin arrives at the temple of Lord Iyi and asks to use the courtyard to perform honorable ritual self-disembowelment, hara-kiri or seppuku. That seems like the beginning and the end of this movie, all in one: a checkmate. But director Masaki Kobayashi instead constructs a masterful chess game, filled with many carefully constructed moves, each arranged to fit in a particular place - it's glorious to behold!\n\nThus, it would be foolish to give away too much. But the ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) has chosen this particular temple for a very grievous personal reason. His hara-kiri is postponed when, kneeling on the white-sheeted death platform, he requests one after another, three separate house retainers serve as seconds to cut off his head. All three so indisposed as to be unable to attend, the ronin then begs a moment of time to tell his story. Like a brilliant player, he leaves out crucial details until the most opportune moments.\n\nThe movie openly depicts vanity and corruption among the samurai class, showing that the Lord is more concerned with his reputation than with actual samurai honor. The film has a steady, hypnotic momentum; Kobayashi, wrings as much drama out of facial twitches as he does out of sword fights which are all elegantly composed and photographed to reflect the values it contains. He's helped immensely by Nakadai's molten central performance and the spare, disquieting music. Using superb architectural compositions, Mr. Kobayashi achieves a sort of visual mesmerization that is suitable to the curious nightmare mood.\n\nIn the end, \"Harakiri\" goes well beyond the usual genre trappings to beautifully underline its recurring theme - that fanatic adherence to codes of honor, by granting them a value greater than life itself, sets up a situation where humanitarian values are forbidden."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Harakiri,\" directed by Masaki Kobayashi, is a gripping samurai drama that delves deep into themes of honor, revenge, and the rigid code of the samurai. Set in 17th-century Japan, the film tells the story of Hanshiro Tsugumo, an aging ronin who seeks an honorable death through the ritual of harakiri.\n\nTatsuya Nakadai delivers a compelling performance as Tsugumo, capturing the character's stoic resolve and underlying desperation. The narrative unfolds through a series of flashbacks, gradually revealing the tragic backstory that drives Tsugumo's actions.\n\nKobayashi's direction is meticulous, with striking cinematography that emphasizes the stark contrast between the samurai's noble facade and the harsh realities of their lives. The film's slow pacing allows for a deep exploration of its characters and themes, though it might feel drawn out for some viewers.\n\nOverall, \"Harakiri\" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that challenges the romanticized view of samurai honor. While its pacing may not suit all tastes, it remains a significant work in the samurai genre, offering a poignant critique of feudal Japan's rigid societal structures."

I think It should be talked about more and more People should know about this film..\n\n*It's a Japanese Jidaigeki (Period Drama mostly set in Edo Period) film takes place between 1619 to 1630 in the rule of Tokugawa Shogunate. At the time, it was common For Ronin to request to commit Seppuku (Suicide,Harakiri) in the palace of courtyard in the hopes of recieving money or help from the feudal lords.\n\n*The story is Simple. A Warrior without a lord, Hanshiro Tsugumo arrives at the state of Li Clan and says that He wishes to commit Seppuku. The Daimyo's Senior Counselor Saito tells Hanshiro about another Ronin who came earlier to commit Seppuku... and Then the story becomes Interesting.. I don't want to reveal anymore of the story, Just want to say that Every scene of this Movie is Just wow! Every Conversation in The courtyard of The Li clan is just Epic and Mesmerizing... The Action, Background Score, Writing, Cinematography everything is Perfect and Memorable.\n\n*It is a timeless classic because It will be always relatable. As the Hypocrisy about Honor and Code, To do anything to preserve the Order.. It makes anyone think that What is Right and What is Wrong after all!\n\n*I don't know about the Director Masaki Kobayashi very much, Didn't see his Films prior to this, But I think He did a phenomenal Job in this and many people thinks it's his best. The actors are very good, Specially Tatsuya Nakadai in the role of Hanshiro and Rentaro Mikuni in the role of Saito did such a fabulous job. Tatsuya Nakadai gives a Aura about his character Hanshiro that You cannot feel anything but Interested!\n\n*This is a Must Watch. And if You don't know about Harakiri, It is kind of a Ritual Suicide for Samurai, Google it to know more.. I said Earlier about the movie being the best Samurai movie ever made and I also want to add that It is one of the Best Movie Ever Made...."

        "review_title": "A Daring Repudiation of Collective Hubris",
        "review_detailed_main": "American ethos has always had a soft-spot for the conscientious objector. We're a nation of fervent individualists and everything from the writings of Mark Twain to the film 12 Angry Men (1957) codifies that idea. The power of an individual against a torrent of common corruption and blind group-think is almost fetishized, especially in contemporary society. The Japanese, generally speaking, don't have such a provocative streak of individualism embedded in their culture. So it's interesting that one of the most eloquent and austerely beautiful films on the subject should come from the land of the rising sun. Harakiri is a repudiation of the collective values of Japan that, on its best days unites a population in tragedy and at its worst marches a people towards war.\n\nHanshiro Tsugumo (Nakadai) is an aging and embittered samurai whose feudal lord has died in battle along with most of his men. In order to reclaim his honor, according to the bushido code, Tsugumo must disembowel himself in a ritual suicide known as seppuku. To do this he arrives at the feet of Saito Kageyu (Mikuni) and asks members of the Iyi daimyo to help him do the ceremony correctly. Kageyu is hesitant as only a few days ago a similar request was made by another ronin who had no intention of committing seppuku but was looking to extort the clan for money. After Kageyu retells the man's tale, which culminates in the ronin dying by the blade of a bamboo sword, Tsugumo insists his intentions are to die with honor. Yet as the pavilion where the deed is to be done is setup, questions remain. What is Tsugumo's connection to the earlier ronin? Why did he pick the courtyard of the Iyi clan out of all others? Finally does he really intent to reclaim his honor, or is there something else going on?\n\nTold in a dizzying array of flashbacks and flash-forwards, Harakiri is not a leisurely movie to watch while folding laundry. It demands the attention of the viewer and weaves a complex tale of Hanshiro Tsugumo's home life after the fall of his clan. He's stricken with the most dire poverty, contemplating his daughter's (Iwashita) sale as a concubine and working menial jobs just to get by. His daughter, son-in-law Motome (Ishihama) and infant grandson Kingo are his only solace from a life of dishonor. Their fates become intimately intertwined with Tsugumo and the Iyi clan in unexpected ways and paying close attention to the plot pays off stunningly in the end.\n\nIn his own quiet and ultimately unsettling way director Masaki Kobayashi strips away the nobility and romanticism commonly associated with feudal Japan. While doing so he implicates the modern audience (at the time the Japanese public circa 1962) in tolerating authoritarianism under the guise of honor. Harakiri recalls and parallels the days of Japanese imperialism and uses a single individual as a means to take apart the misplaced hubris of anyone still beholden to the old guard. Kobayashi himself was drafted in the army during WWII but repeatedly refused promotion beyond that of a private; his own way of fighting corruption, hypocrisy and evil.\n\nThe film comes to a conclusion so damning and memorable that I dare not ruin the satisfaction of watching it for the first time. Harakiri is an absolute treasure featuring a star turn by Nakadai who first made an indelible mark on Japanese screens in Kobayashi's The Human Condition Trilogy (1959-1961). Here, while playing a character much older than himself, he still has a certain inner- turmoil that channels James Dean with a strong baritone. Finally there's Kobayashi's masterful direction which watches pensively and almost perversely as the jigsaw pieces fall in place."

The flashback based story is well told, Tatsuya Nakadai is excellent as the down-and-out samurai slowly unravelling his tale, and the black and white film is beautiful to watch, especially the last showdown. The Samurai film genre lends itself to comparison to the American \"western\" and, with its emphasis on the plight of the destitute ronin, Harakiri could be likened to the early revisionist oaters. Highly recommended, especially before or after a viewing of one of the Japanese versions of \"47 Ronin\" (personally, I like the lengthy, understated 1941 version)."

The acting is powerful, the script is very tight, with plot twists with and tension that is palpable.\n\nSet in Feudal 17th Century Japan, a poor, vagrant ronin approaches a powerful house to request to commit ritual seppuku before the lord of the house so that he can die with honor. Before he does, he tells his story, shown to us in flashbacks. It slowly becomes clear that he didn't select this great lord's house at random.\n\nIt almost doesn't matter if you are a fan of the genre. The story-telling will suck you in. Don't be deterred by the subtitles. This one is worth it!"

In fact, he emphasizes how traditions will become stereotyped to a degree that will destroy humanity over time. This stereotype is growing so much that now customs produced by people anonymously are coming across humanity, just like the giant you created yourself. Tatsuya's super acting also adds to this. The film already reflects its period one-on-one, you feel yourself somewhere there. It reflects their families and customs very well. I advise you to pay attention to Harakiri, because even if you say that I will do harakiri, it's a crime. You will understand these last words when you watch the movie. Be sure to watch, applause."

It's amazing what a director shows you or doesn't show you and how each can have a totally different outcome even with the same scene. This manipulation of emotion is used throughout the whole film and is partly why it is so great. The other feature that makes this movie one of a kind is the way Kobayashi is able to take almost a humanistic approach to a movie that could easily be made into good against bad. He does so by making us understand both sides of the equation and leaving the judgment of who's right up to the viewer. The movie kept me surprise at every angle and although it seemed slow and predictable to me at the beginning, my mindset quickly changed after a good 20 minutes into it. Give the film a chance, you'll be surprised at the life lesson that awaits."

I feel like I would not do anything as far as committing suicide. Watching the movie in the beginning seemed confusing because it started off with a flashback Motome had, he was a person that previously wanted to die by Harakiri. Looking at the series of flashback, I began to learn a lot about him. Watching this movie made me see how painful things could have been if I were in their situation especially having to kill myself with a bamboo sword which is very difficult because the sword was basically plastic. Reason for this is because around this time some Samurais were poor and some didn't have masters so they sold their goods for money. As for Hanshiro Tsugumo, he sold his sword then replaced it with a bamboo sword and I learned that \"The sword is the soul of the Samurai\". This movie helped me appreciate my life as well as the traditions of ancient Japan. I think the best way to actually understand this story is by watching the movie itself. In my opinion I think reading the story would be far too difficult to understand. I think this is a great movie to watch because it gives some information about what happens in noble traditions of ancient Japan."

Ii Naomasa was an ally of Tokugawa Ieyasu and his men were among the very few allowed to wear a red armor. He took an important role in many battles with Ieyasu, included the battle of Sekigahara. And, after his death in 1602, his clan took part successfully in both Osaka campaigns (1614-15). His loyal support to the Tokugawa led them to be a powerful clan.\n\nThe film makers date all the drama in the times where samurai did still remember how to wear an armor.\n\nVery good film!"

In the first minutes of the film I saw it as if it was about two men going to the Iyi Clan in the same day to ask for help but it was clear when the main character is the one telling the story of the other guy. That was a big twist. The director Kobayashi did a unique style in which tricks the mind for the viewer to think this way. It also shows the humanity in each character in their expressions and thoughts. At the end this film said to me to not judge someone look and to do whats feels right and not what a rule said, meaning of who is really a real human. Emotionally it affected me when the wife cries for her husband because of a pass experience. Then when the main character fights with the Samurais, I wanted him to take revenge towards all but it does not happen. Its another film in which makes you question the history of a country."

The samurai who claim to value honor above all either just use honor as a tool to protect their pride, or are simply too foolish to see the holes in their philosophy. Harakiri has perhaps the most genius structure in the history of film, a structure that's rather simple but equal parts thrilling and makes the story even more tragic. Nakadai delivers one of his greatest performances as a man broken and driven insane by a culture he used to value and respect."

This questions the present days' idea of honour that is expected from the soldiers and civilians alike and unfaltering loyalty towards the codes of conduct that bind them together. This movie challenges this very idea.\n\nThe cinematography, set design, actings, musical scores are excellent. But these aspects do not make this movie special.

        "review_detailed_main": "In addition to having a very strong film industry, Japan is a country with a very rich past that we in the West tend to devalue. A somewhat ethnocentric attitude, more typical of small minds. For a long time, the Japanese were a people divided by several feudal princes who fought among themselves, disputing power and regional influence. It was in this context, moreover, that the first contact between the Japanese and the Portuguese took place, the first Westerners to disembark, demonstrably (Marco Polo speaks of the Japanese, but he probably never went there), on the islands of Japan, where they took the first firearm, the Christian faith and a strong cultural influence: even today, in the Japanese language, there are hundreds of words directly imported from Portuguese.\n\nThe film that brought me here tells us about one of the most fascinating traditional figures of Japan: the samurai, a warrior similar, in essence, to the European knight. They were educated people who were willing to live off the war, as paid mercenaries. In a land where each feudal lord wages war for himself, with his own troops and against his neighbors, it was not difficult to live off war. It would be difficult to live in peace! The samurai had a code of conduct, the Bushido, which dictated rules according to which they guided their lives, seeking to live and die with honor. Honor was more important than life and therefore, in certain situations, it was expected that the samurai knew how to die and was willing to do so, even if by his own hands, in a suicide ritual.\n\nThe film begins when a samurai, left unemployed by a long peace, turns to an old man and asks to be allowed to die. In response, he hears a story that occurred some time before, and in which a samurai in the same situation made an identical request in the expectation of receiving money, and ended up having to commit suicide, and with a wooden weapon. The film then reveals an important fact: this first samurai is the father-in-law of the man who killed himself, and who wanted money to feed his sick wife and son. And in fact that warrior is not there in order to simply die, but in order to avenge the son-in-law wronged by human hypocrisy.\n\nThe film is quite dense, and the fact that it is so different from Western cinema and, even more so, in black and white, can quite scare the current public. However, it is worth resisting this impulse to reject it and giving the film a chance. It's very well done, it has a pretty good story, which is nothing behind big Hollywood hits. The script takes advantage of the situation to expose the brutality of the rigor imposed on the samurai by means of a moral code so absurdly demanding that it ended up being inhumane. Contrary to what happens in some films, even western ones, this film does a good historical contextualization of the story it tells us, not being too difficult to understand what is at stake. I'm not the best person to talk about the director or the actors, I don't know them, but I can say that we have the participation of Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoshiro Aoki and Akira Ishihama. On a technical level, I think it's impossible to avoid noticing the quality of the sets and filming locations, as well as the sharpness and quality of the cinematography."

Set in the 17th century, the film tells the story of a ronin, or masterless samurai, who arrives at the estate of a powerful lord seeking to perform harakiri, a ritual suicide, as a means of protesting the lord's oppressive regime.\n\nFrom the opening scene, \"Harakiri\" is an intense and emotionally charged film that masterfully weaves together the past and present to tell a poignant story about the struggles of marginalized people in feudal Japan. Kobayashi's direction is impeccable, drawing out strong performances from the entire cast and bringing to life the complex characterizations of the film's protagonists and antagonists.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to challenge traditional notions of samurai honor and morality, presenting a starkly realistic portrayal of the brutal realities of life in feudal Japan. The film's themes of social injustice and political corruption remain relevant today, making \"Harakiri\" a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.\n\nOverall, \"Harakiri\" is a deeply moving and thought-provoking film that showcases Kobayashi's masterful storytelling and brings to life a fascinating and complex period in Japanese history. It is a must-see for fans of Japanese cinema, and for anyone interested in exploring the depths of human nature and the power of redemption."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hello there, Yoni again. So my second film for review is from Hara-kiri. A1962 film, directed by Masaki Kobayashi. This film begins a bit slowly and has those moments throughout the film and started off with a lot of dialog. This plays off the idea of having morals and honor. Some of the film it was a bit rough for me to identify certain parts of what was going on and the whole concept during the film but this is what I came up with\u0085.\n\nFrom what I took from it was Hanshiro Tsugumo enters the house of lords of another character named Kageyu Saito. Tsugumo wanted to commit in a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment (Hara-kiri). This act was only reserved for samurais only. While getting ready for his suicide, Hanshiro goes over his time with Saito and the retainers. Hanshiros lord's house was thought out to be a threat and surrounded by toppled by forces. One of Hanshiro's friends committed the same ritual (Hara-kiri) which caused Hansiro to watch after his son. Towards the end of the film Hanshiro tracks down three of the retainers of the lord's house and blames them for the deaths of his family. But, instead of killing the retainers in a battle he disgraces them by cutting off the topknots of their heads which is far worst then death.\n\nAt the end of the film, Hanshiro is attacked by all of the retainers and must fight all of them. More retainers arrive after Hanshiro fights all the retainers. This is when Hanshiro decides his time is over and commits hara-kiri to die as a samurai with honor.\n\nIn this film you could really feel the power of how much honor meant to these samurai's. It was all they cared about and nothing else mattered. These films shows the \"new\" turning point in the 17th century between samurai's that fought with swords and the new military that began to use guns. This film represents retaining a person's honor after disgrace"

In terms of editing, the flashbacks fit in perfectly with none of the fade-outs of Hollywood at its schmaltziest. The acting is absolutely wonderful. No histrionics here. But the music is phenomenal! It uses Japanese instruments (with percussion) and is minimal but essential. The duel scene on the plain has to be seen to be believed. This is spell-binding cinema of a tale told extremely well where everything we see and hear is absolutely essential and I highly recommend it.\n\nCurtis Stotlar"

Kageyu Saito is a senior counsel and he tries to deter the man with the story of another ronin Motome Chijiiwa from the same clan. They forced him to do the job despite he has sold his blade. All he has is a blade made of bamboo. It's a brutal painful event. Nevertheless, Hanshiro insists on continuing with his seppuku and then he reveals that he did indeed know Motome.\n\nThe first recollection is actually quite compelling. It catches my attention culminating in one of the most memorable horrific scenes. The rest of the movie can't really compare. It's another series of recollections and it's not as compelling. I think it would be just as good to compress the second half and keep the big final fight."

        "review_detailed_main": "Harakiri (1962) is a Japanese film that takes place in 1630, and it is a story of the Samurai code of honor and family. Harakiri (also called seppuku) is the ritualistic suicide once employed by Samurai warriors to die while keeping their honor intact. A Samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, travels to the House of a rival clan Iyi, asking for a place to commit seppuku. Clans would permit such requests because it was an honorable final act for a Samurai to save his honor in their house. At that time, Samurai often arrived under a false pretense of committing seppuku but leaving with gold. The clan believes Tsugumo arrived under such false pretense. The story unravels from that point into a flashback of another Samurai, Motome Chijiiwa, who had arrived under such false pretense. I can't say anything more about the relationship between Tsugumo and Chijiiwa without spoiling the story.\n\nThe filming style is interesting. It is depicted using dialogue and several flashbacks as it draws out the plot. The first hour is slow-paced, but the story picks up pace thereafter. It is ultimately a pushback on the Samurai code and the hypocrisy behind it.\n\nWould I recommend this? Yes, I believe it was very well done. The directing often reminded me of Akira Kurosawa's works. I would think the director of this film was inspired by Kurosawa. However, it's probably not for everyone because of the pacing, style, and lack of much action (until the last half hour). Not everyone likes subtitles either."

The story that was intended to scare away Hanshiro only carried him to tell a story of his own and so he did in the oddest fashion. And through flashbacks we learn it and the more we know the more we understand.. the more we feel.. the more we think.\n\nHarakiri (1962), that its events are set out between 1619 and 1630 of the Edo period, is a perfect study of the human mind, heart, and soul. It is also a study of the human relations and that of the society and individual..\n\nThrough its characters and their contradicting personalities you will learn a lot.. Sincerity and hypocrisy, faith and appearances, love and hate, caring and indifference, courage and fear... The social structure: flaws and corruptness.. The society's symbols and traditions: their depth and when they are only a cover. And then there is history: how it happens and then how it is written.\n\nThis is all one thing about Harakiri and the other aspects that make a film are just as perfect.. the cinematography, soundtrack, acting.. every single aspect.. and the duels we see reminded me of the duels in \"The good, the bad, and the ugly', only that here it's with swords.\n\nTruly the film is a masterpiece.. a journey that you should undergo."

The tragedy of 'Harakiri (1962)' is profound and, as it moves from one phase to the next, it manages to emotionally affect in some surprising ways. It's a really layered piece, one with a multitude of intertwining themes and hard-won messages. The few sequences of violence it has are suitably brutal and exciting. They're grounded yet stylish, visceral yet thrilling, devastating yet inevitable. Arguably, the movie's most effective moment is an early example of its eponymous act, as a young man is forced to commit 'seppuku' in an incredibly cruel way. This scene is really difficult to sit through, to be honest, and it becomes even worse when the narrative revisits the reasoning behind its circumstances. The film is slow paced but it isn't boring. It's an interesting, entertaining but heavy affair. 7/10"

This movie was all about the samurai and its traditions in being a true warrior. Japan was in turmoil at the time and no one had any money and the honor of a true samurai was tested. Many committed harakiri which means suicide because they had nothing left and they wanted to die as an honorable samurai. Motome a character in the film who was a samurai, asked to commit harakiri but for the wrong reasons according to the samurai tradition. Hanshiro Tsugumo the main character and another samurai of this film also asks to commit harakiri but turns in to something more than that. I was a bit disappointed during the movie because I read reviews of this movie that said it was action packed but rally there was really only two fight scenes in the whole movie. Most of the movie was Hanshiro talking to the counselor of the house of IYE. For people who don't like movies with long talking scenes I wouldn't recommend this for you. This movie also had some very bloody scenes that I felt disturbing. If bloody scenes are something you don't like than I wouldn't recommend it. Overall I liked the movie because it had a great story line and I got some background on some ancient Japanese traditions related to the samurai. The movie is in black and white and also in Japanese but don't let that shy you away from it because I think you could really gain a new perspective on films if you watch this movie.\n\nBy: Vincent Torchia"

This is a major goof in an otherwise excellent movie. The director should have arranged so he would not be at home at that moment. I rate it 6/10 because of this. The Criterion version is exquisite and the black and white close ups are of excellent quality. Samurais are known to have beyond reproach code of ethics, but this movie is telling you otherwise... The inhuman treatment of Motome, the back room manipulation to deal with Hanshiro Tsugumo is proof that feudal politics is as bad as politics of all ages."

It has a few flaws in my mind, such as a rather poor/unrealistic characterization and stiff acting, that somewhat reduces the overall quality of this work of art. Still, despite those problems, the overall experience remained very powerful and memorable. Indeed, this is one of those movies that I will never forget.\n\nOne thing that I love about Japanese movies is the fact that they are slow paced and allow the film to really breathe though. Unlike Hollywood movies, which tend to be too fast paced and therefore do not allow the viewer to fully immerse himself into the film."

It shows the heartfelt of one household heading towards low class. Remarkably shows how the Ronin seeked out its counselor for assistant but due to its code of honor first introduced to submit harakiri. The camera shots were well in placed, the art of styles and costumes, the meaning of cutting the hair, the sword losing its glory, the architectural view of the living quarters were well shown in this movie. The plot kept me very attentive as to how the ending will be. Yes it delivered what its intent that is to make the viewer be on the same accord as the film director."

When the country dishonors its Samurai, and they are driven to acts of desperation, leading to cruelty and further dishonor, the country spirals, and this movie set in 17th century seems to reflect decline in then present day (1962) Japan.\n\nThe movie is quite beautiful visually, with traditional Japanese architecture and at one point a swaying bamboo forest framed beautifully by director Masaki Kobayashi. The story is taut and works on many levels, first and foremost as a vengeance with honor tale, which might remind you of an American Western, including a couple of epic battle scenes. It also has the individual man, disillusioned and saying that the Samurai code he lives by is a fa\u00e7ade, and yet acting honorably, against a multitude misled by corrupt leaders. It's one against many in a battle that is timeless and certainly relevant today, and whose results are sadly akin to the entropy of the universe. \"Who can know the depths of another man's heart?\" the Samurai asks, signaling a need for empathy. Indeed."

However, Masaki Kobayashi's Harakiri totally subverts and questions everything they stand for in a compelling way. It's a study of the human condition in samurai form, naturally from the director of the epic saga The Human Condition, of which I need to finish after being impressed by the first part. It's a dissection of the metaphysical ideas of honour that bind the traditions of these men. While they try to commit to formalities, in the face of conflict they find it impossible. The story unravels like a psychological thriller although it's largely formed of flashbacks and talking but the connections that are drawn and the way the film blossoms to its explosive final 15 minutes is extraordinary. A suicide narrative like this is difficult, what are the stakes and what are the motives? Harakiri keeps you guessing, thanks to the incredible performances and when you feel like you've got it figured out, the whole picture changes. With its stark widescreen cinematography and disconcerting score, its technical aspects bolster the experience. It's a film that works on all levels, Harakiri is certainly the best Japanese film I've seen so far.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Just saw this film thanks in part to comments left on this site, avoiding the spoilers of course. Just wanted to give my take on the film, and some of the reviews on the film.\n\nFirst if you haven't seen the film, simply put it's not just worth seeing, it's worth buying. It is a well performed, brilliantly photographed, hauntingly scored, and masterfully directed film.\n\nThat said it's often spoken of in the same breath as SWORD OF DOOM, and that is highly misleading. If you go in expecting the visceral, brilliantly choreographed sword fights and unrelenting action of that film, you will not find it here.\n\nThis is very much a drama, a morality tale of a time and a place; an exploration and an indictment of a way of life, and as such it has very few equals. The movie does lag, it is in many ways a monologue, one man talking more to himself than anyone else, of the ending of his life.\n\nBut an enthralling story, captivating visuals, and above all else, one of the most intriguing and effective soundscapes since the great Dimitri Tiomkin's work on 1950s DOA, keeps this static film... moving and engrossing.\n\nMentioning DOA, leads me to the bashing Hollywood takes regularly here from \"critics\" such as Landor28. Critics who in their rush to praise films, do it by backhanding other films. I'm not a critic, I'm just a reviewer. Critic implies you have some from the mountaintop perspective that gives you the right to criticize. Unless you've made movies, superior to what you're reviewing, you don't get to criticize. Review yes, criticize... no.\n\nHas Hollywood made bad films? Yes Hollywood makes its share of bad films, so does Japan, so does India, so does Hong Kong, so does every other country that makes movies. However Hollywood makes the most films, the most visible films, and the largest films, so it is an easy lump-sum target as opposed to taking each film on its own merits. Hollywood in fact is judged harsher by these critics, held to a higher standard than films from elsewhere in the world.\n\nI am no defender of Hollywood, as I don't work there, and not fortunate to know anyone who does, but I am a film fan, and a fan of the truth, and to praise films by Kurosawa and Kobayashi and to denigrate the films of Hollywood is to make a mistake these directors did not. These men, like all postwar filmmakers, were inspired by the films of Hollywood, particularly present in the work of all these directors is the large and brilliant work of John Ford.\n\nKurosawa would be the first to state this. Fords widescreen westerns are at the heart of the cinematic recreation of the Samurai. The samurai world as envisioned by Kurosawa as much about history as it is the heroic imagery of the western. They are Stagecoach and Searchers transplanted to the east.\n\nA simplification to be sure, but not much of one. Postwar cinema in Japan and throughout the world copied from the states, and that's a good thing. And has started a trend that continues to this day of films successful in one country being copied in another. And we are the better for this two way copying. That's what film is people, copying.\n\nCopying a headline, or a book, or a play, or another film, copying a moment and making it your own. That's what all art is, looking at something, copying something, a sunset, a tree, a woman, a birds cry, and adding your own... bleeding to it. That's all life is, being influenced by something people have bled on, and if we are great men, leaving our own blood on it... to influence others.\n\nOnly those with no art in their souls, don't see this. Only the very young, or the very stupid. Landor28 accuses Scorscese of stealing from Seppuku, an inane comment to make.\n\nHow many shots in Seppuku but reecho earlier brilliant compositions of Stroheim. But I don't hear you calling Kobayashi a thief. And rightly so, no one owns a shot. Cinema, and images belongs to the story that can tell it. And if that image or look, can service well a thousand films, than it should be used a thousand times. What is film noir, but the same type of look, and camera angles used repeatedly. But used from the directors own viewpoint, it becomes the director's tale. So the comment of theft shows someone ignorant of the fact that there is nothing new under the sun, there are just 7 stories and 5 angles; and all cinema since.... but each person retelling this story through the lens of their own joy or pain.\n\nAnd if they are honest, the story each time... is worth hearing.\n\nGive these directors, whether they work in India, or New Zealand or Kenya or Hollywood their due. Shymalan is a great director, Weir is a great director, Fincher is a great director, Carl Frankin is a great director, Lee is a great director, Zimmerman is a great director, Gibson (for Braveheart not Passion), Ron Howard is a great director, Edward Zwick is a great Director (his resume since 89 reads like a bloody history lesson of great films.) and they all work in Hollywood, and their work inspires all kinds of foreign flicks you do rave about.\n\nGet off of Hollywood's back, it's always popular to hate the top dog, but it's also sometimes unwarranted.\n\nSEPPUKU is a great film, by a master director. ***1/2 out of ****. If you like it also check out these films: GLORY (1989 Ed Zwick), COURAGE UNDER FIRE, A HERO NEVER DIES, KING OF NEW YORK, LE SAMOURAI, SWORD OF DOOM, BACKDRAFT, Excalibur, TUAREG, MENACE II SOCIETY.They are all films about, to one degree or another, displaced honor and cannibal societies."

Due to his circumstances, he wishes to commit harakiri, ritual suicide, in the courtyard of the house. Turns out this is not such an unusual request: the clan has had such requests before, though the requestor's intentions weren't always honourable. The Clan elder tells Tsugumo the story of the last samurai who made the request and how that ended. Will he still go through with it?\n\nNot your average samurai drama. Slow-burning, plot-filled and relatively light on action, this movie will come as a bit of a surprise to most. This doesn't make it less interesting though. In fact, it makes it better.\n\nInstead of a basic plot that's just an excuse for heap of well-choreographed action scenes, the plot here is great, and quite poignant. The action is held back until the end, heightening the anticipation. The action scenes themselves are quite realistic - none of the ridiculous Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stuff - and have a plausible outcome.\n\nOn the negative side, the slow-burn does get drawn out a touch too long. In addition, in the end there's no clear message - the conclusion is a bit flat.\n\nOverall, a great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "While some so-called classics leave me cold, \"Harakiri\" (as it's known in the USA) really fires my imagination. This is a rare movie - the kind that I just can't stop recommending to people.\n\nMuch of the film's appeal is based on surprising narrative twists, so I'm reluctant to delve too deeply into the plot here. But the basic setup is as follows - Japan has entered a time of peace, and consequently many samurai are unemployed and suffering in extreme poverty. Some samurai develop a ploy of threatening to commit suicide, but only so they can get sympathetic handouts of food and money from rich families. The film explores what happens when that ploy backfires in a very serious way.\n\nDirector Masaki Kobayashi paces the film very slowly - by comparison, many Kurosawa and even Ozu films are breezy, and of course contemporary American films move approximately 800x faster. However, I am never really bored while watching \"Harakiri\"; the film slowly builds toward a (very rewarding) climax, while filling in the characters' compelling backstories. In short, this movie requires - but pays back - patience. Stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with interesting revelations and even some exciting (and surprisingly violent) fight scenes.\n\nDue to its unusual blend of action, emotion and social commentary, \"Harakiri\" has shot right up my list of favorite films. I'm tempted to describe it as a Tarantino-style film, only with more of a conscience and a sophisticated worldview. But I suppose that any such comparisons between \"Harakiri\" and American movies must be broad and a little crude. Kobayashi's film stands on its own, of course, and is well worth seeking out for any cinema fan."

The beauty of Kobayashi's work is the basis in reality, his stories and characters are breathing portraits. The bad guys are not acting out of evil, but just working through their interpretation of honor. The good guys are not so perfect, they lie, cheat and set traps. The plot is almost Western in it's structure, a very easy film to follow, but a film that makes you feel educated and cultured. I was completely floored by the opening scene of \"Hara-Kiri.\" It is still perhaps one of the three or four most influential pieces of cinema I have experienced. Remaining shocking for me, to this day. The fight in the windswept fields of grass is spectacular. Watch Samurai Rebellion, Kwaiden, and the Human Condition Series. Why Kobayashi isn't more written about I don't know. When I first saw this film I wrote a letter to the director, c/o the Japanese Directors Guild, it was returned months later, saying I had missed his passing away by three months.

Especially the great use of high contrast lighting, something you barely see in Japanese productions, set the tone both visually and thematically. The director of photography uses a lot of symmetric shots which look beautiful but tell a story as well.\n\nFor me the highlight of this film was Motome Chijiiwa's seppuku. This scene was shocking, absurd and also very unpredictable. Excellent editing and cinematography created an unforgettable, yet uncomfortable moment.\n\nThe turn of events, which slowly unfold as the film progresses is unexpected and will surprise you. But most of all, it will impress you. The director uses some very (without giving too much away) notable techniques to strengthen the effect.\n\nTatsuya Nakadai, one of the greats in Samurai cinema, has some of the most amazing body language you will ever see in movies! I noticed how much work and detail he put into this character by not focusing on his eyes, but rather on his feet - which show that he really is portraying a Samurai.\n\nMy only flaw is that the beginning of the film, the first twenty minutes or so, does not set the tone which I found to be a bit confusing and off putting.\n\nThis is one of the greatest films from the golden age of Japanese cinema. It holds up very well and you will walk away very satisfied. If you get the chance, go watch it!"

At first I thought the film was moving a bit slow however I never lost interest and it kept me on my feet. A great story about two samurai's in the 1630's, this film did a wonderful job of portraying the multi-sided dimensions of the characters. The film was full of action, suspense, great dialogue, wonderful fighting scenes and plenty of thought. This was the first movie that actually got me more interested in the whole Samurai culture and I will definitely check another one out because of this one. Overall, it is a movie about the facades we all put up and the people we really are deep down."

Kobayashi was certainly one of the most engaged directors on this topic.\n\nHis genius is to transpose modern japan in the chanbara style using poetry and well-tough metaphors as well as an extremely engaging a universal narrative. Each character is motivation/emotion/aspiration can be defined by a simple glance at the characters' eyes, at a certain point, I noticed that the subtitles weren't necessary (and I don't speak a word of Japanese). This demonstrates how powerful the directing and the acting of the cast, and especially Tatsuya Nakadai are in this movie. I'm not even talking about the role that lighting an color grading had in this movie because they merit their own analysis!\n\nSincerely, while this movie is indeed not the most action-packed jidaigeki film out there. It is without any doubt gonna be one of the most persistent in memories."

A samurai turns up at a grand lord's home, searching for a place to commit suicide. The counselor at the grand lord's place tells him of another samurai who had come a month back with the same request and that sets the ball rolling.\n\nIf this movie were in Technicolor and I were to not tell you the year in which it was released, it would be difficult for general audience to guess the year/decade of its release as there is not much, if anything, that seems dated.\n\nThe one drawback for me was one of the sword fighting scenes that lacks the intensity of modern action sequences. However, it more than makes up for it by the time it ends.\n\nVery highly recommended. You would be enthralled by its direction and it's narrative trajectory. Truly one of the greatest of all time"

They were often reduced to begging, and that is how the story opens.\n\nThe story is not what is seems at first as we soon find there is much more than we first imagined.\n\nMake no mistake, it includes some great action that one expects to see in a Samurai film, but that is not as important as Shinobu Hashimoto's dialog. It was captivating.\n\nThe film is an indictment of the class system and it's so-called \"honor.\" It also shows the mentality that lead to World War II. It is a film that will captivate you and anger you.\n\nThe acting is superb, the score amazingly good, and the black and white cinematography first rate.\n\nTatsuya Nakadai (Ran, Yojimbo) was outstanding in the lead role, and Masaki Kobayashi's direction ranks him among the best in Japan."

Thousands of samurai lost their jobs and were forced to make a living off of the battle field. Many chose honorable suicide over a meager existence. The samurai's sword thusly became a symbol of past greatness and no longer afforded him elite status. The relatively few samurai who remained employed supposedly lived by the samurai code, but without ever having seen war.

While many interpretations of the director's intentions gear towards a criticization (or condemnation) of Japan's feudal past and early 20th century militarism, I drew an additional conclusion. I will keep that conclusion to myself, for I don't intend or want to direct anyone towards anything.\n\nThe only reason I have written this \"review\", for this film does not need more praise, is to have something to reflect upon after the next many times that I will undoubtedly watch HARAKIRI."

They belong to the league of their own. Masaki Kobayashi's \"Harakiri\" aka \"Seppuku\" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630 [...] A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, \"Harakiri\" deserves all its praise\"\n\nI think that Harakiri is one of the greatest pieces of drama ever written (the reference to Shakespeare is very appropriate). The drama unfolds slowly but with incredible force and ever-increasing tension. But besides involving us in the tragic fate of the characters, Kobayashi denounces the hypocrisy and corruption behind the so often idealized \"honor\" of the Samurai. And in doing so, he also reflects on modern-day Japan's society, where appearance is what matters, and cover-up is the solution to all the problems. In a similar vein, see also \"Rebellion\" aka \"Samurai Rebellion\" (1967), another great movie by Kobayashi.\n\nAs a frequent reader of IMDb, I see lots of good movies rated with 10 stars. I would reserve that rating to just a handful of movies that are above even the great movies. Harakiri is one of them."

        "review_detailed_main": "HARAKIRI is an action drama about an unfortunate fate and an ironic revenge of a ronin.\n\nA ronin arrives at an estate of one clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku (hara kiri) within the courtyard of their palace. To deter him, a senior counselor tells him the story about a young ronin who is looking for a way to commit seppuku, but set of circumstances has made his death a slow, painful and humiliating. Despite this warning a poor ronin insists that he has never heard that story and says that he has no intention of leaving their palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, the ronin is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. Coincidentally, he has chose three samurai who have participated in the ritual of the unfortunate young ronin from the counselor's story. However, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. The ronin has laughed ironically and started his shocking confession...\n\nThis is a very dramatic and tragic story with a very strong final climax. That ritualistic form of suicide is further reinforce the impression of a dark atmosphere. The main villain is a certain kind of a corrupt lord. A desperate and poor hero slowly serves his revenge, with the intent to humiliate and embarrass his opponents. An ancient tradition, political conflicts and shattered pride follow his painful confession. Mr. Kobayashi has enriched a tense situation with a vivid and sad retrospectives. The final battle is truly magnificent, even an occasional shred of theatricality has its role.\n\nCharacterization is pretty good. Tatsuya Nakadai (Tsugumo Hanshir\u014d) has offered an excellent performance as a desperate and poor, but focused and brave ronin.\n\nThe brutality and an attack in the agony give us an entirely new expression of the ancient samurai world."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Who can know the depths of another man's heart?\"\n\nHanshuro Tsugumo\n\n\nApart from its sheer story-telling gravitas and technical splendour, Kobayashi's Hara-kiri is especially lauded for its plea to look closer, to examine a little more deeply the troubles of those not as fortunate as us. When I watched it for the first time, I was blown away by the arresting wallop of this tension-saturated story's narration , and it was on the second viewing years later that I registered with more delicate acuity, its eloquent entreaty for a more compassionate look at the surface issues of our brethren. Particularly in Japan, the practice of bowing to the larger system and the concept of \"honour\" being maintained at all costs, looms especially large but of what use is honour if it makes us lose everything dear to us? Hara-kiri takes on the form of a formidable Samurai drama and builds this visceral sentiment with inexorable power, the vise of its narrative swirling and tightening until the physical carnage at the end isn't necessary - the foes have already been annihilated with gentle words. World-class cinematography and flawlessly strong acting further power this monochrome scorcher.\n\nPic opens with a wide-angle black-'n'-white canvas , the neatness and sparse beauty of which is the trademark of director Masaki Kobayashi. Notice how clean these compositions are, whether it is the large ground ouside a chieftan's house, the inner courtyard with its settled pebbles and carefully coiffed platforms for sitting, or even a poor man's wooden house bereft of much conveniences and yet almost spacious in its tidy gestalt. The framing is immaculate when Motome Chijiwa (Akira Ishihama) - a young Samurai struggling for survival - sits with folded knee - in a martial lord's house in front of a tough-jawed warrior who listens to his case. It is 1630 in the Edo region of Japan - peace has been declared in the land but it has devolved into internal war for the highly trained swordsmen called Samurai - they find no employment now, jobs are scarce with workers pouring into any open job-site and Motome is pushed away by a supervisor who cries out that the supervisor will be punished if authorities find out that the formal warrior class is being employed for menial jobs.\n\nMotome reports to the House of Li , as other Samurai have done before him, that this utter penury is so dishonourable that he would rather commit Seppuku by disemboweling himself with his own sword in this martial house's courtyard as a final act of honour. The House of Li, manned by fierce-looking superiors, is fed up with this pattern of supposedly suicidal Samurais - they see that many such applicants are willing to accept some money and go away without killing themseles as they initially declared to do. At this stage, Kobayashi racks up the sense of foreboding , panic and icy fear with such elan that the ensuing twenty minutes ranks as one of the most implacable turn of events in black-'n'-white cinema. A few days later, a middle-aged man named Hanshuro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai), bearded and rather emaciated-looking, shows up at the House of Li with a similar request. He is told the story of Motome Chijiwa as a warning - but Tsugumo, with a wry expression that is beyond gallows humour, calmly states that he will indubitably execute as promised.\n\nAs great as the previous tightly coiled sequence was, this succeding chapter matches it with its slow burn and unbearable tension which Tsugumo stretches far past breaking point with a story he unspools. Counsellor Saito (Rentaro Mikuni) , heading the house in the absence of the martial lord, is , to put it presisely - driven nuts - by this seemingly interminable narration by the grave-faced Tsugumo but I never got tired of hearing it as the latter lays one dialogue upon another like one revelatory card against the next one till the stakes indicate not just one death but many more. Saito , his strings plucked like a hen stripped to the bone , retreats to the house unable to take more.\n\nIn other jidaigeki (period-films) like Kurosawa's great \"Throne of Blood\", the performances though solid do not evoke my specific praise but in Harakiri ,the thespian finesse is on prime display - this could very well have been a starkly lit theater-drama. One can almost feel the cool breeze of happiness coursing through Motome's smiling immensely relieved face after the stifling humidity of despair, alas later , stomach-churning panic sets in to seize his mien. Tsugumo's nominally amused ,mostly dead-serious physiognomy never ever raises its voice but the prosody of his message undulates with the timeless meaning of great scripture. And then there's Saito , more c**t than counsellor, who's so drunk with power and delusions of tough wisdom that his sobriety is nullified by incurable hauteur.\n\nI was vastly disappointed by the fight at the end on my first viewing - having brought me to the very peak of expectation, Harakiri's climactic sword-fight seemed not even close to the supremely choreographed ahead-of-its-time bristling magnificence of Daibosatsu toge's finisher. But then as Saito himself says , Tsugumo is a \"half-starved\" Samurai who's already been through many hells so it is perhaps unfair to expect him to again fight like Japan's greatest champion. The denouement is a sobering indictment of the way history often operates, and the film eventually reclaims its spell-binding emotional and technical territory . To watch Hara-kiri , then , is to acknowledge that even in 1962 when so much of the rest of the world was learning the ropes of top-tier movies, Japan was already capable of engineering peerless cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "My favourite Kobayashi, and among my favourite Japanese films of all time, \"Harakiri\" (known in Japan as \"Seppuku\"; the former is a spoken term, the latter a written one for the same thing, the former likely adopted in the West on the basis of some general awareness of the word) is a masterly exploration of space, symmetry, honour, disloyalty, tradition, modernity and truth.\n\nThis film has one of the most amazing opening sequences ever. It goes beyond the best of Greenaway or Tarkovsky in how the camera moves and reveals a space, and I'd like to know whether Zhang Yimou considers this an influence on the similarly masterly \"Raise the Red Lantern\" (Da hong deng long gao gao gua, 1991). Especially the framing in the exterior shots is just as beautifully conveyed. Anyway, back to the sequence \u2013 there we are introduced to the idea of the \"house\": not only in the sense of \"assembly\" but also as a building. The main visual motif of the film (the courtyard scenes are another) is very theatrically revealed in shadow and light, and even before the narrative begins (we enter a book read to us, which again, appropriately, is not the whole truth).\n\nI am so in love with how the film looks and how the camera moves. Symmetries open, are revealed, tighten. There are amazingly patient tracking shots, especially in the interiors, where the camera sometimes barely moves at all.\n\nThe performances are just as amazing as the rest of the craft. In fact, this film brings together two absolute icons. For me, Tatsuya Nakadai is the quintessential Japanese actor, even greater than Mifune. His presence is overwhelming, just as his humanity. His eyes speak more than a thousand words in mere glances. Rentar\u00f4 Mikuni is another, and his work in Ichikawa's \"The Burmese Harp\" (Biruma no tategoto, 1956) and in Imamura's films (most notably in \"The Profound Desires of the Gods\" [1968] and \"Vengeance is Mine\" [1979]) adds tremendously to my viewing experience.\n\nThere are two very good Blu-ray editions available for this, released by the Criterion Collection (Region A) and the Masters of Cinema series (Region B). The Criterion appears to be cropped on the sides to a surprisingly noticeable degree, however."

It is against my principals to call anything \"the best\", no matter what it is. After all, opinions are like butts. Everybody 's got his own. But \"Seppuku\" IS one of those films -I can count in my fingers- that tempt me to give it such a title. It made me fall in love with the cinema of the rising sun and loose my good opinion for the Bushido. Later, \"Ghost Dog\" helped me to balance this a bit. 8)\n\nThe tragedy that rolls down throughout the story forces any sensitive person to take sides and get involved with the plot, and the incredible action movie ending can only produce enthusiasm to the viewer who feels more thirsty for revenge than our ronin!\n\nWell, anyway, if you are {a} a man {b} who has the sense of honor and {c} don't consider Bush as the best thing that ever happened to the USA,\n\nthis is your movie!\n\n(Few things in this century are still treated with such respect as the samurai tradition. Mostly because people do not understand its full dimentions. Watching this controversial and highly realistic film can make someone loose all his respect for beautiful legents who are mostly based on lies and an invented sense of honor and duty).\n\nTolerance for old B/W films who don't have any special effects but they do have a plot, is also a must for enjoy it.\n\nEutyhite!"

        "review_detailed_main": "As the Bakufu-Shogunate overtakes the power of the Daimyo, lots of samurai lose their jobs and become ronin. This is a tale about their fate, masterfully told in a way similar to Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' and Zhang Yimou's 'Ying Xiong'. This probably is typical for Asian storytelling in legends and myths, but it is so powerful it deserves a mention. Like Ibsen is known for the meaning is unraveled through retrospectives told by the head of Iyi and the protagonist Hanshiro Tsugumo.\n\nNakudai Tatsuya plays Hanshiro Tsugumo and no one could outdo his performance here, but maybe Mifune could equal him. It just recently watched another movie in which he also played the protagonist excellently, but I couldn't remember his face so clearly (in Teshigahara's 'Tanin no Kao'). Other actors don't get much light shone on them here.\n\nThe social fate of the ronin was poverty and therefore death by seppuku as it was the only fate worthy of a samurai. The movie points at this and how the House of Iyi was empowered by the same code of honour, oppression of the poor and the concealing of anything not worthy, that which is not honourable. The social commentary on the ronin may or may not be including the rest of the oppressed population, in that the ronin were not being able to get a job like the peasants because they know the way of the sword suggests that it is not. If so then its just taking a mock out of the code of honour and thats good enough for me.\n\nThe ending by the way was quite excellent."

        "review_detailed_main": "While initially appearing to be a study of the eternal conflict between individual needs and the demands of tradition, HARAKIRI is actually a clear-eyed and savage indictment of human (particularly male) vanity.\n\nTo me there are two key scenes in the film. First, the enforced ritual suicide of the young samurai early in the film. This has got to be one of the most brutal, toe-curling scenes ever put on film (although there is no gore). What is particularly striking is the juxtaposition of the twisting, writhing, screaming man against the silent, immobile, formally arranged background. This has the effect of giving the environment, or tradition/society/law, increased weight and making the individual appear weaker, transient, more mutable, and thus more subject to error. In other words Kobayashi appears to pay all due deference to the culture and belief system that have created the horror we have just witnessed. He consciously uses the the techniques of classic formalist Japanese cinema (static shots, formal spatial design, exactly replicated point of view shots, etc.) to give us a sense of the weight and power of custom bearing on the individual.\n\nThe second scene comes at the end of the middle section of the film during which time we have been given a detailed examination of the relationships between the members of the small family and the increasing sense of desperation and despair that has entered the home with the deadening encroachment of poverty. When the temple officials tell the tale of the \"honorable death\" of the young father in this setting (they are somewhat more brightly lit - \"cleaner\" than their surroundings) THEY are now what appears mutable or insubstantial and their talk of fame, honor, and tradition is perceived as pompous, empty cant. In short they are shown as posturing, bullying members of some \"boys club\" whose membership is based on vanity and who are totally divorced from the realities of existence. These realities would include, most prominently, our duties to our family and friends, not just our personal honor (ego?). At this point in the film the young father's begging now appears an act of courage and virtue, his suicide would have been one of cowardice and vanity. The film suggests that suicide may be the easier of the choices faced by those placed in the position of this father in this culture. Death provides social approval, lasting fame, and freedom from the grind of responsibility. Continuing to be a husband and father would here only bring disgrace. This could be seen as a powerful indictment of what can occur when women are not accorded a place of respect and/or authority within a culture.\n\nThis is a passionate, clear-eyed, stringently crafted film that is marred only very slightly by occasional use of that addiction of 60's filmakers: the zoom lens, and an (admittedly exciting) action ending that somewhat distracts from the film's main themes (love the toppling of that idol though). 9.5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Masaki Kobayashi had shown great talent for a long time before this, and he'd even made the engrossing epic The Human Condition which seems like it could have been the pinnacle of any man's career, and then he goes and makes Harakiri. In the year following his completion of his humanist epic, he made two films rather quickly. The first, The Inheritance, is an entertaining little noir, but Harakiri feels like something that has been agonized over for years before completion. The precision of the visuals, the exacting nature of the dialogue, and the complex structure that only heightens the experience all come together to create one of the great samurai movies that, because it was made by Masaki Kobayashi, is only out to demonstrate the flaws of the entire samurai system and Bushido, Kobayashi's first work in jidaigeki.\n\nA middle-aged ronin, Hanshiro (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the gates of the House if Iyi in Edo, asking them access to their courtyard to commit seppuku instead of leaving himself to starve in the streets in this time of great peace in Japan where unattached samurai have no hope for employment. However, the Clan of Iyi's senior counselor Saito (Rentaro Mikuni) tries to dissuade him. There have been a rash of ronin approaching great houses in Edo, begging for the same opportunity, after one ronin had been granted a position in another clan's house. Most ronin who do this now are simply deterred by a simple offering of a few coins and told to go on their way, but the Iyi Clan has decided on a different tact. Saito tells him the story of another ronin, Chijiiwa (Akira Ishihama) who came begging, and, persuaded by one of the senior samurai, Hikokuro (Tetsuro Tamba), they forced the young ronin to go through with the ceremony. Saito explains in explicit and exacting detail the torture they forced Chijiiwa to go through, including the use of his own bamboo sword to disembowel himself, despite Chijiiwa's begging for one day's respite.\n\nHanshiro hears this tale quietly, assuring the counselor that he has never heard of Chijiiwa, that his sword is not made of bamboo, and that he has every intention of dying in the Iyi's courtyard. Saito lets him go forward, and that's where the movie gets really interesting.\n\nHanshiro lied to Saito when he said he didn't know Chijiiwa. Waiting there for his chosen second to appear, Hikokuro, he begins to tell his tale of how he showed up at that door. He was Chijiiwa's father-in-law, brought together under the lordship of their own lord who committed seppuku ten years before at the order of the Shogun. He raised the boy along with his own, younger daughter for years in the peace of Edo where he could find no work other than the creation by hand of umbrellas. In order to save his daughter Miho (Shima Iwashita) the fate of becoming a courtesan, he begged Chijiiwa to marry her instead.\n\nI've often wondered if this movie would work as well as it does if it was just told chronologically. It would need a rewrite (there would be no need for most of the dialogue in the first thirty minutes), but it obviously could be told that way. Would it lose something? I think it really would. Most of the backstory of the film, the loss of a position for Hanshiro, his friend's seppuku, his adoption of Chijiiwa, his doting on Miho, and the hardships they all suffered together under the unfeeling, feudal system are told in a concentrated twenty-minute dose at the center of the film. By that point, we already have an understanding of Hanshiro's resignation towards death as well as having witnessed the wanton cruelty Iyi showed towards Chijiiwa. If the point of the film were the emotional character journeys, I might say that the rearrangement would be necessary, but that's not the point.\n\nKobayashi was trying to say something very specific about the feudal system Japan had just emerged from and still lingered in a modified form. He used his characters to tell this point, that Bushido was a lie used by those in power to maintain themselves. This becomes extremely explicit later in the film, but it ends up working because of the emotional journey we follow with Hanshiro. This isn't a lecture (though Hanshiro and Saito do end up lecturing each other at one point), this is a father's final act of vengeance against a system that sent him into poverty with no way to support his daughter's virtue other than to marry her to another ronin.\n\nProbably the most affecting emotional moment is when, in flashback, Hikokuro and two others bring Chijiiwa's body back to Hanshiro, and Hanshiro discovers that Chijiiwa had sold his swords, replacing them with the bamboo weapons. Hanshiro had never even considered the selling of his own sword, for, to a samurai, his sword is his soul, but he could have sold it for the money to help save them from the desperation of poverty that had sent Chijiiwa to the doors of the House of Iyi. In not selling his own blades, he had doomed Chijiiwa to death as much as anyone.\n\nThe film takes a surprisingly fun ironic twist in the fates of Hikokuro and the two other samurai, providing our first concentrated dose of samurai action in the film up to this point, but the real battle is yet to come: Hanshiro's final blow against the Iyi clan and the whole system that they abused to torture his son-in-law. He knows he's going to die, as we heard from his early dialogue with Saito, and he goes out making a blow, but there's one final bit of irony. Saito, untouched by the violence, has the entire affair swept under the rug because it would reflect badly on Iyi and their lord. Their official account makes only a small mention of Hanshiro as having committed hara-kiri in the clan's courtyard.\n\nI've praised Kobayashi's visuals before, but the way he composes his frame in Harakiri is on another level. The precision and depth of his images, especially in the beginning where he has group conversations between a dozen people of the Iyi clan in a single room, where each is completely in frame and at different distances to the camera, feels incredibly natural and allows each speaking part their ability to stand out without relying on a series of closeups that would lose the geography of the scene. The courtyard itself is filmed cleanly and mostly from afar, to keep that same clarity, but there's also an emphasis on distance that underlines the point that the system is dehumanizing.\n\nI have to take a moment to talk about Nakadai as well. For the longest time, having seen this film years ago and only relying on my memories, I was convinced that this movie starred Toshiro Mifune, but it was Mifune's costar from Yojimbo and Kurosawa's choice of his replacement in Kagemusha and Ran that took the central role of Hanshiro. He holds himself extremely well, seemingly almost dead in the beginning, barely hearing what Saito is telling him, but becoming increasingly ferocious as the film goes on. He was a strong actor, and it's interesting to note that while his performances in both Yojimbo and Black River are of the same, insane variety, he'd never really approached it again in any other work with Kobayashi, choosing to go more subtle and human, reaching his apex here.\n\nThis is one of the crowning jewels of Masaki Kobayashi's body of work. It is an amazing combination of storytelling with purpose, told with incredible skill in his assured hands. This movie is great."

It's very emotional at times. Never boring. Really good cinematography. It has a very unique and interesting style.\n\nCons: I dont really have any complaints about the movie\n\nOverall: This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

And one more, this screenwriter always draws such a script. In other words, it is a technique that advances the story by interweaving the present and the past. Looking at this movie alone is a great composition, but I's spoiled to see many other works written by this screenwriter. Also, since it is a story that only revenges resentment, it feels shallow as a story. Since the story is a little shallow, I think the director made efforts to push this story to the higher label movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Set during the early 17th century, the story centers around Hanshiro Tsugumo, a ronin (masterless samurai) who arrives at the Iyi clan's estate and requests to perform harakiri (ritual suicide). However, as he reveals his true intentions and recounts a tragic tale of injustice, the true nature of his visit becomes apparent.\n\n\"Harakiri\" skillfully examines the complex dynamics of feudal society and the conflicts between personal morality and societal expectations. The film explores the hypocrisy and corruption that can exist within hierarchies of power, questioning the value of honor and the true meaning of samurai ethics.\n\nThe performances in \"Harakiri\" are exceptional, with Tatsuya Nakadai delivering a standout portrayal as Hanshiro Tsugumo. His nuanced performance captures the character's inner turmoil, determination, and unwavering sense of justice. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, adding depth and complexity to the narrative.\n\nThe film's pacing is deliberate and methodical, allowing the story to unfold at a measured pace. It builds tension gradually, creating a sense of anticipation and drawing the audience deeper into the moral dilemmas faced by the characters. The storytelling is carefully crafted, revealing layers of intrigue and deception that keep viewers engaged and guessing.\n\nVisually, \"Harakiri\" is beautifully shot, with exquisite cinematography that captures the elegance and brutality of its setting. The black-and-white aesthetic adds to the film's atmospheric tone, emphasizing the contrasts between light and shadow and highlighting the emotional intensity of each scene.\n\nOne of the strengths of \"Harakiri\" lies in its exploration of moral ambiguity and the consequences of blind loyalty and adherence to tradition. It raises profound questions about the nature of honor, sacrifice, and the true measure of a person's worth. The film's themes resonate long after the credits roll, inviting introspection and contemplation.\n\n\"Harakiri\" is a gripping and thought-provoking samurai drama that delves into the complexities of honor, duty, and societal expectations. With its powerful performances, meticulous storytelling, and profound moral exploration, the film offers a deep and resonant cinematic experience. It is a must-watch for those who appreciate compelling narratives and the examination of timeless moral dilemmas."

        "review_detailed_main": "Harakiri is a 1962 samurai film, directed by Masaki Kobayashi. It takes place in 17th century Japan, finally peaceful times for the nation after a long era of war and bloodshed. Many samurai are now masterless, \"ronin\", struggling to survive in a world that no longer needs their skill as warriors. Hanshiro Tsugumo, now a ronin as well, arrives at the gates of the Iyi clan with one request: a proper place to kill himself in the ritual of seppuku, as his life are too poor and devoid of honor to go on living. As his interactions with the clan proceed and his intentions are slowly examined and unraveled, we learn that there is more than meets the eye to Tsugumo's request.\n\nThis movie is a slow-burn, with its first half handling the suspense surrounding Tsugumo's story in a very immersive, satisfying and masterful way. The premise of the film sounds simple at first, but it's developed slowly, each detail revealed making an impact upon the viewer, and it really got me hooked on my first time watching.\n\nThe cinematography is pretty straight forward, but the harsh compositions often do well in showing the brutality of the world, the unforgiveness where we might have expected something else. The bamboo-sword scene is easily one of the best in the whole film for this exact reason, this harshness in which everything is presented. The slow, excruciating pain of the scene, made me feel like I was there. Love it.\n\nThe ominous soundtrack adds a lot to the immersiveness of the film, its dark and twisted notes fitting to the era in which the movie takes place, foreboding, bare and odd. Like it a lot, as well.\n\nTatsuya Nakadai is especially great as Tsugumo, communicating the grit he has along with his special kind of cynicism, and his softer side as well. Range is shown here, definitely. The other actors were solid as well, though nothing as impactful or memorable acting-wise, in my opinion.\n\nAfter the halfway point of the film I feel like it has some heavy exposition, that made this part of the film a little more tiresome to watch. It's important and I don't know if there was a way to communicate this part of the story better (and right from the topknot moment and until the end of the movie, things get exciting again), but it was less smooth than the first half, for sure.\n\nI'd also like to say that this film is not very rewatchable, to me at least- its slowness is fine when you don't know the details of the story, but on rewatch the movie is a little tougher to digest, since you already know everything that should keep you in suspense, there isn't that much to unpack, and things overall move me less. I was quite tired when rewatching the movie, so maybe that had a bit of an impact, but I still think that what I've said is relevant.\n\nIn conclusion, Harakiri is a pretty solid film. Its first half is full of suspense, a well-crafted slow-burn that lets us into the harsh and brutal world of the samurai, and even though there's a little tiresome (but essential) part in the middle of the film it also ends in a strong note. Not very rewatchable, but definitely worth watching. I'm feeling an 8.1/10 on this one."

This is one of those films that slowly and unexpectedly unfolds as you watch it. I found myself switching my feelings about certain characters as the movie went on. In the beginning, you are kind of forced to feel a certain way but gradually after that, you start to learn and understand what is actually happening. In each scene you learn something new and after each scene you just want to keep watching more and more. At the end of the film you can't help to think about the way some people live and the extreme moral codes they live by. Not only that but how some things are kept unsaid just to retain some type of order within that culture. Things like that happen all the time. People cover up the truth and flaws so that the code can remain the same and that others will still follow it. You can only imagine the amount of information that hasn't been passed on throughout the centuries due to that kind of reasoning. Overall, I loved this movie and it kept me on my toes throughout.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Harakiri\" (1962), directed by Masaki Kobayashi, serves as a powerful narrative on the sacred and often misunderstood practice of hara-kiri or seppuku in Japanese culture. This film explores the profound consequences of trivializing such a revered tradition, emphasizing the inevitable repercussions of desecrating what is sacred. The message is clear from the beginning: one must not play with the sanctity of cultural rituals or misuse them for personal gain, for doing so invites the wrath of nature's immutable laws.\n\nThe film deftly unravels its plot through a series of natural twists and turns, maintaining a gripping mystery throughout. Although the pacing might seem slow to those not enthralled by the intricacies of suspense and layered storytelling, each revelation adds depth and intensity to the narrative. The meticulous exploration of characters' pasts highlights the complex motives behind the act of hara-kiri, revealing stories steeped in sorrow and despair.\n\nThe thin line between honor and life is poignantly depicted, showcasing the extreme measures taken to preserve one's dignity. The film also underscores the importance of empathy, as encapsulated in the profound question, \"Who can truly understand the depths of another's heart?\" The portrayal of samurai honor as being as politically biased and flawed as modern-day politics adds a critical layer of social commentary.\n\nUltimately, \"Harakiri\" is a tragic tale of pride, vengeance, and the hollow nature of superficial honor. It exposes the empty posturing behind claims of dignity, revealing that, in the end, it is often about power and prestige rather than genuine integrity."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hara-Kiri Directed by Masaki Kobayashi A courageous story about an unemployed samurai fighting for the honor of his son-in-law, daughter and grandson. The way the story unfolds keeps the audience in a constant state of gripping suspense. The story is weaved together from present-time to flashbacks that slowly (making it all the more suspenseful) reveal the true reason as to why Hanshiro wants to commit Hara-Kiri before the Lyi Clan.\n\nIn this film, I especially loved the cinematography. As the camera silently glides through the grounds of the Lyi Clan, I felt as though I was a samurai. From the stealth-like camera movement, to the very clean and groomed framing of the actors and the background, to the quiet moments spent waiting for the Hon. Elder to respond to Hanshiro's declaration that, \"he is free to choose a second\" I felt as though I was a member of the Lyi Clan waiting for Hon. Elder to make his decision.\n\nI think Kobayashi's story of the samurai culture is extremely relatable to many issues we find in today's society. I found many parallels between Kobayashi's depiction of the samurai culture and religious institutions. For my purposes here, I will use Catholicism as an example. However, Catholicism/Christianity is far from the only religion one could find parallels.\n\nIn Hara-kiri, the rigid samurai culture adheres to a strict code - the boshido code. However, the way these codes are appropriated leads to abuse of power and corruption. Kobayashi relays this message by focusing on one needle in the haystack - our protagonist Hanshiro. Through his experience, we understand the consequences of these appropriations on a personal level. We see how the samurai culture was full of exclusivity and allowed for their own people to live in poverty and starve to death in exchange for the preservation of their codes. Motome, Hanshiro's son-in-law, was forced to perform Hara-Kiri using a bamboo sword. He pleaded for a few more days before he committed suicide, but they would not listen. The event becomes even more tragic as we discover that the sword was bamboo because he sold the original to save his ailing wife and child.\n\nSo how does all of this relate to Catholicism? Similar to the samurai culture's strict principles and ideals, Catholicism has a dogmatic, literal and archaic view point on homosexuality and abortion. The Catholic religion bans gay marriage and refuses to acknowledge, support, or accept homosexual relationships within the church. Recently, NPR did a report about a man who applied for a job in a Catholic school. He met all of the credentials, and they were so pleased with his interview he was hired. However, when he filled out his paperwork, he revealed his husband as a significant other. He was quickly informed he no longer could be employed, because they did not condone gay marriage. And what was the position he applied for, you ask? He applied to be a cook! This story is littered with hypocrisy, judgment, exclusivity, and discrimination. In their determination to preserve these archaic beliefs, they have exemplified hate. Or the fact that Catholic gay couples are having to worship in a separate church. What the church fails to realize is that in order to preserve their doctrine's literal meaning, they are violating the core values that are the foundation of their religion.\n\nIn the end of Hara-Kiri, Saito tells a member of the Lyi Clan the story of what will end up in their history books. He does not want his Clan shamed by the incidents that have just happened. Ultimately, despite honesty being the core value of the boshido code and samurai culture, Saito breaks it to preserve the reputation and power of the Lyi Clan.\n\nThis is very similar to the current scandals we see today in the Catholic religion. A multitude of sexual molestation cases of young boys by their Catholic priests have occurred. What makes the incidents even worse is the churches knowledge of the scandal and its attempts to cover it up (transferring the priest, bribery,denial). And just like Saito, they too violate one of the core values of their institution - truth.\n\nI went to a museum exhibit in which there were letters encased in glass from young women writing to their local government and religious institutions. They were pleading for a way out. These women were trapped with an unwanted pregnancy and stranded without any options. I remember one woman's tearful letter as she begged for her governor to grant her permission to have an abortion. If her school found out she was pregnant, she would be kicked out of nursing school. She was the first in her family to go to school and her father would disown her if he found out.\n\nAgain, another example of how religion has violated their ethical code in order to preserve the sanctity of their institution. Instead of helping these women and looking beyond the text, they left them stranded and forced them to follow through with their unfortunate predicament alone. This is exactly what happened to Motome when he went to the Lyi Clan to plead for money for his dying family."

The close-ups are beautiful and expressive and the framing is clearly well thought-out. Tsugumo is impressive as a character. Motome is affecting as well. Their physiognomies are expertly chosen or crafted.\n\nThe story itself is one of honour and despair, of anguish and rage, of cunningness and cowardice. It is long-winded and you need to be rested and open to have the patience for it. There's a lot of exposition and we get to the heart of the matter an hour into the story.\n\nIt probably resonates better with admirers of Japanese samurai culture. I personally found the duel scene in the field too histrionic and silly. Certainly the visuals of samurai fights have changed over the many decades. I wonder if that's how it really looked back then. And how would we really know what were the practices over 400 years ago.\n\nAnyway, considering the history of cinema and where it is placed this movie deserves a higher rating. But this one here reflects my actual enjoyment of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "HARAKIRI (1962) : Brief Review -\n\nA Legendary tale from Japanese Cinema on Samurai Honour and Traditional Facade. This is the Best Samurai Film i have ever seen till date. I mean it by all intellectual angles irrespective of what legacy other Samurai Films like \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Yojimbo\" carries. Harakiri made me feel the pain into Mysterious narrative and exposed the malicious traditional honour and abrogates. The characters study and subtle meaning in Samurai films couldn't have got better than this. In 133 minutes of runtime, Harakiri tells a story of a Ronin who requests to perform Harakiri at feudal lord's palace. This brutal suicide theory turns into a tight slap to all Ancient theories which have been worshiped by brutal lords and arrogant ronins. Action, drama, Mystery, Social Message and what not to expect from one narrative and Harakiri gets everything right on top. Tatsuya Nakadao in leading role is fantastic from the start and the protagonist Tetsuro Tamba is humanly evil as hell. The supporting cast does well in limited space and mostly in action sequences which have been performed on slow mode to have realistically elegant look. The film is set in 17th century and thankfully I don't know nothing about the Japanese culture from that era to point out faults in production design. However, the film mostly takes place in that one palace so even that production design part of nuances set in specific era didn't bother much to my brain. It all looks fine under one roof and one place. This is my first film of Director Masaki Yobakashi and undoubtedly it turned out to be an unforgettable experience. Harakiri is Masaki's only film in IMDb Top 250 Rated list (if I'm not wrong) and it deservingly holds it's ground and will hold it for years. I am trying to remember the legendary films made in 60s decade all over the world and at the moment i think Harakiri would be in Top 3 in my list. Strongly Recommended to matured Cinema lovers.\n\nRATING - 8.5/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

From start to finish it is riveting. It's timeless in what it attempts to communicate while also being a period piece. Your allegiance as to who you are rooting for shifts in an elegant way, and the pacing between past events and future is just immaculate."

This clich\u00e9 is growing so much that now the customs produced anonymously by people are facing humanity, just like the giant you created. Tatsuya's superb acting also adds to this. The movie reflects its period exactly, you feel like you are somewhere there. It reflects families and their customs very well. My advice to you is to be careful about Harakiri, because even saying you will do Harakiri is a crime. You will understand what I said last time when you watch the movie.

This movie is different from other samurai movies, because it criticizes the samurai code; Bushido, and doesn't romanticize it. Seppuku I don't know if this is the best samurai project ever brought to screen, but I'm willing to bet that it is right up there. Actually billed as an anti-samurai film, this bare-bones black & white drama cuts to the core of the samurai way of life in an examination of the validity of the samurai code. Although the code ultimately stands up to close scrutiny, albeit unsteadily, it is finally only through revisionist manipulation that it does hold up at all. In short, the way of the samurai, or bushido, finally just survives this anti-samurai treatment, teetering upon a shaky foundation made up of lies perpetrated through sheer force of authoritarian pronouncement and will. This not only demonstrates how the myth and mystique of bushido survive, but it also gives good insight into the way those in power can turn fact into accepted self-serving fiction. As an aside, while watching Harakiri, Eastwood's High Plains Drifter, an American anti-western that performs a similar function of undercutting the perceived code, the collective bravado, of the gun-slinging West, kept coming to mind. That's another one I must watch again."

        "review_title": "An exquisite, essential, masterpiece of a classic; an absolute must-see treasure",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's gently paced, and by and large carries itself with a tone that's even softer. While we do get everything we expect out of a jidaigeki film, and still more particularly of samurai films, the preponderance of the length is defined by quiet, reserved scenes of dialogue, with the predominant focus being squarely on the meticulous, careful nuance of the acting, cinematography, and direction. Beyond even all this, the tale on hand is one of utmost despairing tragedy, the sort that should make any thinking, feeling person blanche in horror, yet on account of the precise, supremely mindful approach taken to the storytelling and film-making, the picture is less likely to evoke the emotions one would assume. Yet none of this is accidental. 'Harakiri' was shaped with only the very highest degree of skill and intelligence, an indefatigable purposefulness that meets or exceeds all points of comparison, and any possible expectations. The patient, thoughtful viewer is rewarded with an exquisite masterpiece that in my opinion meets or exceeds any standard one might carry in mind for cinema. This is without question one of the greatest movies ever made, putting to shame the vast majority of anything that has ever been generously granted such a label.\n\n'Harakiri' is perfect. Every note in the increasingly sparing original score of Takemitsu Toru is deployed with an ingenuity that complements, reinforces, and amplifies the hushed yet spellbinding drama that unfolds. Impeccable sound design makes even soft footfalls inspire as the brilliant, fastidious choices that they are amidst the craftsmanship. Rarely has an editor deserved praise more than Sagara Hisashi, for rarely have I so plainly been able to recognize the finesse and artistry that film editing might boast in the hands of a wizard. Miyajima Yoshio's cinematography is rich, crisp, and vivid, smartly visualizing every detail for us in a manner that both accentuates the drama and bolsters the artistry that overflows in the vision of filmmaker Kobayashi Masaki. To date I can't claim to be familiar enough with Kobayashi to speak directly to any point of comparison, yet in watching this feature I'm pointedly reminded of Kurosawa Akira, a man known for his perfectionism - be it true or not, I detect the same level of painstaking diligence in Kobayashi's work here, and that is only the highest of compliments. All this is to say nothing of those facets that more commonly earn praise, like the gorgeous sets and filming locations, lovely costume design, hair and makeup, and props and weapons, and vibrant choreography, stunts, and effects. Yet incredibly, flawless as these facets are, they just aren't the first to catch one's attention.\n\nGiven the overall tenor of this title one could be forgiven for not being immediately swept away by the acting, itself mostly understated and restrained. Like all else here, however, there is stupendous subtlety in the performances that belies the searing drama of the saga and the fervency of the underlying emotions. All involved - not least Iwashita Shima, Mikuni Rentaro, Ishihama Akira, and especially star Nakadai Tatsuya - are to be congratulated for momentously strong portrayals that bring their characters to such stark life in the realization of so gripping a tale. And with all this firmly in mind, it is a tremendous credit to Kobayashi, to producer Hosoya Tatsuo, and to every contributor, above all Hashimoto Shinobu in adapting Takiguchi Yasuhiko's novel, that the story here is so incredibly powerful and impactful. I sat to watch with no foreknowledge save for the film's reputation, and I am altogether stunned. The low-key tack adopted throughout most of these 133 minutes allows the dialogue, scene writing, and narrative to speak entirely for themselves, slowly laying the groundwork and stirring the pot while building to a terrible crescendo quite unlike any other. The premise seems simple as down-and-out ronin Tsugumo approaches the Iyi clan with a request to commit harakiri, and first explains the course of events that led him to this juncture. What unfolds instead, through intermittent cuts to flashback and to the active plot, is a deeply absorbing and compelling story that through to the end only becomes more dour and dispiriting.\n\nMoreover, through the framework of that story, Kobayashi and Hashimoto latch onto bigger ideas and themes that reverberate like a thunderclap and which remain infuriatingly relevant to our modern world. 'Harakiri' is, at its core, a fiery, strident, cleverly devised manifesto. This is nothing if not a vehement condemnation of the adoption of symbols by movements, subcultures, and broader societies, and of the dogmatic codes that zealously cling to those symbols while not just forsaking reason, compassion, and humanity, but also the very values and principles that such symbols and codes are purported to represent and ensure. In some measure I'm reminded of Abel Gance's 1919 epic anti-war classic 'J'accuse': this may specifically target the practices and code of honor of the samurai, but Kobayashi's ferocious statement applies just as equally to any society that puts some emblem on a pedestal - a flag, a ribbon, an ideal - and whether in word or on paper enshrines a system (codes, laws) that emptily prioritizes such emblems and uses it as a shield, a thin veil, to mask horrid, harmful, iniquitous behavior. That the picture does all this while also demonstrating expert craftsmanship, telling a riveting story, and embracing magnificent artistry, can only mean that the end result is a treasure with precious, precious few works that can call it kin.\n\nThis has been on my list to watch for a long time, and I anticipated enjoying it, but I am completely taken aback by what has actually greeted me. I'm aghast that it's taken me so long to see it; I'm almost heartbroken and offended that it's not widely held in much higher regard, and more routinely recognized. As far as I'm concerned the sum total is in every way a piece of cinema beyond all reproach, with fantastically shrewd notions at every turn. Even the climax and the ending defy our assumptions: we get action violence, but tactfully dispensed and cut such that it is as artistic as it is exciting; Tsugumo is a virtuous protagonist, and a fierce warrior, but he is not a \"one-man army\" who will tirelessly cut down all his foes; there is a patient deliberateness in the climax that flies in the face of the hard-charging bombast that characterizes much modern fare; the flick concludes with a denouement that bucks the norms and standards of much of cinema, further cementing the central themes while resolving the plot in a fashion that is at once both satisfying and upsetting. What here is less than superlative? In my estimation the answer is \"nothing.\" For various reasons this may not readily appeal to all comers, and strictly speaking we all have different personal preferences where movies are concerned. Be that as it may, there is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the very best features in all of cinema, and it would be an awful mistake to pass up an opportunity to watch. 'Harakiri' is a truly essential classic that's well worth seeking out however one must, and I'm happy to give it my very, very highest, heartiest, most enthusiastic recommendation!"

The Bushido code is challenged, and the true morale code and way of Samurai life is challenged to the core. I was told that I would never forget my first time witnessing an act of Seppuku, when one commits Harakiri by disemboweling themselves with their samurai sword. So far, I haven't. The black and white film technology available at the time of this movies production is a crime against humanity. How I would have loved to seen the rich red colors of the samurai armor, and to visually see the lush green trees in the Iyi Clan courtyard, or the saged yellow grass starving for the suns rays or a drop of water during Hanshiro's duel with the master swordsman. The film is a work of art, and should be treated as such. Sightly harsh and startling audio coupled with dark images and a haunting story line make this film probably something you shouldn't watch alone in the dark."

However, the way Hara-kiri was perform it lead to cruelty and brutal for me. Motome, Hanshiro and the rest of samurai that live in Iyi clan followed the Bushido code which was pure, unique because it was their religion and believes. Also for those who were decided in heart to committed Hara-kiri, they believe it was an honor to die this way. In other hand, I choose to talk about Motome because the scene where he committed Hara-kiri was the most that make me believe on what was happening and the reason why they were doing those kind of rituals. This scene was so pragmatic, it even make me feel the pain Motomo was going trough till the end of his death"

What makes this film great is the way Masaki Kobayashi went about recording the film. For instance, Masaki Kobayashi had low camera angles, real weapons, and he recorded on real time. I felt, that was what made this film great. One of the things that I actually enjoy about this film is the way Masaki Kobayashi pitches hidden massages to this audience. He makes the audience question what they believe is actually right. He wants his audience to dig deeper and don't settle for what's being said or told. What I find most interesting is the development of Japanese films. Japanese films were relatively late in film making. Yet, they made amazing films in the late 1900s. Karakiri is one of them. This film is a must watch."

But, as a proud ronin named Hanshiro recounts (often through flashbacks) his moving personal story to the Samurai of the House of Iyi, the story unfolds in unexpected ways and we get an opportunity to stare into the souls of those proud Samurai. We also get the opportunity to asses where true honor lies. Is it honorable to adhere to the expected rules and rituals, or is it more honorable to reassess the rules as times of change and to let go of rigidity to show compassion to fellow humans in need?"

It shows the real struggle when someone is left jobless or in this case masterless (Ronin). During this time Samurai where paid instead to kill themselves, so they would go to other Samurai house and requested to use their garden to kill them self or commit (Harakiri). This movie makes you think twice in not to judge people bad about their situation, some houses believe that some samurais would just come to try to commit Harakiri just to take the movie instead. The scene where Harakiri is perform is very painful to watch, I felt so bad for the protagonist.

It is comfortably my favourite as unlike the others it hasn't noticably dated nor has any clear flaws.\n\nThe glacial pace doesn't drag as we're treated to a near-constant stream of visually-striking compositions, a photographer's film! The black-n-white is quite beautiful, with just the right amount of contrast (I recommend the Bluray, for optimal dynamic range).\n\nWhat the camera does is one thing, a good film still needs a compelling narrative, and we get that too. The first half-hour is a little confusing, but once the story finds its groove (or rather, once the viewer has 'tuned in') then it's quite gripping. We want to know what Tsugumo's game is...\n\nThe most impressive accomplishment of the narrative is how it puts its main message across, regarding bushido. I won't explicitly state that message here, as first-time viewers should experience it within the film. It's an impressive ending.\n\nThe cast are all decent, music totally sparse yet effective. Subtitles were fine, clear & concise. The action is mostly quite good (for an early-60's flick) tho' there was one sword-swipe which clearly missed its mark despite the victim falling prey to it. Forgiveable, given the age of the film...and understandable, given the actors used real swords! The sets and setting feel authentic, tho' lacking a little in variety. While the slow pacing and precise dialogue isn't an issue, it does make Harakiri a 'watch-when-in-the-mood' type film...not one to put on at any time.\n\nOverall a strong 8/10. The first classic-japanese to get that score. I already enjoy anime & horror from Japan-cinema (Akira, Grave of the Fireflies & The Grudge are probably my top 3 japanese films)...I wasn't sure if the 50's/60's stuff was for me. Now with Harakiri I'm beginning to see the appeal. On account of this strong showing the next film of this ilk will be from the same director: either Kwaidan or deep dive into his Human Condition trilogy."

The pace is a bit slow and parts of the plot predictable, which is typical for older movies, but not to the point to make the movie boring. The dialogue is very smart, and the movie very well directed as well. The climax towards the end is also amazing and something to remember. Overall, a movie that stands the test of time."

Japan embraces strict cultural patterns and rules and for a samurai, their is a fine line between compliability and morality when forced to follow the Bushido code. This film questions the rationality of following dogmatic practices when it results to unethical behavior. As the movie opens up with a narration from a book and closes in the same way, Kobayashi also questions the validity of history and the subjectivity of the truth.

They became beggars and men without hope. There was no work for them. Some then turned to a the realities of the Samurai code. This was Harakiri, which is the ritual disemboweling of the self with a sword in front of a group of clan members. Making things more complicated is that some of those leaders stepped in and provided charity for these men, leading to a wave of them seeking money. But in this one, a young man whose real story we don't know till the end, presents himself for self execution and then wants to go away for a while. He is kept there and eventually, using a bamboo sword, takes his life. But the big story is a man, connected to this young man, who also presents himself, and he tells a tale that is so sad. This is where conventions trump the sad realities of the people. Duty is seen ahead of compassion. Also, there is definitely politics and self interest at work. While this take a great deal of commitment to watch, don't miss it. Outstanding."

        "review_detailed_main": "So yeah, I just watched this film. And I'm gonna say that is one of the best films I've seen in my life. Such a twisted, depressing, clever and instigating story. Is not the 'typical' samurai flick, this is indeed a serious, very dark drama(hard to watch at times, specifically in the scenes. It gave us a very dark and human insight of the life of a warrior. It also talks about how the leader of 'klans' play so dirty to sustain a blind illusion of order and prosperity. Anyway, is really a heartbreaking story, and certainly a fantastic film in all aspects of filmmaking. The cinematography in some scenes is just breath-taking, the acting I thought was excellent. Really a must must watch. Need to see more works of this director, Masaki Kobayashi."

        "review_detailed_main": "Harakiri is a masterfully constructed period drama by director Masaki Kobayashi. The film is expertly set up and provides the viewer with a thought provoking, entertaining two hours of both brilliant dialogue and suspenseful action.\n\nThe film starts with the protagonist of the story, Tsugumo Hanshiro (Tatsuya Nakadai), as an out of work Samurai requesting to commit Harakiri (Seppuku) because he feels he wants to end his life honorably instead of poor and hungry. The counselor of the clan tells Hanshiro a story similar to what is happening now and the other samurai's grisly fate to deter him, but Hanshiro remains committed to his cause.\n\nThe film is told through a series of stories, using flashbacks and narration to move the story along. Kobayashi effectively used the flashbacks and allows the viewer to easily follow the story line while jumping between different stories and timelines.\n\nWhile the acting of Hanshiro and the Counselor is of a higher tier than most, some of the supporting actors fall flat and leave much to be desired. For example, in the film, when Hanshiro is telling a story of his daughter and her husband, the characters end up being a little flat and not living up to their full potential. Their acting wasn't pivotal in the advancement of the story so it didn't deter the viewer's enjoyment of the film.\n\nOverall this film was deep and the viewer realized that both the protagonist and antagonist both have their own motivations. I found myself thinking about this film and the messages it conveyed long after I finished watching it. There are parallels that can be drawn with current events and even could cause you to reassess your own moral code. I highly recommend this well-written film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Similarities between Kobayashi's Harakiri and films of the French new wave arose to me under the comical disobedience of authority. While the authority being questioned in movies such as Godard's \"Breathless\" is mostly directed towards the rules of filming present at the time, the authority being dismissed here is obviously the one behind the Bushido code, held by Saito. The combat scenes seem authentic in a way that is almost comical--ignoring what they may look like ideally, the director is able to make us feel the adrenalin present within Hanshiro during the fight scenes. This comical use of real actions, along with the demystification of the Iyi clan leader, helps expose the viewer to the idealized values present during the Tokugawa era, which although questionable, have been believed by many."

And makes you to look back to remind what you have been missing for your own \"Bushido code\".\n\nBushido code is still predominant in this movie's background. Which made that era very hard and painful. When I saw Hanshiro still had sword while Motome sold his sword for his family, I was very disappointed on the other hand I kind of understand what was going on. Hanshiro is a man who would have sold his sword for his grandson's life. I mean who wouldn't do that. But thinking of selling his sword just did not crossed his mind. Because \"Bushido code\" was rooted in everyone's mind. And that really made me think about what I have been missing and questioning things that I have never been questioned before."
