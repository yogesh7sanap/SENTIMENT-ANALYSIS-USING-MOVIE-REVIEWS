        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is so charming. It starts out with Phil Connor, the Bill Murray character, doing his Bill Murray. Cynicism emanating from every pore. He is harsh, disinterested, angry, full of angst. Making jokes about everything. Everybody knows it. Everybody feels it. When the \"gift\" or \"curse\" comes to him to relive the same day over and over, he at first is confused, then flippant, then angry, then suicidal, and, finally, sees it as a chance to reclaim his humanity. This is done in a series of repetitious acts which ultimately lead to his willingness to sacrifice himself, live for the day, and try to show that he is worth saving. What this movie does, like \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" is ask us what we would do, given the same circumstances. Would we fall into a retreat of depression? Would we become something that we always wanted to be? Would we keep living it the same way, hoping for he best? Murray's character wants the romance and the commitment that he was never willing to give. He toys with his own approach to the world, experimenting and doing things until he gets them right. He goes through a period of embracing the bad, lusting after Andy MacDowell, forcing himself on the other women in the town, disdaining the \"characters\" he meets. But like most \"everymen,\" he eventually must become good because without that, it doesn't matter anymore.\n\nHe can only impress so much; he can only be angry so long. I find this movie so intriguing, not for what it says but for what it teaches. Some don't like the ending, but whatever the forces are that bring it about, it has to be. If we accept that premise, it's OK."

I mean, in my life the day just become another day. ( really I ask myself, the only thing that was different that was the date) I think a lot of people live in groundhog day, doing the same thing again and again, not taking the best out of life. Just living without any consciousness. Not having enough time by their own fault, because time is a thing you can offer yourself by making other choices.\n\nGroundhog day....I personally am getting rid of that day more and more fortunately and finally too. More and more I am trying to make best of life and using every day in another way.\n\nI am not crazy. No, I just watch movies with some kind of view lately. In every movie there is a hidden message told.\n\nEnough about Ground Hog day....I gave the movie an 8 because the number 8 is the number of eternity. And that's also a thing the movie is about. About eternity and not about the bad and boring repeating of the stupid livings.\n\nDanny"

I didn't notice the first time. But on repeated viewings (like reliving Groundhog Day), I was impressed at the story created by the writers. This film is so much more than witty jokes and comic riffs arranged around a gimmick. It has an internal logic and consistency that is very rarely found in screenplays. No joke seemed disposable, and as you laugh your way along, the philosophy underlying the film takes over your imagination.\n\nCheck the IMDb listings for this film's awards: look at the numerous British awards for writing. And yet this film was not even nominated for an Oscar. It is so rare that a film's jokes seem just as fresh more than a decade later, but I believe that is because the theme underlying the humor will never go out of fashion.\n\nThe acting was terrific, and I now think this is Bill Murray's best work (though I didn't take it seriously when I first saw the film.) But the screenplay is the one of the finest ever written. I don't know if it's studied in film schools, but it ought to be.\n\n* * * * *\n\nON HAROLD RAMIS' DEATH: Ramis told The Associated Press in a 2009 story about the 50th anniversary of Second City. \"When you hit it right, those things last.\"\n\nI found that quote in a story on Ramis' death. The story curiously did not mention \"Groundhog Day.\" If there is any film to serve as a fitting memorial for Harold Ramis, it must be \"Groundhog Day.\" A totally perfect script, perfectly executed. He hit it right, and when will he get the recognition he deserved decades ago?"

I thought about the movie quite a bit, in fact, and that is exceedingly rare for me. I think the theme is good enough for doctoral dissertations and certainly Sunday sermons.\n\nAnd I keep finding myself humming \"The Pennsylvania Polka\"."

What life was in the basic premise soon wears thin and the film drags itself along for the remaining hour or so.\n\nThe film seems to be universally admired so maybe I'm not enlightened enough to fully appreciate it. It presumably has an element which hits a nerve with a certain audience - with me it didn't just miss the mark, it missed the entire block."

He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude.\n\nI love this movie \u0096 not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance, when Gods want to punish a mean, arrogant SOB, they would not take his sanity away \u0096 they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question, what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing?\n\nGroundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes; its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes, and it was very convincing.\n\n9.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Bill Murray can be a very funny guy, especially when given roles where his character has a deliciously cruel edge. He has one of those faces, and a voice to go with it, which can make nastiness and sarcasm funny. Groundhog Day is a highly enjoyable vehicle for Murray's talents. It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).\n\nPittsburgh weather-man Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent on assignment to Punxatawney, where on Groundhog Day each year the locals have a tradition of consulting the groundhog to find out if spring is imminent or if they should prepare for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil despises the job and the town, and can't wait to get it over with.... even though he has a soft spot for Rita (Andie MacDowell), the producer overseeing his broadcast. Phil's dislike of Punxatawney, its people and its traditions is set to get a hell of a lot worse though.... as when he awakens the next morning he finds himself reliving the same day. And so it goes - every time Phil gets up, it's still February 2nd and he seems destined to be stuck in the same day for the rest of eternity.\n\nIt seems early on in the proceedings that the film might run out of steam and inspiration. After all, how can a film about a day which repeats itself be anything but repetitive? Thankfully, Groundhog Day is full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity. The film is laced with memorable dialogue, and Murray gets to play one of the defining roles of his career as a facetious, sharp-tongued misanthrope who ultimately learns the error of his ways. Groundhog Day is a very good film indeed, and restores one's faith in the imagination still lurking beneath the dismayingly shallow surface of Hollywood."

He reluctantly travels to Puxatawney, PA with cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) to record the antics of Puxatawney Phil. After they get there, he is caught in a time loop, making him relive February 2nd over and over.\n\nBefore he goes to Puxatawney, Phil is tired of his boring life. To him, it feels like everyday is the same--more clouds, more precipitation, more cold fronts. He is abrasively sarcastic and genuinely depressed.\n\nWhen he is forced to live a life where literally everyday is essentially the same, he learns to appreciate the small things. And he realizes that he is the primary variable in his own life; it is up to him to appreciate the little things and to make the most of his time.\n\nThe script is terrific. Not only does it hold together on scrutiny, it is touching and funny. Bill Murray straddles the line between humorous and meanness perfectly, affecting a transformation that is believable. Andie MacDowell does a good job portraying a woman who is essentially romantic and optimistic, but wary of Phil's intentions. Chris Elliott is self-deprecating and perfectly tuned to his role as an immature schlub.\n\nI know I am not alone in saying I have watched \"Groundhog Day\" so many times I have lost count. Its appeal is so great, it easily bears rewatching, like \"The Wizard of Oz\". In my estimation, Bill Murray has two of the top comedies of our time with \"Groundhog Day\" and \"What About Bob?\""

There are plenty of other valuable takeaways, not the least a caustic appraisal of the modern world and how it can affect us but let's not get too serious - few people have ever had the ability to pull stuff off like this and, for it to remain as entertaining and as fresh as the day it was released, makes Bill Murray one of those few people."

And Bill Murray delivers a yet another Terrific Performance!\n\n'Groundhog Day' Synopsis: A weatherman finds himself living the same day over and over again.\n\n'Groundhog Day' is perfection, believe me it is. Here's a comedy, that offers meaning. I was engrossed from start to end. The journey of its protagonist Phil Connors, played by Murray, is so entertaining & meaningful, that I was taken aback. The Screenplay Written by Danny Rubin & Ramis himself, is simply marvelous. Ramis's Direction, on the other-hand, is efficient. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are pitch-perfect.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Murray is Terrific! The legendary actor delivers a yet another performance, that deserves to be respected. Andie MacDowell is fantastic. Chris Elliott does his part well. Stephen Tobolowsky is hilarious.\n\nOn the whole, 'Groundhog Day' is an unmissable comedy."

Not just mostly... entirely everything.\n\nThis movie threatens at first to go on forever, but after a while I wished it would. It compresses the lesson of \"It's a Wonderful Life\" into its first act, and then improves continually from there. I honestly can't think of how this movie could be improved.\n\nTo see how bad this movie *could* have been, watch \"Multiplicity\" with Michael Keaton. Then watch \"Groundhog Day\" again and enjoy. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen it."

A bit later on , he's caught in a blizzard that he didn't predict , as he finds himself trapped in a time warp , condemned to relive the same day over and over again until he gets it right . He's trapped in a 24-hour timelock in which most events are exactly the same . At first , as each new day dawns , Bill is angry , desperate to flee . He confides in his producer (Andie MacDowell) but naturally on the next day their conversation never happened . Murray eventually decides on a life of good deeds . What would you do if you were stuck in the same day... over and over? Anything you want and everything your heart desires. He's having the worst day of his life... over, and over...He's having the day of his life...over and over again.\n\nLighthearted and enjoyable romantic comedy takes a fun premise about everyday from now on really the same and manages to carry it perfectly through to the end . A sweet , sensitive , charming comedy , but all this is inevitably , well , repetitive and plenty of good laughs . Bill Murray is top-notch as a self-centered TV forecast presenter sullenly enduring his fourth annual visit at Puntxatawney. He has amusement enough with his nice character , although he did get bitten by the groundhog during a scene . Being wonderfully accompanied by an awesome partenaire , the beautiful Andie MacDowell in her complete splendor . Along with an attractive and familiar support cast , such as : Chris Elliott , Stephen Tobolowsky , Brian Doyle-Murray , Marita Geraghty, Angela Paton , Rick Overton , including brief cameo by Harold Ramis as a neurologist , among others.\n\nIt contains a touching , stirring musical score by the great composer George Fenton. As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography shot on location by cameraman John Bailey , though the movie was not filmed in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, but actually in Woodstock, Illinois . The motion picture was competently written and directed by Harold Ramis . Filmmaker/writer/actor Harold said in an interview that his working relationship with actor Bill Murray ended while shooting Groundhog Day (1993) due to differing views on what the film should be about , that's why Murray wanted it to be more philosophical, Ramis wanted it to be a comedy . The good actor/director Harold had a long career that began in 1969 , it spans over forty years , starting when he joined Chicago's Second City's Improvisational Theatre Troupe before moving to New York to help write and perform in \"The National Lampoon Show\" with other Second City graduates including John Belushi, Gilda Radner and Bill Murray . By 1976, he was head writer and a regular performer on the top Canadian comedy series Second City TV (1976). His Hollywood debut came when he collaborated on the script for National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) which was produced/directed by Ivan Reitman . After that, he worked as writer with Ivan as producer on Meatballs (1979), Stripes (1981), Ghostbuster (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989) and acted in the latter three. Rating Groundhog Day(1993) : 7.5/10 , it is quirky funny in vaguely olf-fashioned style . Better than average , worthwhile watching. The pic will appeal to Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell fans."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some of the more profound implications of the scenario were unfortunately scrapped to play to a mainstream audience. Though in the surface a good vehicle for Bill Murray, the cons outweigh the pros.\n\nThere is at least one implication of the scenario overlooked by almost everyone: namely if Bill Murray lives the same day over and over then what happens to everyone else in the world? The only possible solution to this, considering no one else is living it over and over (that we know of), is the many worlds theory. So each new twist of the day creates a new scenario that of course gets played out in the universe that the film's Phil doesn't get to see. So when Phil commits suicide, he really DOES die in that alternate world. And each Phil goes onto the next day with everyone else in the world. So what's happening obviously is his MEMORIES of reliving the same day with different scenarios keep building up more and more.\n\nSo how do these memories get transmuted back to him each 6AM on February 2nd? The original script explained it as a former girlfriend casting a spell on him. In reincarnation theory what dies isn't consciousness, but memory, and some anecdotes exist of those who recall past lives. So what could account for Phil? Somehow the spell would have to stop the death of memory so he not only keeps remembering the future 24 hours, but remembers all the OTHER future 24 hours. The writer estimated 10 years worth, though the original script called for 10,000 years worth of Feb. 2s, which as you can imagine would make this that much more hellish. The fact that Phil starts out each day the same physically shows that the only thing caught in the time loop is his memory.\n\nNow, much of the dialogue is strictly cheap laughs (\"ever had Deja Vu?\" \"I'll see if it's on the menu\" and such). But as far as any overall message it gets lost in over-sentimentality, especially at the end. The message is suppose to be that we must keep repeating things until we get them right; problem is the way Phil chooses to get things right is to YES, use tricks to get what he wants, which is Rita (Andie MacDowell).\n\nThe first night he gets her home she is wise to him, but the last he so utilizes the tricks as to impress her beyond belief. Remember that close to t helast night he tells her the truth of how he knows so much, but NOT the last \"perfect\" day. On THAT day he basically lies to her by impressing her WITHOUT telling her the reason he is able to do so. So actually the film's moral reads: become a master of deceit to get what you want.\n\nIf the film took the more profound path instead of playing to the mainstream it would have been a great film. As it is it a mediocre comedy with a twist."

        "review_detailed_main": "Weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day Event in which a Groundhog is used to predict what kind of weather is to be expected. Phil is generally cynical about this event and vows that this will be the last year that he'll be covering the event. However, after 'covering' the event Phil wakes up at 6 o'clock the next morning (and every morning thereafter) and finds himself living the same day over and over again.\n\nOn paper, Groundhog Day really shouldn't have worked anywhere near as well as it did. The premise of having a weatherman reliving the same day over and over again could have been a monotonous bore in the wrong hands, but Ramis and co really make the most of the premise meaning that it generally works well on every level.\n\nI think what makes this film works so well is that the writers really went to town in an attempt to explore as many possibilities (both good and bad) of living each day exactly the same as the previous one. As a result of living the same day every day Phil inevitably goes through various emotional stages - denial, anger, frustration, depression, acceptance. Each aspect of the story is handled well by Ramis and co and no aspect stays longer than is necessary.\n\nThe script is good here, but so too are the performances from MacDowell and Murray. Murray has the difficult task of taking his character through each of the various emotional stages and gives a very convincing performance throughout. MacDowell is also good, but she isn't given quite as much to work with. Together though,their chemistry was fantastic and given the journey that they'd shared together I actually found myself believing in their blossoming romance (this is coming from someone who normally gags when they watch anything romantic). Groundhog Day also has a lot of heart to it as well and for this reason it is a very likable film.\n\nAs well as all of the above and perhaps most importantly the film also remembers to have lots of fun with its imaginative premise - the scene where Phil was driving with the Groundhog was genius. Whilst this film is never laugh out loud funny there were still plenty of amusing moments.\n\nAre there any problems here? Well yes, but they are only minor.... The central plot sees Phil living the same day as the last and whilst it is very funny for the most part actually seeing the same scenes being repeated over and over again does get a bit tedious at times - although there are slight variances in each of the repetitions so it's not a major problem. The insurance guy was also really annoying, but he's only in a couple of scenes so again this wasn't a major problem.\n\nIt's a testament to Ramis and Co as writers that they've managed to create a film about a man living a seemingly monotonous existence and flesh it out to create a charming, funny, imaginative and rather insightful piece of work. Not many films leave me with a smile on my face at the end, but this one did."

I don't think so.\n\nBill Murray was perfect as Phil Connors, and watching his character evolve from smarmy misanthrope to playful Don Juan to a hopeless suicide case to a true romantic is a joy. Long before the Academy's snub of Murray's \"Rushmore\" performance, they snubbed him for this almost forgotten gem."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was interested in seeing this film because I was curious what they were going to do with its plot. There is a lot you can do with a plot like this and I was interested to know which directions the movie was going to go in. I was very proud of the angle the movie went in. After watching it, I can safely say that it is one of the best comedies from the past 25-30 years.\n\nA weatherman finds himself living the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again. He is the only one who seems to know that it is happening. After he adjusts to it, he tries different things such as finding a love interest, meeting new people, doing illegal activities, helping out people, and trying to figure out how to stop it from going on.\n\nInstances he encounters on that day which keeps on getting repeated include: meeting a friendly former classmate who is trying to sell him insurance, doing a news report on the event of the \"Groundhog Day\" which he finds to be stupid and pointless, and experiencing a snow blizzard which traps him in a town. He is also very rude to his co-workers: Rita and Larry. He dislikes his job, his colleagues, and himself most of all.\n\nHowever, he learns that in order for the event to stop: he may have to change his normal way of life. Over the course of the days, he discovers his love for Rita and his desire to be with her. He also learns to be more kind to other people and he gets to know and help out people around town that he wouldn't have been introduced to had the events in the film had never have taken place. The event makes him learn to love himself and others. It's a very interesting idea a film could use for representing a change in a characters personality.\n\nAnother great thing in the film is that it leaves the reason for the day's constant repetition ambiguous. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide why that happened to him. It makes the viewer wonder if there was an entity or something else that was doing this to him in hopes of having him change his life and personality around. I can understand why someone wouldn't like this, but I didn't mind it because it gave the film sort of an alien or other-worldly feel to it. That's not to say that the movie didn't have one to begin with, but the ambiguity increased it.\n\nPhil's character development in the movie is very convincing and realistic because we can easily believe that the situation would make him react the way he does. There are dark periods in the film when he endangers his life, does illegal activities, and tries to commit suicide. There are also reckless periods in the film when he tries weird and foolish things he wouldn't normally try. Finally, there are some happy periods in the film when he tries to improve on his life and personality. It makes sense that he would try different things because since he doesn't know anything about the situation: There is no way for him to know how to stop it from happening and whether or not he's supposed to do something. Since he loves Rita, the only way he can impress her is by actually changing instead of faking it. At one point in the movie, Rita says that egocentricity is one of his \"defining characteristics\". He doesn't stop being egocentric at the end. He just learns to use it in a positive direction.\n\nOne of the other great things about this film is Bill Murray's terrific acting. I can't think of any actor who would've performed the role better than Bill Murray did. He proved to us that he's not only able to show dramatic depth, but he is also able to combine a comedic and serious side all into the same character. I think that his role here is his best performance yet.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about it is that I wished it was funnier. Of course, there were only a couple points in the film when it made me laugh. However, even the jokes that I did laugh at weren't super creative or that well-written. However, this is my only complaint for the film and nothing else really bugged me about it.\n\nIn conclusion, this could've just been a good movie, but the fantastic choice of turning it into a character study makes it something special. His character development was interesting and convincing and it was handled very well in the movie. The feeling of ambiguity and Bill Murray's incredible acting also helped to carry this movie. Even though it was light on comedy, this is still an amazing comedy film which ranks up there with some of the very best of the genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Groundhog Day\" is another example of a movie that deserved multiple nominations (and wins) at the Academy Awards. At the time, it was often dismissed as a light fantasy-comedy. But actually Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis wrote an incredibly intelligent, heartwarming, and funny script, and Bill Murray put in the performance of his lifetime.\n\nPhil Connors, played by Murray, is having a bad day. A nearly infinite amount of times. I don't believe the story that the movie takes place over 10 years of reliving the same day; it's clearly implied that it's A LOT more than that, and that's what the screenwriter originally had intended anyway. And this is where the brilliance of both the script and Murray's performance lies; we're not watching the same thing over and over again, because we have as a focal point Phil, who's reliving the day and reacting to it differently each time. The stages he goes through until he finally learns to accept it and try to make something of it are interesting. By the end of the movie he's reached something akin to nirvana, where every move he makes is perfect, and thus he's finally allowed to move on.\n\nWe never get an explanation of why this is happening, which only heightens our fascination of it. It seems implied by the ending that something divine is going on; Phil really seems to reach perfection, a state of being, perhaps, a perfect human being, or as close to it as we can get, and that's where the timescale becomes apparent; think how long it would take to achieve such a thing! And all this is masked at first appearance by all the humor going on. At first glance, it really appears to be a screwball comedy (and even as such, it's laugh-out-loud funny), and you can't see the brilliance behind everything. It's a nearly perfect movie, and it's one of my favorites."

But what does she have to do? Apparently nothing. Let me tell you something: If Murray became such a wonderful human being, he would have no interest in that selfish, self- obsessed, insipid tart. I mean, look at that woman: She imagines to be a morally superior princess that no one deserves. That is how she justifies the fact that she is still single. She proceeds to toast to 'world peace' and imagine to be a mother to a bunch of children, but in reality she'd probably divorce the poor bastard she married before they could even have a child. This is one cold woman and it doesn't even take a single day of self-improvement to figure that out.\n\nSo not only is this film illogical, it is misandric.\n\nI give it two stars: one for Bill Murray and one for the hog."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman for a local news station. Every year he goes to Puxatawney, Pennsylvania for the Puxatawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring.\n\nWell, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.\n\nAndie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager :)--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. Only one problem. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option: Stay in Puxatawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. Again. Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja-vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday. Again. Technically.\n\nSo Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.\n\nPart of what makes \"Groundhog Day\" so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale \"A Christmas Story,\" which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called \"Scrooged.\" Anyway. Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, \"I'm-smarter-than-you\" face. He thinks himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.\n\nHarold Ramis, director of \"Analyze This,\" star of \"Stripes,\" directed \"Groundhog Day.\" Bill and he are old pals, and it sure shows. I bet they had a great time making this movie. But what is good about it is that while making a fun movie they didn't forget to come up with an interesting and audience-catching tale.\n\nAnother thing that is great about \"Groundhog Day\" is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example: When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but \"Groundhog Day\" does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck, never have bought a Ferarri, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of \"Groundhog Day.\" I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash - it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (although my conscience would still get in the way.) There was a little comedy with John Candy named \"Delirious.\" It was about a soap opera writer getting trapped in his own world. And everything he writes on his typewriter comes true. While the movie was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control any - and every- thing, and he didn't do them. I think that's where \"Groundhog Day\" steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature - in other words, I love watching the character do something the average human would do when given the power(s). And that's exactly what Phil does in \"Groundhog Day.\" And that is why, among other things, it is one of my favorites.\n\n5/5 stars"

        "review_detailed_main": "As a movie buff, I cannot believe that I have not seen Groundhog Day until now and I wonder what put me off from seeing this movie for so long, especially as a big Bill Murray fan. This film uses his comedic talent to a long extent, but also this is a showcase for his dramatic talent too. This film has a rather interesting concept in reliving a day every day for what seems to be forever. This film is somewhat predictable, but it has a sweet, undeniable message about love and life.\n\nHarold Ramis, who also co-wrote this film, directs a film about a grumpy TV anchor named Phil Connors who has to go to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the events along with his lovely producer and his wise-cracking camera-man. But after a big blizzard strikes the area, Phil is stuck in a time loop and he must relive the day over and over and over again.\n\nThis is one of the best films of Bill Murray's career. He was excellent in such films like Ghostbusters and Lost in Translation, but his role here is even better. Even though he is like Scrooge in the film, he still managed to be hilarious. He gave his character an edge where we can like him despite his rudeness. Andie Macdowell also does a really good job as Rita, Phil's producer.\n\nOverall, Groundhog Day is a magical film that has an original sci-fi concept, but manages to effectively work comedy and romance to that concept. While it seems complicated, it's actually a simple story. We just have to thank the screenplay that Harold Ramis co-wrote for that. I don't normally give perfect scores to comedies so that proves how great this film really is. A magical, funny adventure about love. I rate this film 10/10."

My favorite aspect is the comedy. Bill Murray obviously as the star. I always loved his comedic style in 80s/90s movies. But all the other characters were funny too.\n\nTime travel is one of my favorite topics in movies so this made me like the movie more. It's not that concerned with the science aspect but mostly about the main character's way of dealing with his odd new reality. There's a lot of romance and drama. Giving this movie depth but it does always try to remain lighthearted. A great feel good movie and one my favorite movies of all-time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm pretty sure everyone in America has seen Groundhog Day, and that most of America watches it every year on the holiday itself. I'm included in the latter and have seen the movie over twenty times with my family. We eat Angel food cake, stuffing it in our mouths when Bill Murray does onscreen, and we drink sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist. Even as kids, we drank bitters to pretend we could fit in with Andie MacDowell. We even have a relative who tried to calculate just how many Groundhog Days Bill lived through! Our family is hardly unique, and I'm sure millions of others enjoy the same ritual every February 2nd.\n\nBill Murray will forever be immortalized in American cinema for his role as an unlikable, sarcastic, jaded weatherman assigned to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania with his socially awkward cameraman, Chris Elliot, and his new, optimistic producer, Andie MacDowell, to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. I love this movie, but I would love it even more had Michael Keaton accepted the role, because in scenes where the character is supposed to show growth and new kindness, Bill's not particularly convincing. He is extremely convincing during most of the movie, when he's irritable, rude, and condescending. And, since this movie is a fantasy about living the same day over and over again with no consequences, it's cathartic for the audience to watch Bill's socially inacceptable behavior. How many times have we longed to tell off an irritating salesman? Bill gets to punch Stephen Tobolowsky in the face for us!\n\nThere's so much to love about this movie, full of contrasts and imagination. Sweet Andie MacDowell is contrasted by Marita Geraghty's silliness. Everyone in the town takes themselves so seriously, providing the perfect surreal surrounding for Bill Murray's distaste. On the drive over, he insults the entire town, calling the residents \"hicks\" and \"morons\", setting the stage for a truly moving transformation. In Harold Ramis's iconic, inventive classic, audiences get to reappreciate small town charm, shrug off years of indifference and assumptions, learn to believe in love, and have faith in the belief that anyone can change. No matter how awful someone is, given several hundred second chances, he can change. And, in the ultimate lesson of optimism, even a simple bad day can turn into a lifechanging good one."

They didn't even try to make it seem as if he was interested in Rita and then all of a sudden she is the only woman he wants and is in love with.\n\n2. Rita written as such a bland, one dimensional person, the way a random seggist can think of when imagining a woman.\n\n3. Mind you, from her perspective, she only knows Phil for a day, so it really doesn't make any sense, doesn't matter how nice he acts, for her to suddenly fall in love with him. Well, for such a bad written character it does make sense. Phil is not even a good person, and neither does he become one.\n\n4. The jokes are bad because they are basically creepy in any other context.\n\n5. But what the fog how uncomfortable was this movie. Why is his 'curse' lifted when Rita sleeps with him, or sleeps by his side? What does that mean? Is it true love? Did he just manage to manipulate her into thinking he is the perfect guy for her, because he seriously isn't. ITS AN ACT, A FACADE, A TRICK and it's sick. But not like sick bro, more like ew I feel sick I need a bucket.\n\nAnd I can hear you say \"it's a romantic COMEDY, it's a joke. Don't get so triggered ladida...\"\n\nBut ask yourself... what is at the core of this 'romance'? Is it their chemistry? Because there is none, its not real, he just learned like a feggin m@niac every single fact about her. What does she even know about him?\n\nAnd what exactly is comedic about suggesting seggsual acts with a new coworker, several times if in the end the exact thing that breaks the curse is being in bed with said coworker?\n\nSeriously, this sshh is straight up horror, psychological thriller if you know what manipulation and st@lking is, and it's just not funny. It's scary and (yes im going to say it) triggering.\n\nNOT A FAMILY MOVIE AT ALL. Why would you show your kids a movie about a rude man secretly lying to a woman to get her to like him?\n\nThe best parts of this movie was when he was trying to unalive himself in different ways (and punching Ned in the face and the diner scene with the Heimlich hold.)\n\nin short: Bad and lazy writing.

On the other hand Andy's angelic, curly haired, innocent face opposes this brut.\n\nI think one of the smartest ideas is that the setting is pure and simple: it could be anywhere BUT nowhere important. Of course, it is important for our character to get stuck in the middle of nowhere - as of course it wouldn't come as a curse to spend every day on a nice island or a big city. Here monotomy hits us hard. And here comes the maturity: people in their 30s, 40s can easily get the metaphor: that 'every day looks the same'. We work, sleep, eat, .... and what else? Something is missing, right? It takes an eternity to realize that there are more important things, human relations, remembering who we are, what makes us happy - and the full capacity of love. This deeper message is nicely wrapped in a funny storytelling, and even more hilarious actions. I don't think we have to simplify it for a \"bad\" man becoming \"good\", more virtous, but rather waking up from his own 'groundhog' sleep, a sleep in which he has been spending most of his life....\n\nHave fun, and don't be afraid of your own shadow:)"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Groundhog Day\" is a satisfying comedy marked by some whimsy and an unexpected and sweet romance. Bill Murray doesn't stretch much playing a nasty, uncouth TV weatherman, unhappily covering Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who is forced by fate into reliving the same 24hr day over and over until he becomes a better person. As written by Harold Ramis (who also directed) and Danny Rubin from Rubin's original treatment, the film is surprisingly inventive considering it has to face a fatigued sort of repetition. The colorful, uniformly excellent supporting cast is a big help to Murray, who doesn't go through as many changes as one might hope (he stays pretty much the same until the picture's third act). Ramis keeps a breezy, effortless pace--and he knows how to touch our hearts without getting maudlin (no small feat). Fresh-faced Andie MacDowell once again provides us with a delightful love-interest, playing the woman Murray intends to win if only he can modify his bad manners. Cantankerous leading characters can sometimes be a drag on the screen, even if their slow-building rehabilitation is done with a gentle touch; here, Ramis and Rubin team with their star to create an irritable, grouchy human being and manage to make him both funny and endearing. *** from ****"

Undoubtedly, you will then be able to grasp the beauty that lies within (after repeated viewings, of course-not because they are required, but because you will want to). This movie is so well-made on many levels. If you're feeling down, this movie will cheer you up and probably change your outlook on life. I have seen this movie many times and I know it will be seen many more. It is that special. I am obsessed, as I'm sure there are many more that feel the way I do. Maybe you will be to. I tell everybody I know about this movie, and every one of them praised me for it. I've read all the reviews, plus I frequently read the IMDb message board for this movie. It kind of reassures me, I'm not the only one who \"gets\" it. Pass it along! Plus, this is definitely worth mentioning-if they were ever allowed to give retro Academy Awards, Bill Murray, as well as the movie itself, would easily walk away with the honor. The Academy people didn't really \"get it\" back then."

        "review_detailed_main": "Groundhog Day was a Harold Ramis-Danny Green script that Ramis ingeniously shot in a freezing Woodstock, IL for a 1993 release. All the film critics at the time noted it as a cute romantic comedy with no particular accomplishment. Everyone I know who has seen it, myself included, liked it and smiled on their way out of the theater. Groundhog Day is on the American calendar, and the film is often played on that day in mid-winter where those of us in colder climates are dreaming of Spring. Today Groundhog Day is considered one of the great American Films of the late 20th Century. Danny Rubin created the concept while Harold Ramis, co-writer of Animal House and Caddyshack broke away from his previous gross-comedy productions to direct his Opus Maximus. That's how Jonah Goldberg of the National Review described it in the February 2005 issue of the Conservative magazine.\n\nI read the 2003 New Yorker piece about Ramis. He's Chicago born Jew with no religious training. He is a Hollywood director, actor, and comedy scriptwriter presently studying Buddhism with his second wife. I don't know anything about Danny Rubin other than his version of the script had Andi MacDowell also reliving Groundhog Day along with Murray's Phil, the slimy weatherman for a Pittsburgh TV station. Ramis made the necessary changes and the rest is possibly the greatest non-secular religious experience in American Cinema. The fact that Rabbi's, Ministers, and Priests are showing this film to their parishioners all over the world is a testament to the film's masterful Aristotelian philosophy of redemption and rebirth.\n\nThere are so many classic comedy bits, lines to remember, and moments of hilarity for a short review but often overlooked is the theme of rescue through learning. Adults are cursed to make the same mistakes over and over again. Every Freudian shrink has heard his patient's repetition of behavior. Every man is trapped by his wiring. Then, sometimes, maybe because of a catastrophic event, a religious insight, or an intelligent evaluation, there is an epiphany. We can't be sure how the application of intelligence, talent, or luck can establish great work, but we must appreciate it when we see it and be the Groundhog."

        "review_detailed_main": "Only with the passage of time and an increased sense of awareness can I now see a remarkable movie like \"Groundhog Day\" for what it is. The last time I watched it, and that was some time ago, I mostly saw an engaging comedy / drama / fantasy with moments both funny and sobering. Now, I can look at it and see what a thoughtful piece of work it is. It is true that it's the kind of movie that really does benefit from repeat viewings.\n\nBill Murray makes the most of a weighty role as Phil Connors, egocentric, wise ass weatherman who travels to the Pennsylvania community of Punsxutawney to cover its annual Groundhog Day ceremony. A blizzard confines him to the town - a blizzard he failed to predict accurately - and while there he realizes he's trapped in a time loop; Groundhog Day repeats itself over and over, to the point where Phil becomes aware of practically every event that will occur. By turns, Phil is both ecstatic - if there's no tomorrow, he doesn't have to worry about the consequences of his actions, and he engages in some great comic bits of recklessness - and despondent, when his attempts to use his knowledge for self gain go awry. Only after some efforts to come to grips with the course of events does he realize the power of any human being's thoughts and actions, as he has the ability to be there for other people and even save their lives.\n\nMurray is great, whether he's being introspective, rascally / charming, or saddened. Andie MacDowell provides an appealing love interest as Rita, the terminally chipper producer to whom he realizes he's becoming attracted. A supporting cast of familiar faces also helps: Chris Elliott as the cameraman, Stephen Tobolowsky (in his best known role) as aggressive insurance salesman Ned Ryerson, Bill's older brother Brian Doyle- Murray as \"groundhog honcho\" Buster Green, comedians Rick Ducommun and Rick Overton as scruffy locals, Robin Duke as the diner waitress, and, in his film debut, a young Michael Shannon as a guy getting married.\n\nDirector / co-writer Harold Ramis, making a cameo as a local neurologist, keeps things headed in clever directions (it's a delicious bit of dark comedy when Phil tries various means of suicide in his attempts to end the cycle), always successfully alternating between the laughs and the more touching elements. In fact, \"Groundhog Day\" is simply very sweet as Phil develops more of an interest in an old homeless man's welfare and becomes increasingly attached to Rita. And George Fenton's music always hits just the right notes for any given scene. In short, it's one of the star's best ever vehicles and a consistently entertaining movie worth revisiting.\n\n10 out of 10."

Phil has so much to learn and takes a long time to learn it, but what he learns is so encouraging and humanistic. He learns that by developing his artistic side he will learn to love and be loved. He learns to sculpt and play the piano beautifully. And, it seems to me, finally, that he chooses to do it for the right reasons: the pure joy of expression, the pleasure of bringing beauty and truth to the world. My wife asked me in wonder how I could love this flick so much; it's so unrealistic. But, ah, the theme is so strong that I want to suspend my disbelief. It functions ultimately as an allegory. We must all learn to try to forget ourselves and concentrate on the moment, live each day not as if it will be our last, but as though it will be our only day! When we learn that lesson, then we can begin to live again..."

Is he too far gone to change? The movie's equal parts amusing and profound. The theme revolves around getting stuck in a rut in life and desperately trying to find the way OUT. Meanwhile the woodchuck is cute.\n\nBeyond MacDowell on the female front, Marita Geraghty plays a potential date for Murray's character; you might remember her from the Seinfeld episode \"The Big Salad\" as Margaret. But it's the stunning Sandy Maschmeyer as his 'French Maid' date at the theater that steals the show in a brief scene.\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in Woodstock, Illinois, which is just northwest of Chicago, and points nearby: Algonquin (opening scene), Rockford (quarry), Waukegan and Cary (interiors). Some stuff was done in the backlot of Universal Studios, along with establishing shots of Pittsburgh.\n\nGRADE: B-"

Perhaps that style of humour was all the rage in 1993 but it didn't do the job for me.\n\nThe best thing about this film is the underlying concept. It's great and has spawned a whole new genre of time-loop films (all of the ones I can think of are far superior to Groundhog Day in truth). They did manage to extract some decent comedic and dramatic potential out of the scenario, and I did enjoy the final 20 minutes or so.\n\nOn the whole this film is fine, but is perhaps in with a shout as one of the most overrated films going."

        "review_detailed_main": "Why Connors is forced to relive the same day isn't explained, but it is made clear that Connors was trapped in a cycle of repetition even before his never-ending day began. Projecting nothing but facile sarcasm, ironic self-awareness and aloof detachment, Connors is a thoroughly postmodern man, his life long filled with what he perceives to be pointless and mindless routine. But Connors is not a pessimist or self-centred, so much as he is super-aware, perpetually dejected and world-weary. For Connors, every day offers only what philosopher Francois Cusset called the \"dead end of postmodernity\". Enchantment is thoroughly dead and everything that will happen has already happened.\n\nWhen Connors wakes up to find that today is, and always will be, yesterday, he is forced into violently confronting the fact that postmodernism conceives of contemporary life as a spectacle before which the individual always sits powerless, and within which questions of the real are always problematized. To the postmodern subject, there is nowhere else, no other time or place, the subject a ghost-viewer in a movie that plays regardless of his volition.\n\nAt first Connors uses this opportunity to engage in pranks, hedonism and deceit, concocting schemes to amass money and bed a beautiful woman, played by Andie McDowell, but gradually these games start to lose their appeal. After learning that all the material and sexual gratifications in the world are not spiritually sustaining, Connors grows suicidal. He takes his life several times, but still the curse continues.\n\nFrom here on the plot becomes a mixture of the myth of Sisyphus and Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" (Bill Murray is essentially Ebenezer Scrooge), with a little Camus and Nietczhe thrown in. The film's existential avenues are best hinted at by a poem (The Lay of the Last Minstrel) by Sir Walter Scott, an excerpt of which Andie McDowell recites to Connors in a diner: \"Despite those titles, power, and pelf, The wretch, concentrated all in self, Living shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down, To the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Groundhog Day is a perfect movie to watch during a rainy evening, while sitting on a cozy couch, covered with a warm blanket, and with a bag of popcorn in hand. It's a well-structured comedy offering many laughs, with a decent plot, which doesn't necessarily involve a lot of thinking.\n\nPhil (Bill Murray), a tired and self-centered weatherman, goes on a trip to Punxsutawney (fancy name I must say), Pennsylvania, in order to cover a story of the infamous Groundhog Day celebrations that take place there every year. Along with him come an irritated cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and a pretty newbie producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). It seems like it will be just another one-day excursion, just to inform people about another useless festivities that involve a groundhog predicting the coming of spring. However, due to horrible weather conditions the trio has to settle down in the city for another night. And then the strangest thing happens. Phil wakes up to the same radio announcements; sees exactly the same view outside his window; gets the same greetings from a hotel lady. And soon discovers that Groundhog Day is going to take place all over again, and again, and again\u0085\n\nSo why not take advantage of this bizarre situation? At first, he attempts to live his life to the fullest, letting go of all the greed, selfish desires, and sexual temptations. By spending this one particular day anew he gets to know every single person in this small town, and is able to profit from all the information acquired. He also tries to get closer to Rita but fails miserably. That's phase one.\n\nIn phase two, Phil realizes (after falling off a cliff in a car) that he became immortal somehow and won't die. So he tries to commit suicide in every possible way and still wakes up at 6 a.m. in the same bed listening to a song by Sonny & Cher. He starts to feel miserable and tired of all the mess that he's in.\n\nAnd then comes phase three. He once again wants to seduce Rita. He gets to know her better day after day, in order to finally be able to sleep with her. However, as convincing as he may be, she still rejects him after all. The ultimate way to make her fall in love with him is through good deeds. After all that time he understands that by being altruistic and helpful towards other people goes a road to a woman's heart.\n\nThe main quality of the movie is contained in its ability to show mostly the same sequences all over again (well, that's what it's all about), but do it in such a manner that isn't boring or dull. Even though it's the same day, the events, actions, and people that the viewer sees are different or presented in an alternative manner.\n\nThis is probably one of Bill Murray's funniest roles. I always admired his passion for acting, and in Groundhog Day he is convincing enough to say that he might as well play in joyful comedies, as in respectable dramas. His performance makes the movie much more pleasurable, as we are able to look at the transformation of his character and the gradual changes that he goes through from point A (destroy, burn, steal) to point B (love, care, understand).\n\nAll in all, I won't say that Groundhog Day is my favorite comedy, but it definitely showed me that even some light-hearted comedies are able to pass a meaningful message to the world, and at the same time, make you laugh at the ridiculousness of their storyline."

But I gave it another watch and my opinion of it has greatly improved. It's a very charming comedy, with an irresistible premise, topped off by a fine performance from Bill Murray. Murray plays Phil Connors, an arrogant, sarcastic weatherman who begrudgingly travels to the town of Punxsutawney in Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day, where the locals gather to watch the unveiling of a hog and to find out if it'll be a long winter or an early spring. Phil is joined by his producer Rita and cameraman Larry. Just before they leave town, a blizzard cuts off the roads and they have to stay in the town another night. The next morning, Phil wakes up to the exact same day again, and when he realises that he is stuck in a loop, possibly condemned to live the same day forever, he starts to make it work for him, by doing crazy things and trying to make Rita fall in love with him. A film with a premise like this has an unlimited pool of ideas and possibilities to play out, which is certainly the appeal, and I think director Harold Ramis and writer Danny Rubin did a good job with what directions they chose Phil to take."

        "review_detailed_main": "I only saw this movie once with my parents on Groundhogs Day, 2013. I didn't even know what the movie was about, not even knowing that the plot would be about a day repeating itself over and over. So, yeah while only seeing this movie one time, the plot is memorable along with the messages from the movie. To me personally, I can't think of any movie that has ever left me with a more positive message than this movie. Most movies will try to leave you with a good life message, but this movie has a very powerful message. Let's think about this movie in perspective trying not to use any spoilers. Well, Groundhog's Day is a holiday and one of the smaller holidays, a holiday most of us probably don't think much about except on February 2nd. It's not like Halloween which is coming up where we're already seeing decorations and costumes out, or Christmas where in 2 months we will see a lot of Christmas decorations along with hearing Christmas music on many radio stations. Groundhog's Day is mostly like a regular day where school doesn't get canceled or anything, and we find out on the news depending on if the Groundhog sees his shadow if we will have an early Spring or 6 more weeks of winter. In this movie, a weatherman known as Phil played by Bill Murray goes with his team to a certain town in Pennsylvania to do a report on the annual Groundhog's Day ceremony. After Phil stays with his team there another night because of a snowstorm, he notices he wakes up not to the next day, but the previous day Groundhog's Day, and the same thing seems to happen over and over and no matter how Phil spends his day, it just seems to continually repeat itself. Nobody else is aware of this time loop and it seems like everything goes the same way with the rest of the community during the day, only Phil can change the events happening by anticipating what is going to happen. So, basically the message this movie has taught me, is how we have everyday a period of 24 hours and we are the ones who decide how to spend the time each day. Most of the things we do each day are probably based on routine and habit, which is a good reason to get into good habits making somethings more natural to us. Obviously, we have countless opportunities of what we can do every single day with our time. Interestingly, we often times look back and are amazed at all the time that has passed from memorable moments, thinking the time flies. However, this movie shows how we spend are time in a single day and what we can do with all those opportunities, doing different things if a day keeps repeating itself, and getting different things from what we choose to do, like Phil chose to learn how to play the piano and get to know the community. So, basically each day is an opportunity in our life to do something, even things we've never done before. I personally am amazed at all we can do in a single day. I thought about that when I ran Cross Country in College, some days we would run 10 miles on scenic routes in the middle of nowhere on a day where we had classes, and a school night. We'd get back in time for dinner and to do homework. It was interesting to see myself in places I'm normally at on vacations in just an afternoon during a Cross Country practice along with getting good exercise and seeing the beautiful world. So, we might not be able to see the end from the beginning like Murray could. But, often times we don't take chances in life and miss out on opportunities we have because we are too afraid and don't try and unlike Phil some of those opportunities we have now, never come back. It's up to us to do what we can as I read earlier today on the internet, \"If You Think Adventure Is Dangerous, Try Routine It's Lethal.\" The plot of a time loop has also been a plot in other movies like one more recently with Zachary Gordon, \"Pete's Christmas,\" which wasn't nearly as good as this is. But, we just need to think about how we spend are time and what we do, and we will get results. Some of those results will last a lifetime. I'd give this movie a 10/10. While it's not one of my favorite movies, not like one I'd care to own. I give it a 10/10 because of the positive message it leaves us with."

It is somehow like the movie \"Edge of Tomorrow \" that the leading character experience the same day again and again. But the differences between these two fantasy movies is that in Groundhog Day, the only way to get out of the infinite cycle is to change person's attitude towards life, which makes this movie not a simple comedy, but a terrific movie with full philosophy on life.\n\nOften we hear the adage, \"It is just a film\". Well, but what if we truly face the similar predicament?Assuming that we all have to suffer the same day like Phil and whatever we did today would leave no impact on others tomorrow and what makes you awake everyday is a song saying I got you Babe , maybe most of us would react to this crazy predicament passively and madly like what Phil did at first, giving everything up as despair. But when we reflect the situation more calmly,we might live a totally different lives. Just as the Phil did in the movie,he took up piano, began reading, learned to ice-sculpt.Everything seems better than before\n\nThere are many truth conveyed in this movie, and I do appreciate such a ingenious movie. It reminds me how happy we are as we have such a bright future, in which we can achieve any marvel as long as we make efforts to it."

        "review_title": "A spiritual and philosophical film that also happens to be quite entertaining.",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?\" \"That about sums it up for me.\"\n\nThere are films that don't necessarily need inventive and artistic camera shots, or groundbreaking special effects, or even gorgeous cinematography to be considered masterpieces. Sometimes a film like Groundhog Day comes along with a smart and charming story with performances and characters that are so well developed that it automatically connects with audiences by reaching for the heart, and turning it into an instant classic. With a premise that might seem boring due to the fact that the lead character has to repeat and live the same day over and over again in a small Pennsylvania town, director Harold Ramis manages to catch our attention by creating interesting characters and through a witty script he introduces important themes such as existentialism in a rather refreshing and light way. It is a very spiritual film without ever feeling religious. In a way the story reminded me of Dickens' A Christmas Story where you have an egocentric and arrogant character who is transformed once he experiences a supernatural event. In Groundhog Day the transformation is much more subtle while at times it does go to dark places. Ironically Bill Murray went on to play Scrooge in one of the many adaptations of Dickens' classic tale. Murray is the heart and soul of this film and although he is hard to like at the beginning of the film there is something about his performance that keeps us interested in him. This isn't one of those laugh out loud comedies (I don't think I laughed at a single scene), but it is so charming that it is impossible to resist and it leaves you with a smile on your face during its entire running time. Once it ends we realize how philosophical this film really was, but Ramis kept us so entertained that we didn't really pick up on it until the very end.\n\nThe original screenplay for Groundhog Day was co-written by Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin. It centers on a weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) working as a TV meteorologist for a local Pittsburgh station. Phil is an arrogant narcissist who is expecting to work for a more important broadcasting channel soon. On the eve of Groundhog Day, he is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney to cover the annual festivities along with his producer, Rita (Andie MacDowell), and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) with whom he doesn't get along very well. Phil hates this assignment which he has covered over the past four years so he doesn't put much effort into his report. After covering the event an unexpected blizzard forces the roads to close so Phil and his crew are stuck in Punxsutawney for another day. The next day Phil wakes up and realizes he has to relive Groundhog Day all over again and he's the only one that notices that the day unfolds in the exact same way. Everyone else seems to be living the day for the first time, but he finds himself stuck in the same day over and over again like if he were trapped in a loop hole with no way out.\n\nThe premise seemed boring for me at first considering I thought it was going to repeat itself too many times, but Murray's character is so fun and he relives each day in so many different ways that it managed to keep me entertained. At first Phil feels like he has gone mad and tries to rationalize things, but once he realizes his fate he decides to take advantage of it. Being the self centered person he is, Phil lives knowing he wont have to suffer any consequences, but eventually he grows tired of this hedonistic lifestyle. He feels so desperate that he tries to commit suicide in every possible way, but no matter what he does he still wakes up the next morning reliving Groundhog Day. Eventually Phil gives up on living for himself and begins looking at others and caring for them. He begins to find purpose and joy in life in helping others. Ramis has made a deeply spiritual and philosophical film without the audience realizing it at first. It could have become tedious and preachy, but it never does because the characters are subtly transformed and the growing chemistry between Phil and Rita is believable. Ramis found a way to reach out to our hearts and remind us that life isn't about living for ourselves, but finding pleasure in helping and caring for others. Groundhog Day is a movie about self- improvement and becoming a better person and I can't think of a better actor to have pulled it off so well as Bill Murray did in his transformation here."

Was it written by Harold Ramis and George Fenton, or was it written by a crew of TV writers who created the movie film, 12:01? The jury is still out on that conclusion. If you see this film and then see 12:01, you will see much more than a mere coincidence; you will see someone stealing someone else's intellectual property. Both scripts were written in the SAME year, 1993. That is way too much of a coincidence. Somebody copied somebody. I wonder who copied whom?\n\nAs far as this film is concerned, it is strictly for laughs; 12:01 had some serious dramatic moments as well. This version does not. Did 12:01 add the dramatic elements, or did Groundhog Day copy 12:01 and decided to leave dramatic elements out? One can only speculate.\n\nBill Murray is very funny in this film; it is one of his best. He plays a man who relives the same day over and over (ala 12:01). See both films and decide for yourself. If you find out who copied whom, let me know online."

        "review_detailed_main": "As I'm writing this review, the day is groundhog day! As you may know, this is the time of the year when the groundhog comes out of a tree and tells whether it will cold or warm for the next 6 weeks. This movie is about two things: the holiday itself and the feeling of Deja vu (when you feel like you already experienced something before) The main character is Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who is a skeptic weatherman that had to do a news report in a small town about groundhog day. After a dreadful day for Phil ends, he wakes up and it's Groundhog day, again! He meets the homeless man and his ex classmate Ned Ryason again, hears the exact same song on radio and answers to the same questions that he already talked about yesterday. And it goes again and again. However, Phil comes up with lot's of ideas to make each day feel distinct, both in a good and a bad way. One time he stole a car and got hit by train, one time he tried to date pretty women, later he would eat lots of sugar, and then later, he would try to escape from this cursed town in many ways. There's also Rita (Andie Macdowell) who is the reason why Phil became nicer throughout the movie. Thanks to her, he learned how to play the piano and began to read French literature. Not only that, he also spent dates with Rita, playing in the snow and building snowmen. I honestly liked the chemistry between the two, which remind me of Beauty and the beast or Megamind and Roxanne Richi or even Hal and Rosemary from shallow Hal, because of the whole \"if you meet the right person, you will become a better one yourself\", which is actually a true statement in my opinion. Since it's also a comedy, it definitely has it's fair share of funny scenes: for example when Phil and the groundhog were riding a car away from the police. Or when Phil tried to convince Rita that he's a god, but not the God, because no matter what he tries, even his attempts at dying, he always comes back to February second. I won't say it's laugh out loud, since it's a more chill kind of a movie unlike What happens in Vegas or Beethoven where it's mostly humour (but has heart too), but it does give some positive moments to make sure that at least smiled. The moral is great too, to always be nice to people and try to do something new every day to make each one special.\n\nThe acting from Murray and MacDowell is great in my opinion. Both act so well that you would believe that they just live like they are a part of the story, which is awesome! Definitely a classic movie in my eyes. The only issues were that the beginning was a little bit slow and boring in my opinion, but at least it gives the exposition of this town and how the plot will go on. Another bad thing is that there's actually a worse version of this movie in my opinion called \"Edge of tomorrow\", which is basically the same movie but in an alien war setting and with Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. So my recommendation is to only watch the true original groundhog day movie, which is this one, however, if your curious enough to watch and compare both films, then I guess I won't stop you from doing it. After all, there's a chance that you may enjoy the other movie. But as for this one, I recommend it just to know what the term means and how is it so popular in our culture."

Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness.\n\nNot many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again"

        "review_detailed_main": "The human condition is to love everything unconditionally. I belive 'Groundhog Day' explores that happiness depends on our capacity to love. There's a spectrum of beauty, and it is effortless to see the beauty at a museum or watch a sunset, but can you see the beauty of everyday life of the most mundane ugly things. To live the greatest life possible is just none other than to see beauty everywhere. Love is a universal property, it's fundamental. It's not a sexual attraction or a romance, therefore, Unconditional love is the absolute acceptance of everything even the bad things. The reason that the universe could say has love is because the universe accepts itself completely without judgement. It's not resisting any part of itself, it loves every piece of itself. It's a love so deep that you can't even imagine what evil is because you love everything so much that there's no more room left for evil to exist. Love is the ability to be conscious of the beauty of creation. This great movie makes me realise the beauty of creation."

This is also a tailor made film for Bill, he absolutely kills it. This will be shown on AMC in the not to very future on repeat, as it should.

It should.\n\nIt has absolutely everything a great comedy should have.\n\nFirst, it's funny. Bill Murray is the master of comic insincerity and he plays it to the hilt in this movie. He is a weatherman who is to Ground Hog Day as Ebenezer Scrooge is to Christmas. Fate gets fed up with his attitude and forces him to relive that day until he gets it right.\n\nSecond, it's deep. He doesn't get it right the first time, or perhaps for years. He does what any human would do in the situation. Early on, he uses his knowledge of that day to play God. Then, he uses it to have fun and get women. Then, he is filled with despair and tries to end it with his own death. Then, after trying every crass and immature thing he can think of, he finally realizes that he can actually enjoy his fate if he is reliving a great day, so he makes it so. He makes himself a better person, but the transformation happens only after many missteps ... exactly what would happen to anybody really caught in the situation.\n\nHow many comedies do you know in which the lead character quotes Chekhov and recites French poetry? Both to good effect (One sincere and touching, the other insincere beyond my ability to describe.)\n\nMurray is terrific, as is Andie MacDowell. The supporting players are all spot-on.\n\nIt's just a terrific comedy. It should have won a whole bunch of awards. Why it did not is a mystery."

At first, he makes a game of it, then he tries killing himself, and finally comes around to realizing he's been given a second chance. You've seen the plot before, but never so well done. Andie MacDowell, also in her prime, costars as Murray's love interest. The writer (Dan Rubin) and director (longtime Murray cohort and GHOSTBUSTERS costar Harold Ramis) really outdo themselves with this clever film. This is the first film I have ever given a 10 to.

From his behaviour (the tradition believes) it can be predicted if the spring is coming soon or the winter will last for some time.\n\nTV weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) has to report about this tradition from the center of Groundhogday, Punxsutawny (Pennsylvania). He can only look at this (in his eyes stupid) tradition and the people who celebrate it with the deepest contempt. After his report hoewever something strange happens. The next morning it is february 2 again. He is forced to relive this day again and again and again.\n\nTime loops are full of logical paradoxes that films are eager to exploit. Think of a film such as \"Back to the future\" (1985, Robert Zemeckis). Also \"Groundhog day\" has its fair share of these paradoxes.\n\nThe real strength of this film is however in my opinion not to be found in these quirks, but in the way routine (because that's were the ever repeating february 2 stands for of course) teaches Phil a leason. In the film Phil goes through different phases: surprise, opportunism, despair and ultimately acceptance. Only when he finally reaches the accepatance phase, he no longer looks down on the people of Punxsutawny and can escape to february 3.\n\nAlso in \"Lost in translation\" (2003, Sofia Coppola) Bill Murray plays a chracter that evolves from arrogant to sympathetic."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Groundhog Day\" is a timeless classic that transcends genres, blending comedy, romance, and philosophical depth into a captivating and thought-provoking narrative. Directed by Harold Ramis and released in 1993, this film has become a cultural phenomenon, celebrated for its ingenious premise, brilliant performances, and profound exploration of personal growth. With its perfect blend of humor and introspection, \"Groundhog Day\" remains a beloved and enduring gem in the world of cinema.\n\nPlot Overview: The film follows Phil Connors (Bill Murray), a cynical and self-centered weatherman who finds himself trapped in an inexplicable time loop, reliving the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again. As Phil becomes increasingly frustrated with his predicament, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery and transformation. Through countless repetitions of the day, he begins to reassess his priorities, learn new skills, and find meaning in even the smallest moments. Along the way, he develops an unexpected connection with Rita (Andie MacDowell), his producer, and starts to unravel the mysteries of love, compassion, and true happiness.\n\nReview: \"Groundhog Day\" is a masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together comedy, romance, and philosophical themes, creating a profound and entertaining cinematic experience. At its core, the film explores the power of redemption and the potential for personal growth, wrapped in a clever and imaginative time-loop narrative.\n\nBill Murray delivers a career-defining performance as Phil Connors, effortlessly portraying the character's transition from an arrogant and jaded individual to a more compassionate and self-aware person. Murray's impeccable comedic timing and nuanced acting make Phil's journey both hilarious and deeply moving. His interactions with the ensemble cast, including Andie MacDowell as the kind-hearted Rita and Chris Elliott as Phil's quirky cameraman, enhance the film's humor and emotional depth.\n\nHarold Ramis's direction is masterful, striking a delicate balance between humor and introspection. He skillfully uses repetition to create comedic moments and explores the existential questions raised by Phil's predicament. The screenplay, written by Ramis and Danny Rubin, cleverly blends comedy with philosophical musings, inviting the audience to reflect on the nature of time, the pursuit of happiness, and the importance of personal growth. The film's pacing is spot-on, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in Phil's journey and appreciate the subtle changes that occur as he relives Groundhog Day.\n\nThe film's setting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, adds to its charm and whimsy. The quaint small-town atmosphere, combined with the annual Groundhog Day festivities, creates a unique backdrop for Phil's time-loop experience. The cinematography beautifully captures the picturesque winter landscape, further enhancing the film's visual appeal.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to resonate with audiences on a deeper level. Beneath the comedy and romance, \"Groundhog Day\" carries profound messages about self-reflection, empathy, and the transformative power of love. It encourages viewers to examine their own lives and consider the impact of their actions on others. The film's enduring popularity can be attributed to its universal themes and the sense of hope it instills, reminding us that personal change and growth are always within reach.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Groundhog Day\" is a timeless classic that blends comedy."

The movie is so simple yet so genuinely funny especially when Murray tries to score some girls.This Film makes you wonder why there aren't movies like this anymore.

        "review_detailed_main": "While I had always been aware of this film's considerable reputation, it took me this long to get acquainted with it; in retrospect, I feel the picture to be deserving of the epithet \"modern comedy classic\". It deals with an original \u2013 and for the genre, singular \u2013 concept: a literal case of multiple deja'-vu experiences (in all fairness, the minor sci-fi entry THE TIME TRAVELERS [1964] had already delved into the theme, though obviously lacking the skill and polish realized here). Bill Murray tackles one of his best roles, actually a variation on the actor's own characterization in the much inferior SCROOGED (1988), which I watched only last week; now he is an arrogant (can he play any other way?) Weather Man assigned to the unexciting titular event in Pennsylvania \u2013 eager to get out of there, he not only finds the passage blocked by a snowstorm but, by some unexplained quirk of nature, finds himself reliving the same day over and over again! At first, he is understandably baffled and frustrated by all of this \u2013 especially in the face of the obliviousness to his predicament shown by colleagues and townspeople alike; then, he is amused by the sheer predictability of the day's proceedings; gradually, however, he learns to take advantage of this state-of-affairs \u2013 not only involving himself in the everyday life of the town, but also striving to better himself (such as becoming an accomplishment piano-player or a hand-craft artisan seemingly in the space of single day); most of all, however, he works at cultivating a loving relationship with Andie McDowell, the producer of his TV program who, normally, cannot stand him! Apparently, Murray and director Ramis (co-stars in STRIPES [1981], another recent viewing, and the GHOSTBUSTERS films) fell out during the making of this one because they had contrasting opinions about the prevailing tone of the script: Murray wanted it to be of a more philosophical bent, while Ramis thought better of extracting the comic potential out of the central situation; in the end, I feel the film strikes a good balance between the two (with plenty of visual gags and assorted mayhem but, at the same time, having a definite bittersweet side to it \u2013 in view of the above-mentioned budding romance and also Murray's numerous failed suicides!)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Groundhog Day has a great deal of potential, but ultimately fails to live up to its promise. It isn't the concept that falls short; on the contrary, the plot is entertainingly original. Self-centred reporter Phil Connors aims to leave Pennsylvanian backwater Punxsutawney as soon as possible after completing a story on the annual Groundhog Day Festival, but his plans are thwarted when he wakes the following morning and discovers that it's Groundhog Day again. . . . . . . . . . and again. . . . . . . . . Initially he sees this turn of events as akin to a nightmare, but soon realises that if there's no tomorrow, there are no hangovers and no consequences. . . . .. . . . .\n\nA storyline like this is very amusing per se, and there are some deft touches - such as Phil's audacious money-van heist, which succeeds simply because after innumerable Groundhog Days in succession, he knows Punxsutawney's routines so well. Due to the inherent comedy Bill Murray's wisecracking attempts as Phil are unnecessary, they don't fit well with his character, and frankly someone making a face like a groundhog isn't that funny the first time, let alone meriting repetition.\n\nAlthough this is a comedy there are some genuinely thought-provoking issues raised - Phil learns (and through him we realise) that spontaneity can never be choreographed, and an impulsive moment's beauty lies in the fact that it 'just happens'. The film's biggest downfall is its predictability. Despite the various entertaining shenanigans en route, we just know that in the end Phil will have learned some Valuable Lessons and become a Nice Guy.\n\nOverall though, Groundhog Day is a likeable movie, and would leave the viewer with a much greater sense of satisfaction had it - instead of showing the happy couple running hand-in-hand through the freshly fallen snow - used a less trite finale."

        "review_detailed_main": "1993 was a wonderful movie year. 2 movie masterpieces stand out today from it; \"Schindler's list\" and \"Groundhog day\". Personally, I always loved the second one more. \"Groundhog day\" is a perfect example why Bill Murray will always be a superior actor than the Oscar darlings Tom Hanks and Spencer Tracy. He plays Phil whom thanks to a time distortion ( a day repeating itself again and again ) gets away with stealing money, committing suicide 20 times, sleeping with local girls without consequences and finding out everyones deepest secrets.\n\nThe story is so subtle that you may at first think its just a comedy. But once you think about it, you will realize how almost every problem from life is contained in it. Most noticeable, the one about how people will make the same mistakes again and again, until they change. And that's what's all about: change. Once when Phil changes himself, the world changes finally too. He is a grown man, but childish in his persona. That's why thanks to the time distortion he ages psychologically, until he finally becomes a real man, not a spoiled kid. This is an extreme satire about life. Think about it. Its about the imprisoned human spirit crying for a change, a difference. Phil became an individual, the only person on Earth that has self-consciousness. At that moment all other characters just became puppets. You can also regard it as a parody of Totalitarian regimes ( Phil is the only person that does something different than the others, and that's why he is misunderstood ). Plus the explanation for the mysterious time distortion is never given. It's shown more like something as natural as the weather, something that just happened.\n\n--------------\n\nThe only great film the director Harold Ramis ever made, \"Groundhog day\" was until recently the highest marked Murray film on the site rotten-tomatoes.com with extremely high average grade of 8.1/10. \"Lost in translation\" beat it, with 8.4/10, but quite frankly, it was overrated. If there was any justice, \"Groundhog day\" should have won Oscars and Golden Globes for the best picture, script and the main actor. But alas, since Murray was underrated for so long, its finally time he gets overrated for once!\n\nYou just have to love him when he is in the studio doing a weather forecast: \"In California there is going to be a big heat tomorrow, and gang fights and too high real estate prizes too. Oh, what's this? A cold front is coming up! Fuuuu( blows the clouds on the screen).\" The only flaw is that some better director could have directed it more radical and extreme than Ramis, but if we love Frank Capra, we must love this symbolic story about the triumph of emotions over cold cynicism.\n\nGrade: 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's not common that a film involving the surreal or supernatural - especially time travel - is so successful. I think the reason for this is that once you enter that realm, literally anything goes. That concept may seem exciting at first, but in practice it can become so illogical and have so little basis in reality that ultimately we can't relate to it. Consider how silly time travel can become. For example, in \"Back to the Future\", looking at a photograph and seeing the people in it start to fade?? C'mon. Or dealing with \"paradoxes\" such as going back in time and killing your grandfather. What now?\n\nNot trying to explain how time travel occurs, this movie skirts those issues by simply backing up and reliving a day (there is no chance to \"travel back to the future\" - you must \"live through it\".) One of the reasons it is so successful is that while ultimately a happy movie, the truly horrible feelings that would inevitably arise in this situation are also explored. Finally living through his day to the next day is a metaphor in this case for the maturing of the main character. He does not know what is happening to him, but in the end he has been allowed a period of experimentation and growth. Haven't we all fantasised about that? For example, having 10 fresh chances to approach a person of the opposite sex we want to meet and seeing which works best? In the meantime the film explores this journey with both humour and sorrow. Having 10 fresh chances to try something sounds great if it's your *choice* - but not so great if you never get to stop the carousel and say \"That's a keeper - let's get on with my life now!\" Few actors other than Murray could play this role so well - he seems perfectly cast. Enjoy!"

The idea of someone living the same day over and over again, until he finally gets it right, is absolutely ingenious. The transformation of this character in the process is a revelation and a joy to watch. \"Groundhog Day\" is truly sublime, one of the best motion picture comedies ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's really not a lot you can say about Groundhog Day that hasn't been said before. It's unlikely that anyone remotely interested in Bill Murray would have not seen it by now, and in all likelihood loves it because it's nailed on one of Murray's finest pictures. Of course, as is the case with comedy in general, there are those who don't like it, but in my experience it's the one comedy movie that tickles the funny bones of most the most! Some have seen it just the once and loved it but feel it is a once only movie, others such as myself return to it yearly like an old friend because it's a pick me up, a tonic for the troops, it never fails to deliver the goods.\n\nThat it has struck such a chord over the years is no surprise, it's a genius premise. Grumpy misanthrope TV weather man Phil Connors (Murray) is once again sent out to Punxsutawney to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. It's a place he considers as dull on earth, the festivities pointless and beneath the broadcasting talent he feels he has. The plan is to get the broadcast done and get out of Punxsutawney as quick as possible. But a snowstorm prevents him leaving and waking up the next day he finds he is stuck in the same Groundhog Day as the day before, and soon he finds that every day is the same day.\n\n\"I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster, drank pi\u00f1a coladas. At sunset, we made love like sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over, and over, and over...\"\n\nThe film then follows a trajectory that sees Connors go through a number of psychological transformations. From despair to using the situation for nefarious means, to despair again and onto using his unique situation to do good. It's material tailor made for Murray who excels with a number of running gags that get expanded upon with each day. However, the ace up Harold Ramis' (director) sleeve is that the film is more than a comedy, it is also an intelligent character study, a message movie and it also doesn't lack for dramatic purpose, often proving to be a moving experience once the tickled rib pain begins to subside. It's a picture as deep in human awareness as it is rich with comedy value.\n\nAndie MacDowell as Rita, Phil's producer and object of his lust throughout the story, proves to be surprisingly good foil for Murray's comedic ebullience. While elsewhere a number of reoccurring characters are performed memorably by the support cast (Stephen Tobolowsky and Chris Elliott standing out). Ramis keeps it brisk, never allowing the plotting to fold in on itself and the sound tracking is irritatingly catchy. But it's with the screenplay (Ramis and Danny Rubin) where ultimately Groundhog day is judged, be it the comedy or human interest, it's a zinger as written. And thankfully, with Murray at the top of his game, the brainy fun on the page is brought vividly to life on the screen. Groundhog Day, one of the finest comedies of the modern era. 10/10"

I very quickly look down on unintelligent people and I won't associate with fools. I'm pretty direct in my speech.

For example on day 1 he chats to a dude and a lady for at least 2 minutes and then meets ned. But on the third day he walks past the lady and the dude yet still meets ned at the same spot as he's crossing the street. Also on top of my dislike of the subgenre while bill Murray was pretty good I wasn't a very big fan of the character himself. 7/10."

Phil Connors, after the initial freak-out, uses his newfound eternal status to get with women, steal money, and have fun. As he evolves as a human being stuck in time, he turns his eyes toward helping others, growing as a person, and sincerely finding love. Only then is the spell broken, and the calendar turns to Feb 3rd. It is heartwarming and brilliant and more than a comedic masterpiece. It is a life lesson and if you didn't appreciate it, you need to watch it over and over again until you do. An exceptional film."

The positive message and moral are well conveyed while still keeping a lighthearted, disengaged tone.

Nevertheless this movie can still have good grip on its main concept and took it into quite a good story with nice repeated scenes. Too bad that the ending is only about love and nothing else. The acting overall is quite good for me. Bill Murray's acting is really suiting to his character's reluctance at things. Andie MacDowell did well to provide the balancing angle for the story"

        "review_detailed_main": "GROUNDHOG DAY is really a jigsaw puzzle of a film. Are we supposed to believe that somehow fate decrees that for punishment you must relive every day like the one before--if you are judged to be a rude enough person in need of redemption? A pretty shaky premise for any comedy/fantasy--and yet, the amazing thing about GROUNDHOG DAY is that it succeeds despite the flawed premise.\n\nThere are numerous twists and turns in the plot--totally unexpected and welcome--otherwise, with the story heading in the same direction day after day, things could have become pretty monotonous. That pitfall is avoided by spicing up the story with just the little differences that make for some brilliant comic touches.\n\nBILL MURRAY is quite acceptable here as the unprincipled weather man who decides to change his ways--rather improbably, I might add--and alter the course of his life. ANDIE MacDOWELL is pleasing enough as the woman he falls in love with, although never one of my favorite actresses. And others in the cast keep the comedy on a high level throughout much of the running time.\n\nSumming up: Improbable fantasy never explains why Murray suffers this strange fate--but it maintains interest and the screenplay has enough originality to keep it fresh."

        "review_detailed_main": "So after 21 years of only hearing about this movie (though when I worked at a movie theatre at the time, I did manage to watch a few scenes here and there), I finally got to see the whole thing on Netflix disc with my mom who hadn't seen this when it was first released either. She was confused part of the time but she seemed to enjoy it while I knew about the living-the-same-day-over premise the whole time. It's funny seeing Bill Murray at first taking advantage of what he can get away with in going back to what it was before and then experiencing some depression in not going forward before redeeming himself in the process. Andie MacDowell is luminous as his eventual love interest. Chris Elliott has some moments near the end. Bill's brother Brian Doyle-Murray is appropriately boisterous as the groundhog spokesman. And Stephan Tobolowsky is a hoot as this Ned fellow Bill keeps encountering. Harold Ramis did fine as director and co-writer and he provides a nice commentary track on the DVD. Since he died earlier in the year, this review is dedicated in his memory."

At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage.\n\nI wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy.\n\nYeah. I liked it.\n\nThere's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is \u2013 if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades.\n\nBut the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy.\n\nI could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride."

I found the ending somewhat unsatisfying and the movie essentially does not develop any character other than Bill Murray's. To be fair that is quite hard since they have to undo that character right at the next day, but they could at least give more depth, Murray's character is implied to know all about everything and everyone in the town by the end, it would have been nice to feel that way ourselves, but I didn't feel like I did."

The acting seemed to be half delivered. The cinematography was very basic and the soundtrack a lot of the time didn't match the scenes. I found myself watching it all only to not offend my dad. The character development of Phil (Bill Murray) was verybpredicable and the love connection seemed to forget that this was over the course of one day plus I don't think that Rita's (Andie MacDowell)character from the start was very much like what she was come the end which doesn't make sense in this particular scenario.\n\nHowever I did enjoy the insanity and suicide montage it was by far the funniest part.\n\nI have to admit though he shore did love it and his a tough critic much tougher then me so it has to still be a good film."

        "review_title": "It's Like I Said, I Love This Film; I've Seen It Over a Hundred Times",
        "review_detailed_main": "Although I haven't counted, that quotation from Phil Connors, dressed as Bronco for a screening of \"Heidi II\" at the Alpine Theater, may not be an overstatement of my adoration for \"Groundhog Day.\" Ironically, for a film about repeating the same, titular day ad infinitum, it's tantalizingly rewatchable. This goes beyond some fantastic wish fulfillment for power, immortality and perfection offered by the time loop. It's a romantic comedy that, among other things, explores the cinematic reflexivity of the time-travel movie while touching on grand philosophical and religious questions.\n\n\"What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?\"\n\nThat about sums it up for the modern rom-com, a cinematic nadir, the same formula and tropes repeated over and over again. \"Groundhog Day,\" too, follows the genre closely. It's this distinctly Hollywood fiction that director Harold Ramis turned to in altering Danny Rubin's original scenario, which began in the midst of the time loop (although that's exactly what \"Palm Springs\" (2020) did, yet it, too, remains distinctly a rom-com.) Phil falls in the mythical movie notion of love at first sight seeing Rita, the producer, playing with the weather-man stage. He, as portrayed by Bill Murray, is the typical male protagonist in these things who is supposedly, initially unlovable, to the female counterpart character in the movie that is (Rita). As for movie-goers, he may be most beloved in this initial state--disarming the spectator's hesitation in accepting the illusory fluff with his funny and knowing cynicism. It becomes safe for us to suspend our disbelief without feeling like the \"hicks\" that Phil desires celebrating the February 2nd celebrations of Punxsutawney.\n\nWhile Murray is wonderful and perfectly cast, Andie MacDowell is also an inspired choice for the co-lead, or to put it more crassly, the prize for the male hero's successfully-completed quest. Such is the way these movies go. If he's the egotistical snob with ambitions of big-city reporting, she's the girl-next-door type, wholesome, accessible, good and pure, and all that 19th-century French poetry jazz. An important thing \"Groundhog Day,\" however, does well to avoid in the rom-com vein of \"When Harry Met Sally\" and other flicks in the Nora Ephron tradition is the friend and confidant--often a homosexual in subsequent versions--in which the romantic couple drone on and on to about their amorous foibles. Chris Elliott's Larry the cameraman is none of that--not even to the extent that Elliott served that role in \"There's Something About Mary\" (1998)--instead offering a comedic sidekick to react to and comment upon Murray's dry and caustic wit. A mediator between the protagonist and the spectator, in other words, which is especially apt given that he's the only character to control or share the perspective of the ultimate cinematic intermediary of the camera, whose view the spectator shares.\n\nWe get the generic boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl. But, along the way, through the time-travel gimmick, it's realized that \"We could do whatever we want.\" By adopting these genre conventions, the picture is able to exploit them for a lot more fun than usual and to explore territory far more interesting, if not profound, than the usual pathetic movie idolization of yearning for intimacy, or \"love at first sight,\" \"true love\" and grand romantic gesture nonsense.\n\n\"The wretch, concentred all in self\"\n\nThe time loop offers quite the framework for introspection. Not only for Phil, either, but for a reflection of film itself. It's one of my favorite possibilities offered by movie time travel, to reflexively exploit the same techniques and magic that comprise filmmaking. To edit characters and settings along the space-time continuum, reshooting repeatedly the same scenes with modifications, an actor playing a character acting so as to exploit the fabrication of the time loop. \"Groundhog Day\" does this better than maybe any other time-travel movie.\n\nWhen Phil tries to seduce Rita, the picture continues to cut to the next day as he learns something new about her to use. He finds that she always toasts to world peace despite asking what they should drink to (I know, how obnoxious, right?), for example, so the next go around, he suggests a prayer for it. His unique position makes him the film's surrogate editor. He's also an actor (Murray) playing a character (the wretch Phil) who is acting (Phil the suitor) to bed Rita. He succeeds at this earlier by learning his lines, \"Nancy, Lincoln, Walsh.\" Ever the discerning producer, though, Rita isn't so easily fooled by an inauthentic performance. Hence Phil's transformation from acting to fully inhabiting, becoming the character he, also a character in the first place, was once only trying to pretend.\n\nPhil, Rita and Larry already work in the filmmaking business, or rather the small-screen TV biz of weather reports and local events coverage for a region's evening news broadcast. Phil, in particular, is involved in the most illusory aspect of this department, of a weatherman imagining the graphics projected on the green screen he performs in front of and putting his own spin on any scientific weather predictions (he arrogantly continues to claim, evidence mounting to the contrary, that the blizzard will push off to the East and hit Altoona instead). Note, too, how the camera tracks in towards one of these TV monitors as the film cuts to the crew traveling to Punxsutawney. This is why I don't mourn in the slightest the loss of Rubin's original beginning in the midst of the time loop, which doesn't begin until Phil is in the small Pennsylvanian borough. They enter the movie, through the screen, that is the Punxsutawney set and time-loop scenario.\n\nWe get this with another analogy, too, that recalls another timeful classic, \"Back to the Future\" (1985). In that Robert Zemeckis production, Marty McFly and Doc Brown enter a shared dream through separate concussions--the teen with his loud music and the mad scientist falling from his toilet. Dreams as analogy for cinema. Something similar happens to Phil on his first day in Punxsutawney. At the height of his arrogance, requesting to be patched through on a telephone line for celebrities in an emergency, he's hit by a snow shovel. Yes, the weatherman who predicted the blizzard would pass by hit with a snow shovel. The rest of the movie, one could argue, is but a fever dream brought on by his freezing in that blizzard before becoming concussed from the blow to the head. He's always waking up in bed, as if from sleep, after all. Marty and Doc, too, videotape their fantastic journey through the DeLorean--just as Phil, Rita and Larry do at Gobbler's Knob, to be infinitely replayed, the weatherman caught on camera stuck in a storm of continuous doubling.\n\nThis is further reflected by his double of another weatherman performing for an audience and named Phil, the groundhog, redoubled by his own shadow. I could even go on about the literalizing of the metaphoric cinematographic death of still images doubled from living movement represented by the doubled Phils driving to their doom, but I'll only say that I don't care if car explosions are an unrealistic clich\u00e9, as it's entirely appropriate if one considers that originally film, as nitrate, was notoriously inflammable--something realized in similar reflexive constructions from \"Frankenstein\" (1931) to \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" (2019). This is the reason to fear death even in the afterlife of cinema.\n\n\"I'm a god; not the god, I don't think.\"\n\nReligious scholars have had a field day and philosophy courses could be taught with \"Groundhog Day.\" Mere comment on the human condition. Is it not only a film-within-a-film, but a Matrix-style simulation that Phil has been awakened to? Like Neo, he's a Christ figure--no matter how many times he dies, he will be resurrected on his path to redemption, and note that one of his suicides involves leaping crucifixion pose off a church. The film even begins and ends in the clouds, not only indicating the meteorological profession but also the heavens. Or is it Eastern-style religious reincarnation? Was that shovel to the head Karma? Is it not purgatory? Rita's Catholic, after all. But, good works matter, too. Then again, he's only a god. It's a tragicomedy of Greek proportions, of rebirth from descent to the underworld. Aristotelian poetics exemplified. Maybe a postmodern critique of a postmodern man returned to the simplicity of a Capraesque, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), American small town--albeit one who inevitably turns to refinement in poetry, piano playing and ice sculpture. Or a Nietzschean \u00dcbermensch, of eternal return, beyond good and evil. Surely there are even psychobabble explanations, and Phil does visit a shrink.\n\nPoint is there is no cosmological explanation for the time loop--at least not beyond the narratology of the hero's journey and the rom-com genre. Not even the science-y locus found in \"Palm Springs\" and \"Edge of Tomorrow\" (2014) or rules of \"Back to the Future.\" There's no point, no meaning, or maybe there is, but it never succumbs to base sentimentality or grandiosity. It's up to the spectator to interpret, but \"Groundhog Day\" offers a lot more to work with than one will find in one-off examples of the genres and conventions it incorporates, exploits and subverts. The groundhog and his shadow only forecast the length of winter if you believe it to be so--and even then not really. It's this multifold ambiguity and complexity shadowing the familiarly comedic and romantic that's timeless."

Nowadays it's a loved classic, and for a good reason. Its premise is really rather simple, a man is forced to live out the exact day over and over again, but the film makers explore its possibilities to their fullest, giving us a tale about the meaning of human interaction, loneliness and the depths we can either sink or rise when there's no one to witness us.\n\nThis is Bill Murray's film, through and through. His performance was the one that would either make or break the film, and he pulls it off magnificently. He gives us everything. The initial confusion, the horror of realization, the rage against the heavens, the joy of possibilities, the descend into monotony, the despair that comes with time, the strength to still move forwards. All this given with just the right amount of snark to keep the tone comedic, while also selling the depth of the story. I've never seen him show us more range and scale than in this movie.\n\nAndie MacDowell also shines as the female lead, and the various other actors give us a nice setting in the sleepy town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. I don't think this film would have worked as well as it does now if the setting had been a larger city. Now you get to know the locale, the various inhabitants, which makes the humour and drama that much more poignant.\n\nGroundhog Day is a fantastic film. Its premise and idea are pure fantasy comedy, but it rounds it up with heavy doses of emotion and drama, while still keeping it lighthearted enough to entertain. And it's those few darker moments that make the overall film shine all that much brighter."

        "review_detailed_main": "A famous movie critic (who evidently wasn't famous enough for me to remember his name, sorry folks) picked \"Groundhog Day\" as the film most deserving to speak for our society 100 years from now. Director Harold Ramis humbly mentions this in the DVD interview before playing off the honor as essentially a happy mistake. He had no intent or expectation of making anything greater than a whimsical fantasy romcom. He definitely succeeded at making a wonderful romcom, but the more I think about it, the movie critic has a great point and if this flick is indeed the only 20th century film to survive a zombie apocalypse or two, hey I'm not complaining.\n\nCleverly disguised as a breezy fantasy what-if comedy, \"Groundhog Day\" gives us a provocative allegory that would have Plato, Confucius, Buddha & Rod Serling scratching their collective heads and slapping their collective knees at the same time. The story is about a selfish louse \"Phil\" (Bill Murray) who finds himself trapped in a bizarre loop, living the same day over & over.\n\nBuddhists, Hasidic Jews, Hindus and Gnostics alike have agreed that this as a wonderful illustration of how reincarnation works (and hey any movie that can get all the religions to agree on something is pretty impressive). Meanwhile psychologists widely applaud this as a fine example of how psychoanalysis & treatment work by revisiting our memories and hopefully learning from them each iteration. Economists have published papers relating Groundhog Day to advanced concepts of \"equilibrium economics\". And last but not least, audiences the world over say this is a hilarious flick. The reason why I've dwelled on all this heady gobbledygook, rather than the plot, is just to entice and prepare you for a masterpiece.\n\nOk if you're still with me, let's talk about the actual movie already. \"Phil\" is stuck living the same day over & over, and at the same time he's pursuing his love/lust interest \"Rita\" (Andie McDowell). Can you guess the problem? Yes, if every day resets & repeats itself in 24 hours, that means he has 24 hours to seduce the chick. He tries everything, but for some reason it never seems to work. At the same time, on a deep spiritual level (though Phil is about as spiritually inclined as a damp sponge) he begins to wonder what's the point of doing anything if everything amounts to the same reset/rewind. Phil goes through almost every emotion & philosophy in the book: hedonism, narcissism, nihilism, existentialism, fear, pleasure, rage, and--quite convincingly--a deep depression which Bill Murray pulls off perfectly without sacrificing the momentum of the comedy.\n\nUltimately our protagonist \"Phil\" becomes the amalgamation of the human spirit, in all its triumphs, tragedies, arrogance and confusion. Watch this movie, and in between wiping back tears of laughter, you just may agree with that movie critic who says \"Groundhog Day\" is a film that should survive for the next 100 years."

Its humorous script and scenes always give me many laughs. Besides the humorous situations Bill Murray's Phil gets into, this film has a distinct message. It is a morality play without being preachy. It lets us see the consequences of living a selfish hedonistic life versus a decent unselfish life. And, it's all done with great humor.\n\nThe genius of Harold Ramis as a comedy writer is apparent in this film. Ramis wrote some of the funniest scripts of the last half of the 20th century (besides \"Groundhog Day\" \u2013 \"Caddyshack\" in 1980, \"Stripes\" in 1981, \"Ghostbusters\" in 1984 and others). The trivia section has an interesting item under the IMDb biography of Ramis. He and Bill Murray had a falling out over \"Groundhog Day\" that ended their collaboration on films. The item refers to an interview Ramis gave. He said the falling out was \"due to differing views on what the film should be about (Murray wanted it to be more philosophical, Ramis wanted it to be a comedy).\" That seems sad and ironic because this film turned out to be such a great philosophical comedy.\n\nI don't know if anyone else has tried to count the number of times that Phil wakes up to the same day, Feb. 2 in this film. The advantage of a DVD makes it a little easier to do that; but still, some of the repetitious scenes flash so quickly that it takes some effort, and sitting through the film a few times to try to nail down the number. My count is 39 times, with the 40th occurrence being Feb. 3. If we were to figure how much time it would take Phil to learn the things he does \u2013 French poetry, playing the piano, ice sculptor, and to do all the good deeds he does, who knows how many days that would take in reality. A big majority of the scenes are his failures that also provide much of the humor. But, toward the end of those, the sense of futility that we viewers begin to feel starts to wear on the humor. So, the filmmakers timed it perfectly and at that point Phil is inspired to turn around \u2013 by something that Rita says. Andie MacDowell plays Phil's TV producer, Rita, very well; and Chris Elliott is very good as Larry, the cameraman.\n\nPhil's repeated days probably would have totaled a year or more. The only incongruity in the logic of the plot is at the end. But, without it, the film ending wouldn't make sense. The one characteristic throughout the film up to that point is that only Phil has his days repeated. To everyone else, it's Feb. 2 for the first and only time. And, every day Phil begins with the knowledge (lessons) of the previous repeated days. The accumulation of the days and their experiences explains how Phil can progress from one day to the next when he begins to read, study, play the piano, etc. Of course, some scenes would be a little different over time \u2013 i.e., Phil being able to play the piano a little better on succeeding days with his piano teacher, played by Peggy Roeder.\n\nSo, for the final February 2, all the people whom Phil has encountered on his many repeated days of Feb. 2 now know him fairly well. It's not likely that he would have been able to do all of what he did in one day, so now all the other characters also have a cumulative memory of days knowing Phil in the past. As I said, it's the only way it makes sense. I wouldn't normally dissect a film this much, but \"Groundhog Day\" is such a unique concept for a movie that it invites this sort of circumspection and analysis.\n\nHere are a few choice lines that alone give a laugh each time. Phil, \"Out in California, they'll have warm weather tomorrow\u0085 gang wars and some very overpriced real estate. Up in the Pacific Northwest, as you can see, they're going to have some very tall trees.\"\n\nPhil, \"Do you ever have d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, Mrs. Lancaster.\" Mrs. Lancaster, \"I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen.\"\n\nOn the phone in his room, Phil: \"Yeah, sport. I know there's a blizzard. When are the long distance lines gonna be repaired? \u0085Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today \u0085. Hello? \u0085 Hello?\"\n\nPhil, \"What would you do if you were stuck in one place \u0085 and every day was exactly the same, and nothing you did mattered?\" Ralph, \"That about sums it up for me.\"\n\nGus, \"Hey, Phil. If we wanted to hit mailboxes, we could let Ralph drive.\"\n\nThe dinner scene with Rita is a riot when Phil asks her what she is looking for in a man. She describes admirable traits, and Phil says, \"Me \u0085 me \u0085 me.\" She describes some more, and Phil answers, \"Me \u0085 me \u0085. Me.\" Rita, \"He's not afraid to cry in front of me.\" Phil, \"This is a man we're talking about, right?\" Rita, \"He likes animals, children, and he'll change poopy diapers.\" Phil, \"Does he have to use the word, 'poopy?'\" Rita, \"Oh, and he plays an instrument, and he loves his mother.\" Phil, \"I am really close on this one. Really, really close.\"\n\n\"Groundhog Day\" is one of the best comedies of all time. It's sure to tickle a funny bone. It is sophisticated comedy that older kids and adults should enjoy immensely."

        "review_detailed_main": "Groundhog Day (1993) : Brief Review -\n\nA nice comedy but Time Loop could have been used logically and intellectually. A well known 90s film is entitled to deliver something upfront, at least that's what i believe, and that's how Groundhog Day comes in my watchlist. If not for that reason i would have never watched it and saved that time to watch any full proofed classic film. Groundhog Day comes with an impressive storyline of Time Loop which might have been fascinating in early 90s especially when the narrative and character aren't cold, suspenseful but are instead happy faces bringing laughters. But does that storyline make it extraordinary? The answer is no. I tell you why. The first big reason is, Groundhog Day failed to mix up fiction and real life theories, 2nd it failed to generate something important and intellectual, 3rd is it failed to show some logic. Why did it happen or how did it suddenly stop? Nobody knows the answer and they didn't even try to give an answer. Did they use Time Loop to discover philosophy of Life? Why, big No. This was an opportunity to deliver something socially responsible sort of thing but in Groundhog Day the protagonist was more focused about his own Love and lust interests. This theme of getting chance to relive the same day again and again deserved better writting where you could put joy, happiness and awareness etc and you get chance to change things according to consequences but there was nothing sort of that in the film. Bill Murray was charming and funny as always, Andie MacDowell looked somehow beautiful in some scenes and Chris Elliot did better than expected. Harol Ramis's filmography doesn't point towards any Cult Classic so all you expect from his film is one time popcorn flick in which Groundhog Day fits by all means. Any given day I would watch it just to pass the time but never as a Classic. Good but Overrated!\n\nRATING - 6/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not saying that this movie isn't funny... quite the contrary. But so many claim that it's great, almost a masterpiece... why? It starts out very good, with Bill Murray being his typical, sarcastic, at times deadpan self, and continue being so for a good while... but somewhere, about halfway through the movie, the films pace suddenly slows ridiculously down and we're suddenly not watching a comedy with Murray's sharp wit and excellent delivery, but rather a typical early 90's romantic comedy. Why couldn't this film break that damn barrier? Why does there always have to be romance? I know, I know, us humans have quite an insatiable lust and longing for love, but can't we think of something more original and constructive to put in movies? The film gets better a little later, with Murray doing more fun stuff again... and the plot is now turned around. The first half of the film is Murray doing what he feels like, pleasing himself, the latter half if him serving other people, pleasing others. This works well, and there are some funny moments in both parts(though there are far more in the first). But the whole romance subplot... I don't know, maybe it's because it's Andie MacDowell, the queen(well, one of them... another good example would be Julia Roberts, but she's done more versatile roles) of annoying romantic comedies. Why, oh why must there always romance in movies like this? Hell, the movie could have gotten an 8 from me, or possibly even a perfect 10, if it had kept up the great entertainment of the first half. Some of the movie also seems to drag a bit, since we're basically just watching the same thing over and over again... but with tiny alterations every once in a while. The plot is good, but the romance subplot sucks. The pacing is OK. The acting is somewhat good... but the only actor that impressed me was Bill Murray... and even he was portraying the exact same character that he always does. The characters are well-written... to a extent. The humor is good. All in all, the movie is worth watching and good, but it's by no means great. I recommend it to fans of Bill Murray and *shudder* romantic comedies. 7/10"

The role is perfect for Bill Murray, who is good at the playing a likable rogue, a guy always full of baloney but you don't seem to mind. The transformation of his personality is fun to watch in this film and gives it a sweet ending that was popular with audiences.\n\nYou would think a movie with this plot - the same day reoccurring day after day - would grow thin in a hurry but it doesn't. The screenwriters and actors all made it clever and fun to view each \"new day.\" All the characters from Murray to female lead Andie MacDowell to the supporting actors do a great job of keeping the story fresh. Particularly funny was Stephen Tobolowsky, who portrays a nerdy insurance salesman. I liked Marita Geraghty, too, and it was fun to see Rick Ducommun again, my favorite actor from \"The 'burbs.\"\n\nFor a modern-day comedy, the language in here is very mild. The only drawback was seeing MacDowell's character compromise her wholesome values at the end."

        "review_detailed_main": "GROUNDHOG DAY (1993) continues the tradition of 80's-style comedies such as THE BLUES BROTHERS (1980), GHOSTBUSTERS (1984) and SCROOGED (1988), although there is a major difference. This one is based on an amazing concept, and has much more ambitious, existentialistic themes, almost in the vein of art-house movies, yet without ever feeling pretentious. It manages to be as thought-provoking and clever as movies by Stanley Kubrick, Michael Haneke or Lars von Trier, but it's told in such a light manner that it's much easier to grasp for mainstream audiences. Therefore it's able to almost sneak its themes in on those, who perhaps aren't normally used to thinking about the movies they watch. To me that's a great accomplishment in itself. GROUNDHOG DAY shows how we shouldn't take the important things for granted, that we should make the most of the time we are given on Earth, and that if the world feels like a terrible place, the changes must come from within yourself.\n\nIt's a movie which different people will interpret different meanings from. It tells the story of Phil Connors (Bill Murray), an arrogant and egocentric TV weatherman, who goes on an assignment in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where he mysteriously gets forced to live through the same day over and over, apparently with no possibility to break the loop. This gives him the opportunity to explore life without consequences. At first he takes advantage of his situation by stealing money, becoming a drunk, and even committing suicide. Yet Phil soon realizes that his hostility towards the world isn't really because of the world, it's because of himself. The lesson is that he must change within to get together with his dream-woman and live happily ever after. Phil is not supposed to make her like him, he's supposed to make himself a likable guy. If you are constantly angry at the world then search within yourself, because that's most likely where the problem exists.\n\nGROUNDHOG DAY is Harold Ramis's greatest movie yet. It far exceeds his other comedies, which are funny movies, but without the grandiosity of this one, in terms of the unique idea and themes. Of course Danny Rubin's ingenious manuscript has to receive credits as well, as it is basically the premise of the whole movie. Bill Murray, who is one of my favorite actors, is perfect as the Phil Corners character. Murray is able to express more than thousands of words with his eyes, and his sense of irony is fully exploited. The cameo-roles are full of comedic character-actors such as Chris Elliott, Harold Ramis (the director) and Stephen Tobolowsky. Pure genius! 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "As I type, the past 4 months have been spent in lockdown because of coronavirus, every day seeming like groundhog day. It's thanks to this film that the phrase 'groundhog day' is even in my lexicon, having come to mean 'a situation in which a series of unwelcome or tedious events appear to be recurring in exactly the same way'.\n\nIn director Harold Ramis's charming romantic comedy, Bill Murray portrays obnoxious TV weatherman Phil Connors, who, while reporting from the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, finds himself living the same day over and over again. At first he is shocked and dismayed; then he tries using the inexplicable phenomenon to his advantage, gradually learning all about his pretty producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) so that he can woo her; after repeatedly failing to score, a despondent Phil commits suicide in several different ways, but eventually learns how to be a better person and finally gets to see tomorrow, with Rita by his side.\n\nWith a set-up like this, in which it is necessary for many scenes to be repeated several times, there's the very real danger that boredom will set in, so it is testament to Ramis's sharp script and the great performances from his likeable cast that this never happens. Each repetition cleverly builds on the one before, with small but brilliant changes that ensure the film stays fresh, engaging and very funny throughout. Take Phil's repeated encounter with insurance salesman Ned Ryerson, for example: each meeting begins exactly the same way, but the manner in which the weatherman reacts each time is unique, ranging from awkward, to irritated, to violent, to overly friendly, to genuinely kind (it doesn't hurt that Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned is freaking hilarious).\n\nGroundhog Day is also one of those rare movies that touches the soul as well as tickling the funny bone: Phil's transformation from intolerable cynic to much-loved member of the community could melt even the coldest of hearts, Murray putting in what has to be the best comedic performance of his career (with Ernie McCracken from Kingpin a close second).\n\nNow considered one of greatest comedies of the '90s, if not of all time, Groundhog Day is one of those films that deserves to be seen time and time again. The title might be used to describe a monotonous, unpleasant, and repetitive situation, but watching the film could never be anything less than a hugely enjoyable experience."

I'm sure I will be watching when I'm 100 years old and by that time It should be close to 300 times I've watched this.\n\nShould go down in history as a classic, and I'm not the only one since this movie gets tons of play on TV and continues to draw interest. It proves one thing, writing a good story is what makes a good movie period, adding graphic violence, sex, swearing and huge explosions and stunts with tons of computer effects are all over done today, all we want is a good story that takes us through the movie and makes us feel good at the end. (Not to say sex/violence/swearing and big explosions don't have there place:) I just think they are over done and used too frequently to pull off a movie.\n\nfunny it's not my favorite movie of all time, but I can watch it more times than any other movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'd been wanting to watch Groundhog Day for some time, but it was only when I ordered the Blu-Ray version a couple of days ago that I could finally sit down and watch the bloody film. I'd heard a lot of stuff about it, I had seen a couple of scenes in cable (never managed to finish the movie for a diversity of reasons), but I'd never seen the movie.\n\nWell, now I have. And I definitely don't regret the experience.\n\nIt's no mystery that Bill Murray is one of the most gifted comedians... no, wait, scratch that, gifted actors in modern cinema. He is funny in a way that one doesn't realize he is actually being funny until you listen to what he is saying. He doesn't depend on wacky mannerisms or profanity in order to make audiences laugh; it's his matter-of-factly delivery of lines and the actual lines that he says that make him so funny. Most comedies he's done are pretty great - including, of course, Groundhog Day -, and even some of the mediocre films he's done get elevated by his presence.\n\nNow, Groundhog Day has a complicated premise, but it deals with it in a very simple, straightforward manner that nevertheless makes one think, laugh and admire what the filmmakers are conveying. Weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) is in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. It's February the 2nd. And it's Groundhog Day - a day he hates so much, he only comes to the Pennsylavian town to do his work and leave immediately before he kills himself. This day is different, though, much to his concern - time has seemed to stop, and he's reliving this same dreaded day over and over again, indefinitely. He's definitely not crazy, but how can he tell anyone, even his co-workers Rita (Andie McDowell) and Larry (Chris Elliot) about his current situation? The thing about Groundhog Day is that it's got a really smart premise and that it doesn't mess with it. Although it avoids many potentially-grim possibilities, it nevertheless explores a lot of things Phil could do with his new powers - memorize everything that happens in town, kill himself and doing illegal stuff without suffering the consequences, trying to conquer Rita's love, and many more. I liked the movie because it's both smart and funny, and the humour it provides with is intelligent enough and diverse enough for all audiences to enjoy the film. There's no place for bathroom jokes and profanity in this movie - in fact, this is one film that proves comedies don't have to be R-rated in order to be hilarious.\n\nI also like that it doesn't provide with any explanations for Phil's predicament - after all, this is a comedy, and since we see everything from Phil's point of view and he doesn't really have a way of learning the reason for the time loop, then the audience doesn't have to know it either. Instead of focusing on the scientific aspect of the story, the movie provides with something more humane, something more basic. It deals with romance, comedy, everyday-situations being repeated - in subtly different ways - over and over again and, of course, the redemption of Murray's character, who starts the movie as a total creep and ends it as a wiser, gentler man. My God, i's almost as if he's learned a lesson! Does saying that he earns Rita's heart constitute as a spoiler? I don't think so. I believe the viewer actually expects this to happen, and is simply waiting to see how it will happen.\n\nGroundhog Day is a masterwork, not only because it delights on a technical level, but also because it's one of those few comedies that manages to touch tickle the funny bone and touch the heart. It isn't formulaic by any means - although it does fulfill some expectations most members of the audience might have - and, despite being a little longer than most comedies, it never feels tiresome or overlong. Considering most comedies nowadays are either boring retreads or R-rated endeavors (which are really funny on their own right - see Tropic Thunder or Pineapple Express) that can't be enjoyed by the whole family, it's always a good idea to watch such a clean, fun and particularly smart movie like Groundhog Day."

You see his perfect play very good in the scene when they build the snowman the second time - the constrained way he acts, when he falls down to the ground and tries to come closer to Rita as naturally as the day before.

I had forgotten it was Paxsutawney Phil's day to shine till I looked at the news today, but just remembering that film, and its story line makes me want to go out and do something nice for my kids today. Maybe we'll go get cocoa before dance lessons- the sun is shining here! Happy Candlemas/Groundhog day to all...MM"

Groundhog Day is somewhat like Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol; it begins with Phil, a cynical, pessimistic, arrogant weatherman, and ends with a cheerful guy who has learned what matters most in life. How the hell did he change?\n\nWell, poor Phil somehow finds himself trapped reliving the same day, February 22nd, over and over again. There's no escaping it; he's stuck in the boring little town of Gobbler's Nob with a lot of eccentric people and the two colleagues he doesn't seem to care for very much. As time goes by, it sees as if he's lost his sanity, especially when he begins breaking the law for cheap thrills and committing suicide (he just wakes up unharmed), but he begins to fall for his co-worker Rita, someone he's always seen as sort of a ditz, as he learns that she's actually a very smart and interesting person. He also tries to be a better person and begins to care more about the lives of others, something very unusual for him.\n\nIt's hard to explain this movie and how it's so effective, you have to see it for yourself to be honest with you. All I can say otherwise is that I really liked it; the soundtrack is great, the acting is great and the plot is comedic and original."

Phil doesn't even bother to conceal his contempt for all that surrounds him, including his TV audience.\n\nAye, but here's the rub. This year, Phil is destined to repeat this day over and over until he gets it right. Once it dawns on him that he is in an endless spin cycle of the same twenty four hours, he keeps experimenting with it, playing with it, even resorting to killing himself a few times, knowing that he will wake up again the following day and it will be Groundhog Day all over again.\n\nBill brings an incredibly nuanced performance to the transformation of Phil. Andie McDowell (whom I normally despise and put her in the same one-note class as Mary Steenbergen, all hair and non-stop-come-hither eyes) as Rita, his producer who is completely turned off by Phil, plays well against him. But it is not about getting the girl at all.\n\nAnd this is where the movie aims for an incredible target, that of inner transformation for the sake of that transformation alone. In hands other than those of Harold Ramis (who has a small role in the movie also) this lofty ideal could have crashed and burned, but here it is extraordinary to see this egotistical man become of value to himself, tiny step by tiny step.\n\nHe takes this endless eternity of the same day and starts to learn ice sculpture, piano playing, CPR, among other things. We don't have to see many of his attempts on screen and we are slowly made aware that he has befriended many in the town and is needed every day for aid and comfort and even life saving work.\n\nNone of the points we observe are two by fours over the head. I would actually use the word \"Profound\" about this film. There is much to mull over, how are we all spending our days, could we be of more value to those around us but more importantly to ourselves if we took the time to become aware.\n\nInspiring on all levels, superlative in both its comic and romantic genius, this film is up there in my 100 best of all time. The message lingers. A must see. 9 out of 10."

Bill Murray portrayed Phil expeditiously, a self-centered weatherman who needed to be taught a lesson and fix his ways. Hence, the repetition of one day. Phil goes through ups and downs, learning new things and memorizing people and the events of the 24 hours by heart. Phil is confused at first, but then he sees how this phenomenon can be used to his advantage. From manipulating some random woman to charting out a love life with his producer, countless possibilities contrive with Phil. Incredible pacing, acting, and storytelling. I didn't feel as if the plot dragged at all. A classic movie that I will hold onto forever."

Bill Murray plays a generally bitter, unpleasant weatherman who turns on the charm while the cameras roll but tumbles backward into mean, icy sarcasm just as soon as he's out of the frame. Forced to relive the same day on an endless loop, a much-loathed Groundhog's Day on-location report, he slowly works through his issues, loses the chip on his shoulder, finds personal fulfillment and learns how to share a meaningful moment. It's a simple idea, thoughtfully explored, that doesn't run short on heart, ideas or surprises. Murray is perfect in the role, able to convincingly evolve from contemptible jerk to charismatic goofball, but it's the in-between steps that really make his journey remarkable. His growth doesn't come without pains and struggles, missteps and setbacks, and we share his agony over those tough lessons and bitter disappointments. By the time his sentence in that circular purgatory is at an end, he's hit rock bottom, explored his darkest impulses, reached out for salvation, failed, improved and found peace within himself. Andie MacDowell is adorable as Murray's co-star, the ever-optimistic, spritely target of our affections, while director Harold Ramis gives the whole package a warm, friendly sensibility that keeps things on the up-and-up and still allows some wickedly dark material to sneak through. A fantastic, character-driven comedy with laughs to spare and sweet, enduring lessons to teach."

He has been a top A-list actor in several comedies and dramas up to the point of this flick. His deadpan approach to his character just brought a realistic scenario to the out-of-this-world story line. The cast selected balanced out his nonchalant personae just right. If I could give it 100 stars out of 10 I would. Not only will it be tough to beat this films comedy style, but it will be tough to cast someone as brilliant as Bill. Simply my favorite film ever."

What person wouldn't find that concept funny? Even if it gets annoying eventually, it remains funny in the pit of your stomach because Phil is such a jerk in the beginning that it's hard to feel sorry for him. When we start to see his transformation, we see something that hits home for all of us: he is misunderstood. He wants to quit and turn back into a jerk. But eventually, even Phil Connors pulls through.\n\nProof that given the chance, pretty much anyone can find happiness. It's all in your mindset. A surprisingly powerful message hidden in this comedy gem that will make you wet your pants and keep you so interested you won't bother changing until the movie is over.\n\n9 out of 10, kids."

How could anything go wrong? I sat down, turned it on, and took a swig at enjoying a mind(less) comedy...\n\nI liked it. Groundhog Day has lots of heart, lots of laugh, and lots of sarcastic one-liners from Bill Murray. But as all this seems to come and go, there were some issues with it. The characters were really one-dimensional. Murray's character was set-up to be a jerk and learn a life lesson from repeating a bad day over and over again. The set-up was useless, and it was contrived. The movie was funny, but the jokes seemed to borrow and borrow from other films similar. Maybe it was because I've seen other modern tales ripped-off from this movie, that the jokes seemed not too smart, but good nevertheless. The film came off a little forgettable, as it gives a good moral lesson and then goes elsewhere; meaning comedy. Lots of it seemed a little preachy, the kind that tells you to get off your ass and live life, but it really didn't take away that much. And my last complaint was how it lacked depth. It sends a message, gives us a good laugh, then wraps up. The movie never gives us something to REALLY think about. The message could've been sugarcoated with more thought and process, but the final product wasn't as bad as my expectations thought it would be.\n\nSo the film was good. Although it was somewhat of a forgettable comedy, with a somewhat preachy moral message, it entertains and provides itself as a yearly tradition, and a good one at that.\n\n7/10."

Add three main protagonists with different characters. Spice it up with romance elements and direct the whole thing into delivering a strong existential message in a funny and entertaining way. There you have it: Groundhog Day.\n\nThe main reason why I liked this movie so much is because it brilliantly balances between being serious and amusing. It can make you think about most pertinent questions to us in general as well as more private ones; it can make you giggle. It's not as if some scenes are funny while other dead serious. Writers of this masterpiece where somehow able to make every scene contain both sides. It's as if you were laughing and thinking about the matter at the same time.\n\nLet me finish with a philosophical thought. One who is able to sanctify even the worse can fully enjoy the best.

        "review_detailed_main": "Of all of the films that span the career of Bill Murray, I may have found my all-time favorite. Groundhog Day is a heartwarming film. A true one, not some clich\u00e9d schmaltz you normally associate romantic comedies with. This, to me, is in the same league as Capra. The best film made by the late, great, Harold Ramis. It starts out as the sarcastic comedy that Murray and Ramis are known for (in the vein of Ghostbusters). Then it turns into a psychological dark comedy, of which we follow Phil's decent into madness in cheery Punxsutawney. Then, a romantic comedy, that pays tribute to that age old premise of going back in time, to get the girl. C'mon, you've all had that desire. Then, something really special happens. We see Phil, not only mastering his sensitivity with women, but with humanity, period. Suddenly, Murray transforms into the world's greatest good samaritan, after spending so much time taking advantage of everyone. This is what you call, ingenious story and character development. It's wholesome, but not saccharine. It's incredibly funny and really, unexpectedly touching."

What would you do if you had all the time in the world? This movie covers just about everything you can think of.\n\nPhil Connors (Bill Murray) is a conceited self-serving weatherman. He gets caught in a time warp while covering the Groundhog Day events. Every day becomes Groundhog Day. After exhausting all the fun things, you can do, he has time to confront himself and reflect on what is important.\n\nIn \"Joe Versus the Volcano\" (1990) people relate that environment to where they work.\n\nGroundhog Day summed this up in one statement:\n\nPhil Connors asks, \"What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did matter?\"\n\nRalph answers, \"That about sums it up for me.\""

I am still of the opinion, although Murray's role in this movie is more significant - more than in his other movie where he stars excellently - \"Lost in Translation\". However, at times, windings of the plot are difficult to monitor and there are not too many scenes you can really laugh - and they are all related to Murray's lines. The best scene is where Murray is driving mad the car with two local rednecks and gives his views on life and future. The romantic angle with MacDowell is similar to most of movies with Meg Ryan. In short, recommendable within an intelligent community, not to be watched as a comedy in a loud and drinking group :)"

Thankfully for this one I didn't post straight away, as this film is one that when it sinks over the coming days really revels itself to be something so special.\n\nGroundhog Day is one that needs little introduction, and I only finally watched it recently on the Feb 2nd anniversary, with the retro showings meaning that it was finally time to catch up with this old classic. We see our lead in a timeless loop, and as this is the deadpan Bill Murray, he is funny and heart breakingly emotive. What we see is our hero stuck in this loop over time (long time) go through the motions and find his true character.\n\nPartnered by Andie McDowall, he is in love with her, but his awkwardness makes it difficult to create a connection with her. He loves her but can he make her love him?\n\nThis film is funny, it's beautiful and it's touching. The idea is a comedy & romance version of those old Twilight Zone episodes, and it could easily have gone so horribly wrong. But it didn't, and that is testament to the genius writing, directing and acting of all involved.\n\nA true comedy classic, that I will watch again and again and again, and should have watched long before I just did."

        "review_detailed_main": "I shall not try to conceal my disappointment when it comes to this movie. In a way though I knew something like this would would happen. A seriously well thought out plot and some good performances by the cast weren't enough to raise this movie's stature in my eyes to the extent that it be voted among the top 250 movies of all times.\n\nAll said and done though , I shall commence my analysis.\n\nThe Direction\n\nA typical early 90's flick and hence had that pseudo feel good vibe around it, found in most light romantic movies of that time. The director could have done much better with the story handed out to him . Some parts were hastily executed were others were rubbed on for too long .\n\nThe Screenplay\n\nIt was the screenplay which disappointed me the most. The dialogues were sparingly funny. Wit was evidently absent . Many lines were repetitive and proved highly unbecoming for the plot. I mean , none of the actors had show stealers given to them.\n\nThe Acting\n\nBill Murray is a veteran . But that fact does not by itself imply that he is extraordinary . A fine actor with good facial expressions and body language , he surely is. The driving force of the movie , undoubtedly.\n\nAndy McDowell does fine as a clich\u00e9d yet for some reason attractive leading lady .\n\nThe support staff is equally decent (not more not less).\n\nThe Story\n\nGood. Actually great. In that it captures all those finer emotions of a life ; It deals with actual dilemmas and Bill Murray's acting and Make Up actually serve the story well. Most Importantly , only faint references to sex. No Nudity or any overtly sexual scenes , no profanities. Perhaps this is why it is so popular. A clean and neat family movie.\n\nWhy I gave it 7 .\n\nFor me the movie is undoubtedly neat and clean ( a relief , after a long time) and that is important. The fact that the movie pulls along at a nice rate and tempo without the use of profanities or explicit scenes (despite being a highly rated comedy movie) is itself commendable.\n\nOn the whole a decent family flick but according to me could have been better , for the position it occupies in the Top 250 list."

To make matters crazier, he's the only one who even notices this! While most movies would probably try to use this premise as an excuse for a bunch of silly gags, \"Groundhog Day\" uses it to show how Phil changes: he starts out a sour, cynical jerk, and slowly but surely grows more human as the movie passes. That's not to say that the movie doesn't allow for some goofy scenes. Among other things, Phil memorizes every event that's going to happen every day (\"I am God! I know everything that's going to happen!\"), and he has a really funny encounter with the groundhog in one scene. Harold Ramis created a perfect comedy here."

From all of comments above ,we even can get a standard way of many guys ,they work very hard ,they earn money for fun or sex ,but they can't get true love of woman he love .It's so sarcastic,isn't it?

There're so many nuances, and moments that get found and that are anticipated that you laugh the moment before it happens. I marvel at the timing and movement as you are drawn through the growth and changes faced by this unwilling human ( Phil Conners)as he faces life head on. There are many outstanding supporting performances by Chris Elliot, as the cameraman the dumb and dumber twins of Ralph and Gus (Rick Overton and Rich Ducommun). It's one of those movies that some hate but most love. Including my family."

Bill Murray delivers a standout performance as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over. The film's unique premise and Murray's comedic timing create a delightful blend of humor and introspection. Director Harold Ramis expertly balances the film's comedic and philosophical elements, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking. While the repetitive nature of the story can feel slightly tiresome at times, the movie's heartwarming message about personal growth and redemption shines through. Overall, \"Groundhog Day\" is a memorable and enjoyable classic that continues to resonate with audiences."

A true testament to its appeal.\n\nI have many favorite movies that are comedies but what sets Groundhog Day apart from the rest is its message of redemption. Okay, maybe that is a message that today's post-modern moviegoers don't want to hear. But some odd coincidences with my own life endowed the movie with an unusual resonance for me personally. For example, I had taken up studying piano and Rachmaninoff's 18th Variation was one of the pieces I aspired to master (q.v. the dance at the end). I also had read many Chekhov works (q.v. Murray quoting Chekhov in one of his broadcasts from Punxsutawney).\n\nBottomline, if you find this movie distasteful, I can only assume that you too are stuck in your own groundhog day."

That's the only theme I could discern from this overlong inaccessible mess. My rating: avoid, unless you really want to suffer through it like I did, 1/10."

Phil is a cynical and bitter man, dislikes the small town atmosphere, and just wants to get back to Pittsburgh as soon as possible.

To his advantage, he uses it to woo cheerful producer Rita Hanson (MacDowell) into a romantic relationship.\n\nMurray's performance doesn't only elevate the film to a completely different level but also elevates the work being put in by the rest of the cast. Intelligent movie. It really lives to its reputation, which is overwhelmingly positive. A lot of substance, all understated, some laughs, respects its audience and delivers a great Romantic comedy."

        "review_detailed_main": "'GROUNDHOG DAY'\n\nDirected by Harold Ramis\n\nStarring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell.\n\nPlot Overview: Phil (Bill Murray), a weatherman, is out to cover the annual emergence of the groundhog from its hole. He gets caught in a blizzard that he didn't predict and finds himself trapped in a time warp. He is doomed to relive the same day over and over again until he gets it right.\n\nThe one thing I knew about this film going into it was the premise. I knew nothing else about it - who the starred in it, who directed it, the names of characters; nothing. Thanks to this lack of knowledge, I thankfully had no expectations either way towards the film. I think that worked towards the film's favour. Let me say this, I do recommend this movie and like it quite a bit but I think I would have been extremely disappointed if I had even the slightest expectations. So if you haven't seen the film, I recommend it just don't go in expecting greatness or mediocrity.\n\nMovies like this are, to me, concept movies. They thrive of their unique and interesting concept or gimmick and then use that as a crutch. That is why the concept for this movie is a great one and the reason it has inspired works such as All You Need Is Kill(Edge of Tomorrow). The story surrounding this idea is also pretty decent. We follow our protagonist through possibly decades worth of the same day, with a new focus every once and a while. We see him utilise this gift/curse to learn new skills and try to perfect the day. This is the most interesting part of the film for me. The concept of achieving a perfect day. Reliving a day over and over and over again for eternity until you complete it with no error or flaw is fascinating.\n\nBill Murray is great as Phil and succeeds spectacularly at showing the growth of his character. Andie MacDowel was pretty weak as Rita for me and I didn't buy anything she did or said. I did, however, buy into the romance between the two slowly building over the course of a possibly decade. Even if it did feel slightly manipulative, I did definitely see the connection building over the course of the the film.\n\nThe cinematography and editing for the film is perfectly passable and looks fine.\n\nThe movie was pretty funny and it's on the upper half of comedies that I've seen. The dramatic moments also work pretty well and are effectively utilised for full emotional impact. If I had one main flaw with the film, it is the very boring and uninteresting first 20 minutes. I'll make an estimate and say the film begins to get good around the point he sees the benefits of this gift/curse.\n\nHonestly, I will recommend you see this movie just don't expect the second coming of Christ. I'll rate this film 7 Perfect Days out of 10."

It is hard to understand the dissatisfaction of either with the finished product. The movie is an absolute masterpiece.\n\nThe writing is brilliant, original and fantastically layered. The story, which details the inner journey of a Pennsylvania weatherman who finds himself living the same day over and over again, is an allegorical representation of spiritual and moral growth that has resonated with people of all religious persuasions. But for those who like their films uncomplicated, unfreighted with symbolic meanings, the movie is enjoyable on any level. There is nothing pretentious about its ambitions.\n\nThe acting is note-perfect throughout, and Murray's performance is revelatory. He moves effortlessly between slapstick physical comedy, romantic love, and suicidal depression; and any number of emotional states in between. I can't recall a bad performance by Murrray in any movie, but in Groundhog day he hits more high notes than he's ever hit, before or since. It's a shame the Academy has so little respect for comedy, because his performance in this film is better than many an Oscar winner.\n\nOne of the best films of the 1990s."

I love this movie, and I have since I was little. Many kids were first introduced to Bill Murray in films like Ghostbusters or Caddyshack, or simply just by watching him on SNL. For me, my introduction to Murray was from this film, and personally, it's one of my favorite performances from him. The range he is willing to show with his character on screen is really dumbfounding. There is still the hilarious genius we have come to love, but also such a greater depth to him than we have seen in his other works. Harold Ramis provides the script for the film, a deeply original and unique story, as well as the direction, which is perfect in every sense of the word. I feel the pacing is what makes this film so good, because they easily could have made it a comedy and forgotten all about timing and the drama efforts it involves, but its storytelling is so carefully crafted and well-orchestrated you can't help but feel in awe as it makes you feel so much year after year. It may not be as old as some classics like It's a Wonderful Life or as well recognized as Ghostbusters but Groundhog Day is simply a timeless masterpiece that I hope more generations will find and recognize for years to come. My Rating: 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "While I do think many people go overboard with their praise of this movie, Groundhog Day is nevertheless a highly inventive quirky comedy and features one of Bill Murray's best performances. I feel like this could potentially have been a massive flop had anyone other than Murray been cast in the lead role, especially given that his co-star Andie MacDowell is completely devoid of charm in every role she plays. Murray is as dry and biting as ever but still manages to make us fall in love with Phil Connors and feel every inch of his anguish, despair and humility.\n\nI do find the underlying premise a bit disconcerting, however. The idea that Connors has to achieve some kind of moral perfection in order to win the heart of a fairly uninteresting woman so that he can be freed from his purgatory is, at best, a little odd and at worst, quite grotesque. I really wish he had broken free from Groundhog Day on his own, with his romantic future still undetermined.\n\nRegardless, this is one of those films you just need to watch at least once in your life. A nineties classic, with Bill Murray at his best."

        "review_detailed_main": "A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, \"Groundhog Day\" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry.\n\nMurray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him.\n\n\"Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future,\" he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed.\n\nIt's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in \"Caddyshack,\" his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, \"Rise and shine, campers,\" calls us back to Murray's film debut, \"Meatballs.\" But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like \"Lost In Translation\" and \"The Life Aquatic.\"\n\nLater Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: \"I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it.\"\n\nThe repetitive nature of \"Groundhog Day\" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on \"Saturday Night Live.\" It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole.\n\nDirector Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on \"SCTV,\" frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis.\n\nWhat is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a \"glass-half-empty kind of guy,\" as one of Phil's new local friends puts it.\n\nThe negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film.\n\nBut taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as \"Groundhog Day.\""

But for some strange reason, Phil is suddenly stuck in a time loop and live the same day over and over again, with the same situations and the same encounters. Progressively, the nightmarish feel is replaced by a domestication of this power which Phil uses by making each day the next one's draft, avoiding the same mistakes and blunders, or taking advantages of some situations through stealing, seducing women and being totally irresponsible with no fear of long-term consequences.\n\nThe movie is a fantasy in the way it fantasizes about the impossibility of giving ourselves eternal second chances, it's the sad basis of our human mortal condition that implies the acceptance of responsibilities and consequences, even of the most futile actions.

But interestingly, this power will progressively drives an empathic move in which Phil will help, save people, and learn to dedicate his time for the community, and God knows how much he's got. Punxsutawney is his representation, ordinary peoples' happiness, his eternity.\n\nAnd as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, the heart of the film is in Phil Connor's redemption and use of the gift to make his life better for him, for the others, and for Rita, played by the beautiful Andie McDowell.\n\n\"Groundhog Day\" is a story with an inspirational message, carried by Bill Murray's virtuoso performance, and providing some of the funniest cinematic running gags ... including one hell of a face punch!\n\nAND THANKS FOR READING ...

Can there really be anyone left who hasn't heard the premise of this movie? If you are that person, then here it is: grumpy prima donna weatherman (Bill Murray), frustrated by being stuck on local news, is sent with his sexy new producer (Andie MacDowell) and irritating cameraman (Chris Elliot) to the backwater of all backwaters, Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania. Why? Because that's the centre of the Groundhog Day festival where, every February 2nd, America waits to see if there will be six more weeks of winter. Murray is bored and fed up after being sent to cover the story, but his distress only escalates when he realises he is stuck in Groundhog Day every day. No matter what he does, at 6am every morning he is back in his bed listening to Sonny and Cher.\n\nThis movie, while definitively romantic in places, is always, always imaginative. We follow Murray's character through depression at his time warp existence, joy at the fact he can do anything including steal thousands of dollars, determination when he realises that he can get to know MacDowell's Rita without her sensing his ulterior motives, and desolation again when he understands the meaninglessness of a life devoted to himself.\n\nAlthough that all sounds kind of deep, the film is a total joy from start to finish, and you never realise you're being exposed to hardcore philosophical concepts as you see Murray scoffing cake in a diner. Enough laugh-out-loud moments to make this a comedy classic, Groundhog Day also has thoughtful and intelligent subtexts, which make it worth watching dozens of times. Fabulous entertainment."

'Groundhog Day' explores this. Egotistical weather man Phil (Bill Murray) travels to the town of Punxsutawney for his annual coverage of Groundhog Day festivities. He covers the event with very little enthusiasm. Along with him, is his cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and his new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell).\n\nWithout any explanation, Phil then finds himself in a loop, where he relives the same day over and over again. I suppose its not important how and why it is happening (to him). The film is a presentation of a 'what if' scenario. If only we could...\n\nBill Murray is perfectly cast as Phil. With every passing day, Phil now knows exactly what will happen next, and is able to prevent or remedy situations. This was both funny and engaging. 'Groundhog Day' is also a very well made love story. I mean, this was actually truly romantic. I loved the way the romance interest started as a platonic working relationship and then slowly developed into much more with every passing day. The film also surprised me by having very touching moments, as well.\n\n'Groundhog Day' is entertaining, and I absolutely loved it. The narration and its presentation is wonderful. Even though we watch the same day over and over again, there were always a few surprises and it never became boring."

Obviously the Academy Awards don't actually care about honoring great film, regardless of genre, because this is clearly one of the best films of 1993, the 1990's as a whole, and also of all time.\n\nMurray plays Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman sent to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania. His one-day trip turns into a never-ending cycle, as Phil gets caught in a time warp that causes him to relive the same day over and over again. Phil is stuck in Punxsatawney for a seemingly endless amount of time; each day, he wakes up in the same Bed and Breakfast and nobody else remembers a thing about all the days he's lived. We follow Phil through several emotional stages, ranging from confusion to terror to joy to despair and ultimately to real happiness.\n\nGroundhog Day is one of the most original comedies I've ever seen. The plot has been repeated on television shows several times since (and perhaps the idea had been filmed beforehand, I'm not sure), but never has it been as perfectly crafted as it is here. Groundhog Day is both funny and realistic, (as realistic as a time-warp movie can be) and Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role. Andie McDowell is also very good as Rita, Phil's co-worker and eventual love interest.\n\nGroundhog Day is essentially a comedy, but it is also deeply thought-provoking, and makes you consider how you live your life. Phil starts out as a selfish, cynical man and slowly changes into a considerate, helpful individual who truly cares about others. As we watch him transform into a better person, we laugh a whole lot at the situations he gets into- but we hopefully emerge from it all like him, a changed man for the better. Groundhog Day is a brilliant piece of film-making and should be watched by everybody (preferably every Groundhog Day, which is February 2nd)."

It has a highly innovative story, excellent acting and something else which cannot be described but you feel it.\n\nBill Murray stars in this film which in essence is a film about a man who relives the same day over and over and over. If you can get past the fact that this is impossible you are in for a hell of a movie treat. As I see it the storyline is perfect for character development and great gags. Without saying too much I can say that the main character, who is the only one who can actually remember the day before, plays on this and seduces women. The writer originally wanted the audience to join the main character as he had already been trapped in this time loop for many years (he doesn't age, how can he when the day before never happened?) and he knows everything about everyone. This approach was thankfully abandoned because watching Bill Murray react to his predicament is nothing short of priceless. He is initially intrigued by the concept and abuses his situation but eventually there is a change in the character. What changes I will leave to future viewers to find out for themselves. The film graces a few philosophical questions but nothing more than that because the objective of the film is entertainment and it succeeds brilliantly in its goals.\n\nThe cast is stellar. Bill Murray, one of our time's greatest actors both comedy wise and dramatically, does an excellent job. His comic timing is flawless and his underplayed and sometimes quite dark humor works brilliantly on screen. Also he portrays the changes in his character with great skill. Pure movie magic. Andie MacDowell, who in my opinion is a very underrated actress, does a great job as well. She is instantly likable and the audience relates to her character immediately because of this. Her reactions are highly believable and this of course adds to the overall credibility of the film. Chris Elliot gracefully underacts his part which is a good thing because the emphasis is on Murray's character but he serves his purpose to great effect. Stephen Tobolowsky steals every scene he is in and contrary to Chris Elliot he overacts every scene he is in but he stays within the confines of believable so his character too works magnificently and creates a lot of laughs. Other than the actors mentioned the supporting cast is excellent. What few scenes Brian Doyle-Murray, Bill Murray's brother, is in he makes his own.\n\nOverall the film's cinematography and sets work pretty well but as the emphasis is on the characters its not really worth mentioning aside from what I've just said. The music is another thing which is very good. The score by George Fenton is excellent and fresh. It doesn't sound like something we've heard before and therefore adds to the originality of the film which is already substantial.\n\nThe whole concept of the film might sound a bit pretentious but it doesn't feel that way. In fact it feels very down to earth because of the characters' believable reactions and seemingly genuine emotions.\n\nAll in all an excellent, highly original comedy that is definitely worth a look.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "While some of Bill Murray films including \"What About Bob\" and \"Ghostbusters\" were surprisingly good, this is by far the best Bill Murray film and the best Harold Ramis feature film in the history that has a beautiful mix of comedy, romance, and character study. The story is very original and it's concept about Phil trying to get back to Groundhog Day while it's being repeated over and over again is excellent in every level. The characters are great including Phil and Rita and I liked the relationships between Phil and all of the other people in Pittsburg and the acting is flawless. The comedic moments with the characters are hilarious and unforgettable and the romance between Phil and Rita is great. The music score from George Fenton and the songs \"Pennsylvania Polka\", \"I've Got You, Babe\", \"Almost Like Feeling In Love\" and \"Weather Man\" were memorable.\n\nGroundhog Day is not only one of the best films of all time, but to die hard fans of Bill Murray that came out in February 2 in Groundhog Day and it's on the same day as my birthday. Thumbs up from me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Phil Connors,a sarcastic weather man disappointed from his boring life the 2nd of February of every year goes to a lost little city in Pennsilvanya to shoot a reportage about an old local tradition \"The Groundhog day\",where a nice big rat,like Phil calls it,seems able to preview the last of the winter and the came of the spring..but this time something of really strange happens,Phil ,for a joke of the destiny (or who knows what else..)is obliged to live the same day for hundred of times ,so every day ,for his desperation,he's woke up at 6:00 am by the same song at the radio and meets always the same people who obviously don't realize what is going on and can't understand his drama. I think this one the best comedy of the 90s not only for the Brilliant performance of Bill Murray (absolutely perfect in this role)but in particular for the deeper meaning of the story. In fact Phil's life is a disaster he's selfish,presumptuous, cinic and only when he changes his nature,stopping to use this absurd situation for his goals ,things will be better for him and the 2nd of February finally will be the 3rd!.So knowing perfectly the things of the day he's forced to live ever he starts helping people : save a child who's falling form a tree,save a man hit by an heart attack and so on in this way he also conquest the woman of his dreams (Andy McDowell).So this film is a metaphor.Each of us after all live always the same day (wake at the same time,make the same job,see the same people)without realizing it,maybe we should make like Phil and try to change ,even just a bit,to be better person and to feel better ,is it so difficult ?.."

His actions during the film makes you think that is just what you would do in the same situation.

        "review_detailed_main": "Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a snarky, self-absorbed weatherman who's got as much patience as a toddler in a traffic jam. He heads to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual groundhog festivities, only to wake up the next morning... on February 2nd... again. And again. And again. If you think traffic's bad on your commute, imagine being stuck in the same day, with no exit ramp.\n\nThe plot works because it takes that wild \"what if?\" premise and runs with it. At first, Phil's living out the dream-there are no consequences! Ice sculptures! Wild parties! Bank heists! (Yes, really.) But then the existential dread kicks in, and it's like the Twilight Zone decided to throw a rom-com curveball. His attempts to woo Rita (Andie MacDowell), his producer, start off in the usual creepy-guy-trying-too-hard way, but eventually, it becomes a movie about self-growth and empathy.\n\nLet's be real-Groundhog Day is basically Bill Murray's show. And boy, does he milk it. His deadpan delivery is on point from start to finish. Sure, at the beginning, he's maximum jerk Phil, and we love to hate him. But by the 178th iteration of February 2nd (not literally, but it feels that way), we're rooting for the guy. Murray manages to make this eternal do-over both hilarious and kind of heartbreaking, and that's not easy.\n\nAndie MacDowell as Rita? She's charming, if a little one-dimensional-her role's mostly to be Phil's moral compass and romantic endgame. But she's got this warmth that makes you understand why Phil would eventually want to become a better guy for her.\n\nSupporting characters like the ever-optimistic insurance salesman Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) and the grumpy bed-and-breakfast owner, Mrs. Lancaster (Angela Paton), add some color to the monotonous days. They're like NPCs in Phil's video game of life-there every day, doing the exact same thing. Over and over.\n\nOkay, so no one's watching Groundhog Day for mind-blowing visuals, but it's got that '90s charm where everything feels a little too real-like you can almost smell the diner's coffee and sense the chill in the air. The town of Punxsutawney is picturesque in that small-town-America way, with snow-covered streets and cozy little shops. The repetitive scenes are shot in such a way that, after a few loops, you're groaning along with Phil. The same faces, same places, same weather report.\n\nThe film doesn't need flashy effects because it's the subtle repetition that works here. You start noticing the smallest changes in each repeat-Phil's reactions, how he adjusts his routine, and the little choices that either make or break his day.\n\n\"I Got You Babe\" by Sonny & Cher. It's the song that haunts Phil's every waking moment-and honestly, it'll start haunting yours too. There's something wonderfully torturous about hearing that same song every morning, like an alarm clock from hell. You'll never hear it the same way again.\n\nThe rest of the soundtrack is pretty unremarkable, leaning into those light, breezy '90s rom-com vibes, but it's that one track that lingers. Even after the movie ends, I dare you not to sing along the next time you hear it. And then immediately wish you hadn't.\n\nThe movie's big theme? Redemption through self-improvement. It's like life is that one video game level you keep failing until you figure out the exact combo of actions that'll get you through to the next stage. Phil starts off using his do-overs for selfish reasons-seducing women, robbing banks, gorging on food, and generally being an all-around jerk. But after hitting rock bottom (and believe me, several bottoms are hit), he slowly starts learning how to be... well, decent.\n\nIt's a surprisingly deep message for a comedy-how we all get stuck in our routines, and maybe, just maybe, the only way to break free is to stop thinking about ourselves for five minutes. Not to get too sappy, but Phil's journey from cynicism to kindness is a pretty solid life lesson wrapped in a hilarious package. The day he's finally \"free\" isn't the day he does something epic-it's the day he does the small things right.\n\nGroundhog Day is a fun flick with a heart, and it's endlessly rewatchable-ironically. Bill Murray's dry humor and deadpan delivery make even the most repetitive scenes worth sitting through. It's not perfect, though. Some parts drag (especially once you hit the 15th loop), and the romantic subplot is a bit predictable. But overall, it's a solid mix of comedy, philosophy, and that Bill Murray magic that keeps you engaged."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bill Murray in a tour de force performance as the cocky weather man Phil, who gets to learn a thing or two about humility. Phil is initially a rather tragic man, lonesome and unhappy with his life, which shows in his satiric and disrespectful attitude towards people. This is also the case with his work, for instance when he must cover the festivities around the groundhog day in the small town Punxsutawney. But fate has had enough, and an unexpected snow blizzard forces Phil and his camerateam to stay one more night in town. The next day, Phil experiences deja vu: he's stuck in yesterday! From now on, he goes through a series of transformations, ranging from bliss, to megalomania, to utter despair, to resignation, and finally: empathy.\n\nBill Murray's contribution to this movie is immense. His mimic and body language alone is enough to make you laugh, and a wonderful script is the icing on the cake. Groundhog Day is a movie with a lot of heart and a great atmosphere, and it offers many laughs as well. I must have seen it about ten times by now, and I'd rank it as my favorite comedy.\n\nRating: 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I watch this film every year, on 2nd February if I remember, in homage to the concept of life repeating itself. Others have paid tribute to the wonderful performances of Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, but everything that happens is worth watching over and over again. It never becomes stale because there is some basic existential truth in Groundhog Day. It's also a puzzle that is never solved.\n\nRecently, I heard on a TV documentary (I can't remember what it was about) that 2nd February is Candlemas, an ancient festival linked to folk tradition as well as a religious festival. Traditionally, on this date, animals which hibernate such as bears and wolves will come out and inspect the weather. If they see fine weather, they anticipate that harsh winter weather will continue for another 40 days, and they return to their hibernation. I feel that the choice of Groundhog Day as the day on which Phil experiences being trapped in the winter world of Punxsatawney is meaningful for this reason as well as what happens to the main character.\n\nOverall, it's a very hopeful story, with a wonderful ending, and I will never grow tired of watching it every year.\n\nFor everyone except Phil, that day is a brand new 24 hours, and everything happens once. Phil experiences the day repeatedly, so he can learn something each time. The others meet him anew, or on Rita's case, have only 1 day to get to know him better. Still, by the end he has learnt how to maximise the impact of his interactions because he only has that day in which to do it. Another thing that occurred to me recently is poignant: his Bed and Breakfast establishment is homely but doesn't have hot showers! The day on which Phil is stuck is one on which he must take a cold shower - every day. That's purgatory, by my reckoning.\n\nUpdate: I watch this film every year on 2nd February, or as close as possible. This year I was impressed again by Bill Murray's wonderful performance, the cheerfulness of all the characters and the life-affirming message of the film. I was also surprised when I awoke on 3rd February to see that it had snowed overnight (in London, UK), and therefore I think the weather was telling me that it was indeed the day after Groundhog Day!"

I even went to Punxsutawney in 2006 for the 120th ceremony, all the way from Northern Ireland. I would recommend it to anyone. One of the highlights is watching the film at midnight in the local community centre. Follow this with a trek up a hill in the dead of night to stand around with around 20,000 other people and every TV news crew from around the world.\n\nI plan to return one year!"

The movie is about a stuck up news reporter who finds himself in his home town reliving Groundhog Day over and over again. This movie is good because it is clever, original and funny or hilarious as I should say. This Bill Murray movie is probably my equal favourite one with him in it to The Man Who Knew too Little. Overall I rate this movie very high for cleverness and all that while being one of the funniest Bill Murray movies out there so I recommend this to anyone and everyone as it is enjoyable and should be(and probably by now is) a major classic so 97%."

If you have a bad day, all you have to do, is to think on this movie and things will change. The actors, Bill Murray and Andie Mac Dowell, are absolutely marvelous. The scene, where Bill as Phil tells Andie as Rita how wonderful she is, is indescribable, although I know it only with german synchronsation. Well, you MUST see this movie, there is no way. Allthough I know people, who don't like it. But these poor (kind of) human beings definitively are lost."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Groundhog Day\" is a rare case of audiences actually being ahead of the critics. When this superficially simple tale of a self-obsessed weatherman (Bill Murray) who is forced to relive the same day over and over again was initially released, most critics, even the best, completely missed this movie's subtle and intricate take on the vagaries of life. They followed only its simple premise, slapstick humour and the great, sarcastic shadow of Bill Murray, who, as always, dominates every scene. Audiences, however, immediately took to it. Despite being released (appropriately) in February, the famine period of the movie calendar, \"Groundhog Day\" went on to gross over $70 million and became a sleeper hit later on video. Soon, the phrase \"It's like Groundhog Day\" began passing from mouth to mouth as a descriptor for any number of human situations, and Groundhog Day was better recognised as a metaphor than as a holiday. Today, \"Groundhog Day\" is recognised by the AFI and the Writer's Guild of America.\n\nThat \"Groundhog Day\" works on all the levels it does is not necessarily due to conscious action on the part of the writers (Harold Ramis and John Rubin), who focus primarily on delivering a sharp and witty script that fully explores every comic (and later, tragic) outcome of its premise, but because its premise, so utterly simple, is also marvelously applicable to an almost endless array of life experiences. In that sense, it is like a fairy tale or a myth: a universal story that manages to capture something essential in the human experience. For example, there is very little overt religious symbolism in the film, and yet representatives of several entirely different religions have drawn parallels between the story and the tenets of their faith. Buddhists see Murray's character's dilemma as a representation of the cycle of rebirth, while Catholics see it as Purgatory. In truth, as the film itself notes, *everyone* feels trapped in an endlessly repeating cycle of identical days for at least part of their lives, and so is free to read it as applies to them.\n\nBeyond this though, it really is quite astounding how perfect this little film is; how annoying characters we wouldn't give the time of day to in the street suddenly become fully fleshed out comic creations, simply because we took the time to see them properly. How every bland suburban street reveals turn-of-the-century architectural gems that our eyes would have passed over on first viewing, and how beautiful the sky can look on a cold February morning."
