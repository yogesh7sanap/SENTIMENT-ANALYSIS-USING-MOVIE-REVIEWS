An imoral movie about an imoral person trying to wash away the well documented facts about his rise to power."

It's a huge, extremely wealthy group, and they have the ability to pull this off. Their intention is, I believe, to both please the ego of their leader, Edir Macedo, and serve as a recruiting tool, to gather more members.\n\nThey, most likely, have thousands of members coming here and writing fake reviews, with text clearly translated using Google Translator or similar services.\n\nAnd I think they will keep coming.\n\nI urge you look into this Church, and why it's so concerning to have this movie here, getting this kind of attention."

It may sound like something so minute, so plain, yet I saw courage to face one's own fears and backlash of others. As I watched, I did not expect any exaggerated effects or extravagant details. Rather, real-life experiences that explain why the bishop and his church has been able to spread into so many parts of the world. With that said, what I came away with is that no matter what, I cannot let others define who I am or stop believing in my dreams, That is why I state that it is an inspiring film!!!"

Honestly, the movie is not bad for Brazilian standards which is why I gave a generous 4 stars. It was nteresting to see how Macedo's life story would play out in the big screen. The setting and cinematography is decent in quality but I found it comedic that most of the character's who I knew personally portrayed in the movie, looked nothing like them in real life except for the actor playing Macedo who shows a good resemblance. I knew Macedo and his family personally from the early years of his church back in 1978. I was disappointed that my family was not mentioned in the movie because we sponsored them to begin his church mission in the U.S. in the early 80's and came to live with us in NY for a period of time. The movie ends with him and Ester in NY with no context of how they got there. If there's a sequel coming, it will be interesting to see how the plot turns out but don't expect a miracle LOL!!! The guy from his humble beginnings and life challenges, definitely dreamed of gaining power and fortune all in the name of the Gospel!"

Unfortunately he comes across as a deluded nut, a religious zealot, someone one would expect to be repulsive to saint and sinner alike, and who does not appear to know very much about how to care for his wife.\n\nIf I met a person like this I would immediately know that there was, before me, a person with very deep need. He speaks of wanting to save the world. Many people have been seized with a desire to save the world, but history books show us that God always deals very deeply with people he calls, the work of grace in the soul of man takes time, and unfortunately the film fails to portray the passing of very much time at all, or any Godly discipline to speak of in the life of this man.\n\nI would not recommend this film for the purposes of education or relaxation because it is so non-realistic as to be laughable."

Cinematography is good and the plot is consistent with the book. Again this isnt a movie based on the history of a country or a drama trying to show a man as a holy person. Instead its the life story of a man who faced many difficulties, and still does, but through his faith and perseverance has overcome them all.\n\nOverall a good movie.

(I don't think they even know the definition of saint, to start this conversation) But it's a movie that teaches us to be persistent people and not give up, because in fact, we have nothing to lose by wanting to help other people and dedicate our lives for this. He is a man of faith, independent what ever people of this influential society like it or not. What I \"admire\" is a society that complains about a TV station that commands a country, see the story of a person who was a victim of them and still think it is a lie.

Edir Macedo is not a man who wants to be perfect, is a figure who seeks to fulfill his calling and has to fight against those who do not want his victory. With his flaws and often gross tone he does not give up on reaching his goal and this makes the film clear. Impeccable scenery, a little compromised edition due to the size of the story told in just two hours, actors super well on the scene with their characters and a script with background on the history of Brazil and a people, who is often persecuted due to his faith, the film fulfills the mission of showing the side of the story that many did not know. Obviously many will judge without having seen the film just for the superfluous knowledge they get in the Brazilian media. Worth checking out, understanding, and enjoying the movie!"

Popular for the powers that be can mean too much power, 'corrupt', 'exploitative'. People must be saved from the saver of souls. Those in power are threatened by people who pull big crowds. Influencing without their control, especially when people are giving then money.\n\nAlthough the money is invested in more churches and the ministry as well as himself and family.\n\nNot sure about the role of Carlos. Is he family? Why is he so ambivalent? He seemed to be in charge of media yet didnt seem totally for them and used footage against them.\n\nWas the church roof collapsing an accident?\n\nBrilliant he was not scared out of action and the way he also used the media in the service of god - if you believe in his uncorruptable faith which I do - especially seeing the real Edir afterwards. He was not afraid to go big and bigger and - why not? After all Jesus had twelve disciples but said to them that after his death 'you will do much more than I have done'. In the age of mass media you dont have to stick to 12.\n\nIt is really good to see a series about faith not just more rape, killing, violence etc that we are served up daily and nightly.

Really enoyed it (helped that I could also watch it in the original language as I understand Portuguese haha).\n\nHighly recommended!"

Than it goes on for him finding his real purpose in life. He becomes a recognizable leader that even made the catholic leader of Brazil a little shakey."

        "review_detailed_main": "A very well made movie, for all those who rated negative review of 1 star please watch it all over again, this movie has the best direction, screenplay, cinematograph of the way they've featured the 70s, 80s culture, attires, cars, houses and churches. Moreover the actors have done a fantastic job especially the lead protagonist Edir Macedo, the eagerness and willingness to preach the gospel really made me think about my life.\n\nThis movie will change many lives for sure. There are many new age beliefs in this world which show the pathway for prosperity, greed and luxuries but the end result is eventually we all bend our knees to the Creator and His Son Jesus when things don't work out. And that's exactly what's been portrayed in the movie ..we need to leave all our cares and worries unto to Him.\n\nThe best scene in the movie was when Pastor Edir casts out the demon from one of the character been possessed by evil spirit, which happen in split of a second by using the name of Jesus, unlike movies like The Exorcist and other horror movies which gives so much emphasis to the undying evils but not the word.\n\nI'm not sure if Edir Macedo was a true religious figure who has saved many souls or conned the poor I never heard of him before..but one thing I know for sure this movie has touched my heart.\n\nWill surely watch the sequel with high expectations..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I know how this guy has throughout his lifetime twisted the bible and the new testament message. There is nothing about money in the NT, nor about God almighty wanting our money. There is a massive contrast between 1st century non Catholic Church which Jesus left on earth, and this man's religious movement fuelled by money, politics and deception.\n\nOh, by the way, Jesus does not want temples let alone to have his own TV channel!\n\nBut the whole video looked like a genuine and very radical conversion, maybe he was this genuine but after $$$ made him lose his way. So 10* if this really happened to him, persecuted for righteousness sake by the feds, and world mafia, prise God."
