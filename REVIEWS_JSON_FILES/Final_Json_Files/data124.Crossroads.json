The script is not good, but it has some heartfelt moments - as well as a cast that will surprise you. Did NOT expect to see Dan Aykroyd or Kim Cattrall."

They buried a box of their dreams and vowed to dig it up on their senior prom night. They have drifted apart over the years. Lucy is a bookworm valedictorian who pines for her absent mother and to be a normal teenager. Kit is the popular mean girl. She's planning to marry her high school boyfriend but he has been distant ever since going off to college. Mimi is pregnant desperate to audition for a record company in L.A. Lucy and Kit have a disappointing prom and join Mimi in digging up the box. They both have a mission and follow Mimi on her road trip in Ben (Anson Mount)'s car.\n\nCom'on, it's not that bad. Is it? Everybody trashes this for Spears. She doesn't fit the nerdy brains role. They could have at least given her a pair of glasses. She couldn't wait to get into a belly shirt. She's not that good as an actress but she's able to walk and talk. She does have good acting partners and I like the girls' frail friendship. Ben is an unnecessary extra and sometimes he sticks out. What's up with him angry at the girls driving? The story structure is fairly standard and this could have worked better. It's an early writing effort from Shonda Rhimes. It has her melodrama. I just don't buy that this is as bad as everybody claims."

If you accept the movie for what it is, a coming of age story of 3 very different girls that would appeal to the tween and early teenagers, it's passable. If you're a guy, don't waste your time. The acting is amateurish, but not nearly as bad as in Glitter or From Justin to Kelly.\n\nAll in all, if you have nothing else to do and it's on, feel free to give it a try. Do not purposely rent or try to watch it. You'll be sorely disappointed."

And it's so silly, like Britney's character writing that poem that turns out to be the lyrics to that stupid, ' not a girl, not yet a woman', whatever it is. And then the guy writes music for it and she automatically starts singing along perfectly, she automatically knows the tune even though she hasn't heard it yet, and so forth. And don't even get me started on the karaoke contest scene, the cover of \"I love rock 'n roll\" is a travesty. This is another pitiful pop star attempt at being a movie star. Doesn't work at all."

Taryn Manning did OK, but the rest... it was just not impressive at any point. And I think everyone was trying to make Britney look better than she really was, complimenting her. Her character, Lucy, is too flawless. She was always perfect while the people who surrounded her had prominent flaws. And then in the commentary she went on about how every girl would be able to relate to her character, but wrong! No one is that flawless and covered in sugar.\n\nAnd I know you've got to see it for what it is, you don't go to see Crossroads if you are looking for a deep film, but even as a cute chick flick Crossroads didn't do very well. at all. It was shallow pretending to be genuine and deep. Even in the worst of girl films you need a point where it's getting serious - something to make it look real, you need to feel something.\n\nThis whole movie is too SWEET. Everything about it is sweet.. the dialogs, the looks, the camera angles, the clich\u00e9s, the music. It was like having 200 lbs of Chocolate, it was way too much.

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some weaknesses. No, MANY weaknesses. However, the movie has some good quality as well. First, this movie is for Britney and Britney(album). In early 2000s, Britney Spears can have and deserves promotional 'movie'. Three songs in Britney's third album 'Britney' are featured in the movie. Also, supporting roles are trying so hard for Lucy to tell her story that they look like tools not actors. For example, when Kit and Mimi leave the place to make a room for Lucy and Ben's romance to bloom, their excuses are awfully unrealistic. Second, the storyline is very simple and linear just like their road trip. But, doesn't all teen or coming-of-age movies have simple storyline? Lastly, the chemistry between Lucy & Ben and Lucy & friends make up for somewhat tedious story. Some say Britney was a bad actor, but that's because she acts 'this 'na\u00efve, innocent, and nerdy virgin who writes poems' which is the very opposite of a shiny, cute pop star who she actually is. Audience also had prejudice on Britney Spears before coming to the theater. Three girls seem to have genuine connection and to really care for one another on the screen. 'Crossroads' and Britney Spears do not deserve this much ridicule."

I'm so glad I watched it at a friend's house and I didn't pay anything for it. The movie is boring because you know what is going to happen before it does. The girls travel with a 'hot' guy, and Lucy, the virgin, really takes a liking to him. Gee... I wonder what is going to happen?\n\nI will give the movie some credit, however. Not all the acting was bad, some of it was good. The characters had some kind of depth, and the movie attempts to hit mature issues like date rape. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless they were like me, and just wanted to be amused."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a bad movie, mostly because of the simple reason that it's an absolutely horrible written one.\n\nThis movie is mostly infamous and hated because of Britney Spears, who plays the lead role. But really, in all honesty, she is far from the worse thing about this movie. It's true that she is obviously no actress but I didn't exactly hated her watching in this and her performance didn't made me cringe all that badly.\n\nIt's a movie that got made at the prime of her musical career, when she also was still considered to be fresh and innocent. But it does not at all feel like this movie got specifically written for her. She plays a character that is quite different from herself and in the movie she doesn't even sing or dances all that much, which is good news for a lot of people.\n\nIt's true that this movie is a typical chick-flick, so perhaps I'm not the right person to judge it but I'm still sure that I'm very well able to recognize a good movie when I see it and this movie just isn't much good to watch. The entire way the movie got written and progresses is not only boring and pointless but also lazy and too often doesn't make enough sense.\n\nI just don't get some of the stuff that this movie does. Britney Spears is supposed to be an ugly girl, that gets laughed at, at school, which is laughable in itself. No matter how much you just don't like Britney, you can't really call her ugly, especially not when you also see her body as well, which she shows quite a lot in this movie actually. And for some crazy and never explained reason, 3 girls who used to be best friends stopped being friends at high school and even somewhat hate each other go on a road trip together and for some, totally different, crazy reason they also suddenly are friends again, as if everything that was shown and told in the movie previously wasn't important and had even never happened.\n\nSomething I also really don't understand; the Britney Spears character had a nerdy boyfriend (played by Justin Long of course) for 3 years but as the movie goes along she totally forgets about this and so are its viewers supposed to do I suppose? Since she hooks up with a totally different guy, which is something we also are supposed to cheer for. But what about poor Justin Long Brit? What did he ever do wrong to you. It just didn't feel right but it's normal for this movie to leave many loose ends like this and character just keep on changing their behavior and personalities for no logical reasons, other than it's just being a very poorly written movie.\n\nThe movie really doesn't progress very naturally or pleasantly and doesn't really wrap things up properly. Just think about it. The 3 main characters all go on the road trip for a specific reason but for none of them, it ends up the way they were hoping for. The movie acts as if it has an happy ending but once you really start thinking about it, you could wonder to yourself, what exactly is so happy about it.\n\nIt's actually amazing to see how many big names appear in this movie. Granted, that most of them weren't really big names yet at the time, such as Zoe Saldana and Justin Long but still it makes you wonder how so many great actors ended up playing in this movie. It's probably all due to it that this was a Britney Spears vehicle and lots of people tried to ride in on the success and fame of her. But as it turned out, this is not exactly a project that any of the people involved with could be very proud of.\n\nNot exactly the worst movies of all time, not even close honestly but it still is far from a great or likable enough movie as well.\n\n4/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "To begin, because that is always a good starting point with films of this nature, I must take a step forward and say that the acting wasn't excruciating, but it was painful. It was obvious that our three leads, Spears, Saldana, and Manning, were quickly becoming strong friends \u0096 and that friendship translated well onto the screen, but it was their individual stories and accomplishments that created the pain. In one scene, we saw this trio as little girls \u0096 friends without a care in the world \u0096 then instantly we are pushed into the awkward high school dark ages where nobody is friends with anyone. Riffs have been issued, and we are asked to rediscover who these characters are again. Matching them with their young counterparts is easy, but when their mouths open, it is another world all together. Spears leads with a hodgepodge of different characteristics. She dances sensually in her bedroom, unrobes nonchalantly in front of her lab partner, but is most avid about doing the right thing when it comes to morality and truthfulness. There is even one scene where she hangs up on her father, no doubtably instilling the correct visions into her impressionable teen fan base. She couldn't give us a straight character to save her life. Coupled with the annoying Zoe Saldana who tries the hardest of the group, but cannot seem to quite understand the life surrounding her. Then, painful to write, there is Taryn Manning (who gets better with each film) using every clich\u00e9 redneck white-trash persona possible to define her character. It isn't bad enough that we have Spears fading in and out of her \"real\" character that to have Manning use \"y'all\" like it is Shakespeare \u0096 yikes. Again, the acting isn't bad (I have seen far, far, far worse), but it isn't Juliard \u0096 closer to flunking out of Acting 101.\n\nI have mediocre respect for director Tamra Davis. The woman that gave us the hysterical and near cult-classic \"Billy Madison\" as well as \"Half-Baked\", has also turned out slow duds like \"Gun Crazy\" and, surprise, \"Crossroads\". Her talent seems to be all over the place instead of choosing projects that will continue to define her. Listening to the commentary, it felt she did this to 1) work with Spears, 2) she needed the rent money, and 3) it was an all girl cast \u0096 her youthfulness will be returned. Not exactly the typical reasons artist create on a blank slate. With Davis, I wanted humor, darkness, or anything that would make me remember why I loved \"Madison\" or \"Half-Baked' \u0096 ANYTHING \u0096 there was nothing. Did I expect it with \"Crossroads\", probably not, but it would have been nice to see something that was uniquely hers. Road movies are made weekly, and it is those road films that try to bring something new to the genre that stand out and bring more to the table. Wasn't \"Billy Madison\" just a take-off of \"Back to School\"? I just question the ability of Davis without a studio baking and thankfully she has taken her raw, rotten talent to television only to further infuse the masses.\n\nWe are left with nothing more than the story. What story did \"Crossroads\" tell? How about one lone girl's quest to find herself and loose her virginity? Does that sound right? Again, this wasn't rocket science writing, yet it seemed amateur from the first word. We know who Spears' love interest is going to be from the beginning, the \"take\" at the end is given away within the first twenty minutes, and the only strength to this entire film is a scene with Dan Aykroyd saying \"I was a Ghostbuster, a Blues Brother, and Conehead \u0096 I did this film for my kids\". I believe that sums up this whole story in a nutshell. Needless to say, the story lacked any depth, and there was one scene where we attempted to bring real life to the screen with a rape, an accidental death, and our old friend, \"underage drinking\". Thankfully, Spears could push beyond all this and finally sing her songs near the end, the obvious finale to the film that was started. The ending point didn't match with the starting point in this film.\n\nSo, I watched this film. Everyone will have to at one point in their life, I just shortened the inevitable. Again, it wasn't the worst film ever made, \"Glitter\" still ranks below this, but there wasn't any value in the final performance. Spears didn't push for this film to be made because she wanted to be an actress, she wanted more face time with an audience that seemed on the fence about her ability \u0096 and as time has shown, we didn't make the best assumption. The acting wasn't horrible, but everything else was so we are left with a sour taste in our mouth coming from all directions. I will not, nor suggest this film to anyone except my wife, who thought it was better than \"Clerks II\".\n\nOuch. I will end on that note.\n\nGrade: ** out of *****"

I knew many people thought this was a bad movie, but I thought just as many loved it too. This is no Oscar winning movie and the script isn't profound, but it's cute and touching with some funny and heartbreaking moments. There are many, many movies that are worse than this that have better ratings, but it's all subjective. Britney Spears is also absolutely adorable in this and her acting is not bad at all. She actually does a decent job. Taryn Manning and Zoe Saldana also make a good effort. As a kid I was a big Britney Spears fan, so I loved this movie. I might just be biased because of that but I watched it again as an adult and it still holds up. This movie is so nostalgic. I give it a 6.5."

Not because I think she is in any way talented, except possibly as a dancer, but because the girl can get a recording contract and sell millions of Cd's across the globe, despite the fact she can't sing.\n\nI was looking forward to watching this movie, but it in no way even matched up to what I thought it could. I knew the plot would be predictable and lack credibility - i mean come on! It's a Britney movie! But some of my favourite films lack credibility and are still hugely enjoyable, just as a silly release from daily life.\n\nBritney tries hard to reclaim her image as the innocent virgin, which has already been destroyed, and making herself out to be clever, or even a geek? Like anybody could fall for that? I'm glad they made an attempt to tackle controversial subjects, but angry that these were skimmed over as subplots, as if they were only there for the critics.\n\nThe acting wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. I have seen a lot worse. I'm sure this will just be another step in the path to fame, especially for the supporting cast. Hilary Swank was in the original Buffy movie, and look where she is now. However, that said, I don't think any of these actors will be winning an Oscar any time soon.\n\nDon't waste your time on this movie. If you are bored and wanna laugh at Britney you'll find it mildly amusing, but otherwise, I wouldn't bother. Even as a fan, I couldn't praise this film."

It's basically about Britney Spears and her friends going on a roadtrip after being reunited with each other. Yes, that's the plot. and besides, Britney Spears is so talentless, that she makes Pia Zadora look like Mae West.\n\nI swear, at least Spice World was the \"so bad it's funny\" type movie, but Crossroads is in the Manos class, as in \"so bad it's traumatizing\".\n\nBut at least I got even and showed my ex-friend \"Manos the Hands of Fate\".

        "review_detailed_main": "Crossroads is the story of three friends, Lucy, Kit, and Mimi, who as children put symbols of their dreams for the future in a time capsule and buried it, promising to dig it up on the night of their high school graduation. Flash forward to Graduation Day and the three girls have gone their separate ways: Lucy is a nerd and (horror of horrors!) a virgin, Kit is a beauty-obsessed snob, and Mimi is poor white trash and five months pregnant. Circumstances nevertheless throw the three back together and they unearth the time capsule, only to realize that their lives have not lived up to their dreams. On impulse they decide to embark on a road trip to California, with the hunky-yet-sensitive musician Ben along for the ride.\n\nTwo words could describe this movie: unoriginal and lame. For example, Lucy's father is pressuring her into medical school when her real love is singing, but of course his outlook is completely changed after he sees her \"spectacular\" performance at the movie's climax. One gets the feeling that if these two morons just sat down and held a *conversation* with one another the whole conflict would have been avoided. The humor isn't funny, and there's nothing cute or entertaining about the girls dancing and singing along to Madonna or Shania Twain every other scene.\n\nOf course this review has to mention Crossroads' star, Britney Spears. Spears' lackluster acting chops, combined with the bad script, makes for one very unimpressive heroine. Britney's Lucy is (naturally) Valedictorian, but she doesn't have the intelligence to stop the road trip once she hears that the man driving her and her friends may be a convicted murderer. She's mocked for being pure and virginal, but she can still pole dance with the best of them. Lucy's braininess is also such a turn off that the only guy at school who'd want her is her socially-inept lab partner. Are you buying this? Didn't think so.\n\nDespite the title being \"Crossroads,\" there actually aren't any in the movie. Lucy meets her deadbeat mother and loses her virginity to a guy she barely knows, Kit learns that her boyfriend is a cheat and a rapist, and Mimi suffers a miscarriage. Things have happened, yet no lessons have been learned, and no apparent changes have been made. That is why the movie ultimately fails. In the final scene the girls are all exactly the same, dancing and giggling as if life is one big, never-ending slumber party."

Some dude they picked up comes in and tells her he played guitar while she was reciting her poem. He tells her she should try singing the poem, while he plays. She balks, and then sings, hey who would have realized she is a great singer?

        "review_detailed_main": "What surprised me most about Crossroads was that the first half wasn't totally horrible. Yes the characters were cliche, but it wasn't totally unbelievable. The writer and director clearly cared about the characters and the story and if anybody but Britney Spears had been attached to this project it might not be the celluloid joke it's become. I have to be honest, I didn't think Britney's acting was that bad. It's just that you can't look at her without being aware that she's Britney Spears. The film never gets over that hurdle. Yet, it's the second half were things get mind numbingly bad. It becomes a total vanity project for Ms. Spears. The whole \"i love rock n roll\" scene was one of the worst experiences of my life, and by the end of the movie I swore that if I heard that damn \"not a girl\" song one more time I was going to start ripping out my hair and feeding it to the dog. Poor Dan Ackroyd... crying as he hears that song???? It was laughable. The film actually has a lot in common with that song. Not a girl, not yet a woman. The film can't decide if it should cater to Britney's posse of young fans or prove that she's all grown up. The film has its share of cutesy moments, but also features plenty of cursing and plenty of sexuality. The movie's not as bad as it could have been, but it's still more or less a waste of time. This sort of thing has been done a million times before and with better results. I think Ms. Spears could continue acting if she were to choose a role that wasn't so blatanly modeled after her, and I insist this film could have been decent with anyone but her in the lead. My friends and I tried to enjoy this as a \"it's so bad it's good\" viewing, but it fails even on that level. You've been warned..."

I was also surprised by the fact that Britney Spears' performance was that good. She IS a better singer than an actress, but I've seen many performances of so-called good actors and actresses that was far worse than Britney's. The story is not the best on earth, but the audience it was meant for, love such stories (i.e. teenagers). I actually think the movie has some touching moments, and to you who voted 1 for this one; I think very many of you actually should see the movie before you rate it so badly. It is unrealistic that almost 50% of the viewers have given it a 1. A great deal of them have NEVER seen the movie and rate it 1 just because they hate Britney. That is not fair... I give it a 6 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "First I have a soft spot for the road trip movie idea. Easily brings that young rebellion feel to a film. But when that is said, this movie is all but good. It takes on as many \"teen issues\" as possible and then deals with them in hand holding and overly sentimental Oprah-scenes over and over. The beginning of the film is the worst though with the extreme high school stereotypes in the \"popular student\" and the \"studying student\". It also contains one of the worst scenes of the film with \"Lucy\" and her lab partner who have agreed to loose their virginity together. I suppose its supposed to be funny, but its not. Well at least you get to see Britney up close. So what about the pop princess acting skills? Very varied I'd say. She overacts every here and there and her meeting with her mom is another low water mark in that area. But then again she handles the motivated sentimental scenes with ease. Her little talk with her father in the beginning is quite ok and later her talk with the guy in the film after meeting her mom is pretty brilliant. So to sum up on that she's not without acting skills but she overacts like seldom seen and that partly is to blame on the director directing a first-timer. Further on in the movie the dialogue generally feels very unspontanious as does alot of dramatic scenes that are much fuss over nothing. Well that was about all, I'll give it a 2/10. If you're particularly in love with these cheap teen flicks, or if you in fact are a young little teen, or if you just want a chance to watch Britney you might enjoy the movie, at least a little. Otherwise you have 99/100 odds of randomly finding a better choice."

Only die hard Britney haters will lie and say she was terrible. However (as noted above), the movie itself is a steaming terd. Everyone involved with this car wreck apparently had their own agendas and ideas for what it should be. The simple plot and immature dialogue are geared (intentionally I HOPE) towards younger children, while the strong sexual content is clearly adult oriented.

It tackles issues that you wouldn't expect and it does it respectably. The casting is pretty good. I enjoyed Zoe Saldana in Centerstage and she took this character a completely different way. Anson Mount, who plays Britney's love interest, looks a little bit like a young James Caviezel and plays his part well.\n\nI was a little disappointed in a few areas, one which sticks out more than anything. Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall turn in completely half-assed performances in their roles as Britney's parents. Aykroyd overacts so much that you wish he wasn't on screen at all. Cattrall acts almost upset that she is old enough to be Britney's mom (and if you've seen any interviews with her, that might be the case).\n\nOverall, though, I was much more impressed than I expected to be. Let's not forget how horrible Madonna's first movie was (Desperately Seeking Susan). I really feel like Britney should be proud of herself for Crossroads."

But about halfway through (just after the all night drinking session, of which they all look beautiful and fresh in the morning) it turned into a comedy. The bright green glow out of the bath was hilarious as was the part when Spears confronts her mother after 20 years apart.\n\nI would recommend this to film lovers everywhere who want lessons in how not to make a film.\n\nCompletely dire sums it up as I hear that Spears is in production on another two movies.

Not only won't it ever win an academy award or be in the running but it managed to distinguish itself by making the imdb list of worst movies of all time. No easy feat!\n\nThat said-I'm a person who likes all types of movies from \"The Hours\" to 'Chicago\" to \"Ocean's eleven.\" And sometimes I like lightweight movies too. I'm not saying Crossroads was a work of incredible genius that will live on in all our minds for years to come.... Not at all-but cmon-with all the BAD movies out there(and there are MANY) I don't think this pic deserves to be in the pile of worst movies EVER.\n\nWhat Crossroads was, is a sweet, light little piece of popcorn fluff sweetness and light movie(but not terrible) that also happened to star Brittney Spears THAT was the problem.\n\nI think the worst thing about Crossroads wasn't Crossroads at all-it was the fact that spears played the lead role. I'm gonna be honest here and say it straight out-BRITTNEY SPEARS IS A POP SINGER!! If she wants to be an actress fine but nobody could watch a movie like this and take it at all seriously. And all the \"Britney singing\" in the backround didn't help.\n\nI'm sure the creators of Crossroads could have done this movie without promoting Britney's singing as well-if Ms. Spears wants to be an actress AND a singer fine-but don't try to be both in the same movie. Then the movie begins to look less like a movie then a vehicle for Spears to sell her albums, thus earning her yet another few million- which essentially it was.\n\nNow that said-I have to admit if SOMEONE else had starred in this movie-lets say it was \"crossroads\" starring Winona Rider I don't think people would have killed on it as much. I mean let's face it the movie wasn't just given no respect, it became something of a joke. I really don't think that's because of the movie itself but because of Spears. Her character was sweet but she was played by a POP SINGER-so that took away believability to her performance-for her first role she should have chosen something edgier I think.\n\nBut on the plus side-I saw this with a few girlfriends and yes it really DID make me think \"girl power\" and make me want to hug my friends afterward. And I want to stress I'm not under 18 nor have I ever bought or been tempted to buy anything by Brittney Spears in my life. Plus as light movies go there have actually been alot worse.\n\nWhat turned me off most about this little buttercup of a movie was all the hype(as if we don't get enough) on Spears itself. This seemed less a movie then a work of vanity. If Spears wanst to prove herself as an actress she needs to make the audience forget she's a pop idol. And that just didn't happen.\n\nBut the movie doesn't deserve to be cut down that much-like I said if Kate Hudson or Winona Rider had starred I don't think the movie would have garnered so much negative attention, though of coarse it'll never be exactly a classic."

Britney's acting hasn't improved all that much since her Mickey Mouse Club days which wasn't all that good to begin with. I felt no connection to any of the characters and therefore did not rejoice with their triumps and mourn with their defeats. It was one of those movies that tried so very hard to be taken as a serious movie. So hard that it pulled out every steriotypical movie stunt it could to get the academy's attention. Though I expected poor acting from Britney, I expected better from her singing, which for a pop icon like her, was very disappointing. That all said, it was so dramatic and amature that I couldn't help but laughing all the way through it. As long as you take it for what it is (A Britney Spears Movie), it can be a very enjoying bonding experience for you and your friends. Not to mention, if you rent the dvd, you can enjoy the sing along with britney programs. If you're brave enough to watch this awful movie, make sure you watch it with friends."

Once in a while a nonprofessional actor (athlete, singer, model, etc.) will surprise you and actually turn in a good performance in a decent movie; Mandy Moore comes to mind. More often than not, though, their lack of training and/or talent is glaringly obvious, and there's no more perfect example of that than this stinker. Britney's stage \"presence\" consists mainly of her running around in various stages of semi-nudity (not that there's anything wrong with that), stroking herself, jumping up and down, shaking her butt and thrusting her boobs (if they actually ARE hers--you know the rumors as well as I do) towards the audience. While that may get 12-year-old boys and 75-year-old erectionally-challenged former U.S. Vice Presidents up and running, it doesn't work on a movie screen. Take away the shaking, moaning, groaning and fondling in her act, and she has virtually no stage presence; in this film she has even less than that. She may be trying to become the next Madonna, but someone should have told her about Madonna's movie career; there's a lesson to be learned there, but I don't think Britney will learn it. She has been quoted as saying that she intends to pursue a full-time acting career. Well, she can pursue it all she wants, but she won't catch it. Giggling, jumping up and down on a bed in your underwear (not that there's anything wrong with that) and flashing that annoyingly goofy grin of hers doesn't pass for acting, although she and her trainers . . . er, managers are apparently under the impression that it does, as they have her do it repeatedly. I don't know what the box-office grosses on this film were, but I would imagine--I would hope, actually--that they weren't very impressive. Hopefully, that will discourage the likes of Britney, Mariah Carey, etc., from thinking that a successful singing career can automatically translate into a successful film career. A \"singer\" can get by without knowing how to sing particularly well, as in Britney's case (Carey, for her almost complete lack of acting talent, has an incredible voice and is a far, far better singer than Britney will ever be), but a lack of acting talent isn't conducive to a movie career, Tom Cruise's success notwithstanding.\n\nIf Hollywood would stop wasting time and money on crap like this, and on no-talent wanna-be movie stars, maybe some singers, actors, directors, writers, etc., with actual talent and something to say could get some good movies made, and we would be seeing more of them and less of the likes of Britney Spears.\n\nNah."

Deep down, it's a horrible motion picture, the script fashioned over a weekend by somebody hired by Paramount and MTV films to churn out a script that would seem \"cute\" and \"witty\" and appeal to Britney herself most likely. All the plot elements stink- the cross country trip to the west coast with three girls and a guy tale with so many cliches even the lowest IQ'd girls in the audience would roll their eyes at, finding mom, pregnant girl, date rape, guy with guitar and ends up, uh, uh, at that point I left the theater!\n\nBottom line, everybody should be warned before stepping into the room to view this picture, and while I would reccomend it to the usual perverts who rent PG-13 movies and use pausing the quick moments of sensuality on DVD to do you know what with what, even the seven year old girls who want to be just like Britney would want to stick to her records instead of seeing her trying to act, which she can do as well as Juanita the cafeteria lady with the one lip and gimpy leg at my school can accomplish.\n\nGrade: D- (and the reasons for it not being a complete failure, there are no reasons, after all who needs reasons when you got eye-Heroin?)"

Simply put, my girlfriend dragged me to it, kicking and screaming. That's the only logical reason for any guy to see it (or any human being, for that matter). This was evidenced by the fact that the theater I was sitting in was comprised of 90% giggling girls between the ages of 12 and 17, and the last 10% was guys who had been dragged there and had the same deer-in-the-headlights look on their face that I no doubt had on mine.\n\nThis movie is god-awful in so many different ways, but let us begin with Titney, I mean Britney Spears. Her acting ability is about on the same level as her singing: boring, unoriginal, completely devoid of talent. Her idea of a Southern accent is to throw in a \"y'all\" here and there (does anybody on this planet actually use that word?). She flashes her bare midriff, her cleavage, and her plastic smile every five seconds. Yes, she is good-looking and all that, but that doesn't stop her from being annoying and talentless in this movie. What else does the movie do wrong? Other than Dan Ackroyd, there isn't one member of the cast that doesn't look like a model (even the school \"nerd\" has perfect abs); every character is a broad caricature (the Handsome But Mysterious Guy, The Spunky Black Girl, The Perfect But Insecure Class Valedictorian, etc.).

Britney! Britney!\" special features? It's such a horrible movie on so many levels that it's impossible to pick the *worst* part. Crossroads is one of the poorest excuses for a movie that I have ever seen. It makes after-school specials look like Oscar contenders. Britney Spears' acting is so over-dramatic and contrived (much like her real life persona) that I don't think even daytime television could accommodate her lack of talent. The only moderately redeeming aspect of this movie is Taryn Manning. While the plot line regarding her character was completely unrealistic, her acting was as impressive as her fortitude which would be required to spend long hours on a set working with a cast of buffoons."

Not to mention it was written by famed Grey's writer Shonda Rhimes. If I knew that before I started watching the show I never would have watched. I am surprised they gave her another job after this movie.\n\nYes, it is about friends and a road trip, but the plot jumps around and was basically a ploy to get more record sales for Brit. And to satisfy the teeny boppers. Not a fully formed movie, more like the deformed twin.\n\nThe reviews of this movie are hilarious, go ahead read them. These reviewers put the writers to shame and should have written the movie, it would have been worth watching, and worth 12 mill. Let's face it, it sucked. It was the worst thing Britney has ever made that didn't come out of her diaper."

Instead, it seemed to be a stream of consciousness gushing on about how wonderful and brave and magnificent the character portrayed by Britany Spears is (and by extension, how magnificent Britany herself is). Being inside a pubescent girl's head while she daydreams during a boring high school geometry class. . . this is what I felt like in the theater while watching Crossroads."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must say that I was very disappointed when I watched CROSSROADS, though I am pretty sure it isn't for the reason you'd think. You see, I am a bad movie nut--and I love laughing at the worst stuff Hollywood has to offer. And, based on what I'd heard about this film, I assumed it was simply dreadful...painfully dreadful, in fact. However, while I'd never in the least say it was a good film, it wasn't that bad--and one of the brightest aspects of the film was actually Britney Spears, as she COULD act and was very effective in her role--even though it, like the others, was poorly written. And this is THE reason I'd say this isn't a very good film. While the acting and direction are pretty good, the script is like a string of clich\u00e9s all strung together and it's pure formula--with very, very few surprises (other than Spears' strong acting).\n\nThe film is a coming of age/road movie involving three young ladies who are mostly stereotypes and not real people. Britney plays an overachiever whose father plans on her going to medical school (Britney...in medical school?!). Her other two friends are the stuck-up Black girl...with sass and attitude, as well as a more tom-boyish girl. All three characters do improve and show SOME life through the course of the film, but especially at the beginning they are like caricatures--not people you could suspect are real in any way...at least not on this planet.\n\nBut, despite the awful writing and music video-like qualities of the film, the overall concoction is pretty painless for what it is and isn't totally bad--hence my disappointment. I also should point out that although Miss Spears' target audience is the 10-15 year-old age group, the film is NOT family-friendly in its dealing with sex. While some of the messages about sexuality are good and informative (such as date rape--though they sure made this plot point a tiny bit too vague), the rest seem to say \"well, if you know a guy, like, for a week or so,...um, yeah, like...you should do 'it'....for sure\". Isn't this sweet?!"

No, this isn't romantic, this isn't \"nice\", this is BORING! What about Britney? Well she really fits the idea of the film, but the combination of poor scenario, miserable acting of Britney and the phrase \"I'm not a girl, but not yet a woman\" can really make strange processes occur in your stomach. I must admit, that this is a very painful film. Mostly I felt pain in my over-smoked lungs. And one more thing. Yes, I was really crying. Not because of Liuci dreams, but because of my wasted time and that Hollywood started to make such films. Crossroads had to be cut to pieces in studio already. Now my personal recommendations. Go to this film if: a) you want to cry; b) you want to see Britney in underwear; c) you are up to 12 years old, and you want to see \"pure love\" and \"forever-lasting friendship\"; d) you are a big fan of Britney's; e) your life is regrettable; f) you live under a nearby bridge, scare kids and kill squirrels;\n\nThank you for your attention PS I LOVE BRITNEY!"

By the time graduation rolls around, they have out grown one another. Each is at a crossroad in their life. They get a gorgeous hunk only one of them knows to drive them cross country in pursuit of answers.\n\nI loved the fact, despite 2 girls are white and 1 black, that there was no mention of race or any prejudices in the movie. It was a story that treated everyone pretty equal, except they played Britney up as the lead singer. I don't know why viewers rated this movie poorly.

        "review_detailed_main": "Hello. My name is Agent DX, MI-6. Let me tell you about Britney Spears' first film, a god awful movie that should be fit for a Dark One.\n\nCrossroads is about three high school friends-one is little miss perfect, one is an engaged prom queen, and the other is a pregnant outcast that even Zaxxon could not save. They bury a time capsule and swear to open it on the night of their high school graduation. Like the box, this film should self-destruct immediately. Fire in the hole! Dan Aykroyd appears in this movie as the dad, but as Emperor Lumino said, he fared better in the Ghostbusters movies. I saw a clip of it on my 2004 camping trip, surrounded by Australian counselors. Its \"Mimi, you're pregnant. What, are you just gonna be some big fat pregnant superstar?\" just can't match Scarface's \"Say hello to my little friend!\" The latter is what a werewolf said to the friends before he killed them. Jen Leone, my mom's friend, had Legally Blonde, 13 Going on 30, and Miss Congeniality, but not this. She was told not to buy it. She listened, and so should you."

For those who saw this film back in '02, I ask them a very simple question: Why? I think Britney Spears should just stick to music videos. That's where her \"real\" talent comes alive.\n\nThis film will only appeal to hard-core horny males of brainless female pop stars trying to expand their popularity. Well Ms. Spears certainly excels in that department but if she ever appears in movies like this or any film, then Ms. Spears may run the risk of overstaying her welcome."

        "review_title": "Warm hearted and fun",
        "review_detailed_main": "Britney Spears' debut film is a curious blend of a cheesy chick flick and a John Hughes coming of age high school film. The plot is simple, three childhood friends, that have grown apart, reunite on prom night to go on a road trip. Pregnant trailer trash Mimi (Manning) is the driving force behind the escapade, as she wants to break out of her small town life by entering a singing contest. Popular rich girl Kat (Saldana) intends to pay a surprise visit to her older, college going Fianc\u00e9, and \"A\" student Lucy (Spears) is in search of the mother that abandoned her. Possible murderer Ben (Mount) spices things up as the duty driver whose masculinity hilariously deteriorates in the midst of continual girl talk. Very soon he allows the girls control of the car stereo and is happily singing along with them.\n\nThis is laughably corny in parts, shallow and often cringe-worthy. The directing is, at times, heavy handed, especially with the blue beer bottle scene. However all the performances are solid, with Spears being particularly charismatic on screen. Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall deliver superb performances in supporting roles that give the film some added credibility.\n\nObviously this is firmly aimed at young teenage girls and Britney Fans. It is a PG certificate and should perhaps be thought of as a children's film, as the clich\u00e9d dialogue and lack of depth means there is little to engage adults. There is an abundance of opportunities for Britney to sing, as well as to show off her perfectly tanned and toned body. The early pink underwear scene is worth the price of the ticket alone.\n\nIt seems as though there has not been such a warm hearted, yet naive and stereotypical teen film like this for quite some time. This is almost like a breath of fresh air, and has the feel of an 80's John Cusack or Hughes film (though not as good). It is blatantly predictable and sometimes wanders into the \"so bad it's good\" territory, but its warm and well meaning, and reminds us that being a teenager wasn't so bad. A great film to watch with your girlfriend, as long as she understands she will have to watch Dog Soldiers with you as pay back."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen a few bad films in my life, the only one worse than this has to be Hellraiser 4 (you can read my review of that one as well).\n\nThe problem with this movie is that Britney chose a film to be built around her, not entering a role of a film already written. When actors and actresses choose a role in a movie already written, they are choosing to act based on if they liked the story or not. This film was written FOR Britney, and a film this bad would not be made without her in it.\n\nThe film suffers from the same problems that have hurt Britney's career. It is not a film about finding the answers. It is a film about young girls going on a trip and their innocence is lost. It is not lost by normal situations. It is lost because Britney's character wants to have sex with some 30 year-old ex-con. Why? Because her screenplay does not know how to build romance. Instead it thinks that sex proves that she's found a bond.\n\nBritney Spears has been criticized for continuing to sexualize herself in videos and magazines instead of concentrating on making good music. This time she's using the same \"I'm not that innocent\" attitude in a movie that will be watched by some of her younger fans. I'm not sure how the parents of a ten year-old girl will feel after taking the child to see her favorite singer in the movie.\n\nI won't go into detail with the things going on with her friends, but a film like this is not for the fun loving Britney fan. I'm sure that Britney could have made a decent two-star average film that her younger viewers could enjoy. Maybe with SOMETHING funny actually happening in the film.\n\nThis film is a complete disaster. Nothing causes anyone to truly care about the drama that the characters go through. It is a Britney Spears project without laughs, good drama, or good characters. The only person who did a good job was Dan Aykroyd, and his role was so small that he couldn't save this waste of film print.\n\nIf you want to see a film that's bad, but TRIED to be good, see Glitter. If you want to see the worst film ever, see Hellraiser 4. If you want to see a film that's so bad it is funny, see Battlefield Earth. Britney Spears' Crossroads is so bad that you can't even giggle at her failure."

As someone already said, the whole movie was about promoting and kissing the ass of Brittany Spears. Which, by the way, I would LOVE to do. But that's not here nor there.\n\nI wish that singers (should we call Brittany that? I don't know) would stick to singing and ruining their lives via drugs. Instead they have to ruin OUR lives by putting out this crap. Am I the only one upset that she is trying to ruin our lives? Can someone give me an answer? I was on the verge of choking on my own vomit before I had to run out of the theater to find a toilet.

I think that people in general tend to judge it too hardly.\n\n\"Cross Roads\" is notorious for being the first adventure of Britney Spears in the world of cinema. Back then she was a successful singer (although her songs aren't any worthy, except for \"I'm not a girl, not yet a woman\") and she was at the top of her success. It was the \"Britney Spears fever\". This literally created too much expectations about this film.\n\nThis film is nothing more than mediocre or okay. It is a weak and predictable movie. Not much of a movie, but even so it has its funny moments, especially the part when the 3 girls steal Ben's car and drive him crazy. His reaction in that scene is so classic, very similar to that of the character Charlie Babbitt (from \"Rain Man\") after a phone call. It was also funny how the girls were scared of Ben, thinking that he was a murderer, when in reality he was a nice guy.\n\nOverall, this is a movie that I recommend more for the fans of Britney Spears (if they still exist...). I can understand why this film is so under-appreciated, but even so I'm surprised with such a low rating! From what I see, it won't take much longer for this movie to win a place on IMDb's 100 bottom list."

When \"Lucy\" (Britney Spears) is with her 2 friends: a cut out scene for this movie (which can be viewed in the DVD version) was of them knocking on peoples doors and flashing them...was that really necessary? I can only say that I am glad they did not show that in the movie. When people watch movies they expect to feel like they are in the movie and they can laugh and they can cry, but it is very hard to feel anything with this movie except disappointment. This movie is a pathetic attempt to make the story look as real as possible and it looks nothing realistic. I recommend this movie to no one."

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed this movie, and would encourage anyone who is a fan of Britney Spears, or teenage drama to watch it. Of course the script writing was not phenomenal and the acting was satisfactory; but still a cute little movie about three teenagers girls: Lucy, Mimi and Kit who go on a road trip with Ben, a guy they just met to Los Angelas for a singing audition. The three girls are best friends from childhood who had grown apart, but end up rekindling their friendship through the troubles they surpass during the road trip: their car breaks down, and they end up putting on a singing show at a local club to raise money to have it fixed. Lucy makes a stop in Arizona to meet her estranged mother, who she hasn't seen in 15 years because she had walked out on her and her father. Mimi is also pregnant with the baby of Kit's fianc\u00e9, who had raped her in the backseat of his car (which of course Kit is unaware of.) Through conquering their own set of problems, the girls become reunited and close again, and, Ben ends up falling in love with Lucy. The only thing I can say bothered me the most about Crossroads was that Britney Spears (Lucy) was by far the best character of the three girls. She was the most successful, innocent, intelligent, and prettiest; also of course she is the one to save the day, and gets the cute guy in the end. Did Britney Spears help direct this movie? Because it sure seemed like it. Although it was largely one sided in this sense, the movie is still worth seeing if you're a fan of Britney Spears."

Too bad contest's require at least minimal skill, including the ability to sing dance, and not act like a stupid, spoiled whore. OOPS! Three out of three! Britney Spears struck out with this film, after producing multiple albums with other people's songs redone in shoddier, cheaper versions, and asking Hugh Heffner for a wopping 100 million for a center fold pose.

I can no longer stand any songs associated with this movie especially \"Unprotected\" and that other one, the title escapes me.

I was expecting to see some really good scenes with Spears since she is talented. But this never came to be. Any men out there who want to see Spears take it off, save your money. There are no adult scenes in this movie at all. I wanted to leave the theater but then again, I wanted to WIN! I wanted to prove to myself that I could sit through this garbage. I did and I am a lesser man because of it."

It's only blooming Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy! Seriously though. Give this film a go and leave a review afterwards- definitely doesn't deserve this poor reviews. Brilliant x."

The acting in it was fine: Britney put on a worthy show given her lack of experience and Taryn Manning gave a good performance and generally the cast was extremely likeable. They tried their hardest without the most inspiring material in the world, and it is actually funny in parts! Just get over your negative preconceptions before seeing the film and you never know, you might even enjoy it!"

We are treated to the emotional moments AFTERMATH instead -- they talk about the pain they felt, but you never see it. Perhaps this was to spare the audience the pain of seeing Britney flex her acting chops.\n\nAlso strange for the pop princesses movie debut is the inclusion of teenage pregnancy, date rape, teenage sex, and underage drinking. None of these topics are addressed in a mature way, but rather dealt with either off-screen or glossed over within a few minutes time. It was worse than the classic \"After School Specials\" many of us grew up with. Nevertheless, I will never, ever again be dragged to a film she is in in my lifetime. Thank god I was at least spared from Glitter."

Lucy's character is Little Miss Perfect throughout the movie. People just aren't like that. Britney just got the job because she's famous and it shows her in her underwear. She definitely didn't get it for her acting. Lucy: all this 'I'm going to find my mom' business is predictable. It's boring. And that 'poor-little-me' act gets old within seconds.

I cannot possibly understand how this movie can be good.

B.S. just says to her friends as she marches up the sidewalk a casual \"call me and tell me how the rehearsal goes.\"\n\nSo she goes and knocks on the door \"it's me lucy, mom.\" Kim Cattrall does her best to make something out of a nothing scene. She acts stand-off-ish at best... and then simply says \"we need to have a talk.\" Cut immediately to B.S. showing up at the hotel room with wet clothing. Her friends ask her how it went, she doesn't respond and goes to the bathroom. She acts sad for at least 6 whole seconds and then never again for the remainder of the movie acts like it's affected her in any way whatsoever...\n\nHow badly this movie sucked has absolutely nothing to do with B.S.

Spears may be able to sing and dance to a degree but she has no talent whatsoever in the area of acting. Dan Aykroyd, who can act, mailed in this performance. I don't blame him. Not only is it a horrible plot with bad acting the messages are wrong as well. You get to see pre-marital sex without consequence and teenage drinking. Bad Bad Bad. The worst movie I have ever seen.. not even bad in a campy way.. just plain BAD!!!

It's fun.\n\n\"Crossroads\" was, however, NOT fun in any capacity.\n\nWe expected this movie to be an absolute riot, but it's SO BAD that it goes beyond laughable to just sad. It was practically *painful* to sit through, and I know what that's like - I saw \"Glitter\" in the theatre. (By the way, as far as laughability, you'd do better renting \"Glitter\" - it's at least fun to laugh at.)\n\nI am not a Britney Spears fan by any means. I don't think she can sing at all and honestly she's not even really that great looking or interesting in any way. If you even feel apathy on the subject of Britney Spears this movie will force her down your throat so much that by the end you will really hate her. It's so painfully obvious that this is just a vehicle for her celebrity that it feels like an hour and a half long music video instead of a movie. Her \"character\" is supposed to be this shy virginal valedictorian, yet the movie provides every opportunity for her to sing or dance around in her underwear, just like every video Britney's ever made. Zzzzz.\n\nHer \"acting\" is horrible, but even if it were good you wouldn't know because the scenes where any serious acting should take place are cut short so they can cut to another singing or underwear scene. The other actors, honestly, are equally as horrible and forced me and my friends to come to the conclusion that they must have cast bad actors on purpose in an attempt to make Britney look better. I will say though that one scene - the scene where Britney reads the lyrics to one of her songs as \"poetry\" to the boy - was one of the more hilarious things I've seen, even if it wasn't *intentionally* funny.\n\nI wonder what Britney's friends and family or fellow celebrities said to her after the premiere of this monumental bore...did they just have to force a \"well, it was...interesting!\" so to not hurt her feelings? I mean, I have a feeling that even her die-hard fans will recognize that this movie is a piece of crap. In our theatre alone 5 or 6 teenagers walked out in the middle, and I expected the legions of her teenage fans to love this no matter what.\n\nHonestly, it's HORRIBLE. A bore from beginning to end. The endless driving scenes make the hour and a half seem like days or weeks. I would say \"oh well, Britney should sick to singing\", but I don't think she can do that either. I wish she would just go away full stop and let Mariah Carey make movies that at least make us laugh really hard."

Alas, she managed to only produce a pile of drivel so bad that I can't imagine it even having been considered for a made-for-TV movie. The plot, subplots, pacing, character development - all terrible. The two times we get to bask in the warm glow of her underwear scenes cannot even begin to alleviate the queasiness that slowly builds as the movie drags along more predictable than a Mike Tyson fight.\n\nSave your money and use it to see \"A Walk to Remember\" - a movie where the better pop singer, Mandy Moore, really does shine in a movie that while predictable has heart."

Entertaining people is in their blood and they can get away with much worse than Britney's attempt at acting.\n\nLet's face it, kids. The best time where Britney should've done this was about two or three years ago, back when people didn't have a case of 'Bash Britney With A Two By Four' and when she kept about 50% of her clothes on. Not anymore. She's burned all her bridges (and a good number of her bras) on this turkey that has the sickly sweet smell of decaying plot and dead performance. Cripes, even her 'singing' is stale in this picture which is a stunning accomplishment considering the material she usually uses. I don't know why today's girls consider this woman as a role model even when she herself says she isn't. I'd rather put my money on a Mandy Moore affair since she did go the extra mile for her role and bothered to learn something about the girl she played even going as far as dyeing her hair brown. That kind of dedication I respect, even if I can't stand her music. Ms. Moore can go far if she gives a similiar effort on her next picture.\n\nAs for Britney...well, there's always that topless Vegas lounge act. (Considering how her stock is dropping with the mainstream, that's about all she'll ever be.)"

The other cast members are great too, Zoe Saldana gives a truly powerful performance and was definitely the star of the film.\n\nI think the reason for the low rating is because of Britney spears. The minute this movie came out people got the idea into their head that Crossroads was going to be a bad attempt into making Britney a triple threat. News Flash: Britney was ALWAYS a triple threat and this movie just proves her potential. Yes, no one can deny that Crossroads was used as publicity for Britney's 2002 album but if you just look beyond that, there is so much more to this movie!!\n\nCrossroads inspires you to follow your dreams and the underlining message of this film is that friendship can over-come anything.\n\n\"Don't make me do what she did.

I'm considering suing Northwest Airlines for the cruel punishment of being trapped 35000 ft. in the air and having to put up with this.\n\nFrom the opening credits I knew that we were in trouble when I saw the large MTV logo emblazened before us. But in looking back, that was one of the best parts of the movie. Basically this was a 90 minute Brittney Spears marketing tool - and talk about bad acting!!!! If you have seen the Pepsi commercial with her and Mike Meyers you have pretty much seen the depth of her acting range (those years on the Mickey Mouse club really paid off).\n\nAnd while I'm on hte subject, I'm tired of the comparisons between Britney Spears (herein known as BS) and Madonna. Granted I'm not a Madonna fan but I have to admit that she has more talent than BS ever will. Also the thing that has sustained Madonna's career for these 20+ years is versatility. Just when you think you figured her out she completely changes, where we have just heard the same old thing from BS since day one (she just keeps getting sluttier). Personally, I'm waiting for 5 years from now when VH1 does their \"Where Are They Now\" segment on her."

Remember back in '91 when Vanilla Ice was put in \"Cool As Ice?\" That's pretty much the same thing here. This film has no story, no plot, no character development, just Britney Spears in front of the camera for a couple hours. Whoever wrote this junk knew Spears could not act and inevitably attempted to cover it all up with...surprise...her music. It doesn't help. Equally as poor as Mariah Carrey's \"Glitter\" last year. And to think, I went out of my way to see this movie in a special screening so I could find something good to review in singers-turned-actors films. But obviously, \"Crossroads\" wasn't the best place to start. --Bud Sturguess, Texas"

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's just first say that I walked out of the movie theatre with several other friends when I saw this. I want to know why Britney didn't pick a movie that had good moral value. There was drinking, talking of rape (which didn't put any teen girl at ease), and to top it off sex before marriage. If the script would of have had Britney stay in her good-girl top of the class character she wouldn't have wanted to have sex! I thought britney believed in waiting to have sex til after marriage.So then why does she go and choose a movie where an eighteen year old girl has sex with a guy she'd only known for a week? She said in an interview that she wanted to choose a movie that dealt with \"real teen issues\". Okay, i'm a teen and i know for sure i would tell my father that i was going on a roadtrip, and, i wouldnt have sex with a guy i only met a week before. I have no clue why britney would make her image even more disgusting. I advice you not to go see this movie unless you want your jaw to drop at every single moment. This movie is definately an excuse for 13 year old boys to slobber when britney takes off her shirt....a few times. PARENTS: PLEASE DONT LET YOUR CHILD SEE THIS MOVIE! ITS AWFUL!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was one of the \"lucky\" people who got to see a free screening of this movie on Wednesday, February 13, and as a result wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I honestly do not despise Britney Spears; while I see her as just another disposable face in the dying music industry, but she certainly does not belong on the silver screen.\n\nCrossroads is another movie following the same, tired teen road movie formula. It has your geeky ugly girl that will soon blossom into a beautiful woman, the sassy black girl, the mysterious guy with bad hair, and a new element, the white trash chick. While the plot is paper thin and predictable (how shocking), it also tries to gain credibility by tackling issues such as child abandonment, teen pregnancy, and even rape. These events are force fed upon the viewer and merely expose the movie as the superficial marketing ploy it truly is.\n\nAnd that's basically all this movie is, a giant commercial. Britney's new CD is especially forced upon the viewer as they are subjected to three renditions of \"Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\" and an atrocious cover of \"I Love Rock 'n Roll\" that proves Joan Jett is low on cash. The acting is yet another horrible aspect of this \"film.\"\n\nThe saddest part is, Britney isn't even the worst actress in the movie, Taryn Manning's portrayal of Mimi is something that would make Shelly Duvall look like Jodie Foster. Anson Mount, who plays Ben seems to be bored out of his skull the entire movie, and it's downright depressing to see Dan Aykroyd reduced to acting in a movie like this.\n\nI knew going into the theater this movie would be an abomination, and it certainly lived up to my expectations. There are plenty of other movies to spend $8.75, I would highly suggest not wasting it on this garbage. Certainly it's not as bad as Glitter, but it's damn near close. Britney Spears needs to stay as far away from film as possible, as well as most other pop musicians (I'm looking at you NSync).\n\nOverall Rating: * out of *****"

Not once does it even become remotely interesting or convincing.\n\nOf course, this movie is also full of lame commercial Britney music, but hey, that could be expected.\n\nThe only plus (?) to this movie is that Britney at least has SOME acting talent (well, at least if compared to Mariah Carey in \"Glitter\").\n\nAvoid. It's not even unintentionally funny.\n\nNO STARS"

They all dump the same truckload of horrible, indigestible, clich\u00e9 problems on a group of unlucky (although horribly bland) teens. This pile of wasted celluloid is no different, this time the Hollywood machine takes on such deep topics as teen pregnancy, losing your friends while in school, and of course how to come up with gas money while on a road trip (gag).\n\nI think the worst part has to be the horrendous dialogue. Even with noticeable faces (Kim Cattrall, Dan Aykroyd & of course Ms. Spears) it isn't enough to distract you from lines like \"Yeah\" and \"That's true\" placed within the (quasi) heart felt moments. Every part in the film could have been played by a balloon; with a face drawn on it and a tape recorder tied to the bottom. Then I think you would have had an original movie.\n\nWell, Britney.

        "review_detailed_main": "Most likely, the reason this movie receives the negative reception it does is because there is a bunch of Britney Spears haters out there, that their first intentions of this movie when they hear she is in it is, \"Just what we need; another talentless singer starring in their own cash-in, poorly made film,\" and when they sit down to watch it all they have is negative thoughts from the get-go, which of course ultimately affects their opinion of the movie in the outcome if all they have to say through the entire movie is how bad every single thing is, not even giving it a chance to be anything more. I, for one, am a Britney Spears fan, and for everyone who thinks that of course every fan would love it, that is just not true. I was able to give the actual film a chance and love it for what it is. Of course I still loved Britney, but the movie is actually really entertaining and enjoyable for me, and I strongly wish that would have been the case for more people, but it was not.\n\nThe movie is just all around very fun and entertaining. It has very likable performances, a nice plot and great spunk that I find myself very amused with every time I watch it. The characters, while I admit they could have been better written, were all very lovable and excellently portrayed, and while there is a lot of dried out material, because I understand it is not a masterpiece, it was not meant to be a masterpiece to begin with and the material works for what the films tries to be, which is just a guilty pleasure, even though I am certainly not guilty for loving it. It plays out very well, spending enough time on the three girls at the beginning to give us a sense of their personalities and friendship so we can learn more about them as the film progresses, and while there are some antics along the middle of the film that some might find boring and meaningless, I thought all the mishaps and faults with the characters' lives were very relevant and meaningful. It is a bit mediocre at times, and like I said some characters, like Lucy's parents, could have been better developed, but it is ultimately satisfying to what I was looking for when I sat down to watch it.\n\nIt was a nice road trip movie, and has aspired a cult following over the years by many people who see it for what it is instead of not letting themselves have a good time with it. I think it is very enjoyable and it has some heartfelt scenes, excellent songs and an overall great feel and atmosphere to it. The heinous reviews are bogus, and I would encourage anyone who may love this movie for what it is, a fun road trip movie with heart and enjoyment, to see it whenever they get the chance."

I went to see this with a couple of friends as a goof, and yes, there were parts where we did groan out loud just as intensely as we thought we would. But you know what? When you get right down to it, this movie actually wasn't terrible. Sure, it was predictable and most of the characters were pretty stock. And yes, we were laughing and waving our cigarette lighters back and forth during Britney's climactic rendition of \"...Not Yet a Woman.\" But the producers know who their target audience is, and they know 12-year-old girls won't sit through two hours of something like \"The English Patient.\" And certain parts even had me, a 23-year-old [straight] guy, laughing out loud (and not in embarrassment). And I know I'll really get ripped for this, but Britney's not even that awful an actress. I think part of the problem is that she was given a completely perfect, virginal, squeaky-clean character to play. But even then she didn't give the stilted, monotone line readings I'd been led to expect. She might actually have an acting career in front of her...certainly she's got more going for her than Mariah Carey. And anyway, here's the final heresy - I thought \"Gosford Park\" was such a drag that I actually fell asleep about halfway through. I didn't fall asleep during this movie. Maybe that says something, maybe it doesn't...your call."

Both of my kids are 10 years old. I figured it's PG-13 so three years less wouldn't hurt.\n\nFor a PG-13 movie, this movie was disturbing. What was Britney Spears thinking? I have seen commercials of her dressed like a trashy Barbie doll, but that really didn't bother me, I have seen worse from Madonna during the 80's.\n\nHowever, I watched Crossroads and I was very disturbed by rape, abortions, and young marriage that were involved in this film. Also, Britney Spears was scripted as a smart young woman, but I guess she lacked in common sense in this film as well.\n\nAnother thing I hated was, the love scene was way too graphical. Britney Spears is basically half naked through out the entire movie and when she is in the bedroom making out to her \"Not a Girl\" song I was thinking, \"Maybe Marilyn Manson would be a better role-model than Britney Spears.\"\n\nWell, after coming home from this movie, my two girls were sick of Britney Spears and I really don't blame them; hearing that \"Not a girl\" song about thirty times through out the entire movie is enough to make you throw away everything related to Britney Spears.\n\nI just want to warn any parent out there that is serious about taking their kids to see a movie without any sexual content or tasteless scenes, DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS TO CROSSROADS!"

        "review_title": "A complete and comprehensive showing of what NOT to do when making a movie...",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is a huge example of what not to do when writing or directing a movie. If it werent for Britney Spears, the obsessive teens that saw this movie wouldn't have seen it, the media wouldn't have noticed it; come to think of it, nobody would have been foolish enough to direct such a poor movie off of such an absurd script.\n\nPredictability is the thing that stands out in my mind. As I watched this movie on a plane ride from Hawai'i to LAX, I think I could have written the story out from the very beginning of the movie. Every scene is so obvious and contrived from the previous ones that I feel like i'm watching a movie that was written by a High School Freshman Dance class. Not only is the whole linear and boring plot predictable, but individual scenes are just as predictable. This movie throws no surprises, curves, or has anything of interest. From begining to end, this movie sloths forward to what would seem like a climax, but after an hour (two thirds of the movie) into the movie, its realized that there won't be a climax. Three immature and childish (although all looking 20+) highschool girls go off on a roadtrip with \"some guy,\" and by the end of the movie the writers and directors must have realized that nothing was coming of the movie. As such, they simply took all three character's shallow and contrived stories and wound them all together in a total writing-cop out. The movie could have ended after the first scene, the second, or any other scene there after right up until the end and I don't think I would have noticed.\n\nThe dialogue is miserable and the environments boring and have already all been done. Britney's character, lucy, and her boyfriend/nerdy lab partner (whos name is forgotten after the second or third) decide to \"Do it\" after prom. This never happens, because Lucy has doubts. \"Are you sure you want to do it? she nervously asks, clad in bra and panty. The guy then proceeds to actually pull out a LIST of reasons WHY they should. What planet are these people from? The best part is that Lucy, after hearing the list, composed of such winners as \"Because we're lab partners,\" and \"I can't go to college a virgin,\" is actually temporarily convinced! But, alas, Lucy is a smart girl and decides to \"wait for love.\" How thoughtful. What depth.\n\nBritney, the typical \"amazingly-beautiful-yet-brilliant-nerd-gets-pushed-around-in-highschool,\" walks around highschool with her head hung low with her nerdy boyfriend/lab\n\npartner and plays \"pretty-made-fun-of-nerd-virgin-in-pink.\" Speaking of Ms. Spears, I once heard someone say that this was a \"foray into new territory for Britney\" or \"a step in a new direction.\" Folks, watch this movie and look at britney's character. Britney's character, Lucy, is a nerd for the first part of the movie but all too soon, lucy turns into Britney Spears. She's an amazing singer, seductive dancer, cute little school girl charm and sexy blonde. Britney Spears plays the same person she is in real life! A move in another direction? This whole movie is about her - its like a little biography or tribute, or even a music video with a few extra added in blocks of unused time. Her acting is just like her music videos; dancing around like a blond fool with a great body. To her credit, I've seen much worse acting. She wasn't all that bad. But, it wasn't hard. SHE WAS PLAYING HERSELF. Everyone else was just filler. As a matter of fact, any character at any given time could be replaced with any random person, or wholly taken out for that matter, and it would have little or no effect on the story.\n\nWhile watching this movie, we dont' care at all about the characters or what happens to them, but rather when Britney is going to get cherry picked. It sounds lewd, but its true. A few minutes into the movie, we already see Britney in JUST her bra and underwear, and shortly thereafter she \"almost\" has sex with some idiot. The rest of the movie does a miserable job of portraying her \"budding romance\" with this \"guy\" she takes this absurd trip with, and of course at the end, they decide to \"do it.\" \"Are you sure you're ready?\" he so kindly asks. \"Yes, I want to do it.\" Cry. Tear. How great.\n\nThis tribute to Britney's sex appeal and singing talent (which I very much hesitate to call it talent) is nothing more than throwing a pretty face into a shallow and aimless plot with a few other pretty faces. Had I been given a full frontal lobotomy or had my ears surgically removed, I might have been able to sit through this movie without thinking I was being tortured or as Mystery Science theater 3000.\n\nNow, directors and writers out there, lets not make this mistake again. If theres one thing this movie can do (besides bolster Britney record sales and worldwide appeal), its show future directors and writers what not do. Lets not let this happen again.\n\nMeanwhile, I hope I'll see this on MST3k, or maybe on TV in a room full of drunk people. Lets see Britney in a movie where she doesn't play an innocent yet sexy and attractive singer/dancer \"trying to find her self,\" and maybe then we can gauge her (lack of?) acting skills."

It's good in the background to just past the time, and younger viewers might appreciate the feel-good bits, but it's a boring watch overall.\n\nI actually like Britney's performance in it, she's sweet as usual, and the rest of the cast aren't the worst actors, but it does have a cheesey, sometimes cringe, feel to it.

        "review_detailed_main": "For a movie that used to promote Britney's new album, I thought it still holds up pretty well. The script is good (it was back when Shonda Rhimes could write), so are the actors (even Britney Spears, who has a different aura than the rest of the cast, but it still oddly works) and you get immersed into this story about three friends finding their way back to each other, during the most chaotic (but in a cute way) road trip. The love interest that used to be the big talk of the season back in 02, worked surprisingly well, to anyone who thought Anson Mount would be miscast, after seeing him in \u00ab Urban Legend: Finale Cut \u00bb. And Kim Catrall graced us with her (fleeting) presence to play \u00ab Britney \u00bb mother, between shooting episodes of SATC. Dan Aykroyd is a decent enough father to her movie character as well, and Taryn Manning as well as Zoe Saldana are great supporting actresses, that gave more impact to the most dramatic scenes. Now there's also the issue of the movie being too transparent, and have you buy Britney's CD on the way back. But you could still get Shaina's or Sheryl's instead... And the heavy handed drama that felt a little odd at times (but it wouldn't be called a \u00ab chick flick \u00bb otherwise). All in all, including Justin Long's hilarious cameo, it's a movie maybe only people of my generation can still enjoy (I was the same age as the heroine when it came out) but as far as one where \u00ab a pop star gets her big break on the big screen \u00bb is concerned, it is more enjoyable than you'd think, after all these years of new teen icons coming and going."

My favorite part though is when Britney was dancing on her bed to Madonna's \"Open Your Heart To Me\". But I'm a guy, and I fell that this is the type of movie guys will enjoy more than girls. Another thing I liked about the movie was that it dealt with real-life situations, though immoral as they may be.\n\nFor those who haven't seen this, it appears to be a cross between \"Coyote Ugly\" and \"Duets\".

The only down points in the movie were when they would incorporate her music into the movie, such as the karaoke scene and her boyfriend writing \"im not a girl\". that was just stupid. but i would recommend this movie to any britney fan and especially to any guys who want to see her wearing skimpy underwear. it was sweet."

Their daughter is a huge Brittney fan and this movie was on the flat screen with the DVD set to\u0085 gulp\u0085 loop mode. Each time I was exposed to it when transiting through the living room I immediately ran to the bathroom, all the while reaching for my personal bottle of Bactine so I could liberally rinse out my eyes. Needless to say I used the whole bottle long before the film was over on the first play through. Unfortunately there weren't any drug stores open on xmas day where I could quickly replenish my supply so I had to politely endure the best I could. A whopping case of snow blindness would have felt far more soothing.\n\nI pity the silver halide crystals that were forced to be part of this acetate monstrosity. The atomic cry emanating from the camera shutter gate would have made the folks at CERN green with envy for the profuse expulsion of sub-atomic particles created by the silver halide nuclear genocide of would have made the multi-billion dollar collider a moot point.\n\nHowever, as bad as this is there are a couple of redeeming qualities that will catapult this film into the status of a timeless and endearing classic.\n\n1. The CIA and other letter agencies can use it as a torture mechanism. This film coupled with copious insertions of the singing Tro-Lo-Lo guy will make water boarding seem like a folk dance. You want the information? 30 minutes of this puerile tripe and any hardened spy, criminal, or terrorist will spill their guts pronto. Hell they'll probably make some up too just to end the onslaught before irrevocable damage is done.\n\n2. UCLA film school can use it as a \"frame-by-frame\" forensic study of how not to make a movie. This requisite first-year, first-semester post- mortem will take the most resolute future filmmaker or writer and have them run screaming from the campus giving up the Hollywood dream only to become a used car or insurance sales person. Nothing like weeding out the weak stomach wannabe's."

Since it was produced by MTV films, they should've just showed it on MTV. Hell, they could've gotten away with it--especially since the film contains no foul language or nudity. This should've NEVER made it to the big screen!\n\nBritney is--and I say this without hesitation--a horrible actress. In one scene she's crying to her father (Dan Aykroyd) without tears! Did she take any acting lessons prior to making the film? Most of the cast is second-rate, but there's some wasted talent here and there. I don't know what is it with Dan Aykroyd. He hasn't had a memorable role since \"Coneheads\"! He went from an SNL superstar to taking on thankless roles like this! If I were Mr. Aykroyd, I'd fire my agent. Zoe Saldana, who was great in \"Center Stage\" (an underrated flick I really admire), is good but she has very little to work with in such a two-dimensional role. Every character in the movie is two-dimensional. The screenwriter must've read \"Character Arcs for Dummies.\" Kim Cattrall only has about two minutes of screen time, and that was a good move on her part. I can tell she's concerned about her reputation.\n\nThe plot is contrived and predictable. There are many melancholy moments, but I couldn't feel a single emotion--unless you count boredom as an emotion--because all the plot points are created in such a labored Hollywood fashion.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I was extremely turned off. We're introduced to the three main characters. Lucy (Britney) is established as an introverted bookworm who hangs out with the geek squad. Yet she still wears sexy, cleavage-enhancing outfits. Her ex-friend Kit (Saldana) is one of those stuck-up popular girls who hisses at the sight of girls like Lucy. And her other friend is a pregnant tomboy. This is such an obvious setup and we know that they're all going to end up arm-in-arm, as best friends again, by the end of the film. We're not stupid.\n\nAbout the only positive thing I can note (and this is just for the guys out there) is Britney wears some very sexy outfits. In the opening scene, she's dancing in her underwear.\n\nNow, I'm not one of those hypocrites who takes delight in bashing Britney. I think she has a reasonable amount of talent as a singer. I'm not a big fan of hers, but I like some of her music. I just think she should stay away from the silver screen--along with Mariah Carey and all those other musicians/wanna-be actors (with a few exceptions of course).\n\nMy score: 2 (out of 10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "It was a long time ago since I saw this and all I remember was how bored out of my mind I was having to watch this film in the cinema along with a cousin of mine who is a girl. For what I can recall as I vaguely remember it, the story was all over the place, actually it was more like a film about \"nothing\". You got these 3 friends (Britney included) going on a road trip together (I know I'm just reading off from the plot lines here) and then they come across this guy who is your typical handsome guy at which point is where the film becomes a load of nonsense with nothing interesting happening, this is where the film pretty much gives up trying to be a movie and goes into soap opera territory but is worse.\n\nWhat I actually find most baffling is that this film is supposed to be a \"romantic comedy\" film yet there was nothing in this film that was remotely funny. And Britney Spears thought she could have a good crack at movie acting, huh, I don't think so.\n\nAlthough I don't remember everything from the film since it was years ago since I last saw the film, but then again why would you want to remember an awful movie like this? Really bad movies such as this are best left buried away from the mind to be made forgotten forever."

        "review_detailed_main": "Aside from a few oversights in the \"believability\" department, Britney Spears' initial foray into movie stardom is actually a charming little movie. Britney need not worry about any Mariah Carey \"Glitter\" comparisons- \"Crossroads\" is not the mess that movie was at all.\n\n\"Crossroads\" IS what it is... a teen road movie. Parents with children under the age of 10-12 might want to skip this one for a few years. Britney loses her virginity (not on screen), gets a little drunk, and even says a few curse words. These are the things that actually make the movie more realistic.\n\nKim Cattrall literally has one two minute scene- why on earth she agreed to do this flick is beyond me. She plays the woman who abandoned Britney at age 3, leaving Dan Aykroyd to raise Britney's character as a single Dad. No wonder Britney wanted to hit the road.\n\nHer co-stars turn in good, solid performances. Although I'm happy that I got free passes to see a sneak preview- I wouldn't have felt that paying for a matinee of this flick would have been a ripoff. If you've ever hummed along with a Britney hit, you'll surely find something to enjoy here."

After I watched the full 93 minute movie from beginning to end, I couldn't help but think \"Well this isn't THAT bad.\" Yeah, it is really cheesy in some sorts and kinda dim-witted but it wasn't that bad of a movie. I know the thought of the incredibly hot Britney Spears playing a shy, valedictorian, good girl is kinda odd to see but hey its Hollywood. I thought it was kinda odd seeing Chris Evans playing two marvel characters in the human torch and captain America but like I said its Hollywood. Well anyway back to Crossroads, this movie wasn't that bad. I was entertained and I thought the ending was kinda good. I've seen a lot worse movies than this like \"Glitter\" and From \"Justin to Kelly\" for example and Crossroads was noway as worse or worser than those abominations."

Some might say: Well there was Brandy and Monica? But they are never mentioned in the same breath as Britney and her rival record company clones Christina, Jessica, and Mandy and what's more Brandy and Monica etc. were marketed/packaged as \"soul artists\" rather than \"pop princesses\" on account of being Black. The presentation/exposure is totally dependent on race. J.Lo is a rare crossover exception but she is older and past her expiry date like Brit. All the other ethnic groups are virtually shut out. The Lindsay, Hillary, Jo Jo pop princess class was again all-white. Most of these \"singers\" are clearly more dependant on marketing/packaging than on raw talent so I have to believe that it must be possible to groom a minority pop princess if record executives in the entertainment industry weren't so racist. When the next class comes around minorities must demand representation. The Washington Post reports that 45% of children under 5 are now minorities so hopefully the next generation will be able to break the racist white stranglehold."

I have seen worse. This would be a good movie to watch on a rainy day or if you have nothing to do at all. Like I said, I didn't get to see all of the movie, but I did catch the part where Britney attempts to sing I Love Rock and Roll by Joan Jett and the Black Hearts.

First, Bowling For Soup is in this movie and a few of their songs appear. Most people probably won't notice, but I did and I appreciate it. What would have been better is a Bowling For Soup movie with Britney Spears just showing up in the background.\n\nWe also have a few good cameos: Justin Long (who is surprisingly muscular for such a small guy) and Dan Aykroyd. They are more or less wasted in this film, but it is not unusual. If I recall correctly, there was a throwaway in another movie of the time, \"Coyote Ugly\". (I think it was John Goodman, but I've tried to block that movie out of my brain.) This is, for better or worse, a Britney Spears movie. If you think she is attractive (I don't), this might appeal to you. If you're a girl who grew up in the late 90s, this might appeal to you. But let's be honest, the singing from Spears is not that good. She is not a terrible artist, but she did not achieve super-stardom for her voice.\n\nAs an interesting side note, this movie introduced the world to Taryn Manning, who sort of plays the bad girl. Who knew that it would turn out she was so much more bad than we ever thought? Maybe not Amanda Bynes bad, but if the allegations of violence are true, she's a scrapper!"

They also promised that they would come back after they graduate and undig that box. Now that time has come but what a shame, Lucy, Kit and Mimi aren't best friends anymore. Lucy is the shy virgin next door who likes to dance around in her underwear in front of her dad, Kit is a snobby popular girl who was supposedly fat once but now looks like a skeleton and then there is Mimi, the pregnant girl who doesn't know who the baby's father is. Can a roadtrip now help save their friendship? I bet you know the answer for that. It's not that i didn't like this movie, it's a very cute chick flick but it really doesn't have that much to offer. But anyways, it's a nice movie about growing up and friendship. Britney Spears of course cannot act at all, i had to cringe at some parts because she was so goddamn bad. They should have cast someone else to play the shy virgin Lucy because Britney did not look the part. The only person i really liked was Taryn Manning, she is a great young actress with a bright future ahead of her. Zoe Saldana was also pretty good, but like I said Britney sucked badly. The moral that she gave in this movie was: don't sleep with someone that you've known your whole life but just go lose your virginity to some guy you've just met Anyways, I would give Crossroads 6/10"

I'm sorta a Britney Spears fan, but, as time goes on, I'm sorta getting a little sick of her whole image thing about how we all must accept the fact that she's not a girl but not yet a woman. It's really growing thin. I think, we all know that she's definitely no young girl! WE CAN ALL SEE THAT. But anyway, I'm going off track here. \"Crossroads\" is a movie going into I know I wouldn't like. Why do you ask? Because, to be completely honest, exactly how good can a film starring Britney Spears be? And secondly, why would I even want to go see a movie where I know I won't like it? That's because 2002 is shaping into a year of dreck. There's not one good film that has started to come out. \"Crossroads\" I think will please it's target audiences. I'm guessing young 12 - 16 (?) year old girls. Other people who bash this film had, to be honest, no business going to see this movie. Yeah it's true, I didn't care for the film very much, but, I don't like reading or listening to older people who are already against Britney Spears bash the film. If you dislike the lead star so much, there's very little chance you'll give yourself a chance to enjoy it. As you watch the film the whole time you'll be critical of what your seeing. I on the other hand, wanted to like it. I wanted to be able to fully defend it. I wanted to be able to say Britney Spears deserves more attention than what she's getting, I can only mildly defend her and this movie. And I only defend her because I'm a fan of her music, not so much the film itself. I just like her, for her, nothing more nothing less. \"Crossroads\" lags. It really is kinda boring. The viewer isn't drawn into these characters enough to honestly care about what happens to them. Sure, we can say this is a sad movie, and when certain tragic events happen we can for that moment say,\"Awwwwwww, I don't know what I would do if that was me?\", but 99% of the time, we only say these things because we're not heartless. \"Crossroads\" coulda been a good movie. There were themes of date rape, peer pressure that young girls face in losing their virginity, and self discovering. All elements that some very good films have dealt with. \"Crossroads\" chickens out. And for this we blame not Spears, but scriptwriter Shonda Rhimes. Because of undevelopped characters and awful pacing I can't say I enjoyed this movie. Do I think everyone will dislike this film? No. I think it's target audience will enjoy. And they should. I'm giving it ** out of **** or a 5 on a scale of 1-10."

Not a fan of Spears, but am a long way from disliking her. Having heard nothing but bad things about 'Crossroads' there was the worry of whether it was as bad as all that, but giving it a fair chance with no personal bias while 'Crossroads' is a long way from good it could have been much worse. It is much better than 'Glitter' with Mariah Carey, which didn't even have a good soundtrack and Carey's extraordinary abilities as a singer doesn't come over in her incredibly one-note acting.\n\nGetting the good things out of the way with 'Crossroads', some of the scenery is nice, Justin Long and especially Dan Aykroyd make amusing enough cameos and the soundtrack is memorable and has a nice range of emotions. Despite the Golden Raspberry (Razzie) win and nomination, \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\" and \"Overprotected\" to me are not bad songs at all, in fact they were two of the soundtrack's highlights and most likely got the negative attention due to them being performed by Britney.\n\nBritney has gotten a lot of stick for her acting here, and one can see why. She does fare better than Carey does in 'Glitter', she at least looks more engaged and has a better ability of displaying more than one emotion. Despite being a charismatic performer on stage, the same kind of charisma doesn't come over in her performance here, which has a lot of erratic changes of mood, awkward line delivery and lack of genuine emotion in the emotional scenes (she doesn't even convince doing crocodile tears). The rest of the cast don't fare so well either, with Kim Catrall wasted, Zoe Saldana annoying as a result of over-compensating and Anson Mount amongst others looking disengaged. Chemistry is also lacking.\n\nIn all fairness, the cast are saddled with shallow and underwritten characters that are written with no warmth or originality and a clich\u00e9d and tonally muddled script that is filled with cheesy and juvenile humour, clunky and attempts at emotion, heavy-handed dramatic elements in places where the film attempts to tackle more mature themes and romantic parts that have more sugar than a pack of eight diet coke cans. Tamra Davis is uninspired visually, with very limited use of camera techniques which cheapens the film's look, and lacks cohesion from a narrative point of view.\n\nDespite a decent start, 'Crossroads' has a story that is as muddled and incomprehensible as its script, not being able to decide whether to be a road trip film, a vanity vehicle for Britney Spears, a comedy, a drama or a romance, because it tries to be all those things and doesn't work as any of them. The problems with the comedy, drama and romance have been detailed when describing what was wrong with the script, while the road trip parts are aimless and meandering and while not as self-indulgent as other music-themed films with similar kinds of stories it does feel like an extended advertisement for upcoming projects for Britney Spears herself and Britney's strengths are not put anywhere near enough to good use as an attempt to shed from her pop idol image.\n\nIn summary, was expecting much worse but 'Crossroads' to me, even when judging it with an open mind, was a long way from good. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

Anson Mount even comes off okay despite playing the stereotype 'hunky' guy. Spears looks great and certainly has acting potential, she just needs to be in a better movie. You can just imagine how the pitch must have gone before production began: 'Let's make a low budget road movie where Britney struts around in skimpy clothes and has 'issues'. We'll make a fortune even if it stinks.' The disheartening thing is... they were right."

Spears, playing sickly-sweet about-to-graduate Lucy, didn't try anything outside of her amateurish acting range with \"Crossroads,\" and while cheesy, the movie isn't a bomb. Viewers follow Lucy and her two grade-school best friends on a road trip across the country, driven by a predictable hunky and possibly dangerous older guy (with a heart of gold). Along the way, Lucy discovers love and a talent for kareoke (who knew?), while her friends \"grow\" similarly from their coming-of-age experience.\n\nThe script is no less predictable than any average teenage-aimed romantic comedy (or did \"She's All That?\" win an Oscar when I wasn't looking?). Spears' co-stars are a solid teen-ish ensemble, with Anson Mount, in particular, pulling of a performance that was at once scornful of Spears' typical audience and endearing all the same. Dan Akyroyd is sorely underused as Lucy's father; Kim Cattral has an almost cameo appearance as Lucy's long-lost mother.\n\nBottom line: unlike most Britney Spears videos, this is one that's safe to watch with the kids."

With a few Corrections, better directing and having the acting been a little better.....this may of been a halfway decent film. The Acting of Ben Kimble was pretty good for an unknown. Britney tries her hardest to act but dosent do a real good job of it. The Plot of the fiml wasnt that bad- if it only had some more spice..it may of been good. The Flow was awful and this is mostly blamed on the directing which was also preety pitiful. If you had Rob Riner directing, this may of been a totally diffrent and much better film.

It is by no means a classic or even average for that matter but I think a lot of the vitriol for this film has to do with Britney Spears being the star. For whatever reason many people resent her. Many do so because they perceive that she has marginal talent and has only been given the opportunities she has because of her undeniable good looks (I think her vocal prowess could be better but she is a commanding stage performer; then again would anyone buy her albums if she didn't look the way she does?) All that aside, I think this film will also have considerable less mass appeal because it has been so intensely targeted towards girls in the 10-17 age group. It is difficult for other members of the viewing public to identify with the three main characters. I don't fall into the target audience but I thought Britney did a fair job given the material she had to work with. I think the film could've been improved if they trimmed or eliminated some of the other story lines and focused more on Britney's. For instance it would have been interesting to actually see her mother in essence reject her instead of just the aftermath to that event. My score: 5/10."

So I had to watch it.\n\nWell, the basic idea for the script was NOT bad. A movie about the problems of teenager girls. That is, about friendship between girls, finding an identity, finding their own way, boyfriends, first sex, date rape, unwanted pregnancy and so on.\n\nUnfortunately, the script author didn't managed to get a really interesting story out of it. Instead of some living characters, we only get more or less stereotypical ones. It was however very realistic, and mentioned many of the real life problems teenager girls might get into.\n\nAnd who wants to see Britney in underwear (and likewise dressings), throughout the whole movie again and again and again ? That was not very original.\n\nAnother problem of the movie was music. Many scenes where only there to promote the new song of Britney, 'Not a girl', and therefore simply nerved.\n\nThe acting, however, was really not bad. I didn't expected anything from Britney, but in fact I've to state that I've seen far worser actresses than her. The script was the problem, not her acting.\n\nBut what also really sucked was Britneys idea that she could actually sing. It wasn't really a big problem as long as she was singing her own material. But at one place of the movie, she compares herself to nobody less than - Joan Jett ! By singing Jett's song \"I love Rock n' Roll\" before a mass of people, who pretended that her singing was actually good, while in fact she had not even enough voice to be really understandable ! It was so bad, so abysmal, so painfull !!!\n\nThe acting of the others wasn't bad either, I especially liked Taryn Manning (appeared already in Crazy/Beautiful with Kirsten Dunst).\n\nIf you want to watch a really good movie of this kind, I would recommend the fantastic masterpiece 'Strike' with Heather Matarazzo, Kirsten Dunst, Rachael Leigh Cook, Lynn Redgrave and many others, plus an excellent script. One of the seldom movies that had actually something to tell to me.\n\nThis one here only recommended for those teenage girls who are Britney fans."

But I wish this movie was as bad as those, because at least then it would be interesting. This is one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time. It's obvious that this was directed at a teen girl audience (not me), so there's lots of the girls just \"hanging out\" and friends bonding I guess. But as it is, it feels like you're just hanging out with 3 random girls (and some dude) that you don't really care about - which is not very interesting even in real life. They could have introduced some random events to make things interesting. Maybe some weird guy steals their luggage and they have to track it down and steal it back. Maybe the cops mistake one of the girls for a criminal and they have to get away. I don't know, something, anything. Britney sings well, but even the songs were boring. I guess it's better than Gigli?"

I could have done without the lame references to Britney's real life songs and some of the singing seemed like overkill, but the rest of the movie was perfectly alright.\n\nPeople condemned this movie before they even saw it because they saw Britney Spears' name in the cast list. Give it a chance, because it wasn't as horrible as everyone says."

Now that I decide to watch it on Nexflix more than 20 years after its release, I realized that this movie brings some nostalgic about the good times of Britney Spears, and a period that makes me remember about the things I was into during that moment. I'm sure that this is now a cult movie because marks this period of time, 2002, and even when the storyline is a classic cliche, I'm so sure that new generation will enjoy it ,and that through it, will know much about who is in fact Britney Spears. Her performance in this movie was okay, and the cast was very good. It's enjoyable to see a Dan Aykroyd as a loving father, who is worry for his daughter, and to see a Kim Cattrall playing the part of an indiferent mother. Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning have both a good chemical charm together with Britney. And Anson Mount did a good interpretation of the nice guy that try to understand this group of girls that become his new close friends. In conclusion, I recommed to see the movie to know more about Britney and to enjoy again how was the early 2000s years."

I expected a movie on par with Plan 9 - my expectations were low. Turns out its not that bad of a movie. The scripting is highly competent, though fairly unoriginal and linear and less sappy than expected. The acting is, for the most part, good, and the production values high. It reminded me of Varsity Blues if it had a more female-oriented cast and slant. Quite cleverly the scriptwriters write a character that is an aspiring singer so Ms. Spears doesn't have to stretch to far (though she actually isn't that bad) when she acts sort of in the same manner Hulk Hogan played himself/a wrestler in every movie. Wouldn't buy it, but it's worth a rent if you want a tolerable date movie or if you don't feel like watching anything too thought-provoking."

In my opinion, I thought she did pretty good, especially for her first movie. I think a lot of girls can relate to this movie. And while some scenes could definitely have been done better, it was all around a pretty good movie. And the other actors in this did extremembly well. I honestly think it would've been much more accepted if most people did not already have a bad impression of Britney Spears."

Britney Spears smart?? A doctor??? A nerd??? Willing to lose her virginity to a geek???? It was so absurdly funny.\n\nLike an above poster said, the film was basically an extended video clip. They never stopped singing, much to the delight of many twelve year olds in the audience.\n\nBasically, the film was what I expected- a shallow storyline centered around Britney Spears, who was often singing and semi naked.\n\nI would recommend this film to 12 year old girls, dirty old men, and people who like to laugh at pathetic films."

No doubt she could have gone instead for a big studio film, but quite courageously, she's chosen to cut her teeth on something rather more gritty. Yes, her performance is at times a little raw, but surely that's the point - this is, after all, a film about three teenage girls and their struggle to cope with impending adulthood, as they try to come to terms with what were once their dreams. This is a warm, thoughtful film, finely directed by Tamra Davis, with well-judged performances all-round. Its a production which truly manages to make the most of its \"independent\" feel.\n\nGo and see it for yourself - you won't be disappointed."

I appreciate the movie for the story that it tells young women, that their friends are above all else the most important, as well as the historical importance it serves to show us what the early 2000s were like and what Shonda Rhimes was about before Grey's Anatomy.

Britney Spears has a great presence on screen, and I enjoyed watching her play a character so unlike her public image (the reserved, don't follow-your-dreams girl that she is at the beginning of the movie.) I also loved the friendship between the three girls, and I loved watching them get closer and closer as the movie went on and they each grew up a bit in their own way, in their own time. The movie didn't show three girls being told what they needed to do to become the people that they wanted to be, it SHOWED them discovering this for themselves. Britney was fantastic in the singing sequences -- no secret there. And who wouldn't like a movie about a road trip across the country with your friends?"

I've read other comments on Britney's acting ability and the quality of the direction and script. The script and direction were poor but hardly Britney's fault and I've seen much worse, such as Random Hearts (Starring Harrison Ford) and Toys (Robin Williams). The acting, however, give the girl a break for goodness sake, it's her first film, you'll be hard pressed to find a better film debut from many bar the greatest Hollywood actors. Take Heather Graham, star of many films, she can't play anything more than an airhead and can't even do that well (see Austin Powers 2 for an example), yet she has no trouble finding work. I'm annoyed that the worst reviews are reserved for people who the public or press love to hate, this is not a bad film, it is however aimed at Britney fans not the small minded jealous fools that can't handle the fact that not all entertainment is designed for them. If you don't like Britney, don't watch the film, don't comment on the film and accept the fact that Britney's going to be around for many years to come."

Britney Spears is now my favourite singer, despite all rumors about her. and also, Anson Mount is such a babe! all you girls out there got to agree with me! i think what makes it special is that they didn't stay best friends through the whole time, that makes it original, in most movies about friendship they stay friends forever but its not usually like that. To me, this movie is by far the best and if you haven't seen it, i sincerely suggest that you do so as soon as you can!"

I loved it. best movie ever, Britney did a wonderful job and was really impressed what she can do. good job Britney. this movie takes people through the true life inccidents we teenagers go through; sex, alcohol, and just getting through life. We want to explore ourselves and i believe Britney wanted to. So we should thank her and buy not only the movie but also her great albums. I love Britney and wish her the best in her career.

If I could chose any movie to watch over and over again, it would be a tie between Crossroads and Beaches (Bette Midler, Barbara Hershey). They are my two favorite movies and honestly, I'm not sure I could choose just one to watch. The cast did a great job on this movie and I think Britney did an excellent job picking this script for her first movie. I just wish that you can see the love and hard work she put in to it as I have. So, I beg you, watch it again and have an open mind. Cause she says on the DVD that she can kind of relate to Lucy.

Memorable scenes include Britney in the shower, Britney losing her virginity and Britney dancing in her underwear to a Madonna pop-classic (a nod to her idol). Albeit not a brilliant film, it does earn the \"so bad that it's good\" tag, because it's ten times better than any Mariah or Whitney vanity project, it does show Britney can act (a little).

I'm now 33 and I still love this movie...it's adorable, it's wholesome, it has romance, laughter, heart break and all the little things in between that make it beautiful.\n\nI only recently read Britneys book and, realising what she went through during her formative years right up until the dissolution of her conservativeship, just made me see this film on a whole other level\n\nIf you go into it taking if for what it is, a heart felt coming of age story, then you can't not love it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rewatching Crossroads recently with two girlfriends made me realise how deeply under appreciated this film was at its time. Yes it's not perfect, but it tackles female struggles and issues in a way that was daring for the early 00's. Not only that, but the organic chemistry between all actors made the sisterhood journey relatable and fun. We cried, laughed, sang and giggled at the corny bits, but never once did Crossroads dip or disappoint us. Although Britney Spears admittedly isn't known for her acting prowess, her debut showed a sense of vulnerability and genuineness that carried the case. Do yourself a favour, and rewatch this time capsule gem."

I grew up with this music being the soundtrack to my life.\n\nThis movie needed only to appeal to Britney Spears fans. It didn't require a complex narrative outside of a typical road movie with Britney at it's centre.\n\nHowever, in spite of that, it pushes past the basics and is more layered than it is given credit for. Yes, there are scenes solely for the fans, that can feel cheesy. Yes, it's a teen movie aimed at a younger audience. But it deals with some very serious adult themes that are displayed with great acting - emotional scenes that to this day still have me well up.\n\nThis movie does NOT deserve the low rating it has. I can only assume this is down to the wrong target audience, or Britney Spears non-fans not able to understand that this movie wasn't made for them."

It's very nostalgic.\n\nCrazy to see god dad Zoe Saldaba has come too.\n\nI wish Britney did more movies and got to stay true to herself and her artistry without all the trauma and interference."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wanted in 2024 on Netflix, wife is 34 and hubby is 37.\n\nNot only holds up, but actually is a good movie. I always liked this movie. I remember when it would come on tv or paid movie channels on the tv. It came to Netflix recently and hubby wanted to watch it for the first time. I warned him by saying it's not a masterpiece and it's a bit dated, also a girls movie. He said that's cool let's do it.\n\nWe start watching. Britney looked amazing! Her hair was beautiful, her skin was perfect, and her stomach was insanely in shape. Her acting wasn't great but I've definitely seen worse. Zoe and Taryn are great. They've always been so great. And both look so young and both played their characters perfectly. Anson (the guy) was great too, hubby didn't realise he'd be in the entire movie. But once he realized he was from Star Trek he loved seeing him in this. Hubby also enjoyed Dan Akroyd as the dad.\n\nThe story itself is cute. Very basic, road trip rekindling a friendship and starting adulthood. I enjoyed the fun moments and the bratty moments. The immaturity of the characters and the bond they all form is super cute. Most of the outfits hold up except the way too oversized sleeves at the end.\n\nNo spoilers in this review but there are heart breaking moments. Nothing that is unsuitable for teens or young adults. But will hit you in the feels. Ending is cute. Ties it all up nicely.\n\nI enjoyed this rewatch. Hubby really enjoyed it. (He had a thing for Britney as a teenager). While I feel like Easy A is up there as far as must watch for our kids as we watched Grease and the Breakfast Club. I'd like to add Crossroads to that list."

This is a movie for young teenagers; this movie represents the very problems teenagers today in America face. And if you aren't familiar with these situations, then maybe you might not have enjoyed it, as much as someone who does. It truly is a wonderful movie, though I don't suggest watching it with your parents. Maybe your girlfriends or a close-to-age sister. I watched it today and for the 4th time. The laughs are still funny. The music is still wonderful. And the actors are still excellent. It is definitely one of my favorite movies, and I strongly suggest that you watch it, especially if you haven't seen it. If you have, watch it again! It's a good movie."

It covered a number of topics from teenage pregnancy to the pressures of losing your virginity in society today. We feel that the movie can be improved upon in a few minor ways such as the casting of Whoopi Goldberg as Britney's long lost mother. We also felt that it was unrealistic that Britney lost her virginity at a open window on the beach but who we are to cast stones. The perm featured in the karaoke scene seemed a tad unlikely as it just sprung from nowhere...who knows? Maybe Britters stuck her finger in a plug socket!! Also the DVD edition has a wide array of extra features which are essential for hours of britilicious entertainment. Bring on the Oscar, Britney deserves an Academy Award."

I think that this, much like most of Madonna's movies, was intended for Britney's target audience. This is definitely a chick flick. There's no doubt. But the movie is intended more for a teenage audience. Because I am so young, I think I could relate and it really got me into it when watching this film. I liked it. It sends a positive message to teenagers out there. And in general, sometime we all have to grow up, and this movie definitely shows that. Sure this movie might be somewhat corny, but like I said it's a chick flick, which ones aren't. In general if I had to some this movie up in 3 words I would say: Real, Emotional, and Fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen around 15 of the Bottom 100 films according to us users of IMDB.. and around half of them, don't deserve to be in that list at all!! weak they are, but dire, no.. but this is one of my strongest candidates for removal. Now i ain't going to say Crossroads is some masterpiece, far from.. but it seems people are being much too cynical towards it, maybe they see it as simply being some marketing tool for Britney Spears. Sure she may sing two tracks from her album, and she ends up becoming a singer of sorts in the story, but that doesn't seem to be the prime focus or drive of the film, but if she didn't sing, then a lot of her real fans would have been very disappointed.\n\nAnd people who say Britney is an AWFUL Actress should really go see some more films. She performed her role as well as any debut actress could, in no way would i say she even comes close to being rated as poor, and neither did any of the proffesional critics think that either! Critics may be harsh with films, but they generally know their stuff about performances. I thought she did pretty well, and didn't seem to just play herself, though her debut role really should have been even less of her and more someone else, if she wanted to make a mark in the world of film. Mandy Moore seemed to make the right move in that respect.\n\nSo the film, the story has no real inspiration or passion, it's very by the numbers, the 'twist' can be seen a thousand miles off, and at the end the movie is nothing more than a glossy TV Movie. But like most ok TV Movies, they pass the time quite well, just like this one.. sure it's pretty cheesy in places, but i can see a certain age group of girls really liking this film.. it's been very well made for them.\n\nI personally would have preffered Britney's debut film to have taken itself less seriously, and be more in vein with something like She's All That, something a bit more frothy that didn't try too hard at being all grown up and mature, with teenage pregnancies and runaway mothers. A huge proportion of people who are going to see a film like this and be the key flagposts in a strong word-of-mouth campaign would be slightly older teens.. and Britney it seems would have been perfect for a well made film like that. i.e Bring It On, many guys went to see it just for the girls in short skirts, but most of them went on to recommend it to friends, because it was completely unpretensious and totally enjoyable, while appealing to both sexes.. had they coupled that with seeing Britney in her underwear, then they would have had a sure-fire hit, and a much stronger rating here.\n\nThis would probably sound less offensive if i was female, but her next film should be directed by a man.. no disrespect to Tamra Davis, i LOVE Billy Madison and Half-Baked, but when it comes to handling women on screen and their sexuality, no one does it better than a man.. look at what Hitchcock did for his leading ladies!!\n\nIf you are wondering whether to watch this film, and are not really a fan of Britney, but just wanted to watch a teen movie, then i would personally recommend a few others before this one.. but i wouldn't completely disregard it. Non-Cynical movie goers will find it a good enough diversion for 90 minutes. As for Britney fans (like myself) i'd off course be curious to see it, but i'll always be disappointed that it wasn't as strong a debut for her film career as it should have been.. she has obvious screen presence, and i think with the right film, she could win a huge amount of new older fans... it's hard though as her real-life persona will always interefere with the audience's pre-conception when coming into the film. Hopefully her and her team of people will learn from the mistakes of this film, and think more realistically towards a long term movie career for her, rather than just catering the fickle youngters, who gave the film 1/10 because she didn't get naked or sing 'Baby One More Time'."

The characters are a little too one-dimensional (Lucy's dad, Ben) but this film was made to appeal to a certain type of person. Crossroads is strictly for the under-16 crowd and girls who like a very \"girlie girl\" movie with a pop-star and singing/music. You don't need to be a Spears fan to like this film. What you need to do when viewing it is realizing that Crossroads delivers what it strives to; pure entertainment with some typical teen drama. A-"

The love Story in the movie is amazing and the cast is great, and Britney Rocks."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was a little skeptical going into Crossroads. When Britney Spears in the star, you know you're going to be surrounded by teeny-boppers. Yet, the movie really wasn't one for this pre-teen crowd. I think that viewers really have to be in high school to at least have some understanding of the film.\n\nWhen I was in my senior year of high school a movie called Can't Hardly Wait hit theaters. The movie depicts a high school graduation and the summer following. I remember looking at this film and thinking, how do they know exactly what I'm going through? Because everyone does, and the whole process of growing up really occurs between the ages of 18-22, that's the time when we discover who we really are and what we really want out of life. Crossroads has a lot of the same themes.\n\nI'm 21 and a senior in college- graduating in May! And, even though Crossroads depicts a group of friends who have just graduated from high school, the feelings are the same. People seem to make fun of the lyrics, \"I'm not a girl but not yet a woman...\" But it's so true and real. Whether coming out of high school or college, it's like \"Oh My God, that's the real world!\" But the truth is, I'm not a girl, I'm not a kid, but at the same time, I'm not a grown-up yet either. Yet, come May I'll be looking for a real job in the real world. And, now's the time when I think and try to figure everything out. Sifting through my fears and hopes and dreams and trying to find who I am and where I'm going. And meanwhile realizing that I didn't get any more out of college than an education- I didn't ever really have fun or just act wild or let myself go. This movie makes me want to get a group of friends together and take a crazy roadtrip!\n\nTo the pre-teen crowd, sure the song sounds silly. And the same crowd (especially the young boys) are thrown by Britney's belly shots and dancing in her underwear. But these kids have no concept of many of the mature themes in the film- drinking, rape, sex. I can't see taking a ten year old to this film and having to explain what happened to Mimi and how she got pregnant.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to tell everyone- DON'T LET BRITNEY FOOL YOU! The film has a powerful message and explores all the fears and desires we all experience during the real years of growing up."

        "review_detailed_main": "In no way is Crossroads bad, but it's not very memorable.\n\nJust like Britney herself, you either like this movie or hate it. Personally, I enjoyed it, and was surprised at how sad it was. It was never meant to be an Oscar winner, or even be a critical darling, but it was made for Britney and for her fans. The movie itself is about a trio of girls that have grown apart, and grow close together again while going on a road trip. The acting is genuine, but a little stiff . Britney is not a bad actress, and this acting is far superior than some would like you to believe.\n\nThe chemistry between the cast is good and it shows in the movie. If you HATE Britney Spears, well then obviously you aren't really gonna like a movie that was made for her. If you do happen to like Britney, then you most likely have already seen this movie, and thusly formed your own opinion.\n\nThe movie does have many faults, and it's plot is kind of rushed and lethargic. Crossroads kinda lays it all on at the end, with a lot of bad things happening, that it seems kind of unbelievable.\n\nThe movie tries to tackle too many issues that affect teenage girls, and it works to an extent...but it also comes across a little sappy.\n\nThe thing that I really liked about the movie though, are the characters and the people that played them. Zoe Saldana, Anson Mounts, Taryn Manning, and Britney Spears really make the movie, and they were really the only characters that matter. I know the movie has limited appeal, but it's unfair to call it awful or the worst movie ever just because Britney Spears is in it and many people can't take her, and thusly this movie, seriously.\n\nI guess the bottom line is that if you like Britney, you may like it; if you don't care about her, then you won't care about this movie; and if you loathe her, you will loathe this movie."

I did feel Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall were a strange choice but actually weren't too bad.\n\nI went into the cinema expecting something easy to watch with not much storyline, what I got was an emotional journey that made me look at my own life in a completely different way. I've always been an admirer of Britney's but I wasn't getting my hopes up over her acting skills after reading so many poor reviews.. now I'm glad I went and I certainly won't be taking any notice of film critics any more.. no actually I will...

I mean come on does anyone remember glitter, now that was just a ridiculous movie (although Mariah has an amazing voice) so in comparison crossroads does have its good points.

Personally, I've noticed that some of these people impress me more as actors than singers. Aside from some of them, Britney is good at both. I enjoy her talent as a performer on stage and as an actress on the movie screen. In her first movie, \"Crossroads,\" her character's name is Lucy, a girl who accompanies her two girlfriends on a road trip and realizes the woman she is becoming at the same time. Althouth this movie has been bashed by many people, I feel it is an excellent movie for its genre. Too many people expect too much out of so called \"chick flicks\" and they are so quick to shoot them down, but take some time out and think about what's happening in the movie and the messages it is providing to its viewers. Two of the important themes in the movie are friendship, and growing up. What is so wrong about that? Does a movie always have to be a documentary or an action packed movie with elements of death and darkness in it to be considered good. Sometimes a cute little comedy or drama is very satisfactory."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not a little teenybopper and after seeing CROSSROADS, I found that I actually enjoyed it! I was entertained thoroughly seeing this movie. I think most of these negative reviews are coming from anti-Britney fans who didn't even bother to see the film and are just saying that Britney Spears is a terrible actress, which she is not. CROSSROADS is a film about friendship, hope, loyality, and \"finding yourself\". In CROSSROADS, we meet Lucy (Britney Spears), Kit (Zoe Saldana - CENTER STAGE), Mimi (Taryn Manning - CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL), and Ben (Anson Mount - newcomer). Lucy, Kit, and Mimi were childhood best friends, but in high school, grew apart from each other and went their own separate ways. Lucy is the smart, valedictorian. Kit is the popular girl. And Mimi is known as the bad, trashy girl. After graduation, Lucy, Kit, and Mimi get back together and decide to go on a road trip to California. Lucy wants to find her mother (she lives with her very overprotected father, played by Dan Aykroyd), who lives in Arizona. Kit wants to see her fiance. And Mimi wants to become a singer. They hitch a ride with the mysterious Ben, whom Lucy falls in love with, and he comes along for the ride. Yes, there is teen drinking and some swearing in the film, and even a little love scene (they really only take off their shirts in that scene) and a few kisses. But basically that's it. It's not as bad as it seems. Plus, if you're really worried about your children seeing this, they rated it PG to be on the safe side. Even the script is okay, because the characters in this film are not perfect people leading perfect lives--they all have different problems that they have to resolve by the end of the movie. And let's face it: we are going to have to deal with teen pregnancy, teen drinking and doing drugs, but I don't think CROSSROADS encourages any of it. And, I personally think Britney Spears is a great actress, singer, dancer, and role model. She doesn't give up on her dreams even though she knows there are tons of people out there always making remarks about her and dissing her and everything. That's why I think Britney's a great role model...not because of her clothes or the way she looks. You may disagree with me but this is just my opinion. Also, another thing: don't ever listen to professional critics because they always bash teen movies--just look at what they did to Mandy Moore's A WALK TO REMEMBER and Mariah Carey's GLITTER--and I thought those were both excellent movies, too! So my whole point is, go see CROSSROADS. You don't need to be a Britney fan to enjoy this movie. I am not the hugest Britney fan, but I do appreciate her, respect her as a person, and I like her music. I can't wait for the DVD of CROSSROADS--I hope there will be some great special bonus features! See CROSSROADS and you won't be disappointed."

There was this one person who said that it was SOO horrible and that he felt sorry for the brainless young girls that want to go see it. Well, you know what? I have a friend and she LOVES Britney and SHE'S SMARTER THAN YOU ARE!!!!!!!!!!! I went to see that movie too and it wasn't bad. Britney did a good job (as usual) and the other people were good too. It wasn't predictable and badly-written as everyone says it is. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 45.

It also shows the changes that many go through from their teen years to mature adults... This film, in my opinion, was given bad reviews because critics were not giving Britney Spears a chance. When I first heard the film was coming out, I had an open mind, but many were already criticizing the movie before they had the chance to see it. The acting in this movie was comparable to that of Mandy Moore's in A Walk to Remember; however, Mandy Moore was given high reviews and praised for her performance. Britney Spears was not. I believe you should have an open mind when watching this film, and give Britney Spears a chance. Kim Cattral was excellent in this movie along with Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning.\n\nAlthough this movie did have some cliches' that many other teenage films have, I believe this movie had excellent acting, a great plot, and a great leading actress."

Just because she is a pop star don't mean that she is a bad actress. Is a lovely movie from a lovely girl. With their concerns and their good times. A girl that tries to discover her fate and her life sense. Fortunately, Britney is much smarter than many of you and your opinion have no care for her. She knows has made a good movie and that's more than enough for her. You can take you all of the hand and go to Disneyland to see Mickey Mouse. I'll stay with Britney... In Spain the film is known as \"Crossroads: Until the End\". I say the same... I love you, honey."

Britney is real and plays her character greatly. Zoe Saldana is really funny throughout the film and just cracks me up big time. The girl who plays Mimi is real and just a character who reminds me of my people I know. She's also really funny and a crack up too. This film is great and greatly acted and really really funny and sometimes sad. 10/10"

Sure, there are some bad scenes, and there are some where you laugh with embarresment for the actors, but it is still likable and easy to sit through.\n\nMy Grade: B"

Britney was surprisingly talented as an actor. She was very natural. Her friends played their roles perfectly.\n\nI'm a Woody Allen fan, and for those of you who are too (though I somehow doubt too many Woody fans will be reading this review), watch this movie and look for the scene where Britney and her nerdy lab partner are about to lose their virginities (preemptively) and the guy douses himself with baby-powder... that scene is a nod to the scene in Woody Allen's \"Bananas\", and the kid even stammers and jokes in a very Woody Allenesque sort of way. So that makes me think that there were decent writers behind this script- hence it's a good movie.\n\nThe movie is also genuinely funny. The plot is very cohesive, and the dialogue is very real. I am not ashamed to say I liked this movie. It was better than most movies that are put out today- which are lame, clich\u00e9, wannabe indie pieces of trash. This movie will probably go down in cult coming-of-age film history."

(Fact=Anson Mount wasn't sure about doing a Britney movie but Robert DeNiro said 'Why Not? She's Great!' and he decided to do it!=Robert's a Britney fan!) It's quite enjoyable, some bits are funny even when they're not meant to be!-like the 'sad' bits.

Her two friends, Kit and Mimi, do a good job too. There are many funny moments in Crossroads, but I won't spoil them. There are also a few very emotional moments, too. But they just make the movie more special and meaningful to me.\n\nAfter seeing Crossroads twice now, I'm now looking forward to seeing Brit's next movie, which is probably a part in the next Austin Powers. But Crossroads is currently my favorite movie. You did it again, Britney! 10/10!"

Britney acts just fine in it - totally natural - didn't make me feel like she was overacting or anything. She convinced me in her dramatic scenes, and showed that she's capable of expressing any human emotion that she has to. Besides, it's a typical chick-flick, so it didn't bother me that the plot was predictable or anything. It's a fun movie to watch. I gave it an eight because even though it is a seven in my opinion (I reserve higher marks to movies that are truly exceptional in this genre like Pretty Woman, or When Harry Met Sally), I want to help raise its average rating. In other words, I'm well aware that this is no extraordinary film. but it does what is expected of it just fine - entertain you for about an hour and a half.\n\nAnd I repeat - I don't know why so many people trash Britney's acting abilities - she handled herself just fine and I dare say that if she ever stars in another movie I'll go see it or at least rent it if my friends are too judgmental to go see such a movie with me...\n\nBritney - rock on! :-)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The basis of my enjoyment of this nice-girl-getting-to-know-old-friends-while-rebelling-against-overbearing-parents film were the performances of its three female leads. Britney was fine and ultra engaging in a role not far removed from her music world persona; Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning as her partners-in-crime fared well also, (although I could never quite get past the feeling that the characters had only ever been friends for the sake of the situation; i.e. Saldana and Manning never achieved any real chemistry with Britney, despite striking a rapport between themselves. Anson Mount as Ben provided the 'eye candy'; an effect that was lost on me being in the demographic the film wasn't setting out to aim for, (19 yo hetro white male,) but his performance was adequate enough and he achieved the requisite chemistry with Britney, (though I laughed at the artful taste of 'that scene' where a lot of fluttering sheets and whistling curtains replace what the world wanted to see and, I expect, what Britney knew we wanted to see.)\n\nDan Aykroyd fared surprisingly well in a thankless sort of a role, while Kim Cattrall's cold-as-ice scene left me disappointed that more time couldn't have been used to posit an explanation for her coldness, (after all, if I remember rightly, she hung around until Lucy was three; what made her run off? Surely Dan Aykroyd couldn't have been THAT hard to live with...)\n\nThe scene in which Ben writes some music for 'that poem you read me last night' contains what must be one of the film's funniest moments, when we are desperately persuaded that 'Not A Girl...' is a completely new song that has only just been conceived. I don't know what coverage there has been in other parts of the world, but I first heard the song before September 11, so the moment lacked that wonder for me.\n\nAs far as musical numbers went, I thought that they were too 'realistic' to be impressive. I found particularly 'I Love Rock 'n Roll' wasn't any more impressive than a mediocre karaoke night. I felt that it would have been more effective had it broken out of the 'reality' of the story, (any good musical movie does this; think Woody Allen's 'EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.')\n\nI enjoyed the movie a lot, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed stifling smirks at the blatant plugging of Pepsi, (apparently every gas station in America stocks and advertises Pepsi, while neglecting to display that other reasonably well-known and popular red coloured bottle,) and those bottles of Clariol Herbal Essences (I've got the urge!) I also appreciated the subtle advertising of that boy band that must have had some connection to either the director or one of the stars, I dunno...\n\nI will warn now: I am biased in that I am a fan of Britney's stage persona, and thus found it engaging in this context. Although the other performances were fine, DON'T see it for that. If you find Britney irritating/annoying, save your $10 and see another music-based film out last year, 'MOULIN ROUGE.' Now I'm thirsty. Might go grab a Pepsi with a Clairoil chaser...\n\nBYE BYE BYE!\n\n**** out of 5."

Britney acted decently, and there were a few genuinely funny scenes. I ended up coming home and recommending the movie to my wife.\n\nI don't think there are any Oscar nominations coming, but overall Crossroads is a good movie. It is too bad that the movie will get trampled on just because it has a famous pop star in the lead role. It was certainly better than \"Slackers,\" and \"American Pie 2\" and all the other tired teen movies that have been out recently."

When this film came out I was interested in seeing how she would do in a full length film. I can honestly say I was surprised by how well she did and how good the movie was.\n\nFor her first performance in a movie, she did fantastic. Let us all not forget how horrible some of our favorite stars did in their first films. I would recommend this film to everyone and anyone. The film had the right mix of acting and singing, and it was hilarious to see Dan Akroyd back in a major motion picture. He was awesome, and watching this movie made me want to go home and pop in The Great Outdoors, and awesome Dan Akroyd movie.\n\nI went to go see this film with my fiancee, and even though he kicked and dragged every inch of the way to the theater, he thought that the movie was great. Don't let your taste in music get in the way of seeing this film. His favorite bands are metallica and Godsmack, mine are Bush and Limp Bizkit and we both loved the film!\n\nSo just in case any of the actors of the film see this, you all did awesome, don't let the negative feedback get to you! It's a great film."

The jokes were humourous and Anson Mount was a sweetheart. Britney's acting wasn't worth an Academy award, but it was a great first effort. The script was extremely predictable, but it didn't take away from the happy, youthful feeling that I left the theatre with. I'm not ashamed to say that I really enjoyed this fun flick, not to mention the fact that Britney's song \"Not a Girl, Not yet a Woman\" has been replaying in my head for days."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll admit that \"the Britney Spears\" movie was the last place in the world I expected to find myself earlier this afternoon. I mean, I consider myself a girl with a good head on her shoulders, and also a little too old to fall into the traditional marketing scheme that this movie obviously is. Honestly, I expected it to be awful, I mean, truly awful. I was dragged to it with MORE than low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. For one thing, this movie deserves \"cuteness\" points. It really is the most precious thing I've seen in a while, and that's saying a lot, considering I do most of my TV watching with the 4 and under crowd. But, \"Crossroads\" definitely had some cinematic merit as well. While it was a little predictable, for my part, that only served to make me feel smart and on top of things. The characters were pretty classic stereotypes, but not too over done, and made the movie easier to identify with, in the same sense as a farce is easy to laugh at because you know what to expect from the characters before they even open their mouths. I did find myself rolling my eyes at some of the scenes, and the way that the director chose to convey some of his messages, but overall, the content of the movie wasn't horrible. My biggest complaint, however, is the focus on sex in this movie. Now, I don't want to sound like an over protective mother (or grandmother) because I'm not, I'm a 16 year old girl and I like a good sex joke as much as the next teen, but the way sex was portrayed in \"Crossroads\" was still a little unsettling. On the one hand, the dangers of unprotected sex, and sex too soon were addressed with Mimi's character, a pregnant teen. But, on the other, 30 minutes into the movie, Britney and her lab partner are trying to loose their virginity, just so they won't be \"losers\". While she doesn't loose it then, Britney's character DOES make a big deal about having sex later. I know it sounds old fashioned and stuffy, but that 4 and under crowd I was talking about earlier really tend to look up to people like Britney Spears, and I'm afraid that the whole sex subplot might have been a bad idea. On the one hand, it's not so bad (I mean it IS a PG-13 movie, and it's just sex), but on the other hand, for most of the movie, Britney's character is the OBVIOUS role model (And when I say obvious, I mean it. She was the nice one, the grounded one, the good one, the talented one, the VALEDICTORIAN for crying out loud!) , and then she goes and does the deed. As a teenager, it doesn't bother (or even really phase)me, but if I was a mother (or even had a little sister) I might be really bothered by that. It was like Britney's character couldn't REALLY be happy or fulfilled until she wasn't a virgin any more. I mean, why did that matter in the first place?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I left extra stars to compensate for the TRULY AWFUL & undeserved rating this movie has! When it came out, I was 14 or almost. I actually remember really liking it & maybe a few parts I felt were cheesy or corny but honestly most of the movies & books are over the top cheesy & corny bc they are created by 1 person's idea & tend to be much more dramatic for effect. Think about it we get 1 person's faults, hopes, thoughts, fantasies, & oddities typically in an idea. So, of course some might not be quite what WE think it should be. Then when you filter it thru all the different hands it goes through b4 being a finished project there's more added & taken away or just tweaked a bit. It's edited for time & sometimes edited to get a certain rating. That's not even considering the actors themselves (this is for movies or shows). Actors can add things when playing a character.\n\nAnyways, back to the actual movie review. I find it's a really good movie! DEFINITELY has the Nostalgic part covered for me & I'm SURE many many others from the same generation. I think it got a LOT of criticism bc Britney Spears was the lead & it's like a lot of ppl WANTED her to fail! The level criticism &expectations & ppl just over-analyzing EVERYTHING about her was INTENSE! But bc she was a Pop-Star & not an actress or unknown they held her to a different standard. She's also a polarizing person too & there's a ton of stigma surrounding her & fans. But if you take out all of that you have a pretty d@mn good movie w\\great music & that's a lot of fun.\n\nI will say 1 scene that always bothered me was Ben freaking out all angry abt them driving. It's fine for him to be bothered but he definitely was over the top slapping the seat in anger & storming off throwing a tantrum. I felt that in the past & watching it today I STILL feel that way. I don't like that scene. (But I think if has a LOT to do w\\my own personal triggers about anger due to spending my entire childhood in a very awful & violent DV environment. So...) As an adult I can find some humor in it & I listened & understood his explanation better. All he really had an owned was that car & he needed it to be HIS. For those not well versed in a LOT of harmful disorders due to crazy home lives such as Eating Disorders &Self-Harm, this is about control. When ppl feel things in their lives are totally out of control & basically running them over & dragging them long, they tend to look for small ways to exert SOME control. They can't control the chaos surrounding them but they CAN control how much or how little the eat. So... That's how I understood & finally listened to what he was saying. The car was his 1 thing. Everything else was chaos & being ruled by everyone else & now there's these 3 girls &he just needed his car to still be HIS. So, I'm less bothered now & more sympathetic! Lol. Okay thanks for coming to my Ted Talk if you managed to read all this! Sorry so long!"

All in all, I made it through about what mist be halk of the film before I had to take off, and hours later I remembered I started watching it and actually wanted to finish the film. That's not the hallmark of a truly terrible film.\n\nI say it's great bc I can see myself as a tween adoring this movie back in the early aughts.

Im surprised she's not doing any other movies, because she has a very natural ability. The music choices was very smart. Even though the songs were off her album, the songs fit in to the story extremely well and seemed realistic. Anson Mount(Ben) was super hot in it, Zoe Saldana(kit) played the mean girl part well, but was still very likable. Taryn Manning(Mimi) was just simply cute and easily to laugh at. Kim Cattrall wasn't in the movie very much, and I didn't like her part very well. I think she could have played her role out a little more likable. I didn't believe her character. However Britney was very believable and that's all the matters!"

Britney actualy shows good screen presence and is believable and watchable in her part, her lack of experience does show but she definitely has promise and is probably the best thing about this film... though the film itself is actualy kinda fun to watch if you are in the mood for some light breezy fluff... sure the story flaws, such as Britney being an unpopular high school girl (not very likely), are numerous.. but hey it's still fun to watch and Brit gets to sing a few songs to promote her new CD.. what more could you ask for?

She did a great job during her first stint on SNL but her last one wasn't as great. (I'm guessing its because the great cast members were gone by then, i.e. Wil Farrell) Usually when you're great at one thing, you're only okay at anything else. Kobe Bryant is arguably the best Basketball Player today but he can't rap a lick. But being that I'm a big fan, I threw away all doubts and I put my $8 to support her and I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting 3 best friends to go on a road trip to become famous, *sigh*, not a very interesting story at all. But the fact that they were not best friends when the trip started and that they all were on the trip for very different reasons was a great change. The audition was not even Lucy's reason for the trip. It was only to see her mom. The chemistry between all the characters was impeccably real. The situations and issues that were dealt with are all real and some even hit home with me. Namely the situation between Lucy and her mom. Overall, I was very impressed. Brit, Zo\u00eb, Taryn and Anson did a great job of bringing real loveable characters to life. My hat's off to you all. And Britney . . . What can I say? When you're good, you're good."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm noticing a large number of negative comments from other IMDB reviewers about how bad this movie \"sucks\", \"blows\", \"never should have been made\". I'd like to ask those folks if they like Ms.Spears AT ALL. Do they bob their heads when \"Oops I did it again\" comes on the radio? Do they read the interesting in-depth articles in Rolling Stones about her? I have a theory that they do not. There are folks out there that hate whenever anybody gets very popular, no matter how talented or deserved, and I suspect that these reviewers are letting that bias their reviews of this film. Now don't get me wrong, \"Crossroads\" is no Shakespeare production, but it is a cute, and fun film that if you can go into it with an open mind, will surprise you.\n\nThe plot is simple. Three little girls bury a box filled with \"dreams\", and vow to dig it up on their high school graduation night. During that time, the girls grow apart, but they do return to dig up the box from their childhood. This sets the movie in motion to take the girls across the U.S. on a road trip with a guy they barely know in search of (among other things), a recording contract, a missing mother, and a distant fiancee. Sure, some of the situations are predictable, but so what? I haven't been to a movie in YEARS that hasn't had SOME degree of predictability in it's plot. The dialogue is realistic and charming. And the three principle actresses, Zoe Saldana as \"Kit\", Taryn Manning as \"Mimi\" (looking like a modern Soleil Moon Frye from Punky Brewster), and yes, miss Britney Spears as \"Lucy\" are all excellent in their roles, and become characters you quickly care about and want to see the best happen to. Also good is Anson Mount as \"Ben\", the token guy throughout this cross country trip. I particularly liked the scene where he said that his car was the one thing not \"taken over by women yet\". Being a guy who's always managed to have more female friends than male friends, I've been in his shoes many a time! :^) Dan Aykroyd was also good in his role as Britney's single father, although I did keep having \"Ghostbusters\" flashbacks whenever he was on screen, but that's just me...\n\nAlthough most folks are calling this a comedy, it's not a laugh out loud film. It's not meant to be. It's more of a romantic, adventurous, \"Dramedy\" if you want to be exact.\n\nAnd as a final comment to all the naysayers out there... Remember a man named Mark Wahlberg? When his first film came out, wasn't everybody putting HIM down, saying he was nothing more than a flash-in-the-pan pop/rap star? He did record those songs \"Good Vibrations\" and \"Wildside\" with the Funky Bunch, if you recall. Now look at him. Great roles in Renaissance Man, the Basketball Diaries, Boogie Nights, Three Kings, the Perfect Storm and others have elevated him to revered acting status.\n\nI can't help but wonder if a similar career awaits Britney. If so, more power to her, there's nobody more deserved! :^)"

In the past, people and critics would pan movies with pop stars in there like Spice World (The Spice Girls), A Walk to Remember (Mandy Moore), and Glitter (Mariah Carey). Spice World and A Walk to Remember are good movies. I can't say the same for Glitter.\n\nNow, the movie is nowhere near like Spice World or Glitter, because there is less cheesiness in Crossroads than Spice World and Glitter. Britney Spears is not a terrible actress. You all are putting her down as an actress because she is a singer. Cher is both a good actress and singer.\n\nI would recommend this movie for 13 years old or older, because there are some scenes that are inappropriate for younger eyes. If the deleted scenes were added in, then I would recommend it for 16 years old ore older.\n\nRating: 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I must make a short comment on the other reviews I've seen. There seems to be two distinct classes of reviews for this movie: those based on the movie, and those based on the reviewer's feelings toward Britney. I suggest reading those of the first kind (so long as you can differentiate between the two) for two reasons: the first is actually useful in judging what others though of the movie, and the second kind has no purpose since you probably already know what you think of Britney.\n\nOkay, time to get to my review of the movie...\n\nAs many reviews have pointed out, the movie isn't bad, but isn't great either. It's enjoyable and entertaining, but not particularly thought-provoking. Yes, it's predictable, but there's comfort in consistency (that's why people tend to order the same thing every time they go to a fast food place), so that's not such a terrible thing in some respects. No, Britney won't win an Academy Award, but to tell the truth, she's a fine, believable actress. The other two main actresses do pleasant performances as well. The main male actor is easy to watch and looks comfortable in his character, so no complaints there either. Sure, you've seen these characters before in numerous other teen movies, but just think of the collection of teen movies as a sort of series (like the Jack Ryan books of Tom Clancy or Nancy Drew books) where you watch the newest film in the \"series\" to see what these favorite characters have gotten themselves into this time. Don't watch it thinking it's going to blow your mind or spawn days of philosophical pondering in solitude; it's simply meant to be a fun movie that keeps you entertained for a couple hours. If you allow yourself to, you might just find you like the film.\n\nFinal suggestion: Don't watch it with friends who don't like Britney unless you have the same opinion (their comments will most likely take away from the movie and make it impossible to watch unbiased).\n\nThanks for reading my humble opinions."

I went into the movie theater expecting a lame teen melodrama - the kind that's right up there with 'A Walk to Remember' and 'Summer Catch'.\n\nThat is not what I got. Crossroads is a serious dramatic film - yes, it is a teen movie. But it's a serious teen movie. Despite the advertisers trying to play it off as sugary by showing the few happy scenes in it, 'Crossroads' deals with serious issues. Teen pregnancy. Abortion. Divorce. Mis-Carriage. Date Rape.\n\nAll the actors in this film were great, INCLUDING Britney Spears. Whether you like her music or not you have to agree that she put on an incredible performance. Her two friends shine in this film also.\n\nMaybe all the people that have been criticising this film should actually go SEE it instead of just making assumptions based on the previews and characters. Maybe you should actually pay attention and start giving movies a chance. The people that gave this movie a bad review are probably the same people that give plotless action movies like Colateral Damage 4 stars."

I enjoy reliving those awkward moments in life and remembering what it was like some years ago. Crossroads is just like your typical teenage movie, with predictable plots and angst. I didn't go into the movie thinking it was going to be award winning, but I came out quite surprised. I enjoyed it more than I expected, even being a Britney fan (what can I say, the girl is beautiful!).\n\nShe deserves some credit, as well as the other girls who took part. I saw familiar faces and maybe this will be their chance. They all deserve it, and a fair one. I can't believe that everyone who saw the movie could've hated it that much...

The only bad thing about Crossroads, is that in some parts the movie gets boring and drags on, but in the end it's all good. So if you really love Britney Spears, watch the movie, if not, don't."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was hesitant about seeing \u0091Crossroads' mostly because Britney Spears was the main star. Sure, she can sing, dance, whip males into a sexual frenzy, pull off the most revealing outfits, but can she act? It turns out, she can! She impressed me and I like Britney more than ever now. Although she was very good, I didn't think she was the best in the film. Zoe Saldana, who played the pretty, popular little madam Kit and Taryn Manning who played the pregnant, level-headed rock chick Mimi, blew me away. They were fantastic and the chemistry between the characters Kit, Mimi and Lucy (Britney's character) was great fun and very enjoyable to watch. Anson Mount, the mysterious driver Ben, was impressive. I haven't seen him in anything else before and although I didn't think he and Lucy fitted well together, the actor and the character were likeable.\n\nThe only flaw was how the writers droned on about how Britney Spear's was a singer! We knew beforehand but every other scene was her singing, dancing, writing song lyrics and pretending it was poetry. I think Britney's very talented, both musically and in acting, I don't need any reminders! Some might say the film was predictable, and true, some bits were. Still there were twists and surprises.\n\nThe overall film was a feel-good movie, it did have the cheesy lines and moments most films have, but it was fun and lively. I recommend it to anyone looking for a light enjoyable film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am astounded! Can anybody say jealous much???? Yes, you heard me right folks! People are just jealous over Miz Spears! It's blatantly obvious, isn't it?!?!? Anyway, Crossroads is not THAT bad! sure, it's a pretty predictable story, and it has some pretty pathetic scenes, but overall? you get your money's worth. Contrary to what some people might say (y'all know who you are!), Britney is a capable actress. She's very natural, and she does not come across as trying hard. Although in some takes, she does tend to falter a bit. Anson Mount is definitely a hunk and a half! Likewise though, there are some scenes wherein you just want to hit him in the head for a deeper emotion. Zoe Saldana was great as the bitchy highschool princess while the girl playing Mimi (sorry, I forgot her name)was lagging a little on the acting wagon. Dan Aykroyd would have made quite an impact on the film if he was given a bigger part. As it is, we only see snippets of him throughout the flick. Kim Catrall is a good actress but was not given much time in the film. It would have been good if there was a big confrontation scene between Lucy and her mom. So, as a rating? I'll give it an 8 out of 10.\n\nP.S. I am NOT a Britney fan. But I do know jealousy when I see/ read one. Y'all just have to stop dissing her just 'cause you do not like her music. Live and let live, people!!!!"

It's just a basic, honest little star vehicle for a mediocre but far from bad actress and singer named Britney Spears. hello people we've seen worse performances( Madonna the next best thing Kelly and Justin in you know what). So why all the outlashing against Ms. Spears. I personally think this was an entertaining little films with hints of ripe melodrama filled with above to average performances from it's talented cast. Maybe if she wasn't in ti people would have enjoyed it more. What a shame cause in my opinion she's got a lot to offer."

But she's not in it as herself, if that makes sense. She does a great job acting, and so does every other person in this movie!\n\nZoe Salda\u00f1a's character was so wonderful, same with Taryn Manning!\n\nThe female friendship in this movie was aspirational!
