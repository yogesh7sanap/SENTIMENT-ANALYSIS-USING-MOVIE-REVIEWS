Sure, he can't talk due to being shot (it's in the trailer, hardly a spoiler) but the others haven't been shot. Having no one else speak just takes away the impact of the MC losing his own voice.\n\nI'm also struggling with the fact this guy has zero training but thinks he is going to take on the whole criminal underworld - training himself with YouTube videos in his basement.\n\nI guess, all I'm saying is, if you want a decent \"You shot my kid, I must kill you all\" revenge film - check out Kevin Bacon's \"Death Sentence\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is not up to John Woo's talent. I found the material entirely like a one-trick pony. All rage, and sadness, verging on insanity, without any real character development, or pathos. There is nothing in the lead character's story that allows the audience to sympathize with him, other than the loss of his son. There are no positive events to draw us into the story. Instead, we are faced with an ever-increasing level of horror, rage, and madness. Woo has been known to give violence an almost ballet type of choreography (Bullet time slow motion) but that is not what we are seeing here. With the rage of the main character, we are faced with depression, rage, and madness which causes an ever-increasing degree of violence that continues to the very end of the film. This film should have ratings of extreme violence attached. While I watched the entire film I was left with a deep feeling of disatisfaction when it was over. It almost feels like the film was only part of a story."

Instead of using the idea of a dialogueless action flick as an interesting device he creates a very drab story that is less than appealing. He makes little effort in trying interesting ways to propel the story within the confines he set up. It's like he never watched a silent movie and saw how you can tell a compelling story with minimal dialogue. He just leans on lame cliches. Also there's too many logical errors, even for an action movie. And Joel Kinnaman, who I normally like, makes a less than appealing protagonist. Even without speaking his character seems annoying. An unfortunate misfire from something that had a lot of potential."

        "review_detailed_main": "I respect John Woo's decision to try to make a film with no dialog and the story to be expressed through his imagery rather than a script. The problem is, however, that his imagery is not strong enough to hold my attention for as long as the film demanded, and the film's plot was also paper thin.\n\nA lot of scenes come off as awkward, and unnatural because the characters should be talking, but for some inexplicable reason are not. I was starting to wonder if I had missed a scene where everybody gets shot in the neck, and not just the main character? It was ridiculous! Even when the wife is grieving with him and he goes all insane, throwing things and raging, she just stares at him and says nothing. Same with Kid Cudi's character. A lot of his screentime is just him staring at some photos or into a room without saying anything. Made the film almost unbearable to watch.\n\nThe plot itself was ripped right out of Death Sentence, which was also a ripoff of Death Wish. I'm thinking Hollywood needs either better ideas, or better filmmakers. I don't mind a reused idea, but reuse it with purpose, to expand or better the previous product. Neither happened here.\n\nI also want to touch on how cheap the film looked. I'm not sure what the budget was, but surely they could have done better than this. The vast majority of the film is shot frenetically, so it's hard to see the action most of the time. It's also shot in some pretty low light, also making it difficult to see anything. The cinematography is what should draw people into this movie, considering that it probably didn't even have a script, and they couldn't even pull that off.\n\nOverall, this film is a mess and a shame. Such a simple premise and you make one of the most boring and irritating action films I think I've ever seen. I'm going to rewatch Face/Off to make me forget this film ever happened.\n\n0.5 shots in the neck out of 5."

And without character motivations carefully explained through words all that is left to do is make every single action that appears on screen cartoonish beyond belief. I kid you not, what appears on screen in this film also works as a perfect parody of modern action movies. This film can be hilarious if you choose to view it from that perspective. I laughed out loud a lot.\n\nI am giving it 3 stars because it is filmed competently. Visually appealing, well edited, well choreographed action. But without believable situations and characters to care about it all falls flat.\n\nAnd, for the love of all things good, WIND UP MUSIC BOXES MUST BE BANNED FROM CINEMA FROM THIS POINT FORWARD."

        "review_detailed_main": "John Woo is a filmmaker I admittedly haven't seen a tonne of work from, but he undeniably has a vision for action sequences. That is what he is known for and he has stuck to that throughout most of his career in the business. Face/Off and Hard Boiled are awesome action films, so if I ever get the chance, I'll check out his latest. Well, Silent Night is his latest American effort and I must say, he hasn't lost his touch with action. With that said though, it was just okay overall. It has a lot of promise and some great ideas, but something bogged it down for me. Here are my thoughts.\n\nAfter a gang accidentally kills the son of a couple just trying to live a happy life, the husband, Godlock (Joel Kinnaman) decides to go after them. He ends up shot in the neck, preventing him from ever speaking a word again. His mission then becomes to train his body to take on this gang and kill them all. The unique aspect of this film is the fact that it is told entirely without dialogue. Not a single one of the characters speaks one word. I enjoyed that aspect, but I do wish it was utilized more than just having nobody speak. Nothing was interesting past the point of just not having him talk. It was clear that Woo just wanted to focus on the action and that was worth the price of admission.\n\nThere wasn't a lot of originality in terms of the action set pieces, but it was all very well-choreographed. From a standout fight that takes place in a house, to a great stairwell scene, the action held my attention. With that said, the good aspects of this film are bogged down by the sappy nature of the backstory. The way his past with his child is presented is kind of cheesy at first and there is a specific moment towards the end of the film that almost made me chuckle when it was clear the film was trying to be very emotional. The schmaltz of it all overtook the film and ruined a few moments.\n\nJoel Kinnaman is an actor I like very much and his performance here is quite solid, but I'm not sure he was given enough to do, other than either be incredibly angry or sad. It's a very thin story and screenplay and the final product shows that. Still, if you enjoy action, there is enough here to satisfy viewers. The absent dialogue is a great idea, but this type of film needed some in my opinion. Silent Night is a little too cheesy at times, but I still think it's worth a watch if you are already interested. Now playing in theatres, there are worse options to watch than this one."

Besides an action packed opening scene of a few minutes no thrilling action to be seen during the first 50 minutes.\n\nIs the action any good then? Well yes and no. As I said before, the action looks great visually, but the action choreography is a bit lame, because gangsters get shot and stabbed and just keep on figthing as if nothing has even touched them. Pretty lame. Credibility near zero.\n\nMore bad: the leading actor hasnt got any charisma. He looks like a dork. And although there is one big, bad crime guy who was supposed to be the ultimate evil, but he wasnt impressing me either.\n\nI had hoped for a thrilling action packed gangster movie, but it was quite a bit of a dread to watch though..."

While Kinnaman's character is literally silenced due to his being shot in the throat renders him mute and his impressive implosive performance can't make up for the pedestrian trope-laden story (i.e. The police not doing their job). A few decent set pieces sadly cannot make up for a half-baked update on DEATH WISH and its ilk."

The shoot outs see the bad guys about 10 feet from each other and nobody can hit a thing!!!!! Two cars driving side by side shooting at each other with about 200 bullets and they hit nothing!!!!!!!! I found myself laughing out loud and swearing profusely at the screen!!!! Woo's use of slo mo is still there but it just made scenes funnier!!

The Christmas action movie Silent Night (2023) is a fun by the numbers revenge film that has good performances, good cinematography, and fun action; the movie is not perfect, because of how it could take the premise farther or impacted the character.\n\nJoel Kinnaman gives an exceptionally satisfactory performance not saying anything throughout the movie because of his character losing his voice and gives a lot of facial expressions to show what he is feeling right in the situation, with an occasional raspy yell and talking with his wife by texting at one point. He gets revenge for his son being killed, and there are a lot of moments where you can tell he is upset and is reminiscing everything he did with his son; most of the movie is him getting ready to put his revenge into effect, which was cool to see, and him getting info on certain gang members for the police to turn in. I would have liked if him losing his voice effected his revenge plan in a way that makes sense, so there was a bit more suspense in a way when he is trying to communicate with other people to help them in certain shoot outs.\n\nThe antagonists are just standard gangs on the streets that are there to be killed in many brutal and bloody ways that are fun to watch; the action sequences are mostly well shot with particularly good cinematography like with shoot outs and car chases, but some action scenes could have reduced the number of cuts that were used. What I thought was impressive was that there are no lines of dialogue from every person throughout the entire movie, except in radio transmissions and in small whispers at times; I like how it focuses on facial expressions to get character's feelings across, but I would have liked some dialogue from the side characters since the main character cannot say anything.\n\nI can see why there are people who will hate this movie, but I thought Silent Night (2023) was a fun action movie that had an impressive performance from Joel Kinnaman, and well-done cinematography in the fun action scenes; there are issues like it being like all other action revenge movies, but it is entertaining to watch. Director John Woo has done a respectable job directing, and if you like him as a director, I recommend this movie; not a must watch, but it is a fun Christmas action movie to watch whenever you get the chance."

Truly silent, minus a few bits of radio chatter and music with action sound effects. This is what sets it apart from other revenge flicks, though, and part of the reason why it is fresh, but also a little problematic. It has to get to the action as quickly as it can, but needs to fill the run time, so has a shaky first half, albeit a very rewarding second half.\n\nMany movies, especially from the past 10 years, start twenty minutes later than movies used to begin. Character building is lost because we are thrown into the action. For this to truly work, on a quick popcorn movie, the film would have to be just over an hour. Since we are over that theoretical minimum of 90 minutes, there's a chunk of slow-moving scenes at the start. We get hit over the head with the reasoning behind the vengeance, and it's done in a slow, no dialogue way. Once you get past this, then you can settle in for some very good action scenes! Luckily these action scenes are rewarding enough to deal with a frustratingly unlikeable hero and a shallow supporting cast.\n\nI could definitely see rewatching this, but only for the practical action that is very well directed. Some people may not get far enough into the movie appreciate some John Woo thrills, but if you give it 30 minutes (or chapter skips), then it's very worth your time."

While John Woo's new film, which hits theaters December 1st, has many elements that embody the reasons international action film fans idolize him, it has one character trait that is distinct from other Woo films. In fact, it is unique from all modern, full length movies. That feature is that the film has no dialogue. When I use the phrase \"no dialogue\" it is not hyperbolic to mean limited dialogue. There is, literally, no dialogue, at all.\n\nWhile this bold cinematic experiment could have been disastrous, it was not. In fact, it is critical to the film's appeal. This unique perspective, actually, elevates this film to a higher art form, without ever losing the raw grit and violent, action thrills that are at its core. The film's success lies in the fact that it is so well made, and the acting is so thoughtfully constructed, that the audience never longs for what does not even seem to be missing-spoken words. After viewing this one I had to remind myself that there was no dialogue. That is a tribute to the solid storytelling throughout Silent Night.\n\nJoel Kinnaman stars in, and does much of the heavy lifting, in this one. Kinnaman, a relative unknown to American movie audiences, is the fulcrum around which the entire weight of the film rests. His stellar ability to solidly convey to the audience his angst and despair over the murder of his son, and his laser pointed focus in avenging his death without words is what propels the film from an ordinary action film to an extraordinary one. This is a solid performance that happens to be in an action film, and not in spite of it.\n\nCatalina Sandino Moreno does an equally powerful job balancing the emotions of being the mother of a murdered son, who can not seem to break through the forcefield which is surrounding her husband's emotional descent. Moreno is the heart of the film, for sure.\n\nJohn Woo is known for his masterful Direction of action sequences. His, The Killer (1989), is considered one of the best action films of the 20th Century. This film builds on his distinguished body of work with jaw dropping vehicular chase scenes, chaotic shootouts, and visceral hand to hand exchanges. These are filmed with magnetic precision, and the elimination of shaky-cam effects, leading to a riveting result.\n\nWhile the film has the traditional martial arts theme of revenge, Kinnaman's lack of the conventional training of John Wick, Taken's Bryan Miller, and Nobody's Hutch Mansell is an asset to the film. His attempt to elevate his physical body and fighting skills to be able to obliterate his enemies is part of the film's brutal realism. This one is extremely violent, but it is all part of the roller coaster ride. He is a man driven by a singular cause, and we feel his pain.\n\nThe entire supporting cast here does an admirable job of telling their part of the story. They are very good. The villains are, certainly, a little over the top here, but that makes their demise so much more satisfying.\n\nMarco Beltrani's musical score is as much a character in the film as any member of the cast. Music in movies is an important element of the storytelling; however, not all scores have the same level of importance. Perhaps, because of the lack of dialogue here, the score is vital and it does its job effectively.\n\nThe real question on my mind as I left the NYC screening was, \"Like Die Hard, will people be debating whether Silent Night is, actually, a Christmas movie for years to come.\" While I am not sure of the answer to that question, I do know that John Woo's, Silent Night, is a winner. This Lionsgate release is greater than the sum of its parts. It is one of the best action films of the year, and I highly recommend it."

It's slow but the acting is good and action is good when it happens. It's a decent movie to watch once. I would not purchase the movie as I feel like watching it once will do the trick. The only thing I can think of is, if you watch the trailer and watch the movie it can be misleading. Trailer shows nonstop action but the movie starts off pretty slow leading up to action and no dialogue which might have bothered some. For sure better action movies but this is a good watch."

Keep in mind, John Woo directed Mission Impossible 2 back in 2002 and here we are 20 years later with this disappointment of a movie. The best part about the movie is that nobody speaks which tells you a lot about what to expect. Terrible writing and atrocious acting is something I never thought I'd write in a movie review with Joel Kinneman but here we are. This is what happens when the Writers Guild goes on strike and you have some random baboon writing your script. As most movies nowadays, the previews are the best parts of the movie. Stay home and wait for it to release on some streaming service platform. John Woo, just retire if you're going to make trash movies like this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Silent Night is a new action film directed by John Woo, director of Broken Arrow and Face/Off.\n\nWhen a father (Joel Kinnaman) and his son accidentally become victims of a criminal gang shooting on Christmas Eve, the son is affected. The father goes after the criminals, but is also shot and his vocal cords are activated.\n\nHe can no longer talk, but he wants revenge. So he begins to train himself to take impossible Christmas revenge on the gang members who took his son and his voice away.\n\nWith Silent Night, John Woo makes a directorial comeback after 20 years, because he has no longer controlled American action films since his 2003 film Paycheck. John Woo has often made his private action films unique in special ways. He now tries to do the same again by using almost no real dialogue in this film, apart from some background dialogue from music and news radio.\n\nJoel Kinnaman has to work more with facial expressions and body postures to act. He does this well, but if there had been a little more dialogue at the beginning of the film, the story could have been a bit clearer. Due to the lack of speech, the film can sometimes remain unclear. Catalina Sandino Moreno plays his wife and mother of the child who died. She knows how to portray a good, supporting role. Unfortunately, she fades into the background halfway through the film, during the father's revenge campaign. Kid Cudi plays a cop in the film who tries to investigate the attack on the father and son, but he still comes across as more in another film. If they had left his character out of the movie, the movie could have been a bit shorter and clearer.\n\nThe story remains a standard revenge action film, in which characters, for personal reasons, want to take revenge on people who have harmed or taken something away from them. This film is somewhat reminiscent of John Wick's Deadpool, only with less humor or similar action.\n\nThere are entertaining action scenes in this film, but unfortunately they are not that special and not at all for a Jon Woo action comeback. The action scenes do have some creative moments with good visual effects. Unfortunately, not all of the effects even look significant. Some explosions seem less realistic. The blood that characters get during the action scenes also sometimes looks more like fake CGI blood than it looks real."

My advice: Don't turn it off to quickly.\n\nThis film is not perfect, but it's a good movie and it does not need an oscar, because I always wanted to know, what is happening next and THAT is the magic, what I always want to happen, when I watch movies.\n\nIf you are that kind of person, who can let go you will enjoy most of your invested time.\n\nPerhaps 7 stars are too much, but in the end, who cares if I gave 7,6 or even 5 stars?\n\nMerry christmas."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I do like what John Woo did different by making an action movie with ZERO dialogue and nice cinemtography, this movie was awful. I am not someone who expects movies to be realistic. Because lets face it, if that were true, I would never see 99% of the movies that have been made. My mom will tell you i usually like bad movies. But i still feel that main plot points of a movie need to make some sense. And I just found too many things in this movie that didn't.\n\nFirst, I will start off with the fact that these career gang members have the accuracy of a two-year-old with a Nerf gun. In the beginning of the film, there is a scene, that you can see in the trailer, that involves two rival gangs driving in cars and shooting at each other. Despite the fact that these cars are within 2 feet of each other and all of these big bad guys have automatic weapons, neither side hits each other for miles. Then, in the last act of the movie that is the big shootout in the building, again that you can see in the movie's trailer, these lifetime criminals run up on the guy and don't get a bullet off before this homebody dad shoots them? You have got to be kidding me! Harry Potter had better accuracy in \"Guns Akimbo\".\n\nMy other problem is with the main character himself. The movie plays up how he spends nine months preparing to exact revenge and kill all the gang members with fight training from youtube, target practice and working out. Yet the first fight he gets in he gets his ass kicked horribly. If I were him, I would get all the money back I paid for the gun club because the training did absolutely nothing. The only reason he can kill any of them is because the gang members have the accuracy of a magic eight ball. Joel is a scrawny dad and yet this tough gang can't kill him? He's not John Wick. And the only thing that has been on his mind all this time is revenge. How come whenever he killed somebody he looked upset about it?\n\nLastly, while I do get that emotion plays a big part in this movie because there is no dialogue, those scenes were repetitive and very long. Half of them were unnecessary and just a drag.\n\nThe plot line to this movie is not unique at all. In fact, it was like a Tubi version of Death Wish, The Punisher, Death Sentence, etc.. That combined with the ridiculous so-called gang members is why I dislike and was very disappointed in this film."

For the next 30-40 minutes the main character walks around the house drinking all day and looking up fighting videos on YouTube so that he can train to take on all the baddies.\n\nThe next half of the movie is just straight up stupid action sequences that make no sense and are so sloppy. I wanted to like them and I really tried but the first half of the movie drained everything from me out of pure boredom that I could not get back in it.\n\nThe ending of the movie is also pathetic and just mind blowing how a legendary director put this out.\n\nJust save your money and stay far away from this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "An action/crime/drama movie in the vein of DEATH WISH/ DEATH SENTENCE etc. If you read the synopsis, you'll get exactly what this is about. So, if you are a fan of this genre, you're gonna like it. Yes, it's flawed. It should have been at least 10 minutes shorter. It's taking a lot of time before action starts. There are a few unnecessary scenes. And it's cheesy at times.\n\nHowever, i still think it's a bit underrated. Whereas it's indeed slow during the first part, viewer gets to know pretty well this character. Kinnaman's character is not a soulless caricature, i'd say he is convining. Viewer empathizes with him and sees clearly his struggles. Furthermore, Kinnaman gave a strong acting performance. Villains are great, they play their part well as disgusting/evil thugs and viewers are praying for their demise. Action scenes are good, although i expected something better and more impressive from John Woo. (Not a big budget production though). And finally, the ending was good, i really liked the interaction between Kinnaman and Cudi.\n\nDon't nitpick it and you will enjoy it if you like this genre. Of course there are some ridiculous scenes (Big villain wearing Santa Claus uniform and dancing while all hell was breaking loose, lol.). But in the end, you'll get what you came for. Lower your expectations and enjoy the ride. It's an honest movie."

Woo's big comeback movie, being his first since 2017 and his first US release since 2003, Silent Night offers much of what Woo is famous for in what is ultimately a minor classic. Narratively, something is missing, almost like the no dialogue gimmick is a hindrance, but once it gets going it holds your attention to the bitter end, pushing and pushing to overcome any supposed rational objections the viewer may have. There was never any doubt against Woo's ability to choreograph mayhem in a beautifully bloody fashion. Combined with stylishly bold yet elegant editing (and possibly my favourite match cut I've ever witnessed), it all balances out with a heavy emotional weight. Joel Kinnaman is fiercely commanding in the lead role, a role that relies on an intensely physical performance that he more than delivers. While it may draw some ire for a few too many clich\u00e9s, Woo is to be applauded for daring to do something so starkly different in such an oversaturated market, Silent Night risks it all and brings home the turkey."

This is a nice picture with tight , mind-bogging twists , non-stop action, alongside moving musical score by Marco Beltrani and colorful cinematography by Sharone Meir. Dealing with a good father (Joel Kinnaman), an electrician living a happy life in the fictional town of Las Palomas, Texas with his wife Saya (Catalina Sandino Moreno) and young son, who witnesses his young son die when caught in a gang's crossfire on Christmas Eve. While recovering from a wound that costs him his voice, the tormented father makes vendetta his life's mission and embarks on a punishing training regimen in order to avenge his son's death. Action Speaks Louder Than Words !.\n\nThe master of action cinema John Woo returns to Hollywood, after 20 years, with this hyperviolent reckoning starring a ruthless Kinnaman (\u00a8House of Cards\u00a8) thirsty for revengeA grieving father enacts his long-awaited revenge against a ruthless gang on Christmas Eve. Full of Woo's signature style, Silent Night redefines the action genre with visceral, thrill-a-minute storytelling. Thrilling film about a merciless vengeance until an overlong and incredible final duel. What follows is a balletic bloodbath typical of the director of\u00a8A bullet in the head\u00a8 and \u00a8Hard-boiled\u00a8with men running while leaping through the air, or turning somersaults to avoid bullets. A film that, due to its violence, with a dizzying pace and continuous impossible shots, leaves you speechless, as well as its protagonist. It focuses on the need of a father to put an end to those responsible for his son's death, and in this regard he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals; So the little one was caught in a crossfire between gangs. The film begins in a shocking way and ends doubling the viewer's expectations. The film is action in its purest form, with hardly any dialogue, maintaining the tension to the maximum and leaving you on the edge of your seats through stimulating visual choreographies, extreme violence, gore. Fights, and frenetic car chases with impressive crashes.\n\nWell made high-tech hinkins and with plenty of impressive set pieces along with a flamboyant treatment and gorgeous images. Filmmaker John Woo brings his trademark ballets style to the action with a lot of surprises. The motion picture was compellingly directed by John Woo , who originally did not want to do his trademark \"Mexican Standoff\". John Woo direction is good, he moves well the camera with spectacular scenes ,but doesn't match with his Hong Kong vehicles (Bullet in the head, The Killer, A better tomorrow I and II), John Woo followed with a successful American career(Hard Target, Broken arrow, Face off, Mission impossible II, Windtalkers). Rating: 6.5/10 . The flick will appeal to John Woo enthusiasts."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a John Woo fan I really thought this was going to be his comeback. The concept was so cool, and the trailer looked so good. I genuinely felt like this had so much potential and I was so excited to see it realized. I kept imagine how intense sequences of pure action must be without any interruption of dialogue. I kept imagining the unique focus on the visuals and sounds to replace the work of the dialogue. Mr. Robot pulled off a thrilling episode with no dialogue, so surely this movie could've too. Truly there was so much that could've been done and this would've been a classic. Unfortunately that trailer literally showed the best moments, and not much was done with the concept.\n\nAll they really had to do was follow the John Wick blueprint but focus more on the visual storytelling and give it a unique angle with the mute protagonist on top of the lack of dialogue that could've made this movie so much more tense. Unfortunately, the lack of dialogue detracts from the characterization and feels forced in many scenes. I feel like there could've been a lot more done with the protagonist who's very well performed, but not well written. I question his willingness to go on shooting sprees when his son was killed by a stray bullet. There is nothing really done with the protagonist suddenly becoming mute, and the drama with his wife has no real development. The mandatory set up for the emotional beats to hit are executed in such a boring and cliche way and takes up what feels like half the film. Every scene with the son felt so repetitive, and like it was begging you to care with the music, but I really didn't. It almost became cheesy, especially at the end. There's this cop character that's just... there, I guess. There's no personality given to the villains except it keeps cutting to the main villain drugging and shagging this random girl...\n\nWhen we finally get to the action John Woo does deliver, but it's not his best work, and doesn't redeem such a thin story. There's moments of Woo's brilliance shining through what are mostly just pretty good action sequences by today's standards. A lot of the car scenes weren't the best either. The action has its moments and the visuals are often cool, but even then there are some odd directorial choices like overuse of slow-mo and some odd editing choices. I always just felt like there's this great action scene coming, and some parts were, but other parts were off. What's worse is that much of the action feels completely unbelievable and just dumb with the protagonist, of course, getting along through luck and pure incompetence from the villains. The last 2 confrontations in this movie are what really tanked it for me to call it bad. It's just plain ridiculous and unsatisfying how they unfold. Genuinely feels like some AI choreography, unreal, and it's so stupid character wise.\n\nWith all this being said I still mostly enjoyed the movie thanks to some good action and visuals, but I felt like it was more due to the goodwill I have for John Woo, like I owe him for his older awesome films. This was overall a disappointing film and such a waste of the concept. I hope someone else tries something like this again and does better. I don't want to be too hard on Mr. Woo though. Please John Woo, you are better than this, and we still love you!\n\n(4/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Can you make an awesome Gun-Fu flick but have nobody talk? Absolutely. And who else to do it but the legendary Hong Kong Action Guru John Woo. I went into the film blind, and oddly enough I had watched John Woo's magnum opus, Hard Boiled, for the millionth time about a week ago and while thematically, it is significantly different, I still liked it. I grew up as a child watching the relentless Hong Kong classics on VHS in the 90's, and while some may soon be saying it didn't reach those heights. I don't think it was supposed to it.\n\nThis was a quite interesting experiment of combining character study and an explosive Gun-Fu action flick. I must say, it worked much better than I anticipated it would. This was a wholly unique movie in a sea of the same old boring action movies (insert 500 movies in the last 5 years). In fact, the trailers before the film were literally the stale Jason Statham, solo action hero BS that this film amazing breaks free from to provide a fun and special experience. The action was not quite Hard Boiled extremes, but it was well choreographed. The acting was good enough to convey a story with no words. Thumbs up, fun movie for a change, the movie landscape seems to be changing.\n\nPeople should also remember how frequently John Woo has commented on many of things I have a feeling younger folks, or folks new to his work, will soon complain about. He acknowledges that nobody reloads their weapons because it \"interrupts the flow of the action\", the enemy couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat (people shooting 2 feet away from each other and hitting nothing). There needs to be a suspension of disbelief for Woo films, and there have been for decades, just relax, and enjoy the violence.\n\nWhile I am getting sick of CGI car accidents (I saw that in another different movie very recently but can't remember), and the digital blood and wish there would be a return to the classic use of practical effects. I miss the 90's and all its paper/debris flying, squib orgies, and people actually hitting each other. But this film does have the classic practical effects to a large degree and while the digital effects would be my only complaint. I REALLY liked this and would recommend."

This conceit is pulled off effortlessly.\n\nBut with that all said, I still found this movie to be tedious. Maybe it's my old age speaking but the days when I can watch a film where one man can shoot dozen upon dozen of people while they some how manage to miss him are over. Every first shot this man makes hits his target but almost every bit of returned fire manages to go nowhere near him. Add to this our hero knowing where to put up surveillance for LA' s Most Wanted but for some reason the cops don't is too stupid by half.\n\nSpeaking of the bad guys, while I admit I'm no expert on street gangs I'm going to guess that when they doing their illegal business in their HQ it's not with the windows wide open where anybody can look in.\n\nThis is a stupid movie.

In fact, there are many sounds, sounds of bangs and booms, grunts and groans, stabbings and rippings, all of which you would expect from John Woo and this amazingly maudlin melodrama. Perhaps a technical Oscar nod is fluttering nigh? Or maybe maudlin melodramas are not au courant these days?\n\nWhat do we learn from this modern-day Jeremiah Johnson? Primarily that we all grieve in different ways, and that's OK. Some of us turn inward and dig deep into our best, creative selves and outwardly express our sadness and honorifics through painting or rededicating ourselves to our careers. Others of us turn hard and fast to straight-warm vodka by the tumbler, somewhat conspicuously near our tool benches in our garages.\n\nAfter diving into that vodka-infused Darkness, it's time to stand up and learn a bunch of important life skills, such as stabbing stuff with knives, shooting different types of guns with various gradations of mastery, and packing on protein pounds until all muscles work in a beautiful, harmonious concert of slaughter. You can accomplish any and all of your goals given enough time and dedication.\n\nIt is not clear that the message of Silent Night is a good one, at least for our modern society. It is always okay to check your brain at the door of the movie theater, and on the way out of Silent Night, one would be also wise to check one's pants, for this is a seat-edge dark comedy that will fill your empty skull with raw entertainment."

Just skip this film. You need both sides of the brain and heart hardware/software to understand the polarities.\n\nPeople's main negative about a film called silent night....is that there is no talking,,, the trailer makes it very clear what this action epicness is. And it is awesome, now if you went in expecting a dang Tyler perry drama Plat, you will be disappointed, but otherwise you should love it, john wick fell into John woo's grieving father's revenge story script. And it works very well. Reminds me a lot of crank as well, another franchise that deserved a sequel. Hopefully people support it so maybe we can get more like it. I love we are getting more holiday themed movie's that are not just corny comedys or dramas that you forget as soon as your done watching it, never to be watched again, but movie's like this, the recent Thanksgiving, krampus, and further back trick r treat, are awesome holiday movie's that can be watched over and over. Speaking of sequels, those last 2 definitely need them.\n\nBrilliant movie and like nothing I've ever experienced. Action scenes were spot on and the emotion was strong without any dialogue. Great work by John Woo and the incredible actors.\n\n6/5 making things accurate.\n\n11/10 this is what you should have done."

How Brian succeeds in executing his mission forms the explosive final act.\n\nJohn Woo is finally back to Hollywood and it was indeed a fun comeback. The entire gimmick behind minimal dialogues, none for Brian as well as the baddies works for an extent to make the treatment unique. The narrative is as predictable as it can get and it's a straight forward revenge story. There is no action during the first and second act, completely focusing on grieving and prepping to exact the revenge. It is the final act that thoroughly pays off with non stop action. Though the film doesn't have anything to standout wrt writing, John Woo makes up for it with his direction."

The viscerality is there, but it's no The Raid; the vehicle combat is no Fury Road; the stairway oner is no Atomic Blonde; and I could keep going. Forgive the comparative nature of the analysis, but this does nothing we haven't seen before (outside of the dialogueless gimmick that frankly was a terrible decision) which would be fine if the supposed 'master of action' actually lived up to his name here. I have yet to properly dive into Woo's filmography, so I hope Silent Night ends up a stain on an otherwise perfectly clean blanket.\n\nCherry on top is the conservative fantasy of a man going on his sigma male grind, thereby losing any meaningful human connection, but ultimately it's all worth it because he went on a rampage against a bunch of gang members.

        "review_detailed_main": "During Christmas, family man Brian Godlock (Joel Kinnaman) loses his son Taylor (Anthony Giulietti) as the result of stray gunfire during a gang war. Brian is left mute when gang leader Playa (Harold Torres) shoots him in the throat when Brian tries to confront them very much leaving him as he and his wife Soya (Catalina Sandino Morena) struggle to continue on in the wake of the tragedy. Eventually Brian spends the intervening months training and planning to take down the entire gang on Christmas Eve.\n\nSilent Night is the new action film from Hong Kong director John Woo and marks the director's first Western produced action film since 2003's Paycheck with Woo primarily focused on Wuxia films and historical epics in the intervening years (save for the exception of 2017's Manhunt). Produced entirely without dialogue and featuring a more serious take on the material than Woo is traditionally known for, Silent Night won't quite be the revisit to the Woo style of action that fans know from A Better Tomorrow 1+2, Hardboiled, or Face/Off, but as a technical exercise it's exhilarating and well made.\n\nTo start off, Silent Night is undeniably impressive as an exercise in pure visual storytelling. While Silent Night's premise and script feature many of the hallmarks of the tried-and-true vigilante subgenre of action films, the style and craft that comes from conveying the story and emotions through pantomime is brutally effective and much of the credit can be placed on Joel Kinnaman whose performance is as painful as it is intense. Despite being an action film, Silent Night takes its time before we action begin the action proper and the first 40 minutes or so are mostly focused on Brian's breakdown that eventually leads to him rebuilding himself into a single-minded vehicle of vengeance. Silent Night has the distinction of featuring one of the best training/planning montages I can recall of recent memory and it's elevated by Joel Kinnaman's performance who radiates an intense energy that becomes terrifying in some cases. Once we get to the action, it's as brutal as it is well-staged as Woo plays off the fact Brian isn't trained in combat and there's quite a few times where he stumbles and makes mistakes and when the punches, shots, or stabs impact you feel them. Admittedly some parts of the movie could've been refined as despite Woo playing the material more grounded in comparison to his past work, some of Brian's flashback sequences are so over the top in how they're portrayed they feel like they'd be more at home in something like Face/Off rather than this more gritty film. The movie also features Scott Mescudi (aka Kid Cudi) as Detective Dennis Vassel and I didn't really understand why he was in the movie as he doesn't really serve much purpose except to showcase Woo's trademark \"duel wielding pistols\" that feels really out of place and like it was put in more as fan service than for any legitimate reason.\n\nSilent Night certainly delivers on brutally violent action spectacle with a heathy dosage of holiday iconography, but if you're expecting a traditional John Woo movie with an ironic Holiday backdrop you're not going to get that so clear your expectations of any comparisons to Hardboiled or Face/Off levels of over the top. If however you're looking for a solidly brutal and well-acted revenge thriller with well-staged action: here it is!"

The absence of dialogue forces him to express his pain and rage through his actions, a bold choice that Woo executes with impressive directorial flair. The balletic gunfights are undeniably stylish, punctuated by slow-motion flourishes and operatic lighting. Each kill feels meticulously crafted, showcasing Woo's mastery of action cinema.\n\nYet, while the brutality is beautifully choreographed, it eventually numbs the senses. The constant barrage of violence, despite its artistic presentation, lacks emotional weight. The motivations behind Brian's rampage remain frustratingly murky, never quite delving into the depths of his grief or offering a nuanced commentary on vengeance.\n\nFurthermore, the film's silent gimmick, initially intriguing, feels increasingly like a missed opportunity. While effectively creating a unique atmosphere, the lack of dialogue hinders character development and emotional connection. The supporting cast, particularly Brian's wife, suffer from this enforced silence, leaving their backstories unexplored and their motivations unclear.\n\nSilent Night is a visually striking and technically polished film. It pushes the boundaries of action cinema and showcases Woo's undeniable talent. However, its narrative shortcomings and morally ambiguous message prevent it from achieving true greatness. It's a spectacle best appreciated for its technical artistry, but one that ultimately leaves an unsatisfying echo in the silence."

I found myself laughing out loud at a few points because of the way he chose to execute something without saying anything, it felt very silly during very serious moments. If you're going to go silent, you have to at least give the audience something more clever than a predictable action movie. He also used a couple of cop-outs, like text messages to replace the dialogue.\n\nI guess watch it if you're curious so you can say you did. It's a unique film, but it's also pretty forgettable."

Even with the rule \"show, don't tell,\" creating a complete movie with no dialogue seems highly difficult. So how did they accomplish this so well?\n\nIn my mind it's two things. First is a great performance by Kinnaman. His silent acting conveys everything you need to know. Second is a fantastic musical score that can carry the focus and fill in the void. I've been asking for movies where the music is a heavier focus, with extended action sequences with nothing but music. Here is a good example.\n\nThe action is awesome. Visceral and intimate like the rest of the movie. And the emotional moments hit well. Overall an entertainingly good time. (1 viewing, 12/19/2023)"

I'll be honest, this movie made me feel everything: sadness, excitement, anticipation, anxiety. I literally cried, laughed, was on the edge of my seat, and cheered. All of that without dialogue. Personally, I was impressed and indeed, I am surprised by all the negative reviews.\n\nI love the John Wick movies, and I think one mistake is this film being associated with that series. They're not even in the same league, but in a good way. One of the things I appreciated most was how realistic most of the training/revenge was. Yes, I know, some things were still questionable... but it felt possible overall.\n\nNothing can please everyone, but I had to add my own take on it. I hope it is viewed by the people who will appreciate what was done with this film. I will definitely be watching it again. Loved it."

It is a bit weird to have everyone mostly staring and expressing every emotion by ... well way of looks.\n\nThat said, John Woo wanted it that way and this movie really asks you to suspend your disbelief! It is not just the missing dialog (it is not a silent movie - it is anything but that - effects wise), but what happens .. as in the action and stunt department. How our \"hero\" acts and reacts to things.\n\nYou are not supposed to hold it against him - don't try this at home of course. And while this is a tour de Force for Joel, you may wonder about the female role (his wife) in this. Not much to do - she does her best with the little she is supposed to be doing.\n\nThe action is amazing (Woo adding car stunts to his vita - I reckon he hired a really good person for this - an expert so to speak). It's been a while since I saw a Woo movie - I remember there being melodrama involved. And after an action heavy beginning, we do slow down and have half an hour or more of ... well story time. Bit of time hopping (what happened before and all that) ... something that even though the actors try their best, might be the weak spot of the movie. Yes it is needed for motivational purposes and planting, seeding and all that ... still it may feel way too long.\n\nBut the reward is around the corner ... in form of some very fine action scenes. Of course you cannot be squeamish! The movie has a high amount of violence and a lot of blood on display. Not Woos best, but a welcome back of sorts ... if you are into that form of thing ... some comical (accidental?) moments included ..."

He certainly gets a work out expressing anguish, as we are shown this endlessly, over and over again. I'm tired of being treated as though I'm too stupid to work out the plot. There's an interesting beginning, then it languishes for forty to fifty minutes before there's any action. And even this is interspersed by repetitious reminders of the \"anguish\", so much so that you simply don't care anymore about the characters. A script would have smartened this up considerably. Woo took \"Show Don't Tell\" to a new level. This film should be seventy minutes and not a hundred. A waste of good plot, good actors, good action and my time."

        "review_detailed_main": "First movie of John Woo in Hollywood since Paycheck in 2003 (that was an average movie).\n\nThis movie is almost all based on the expression of the protagonist and secondary characters, even being previsible and a bit melodramatic (but the melodrama is dispersed thorough the movie), without any line whatsoever is something to be praised and offstream.\n\nA father suffers the sudden loss of his son in a gangs shootout in a fictional city on Texas, and barely surviving trying to catch the killers - no explanation why he have those skills in the start of the story and in the end being all movie a preparation for revenge is a big no-no on the script thought.\n\nBut is enjoyable especially if you like revenge is better served cold movies. The tension is present and even being previsible the movie delivers the satisfaction of revenge in the end, building up tension till the end (I liked the final scene btw - it was something that was bothering me, and that little bit was explained and I mean his reactions to the mother that suffered such a hard loss too).\n\nBeing a John Woo movie you expect very electrifying action scenes and you get those on sequences on the start, middle and especially end as it should be. Really nice and bloody btw - and for the acting of Joel Kinnaman as the only protagonist I decided to gave the movie one star more than it would be without him.\n\nSo a 7.0 out 1f 10.0 / B for this one. If you crave action and revenge for Christmas this is it (speaking of Xmas, it only serves as a more dramatic starting point for the story - it could have been any time of the year, but hey we need something for the season every year right?)."

A grieving parent going through great lengths to avenge the death of their child where the police aren't helping. The movie lays out the cause, the build-up, and the climax perfectly... with an ending the SUITS IT. I mean he has a year to train and perfect his plan, of course he will be able to hold is own.\n\nAll in all, it's not John Wick... or Monkey Man... etc etc etc. But it's a take on a rookie version who doesn't care if he dies. It's great at that. Realistically I'd give this a 7 but with the amount of dumb reviews I feel like an 8 helps even it out. I'd definitely watch it again with friends or maybe next holiday season."

You have seen it all before, in many movies, still enjoyable. Acting is not bad but is not the main focus, the main focus is on some amazing action scenes, only for these scenes the movie gets the 7/10."

If it had dialogue, it wouldn't have been as memorable. The story is told visually, through strong acting, a fitting musical score and of course the impactful and violent action and John Woo's expert direction.\n\nThe acting from Joel Kinnaman is top notch. He really conveys a lot of emotion with his scenes with out saying a word and you really feel for his character and the pain he is going through. The direction from John Woo is amazing, he proves why he is one of the best action directors of all time. The action is violent, and hard hitting and expertly crafted and shot. Story is simple and straightforward , something you've seen so many times in an action movie, which is why the no dialogue makes it unique.\n\nOverall, a future cult and Christmas action classic. One of the best of 2023 and will go down as one of the best in this decade. A unique, artful and surprisingly emotional and high impact action movie. A must watch for fans and glad I watched it in cinema.\n\n7.5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I would start describing this movie as a no-frills, action packed, fun to watch production. Silent Night is a well put together movie, the one that delivers on his promise: brain switch to off, engagement switch to on. Our hero is , as the title suggests (but you only really realize it after you saw the movie) silent after the inciting incident. Yet , through a very basic plot, good acting and a well written script, you are still fully able to grasp his evolution, motivation and anger, an anger so profound it ends up further complicating the life of our protagonist who, however, is deeply determined to take revenge over the unjust loss of his young child.\n\nThe movie follows pretty much a very basic three act story structure, with act one and two (the loss of his child, his sense of helplesness and newfound motivation and preparation) taking about half the runtime (to exactly the point where you start craving for some action) and the remaining half of the movie is gun blazing action that leaves you oddly satisfied.\n\nPhotography is good, not reaching the levels of John Wick 4 but nonetheless enjoyable. Stunts are well executed if not a little too unrealistic at times, but nothing you cannot easily go over considering the type of film. Action sequence are not as precise and well choreographed as John Wick, but on the other hand the story, despite being very easy, lets you get in touch a bit more with the Hero as he has to develop into a killing machine, since he has no specific skills to begin with, which makes for a good moment.\n\nIf you like this sort of action movie, go see it. I have enjoyed it as it has delivered on his promise: a fun night at the movies with friends."

It's actually quite unfathomable how bad this is. It has elements of Woo's personal touch in it, but even for him the level of Schmalz and cringe is off the scale. It is a lazy, boring, ugly, flat, misguided and frankly reprehensible movie. The main character is unlikable from start to finish, the drama is excruciatingly boring and hard to sit through, the gimmicky idea of no dialogue is realized in a hamfisted way, bordering oftentimes on comedy and low and behold, the action is just crappy. It looks like a special two parter episode of a tv series from the 2000s, even the one shot it's done so lazily and badly, that it must be seen to be believed.\n\nIt will not take away from Woo's classics, but clearly the man has lost any touch and talent. Please don't let him near a director's chair for an action movie ever again.\n\nAhahahahaha, I just saw that Roger Ebert (the website, not the man obviously) gave it 4 out of 4 stars. If you ever needed a clear and undeniable moment of truth, that this website is silly, this is it. The movie is not just bad because of taste. It's bad in every conceivable level you can measure, it's bad compared to so many of its contemporaries and giving it a perfect score is simply the dumbest thing I saw today. \ud83d\ude02"

Very soon you understand how artificial this constraint is, considering that right after they teach you that the guy is voicless he starts moaning, crying and shouting out with his very normal voice. The rest of the story has no surprises, same old content, just nicely shot. The question I am left with is why the guy, who's son has been accidentally killed in a street gangbang, is doing exactly the same - putting on some street shooting during all the story. Is this ment to create other casualties, other fathers in search of a vendetta and thus a door for a second film?.. Pretty poor screenplay."

Build up to piecing together the plan holds Oceans like quality, but yet is simplistic and the visuals giving you that thousand word approach for efficiency.\n\n-And once the action starts, I can say it hits just about every box in terms of action, kills, carnage, and that justice driven shot that sums things up so well. All with stable camera work to give you the experience without the mess.\n\nThe Action: -It's big, it's bold, it's bloody, and it's the promise of the trailers.\n\n-Silent Night has moments that again show how a good director makes those moments that make you say expletives or at least oh Wow.\n\n-Gun play, knife work, and some fisticuffs fly as the savagery of the movie unleashes into a fight that has edge, dynamics, and stakes that are exciting to see. Fun moves that blend modern day with video game style moves, a sort of gang busting cowboy at times.\n\n-Combined with that emotional cinematography, it helps elevate the fight past the usual bland punches that most action movies take when they aren't action.\n\n-Fantastic and the heart of the movie, Silent Night's third act is exactly the climactic experience you want to the buildup that this movie was designing. Loved it.\n\n-And even more impressive, is that unlike some action heroes, you take damage you keep it, only further adding that realistic measure to give a little more excitement to the film.\n\n-It misses few beats, and the character tale through the violence... works on some level that pulls it all together.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nThe Story Is Meh -There is emotion, and there is relevance, but that's about all this simplistic tale has to go for it.\n\n-Where John Wick accomplishes this to a better degree, Silent Night is more of a visual direction story to live through with little thought, which may work for those wanting adrenaline.\n\n-Yet the directions they chose in the beginning could have used a little more, some engaging characters, some discussions, something to help add that spark for inclusion.\n\n-Fortunately the action helps distract from this but still there was more that could have been done for me.\n\nThe opening is a tad slow and repetitive: -You'll get the vision of grief, remorse, and trauma, but perhaps a tad too much for my liking.\n\n-Seeing these moments of mourning start out fine, but they get very lengthy, see it happen a lot for nearly one hour and at times get a tad creepy.\n\n-Again, it's a bold artistic statement, but this added a lot of bloating at the beginning, and could have been done a little less time manner to improve in my ability.\n\n-Or you know integrated in a manner that didn't get too odd or distracting.\n\nCharacter Integration: -It's really a story about the silent protagonist alone, and that works, but for the fact of integrating Kid Cudi into the mix and modeling him a key player -Silent Night kind of stinks in terms of building up most of the characters, suing only the attitude, the shots, and some simple story elements to make it work. You have little attachment to them, even the mom and that was a shame given the potential.\n\n-It could have used more planning and magic, but again, for most it won't be an issue when you are in the midst of gun play.\n\nThe Violence: -Another warning than dislike, the violence is again to the level where sensitive beings need to stay away.\n\n-It's gory and realistic, gun shots and knife wounds deep and close up to unleash the true injury that comes with it.\n\n-Sure, there is excitement, but its vicious, paints the walls with red saturation, and can be very disturbing if you aren't prepared.\n\n-A tad excessive? Yeah, near the end especially, but still within reason for most members going to see this film.\n\nTHE VERDICT: -Silent Night is pretty much a unique twist on a Christmas action film, that holds Woo's style with cinema making and the typical adrenaline fuel of the genre. A pace that is quick, this movie uses the bare minimum to tell the story and get into the motivational montages of fighting and training to get you into the film. It's simplicity is both genius and limiting, but for the most part this action film is ready to unleash madness with strong visuals, great choreography, and a realistic edge that helps keeps things engaging. Such fight scenes prove the right directors can still make good pieces in terms of action stunts, fighting, and the splendor that they can be. However, the movie lacks a fleshed out story, it lacks character usage, and is really just a spectacle of violence that though fulfilling is not the most engaging piece to come to mind. I had fun with it, but there are still better pieces that balance both story and the flair of action. It certainly delivers on the element of the trailers, but again caution to those sensitive to violence and trauma being repeated a tad too much. Thus, my scores are:\n\nAction: 7.5-8.0 Movie overall: 6.0."

And, truth be told, Kinnaman is a great casting choice in a world where Hollywood has very few legit action heroes left. Which brings us to the difficult question, why did Master Woo come out of retirement to do a film which -- according to critics, fans, and regular film-goers -- is one of the least watchable efforts of his career? The answer is no doubt as personal and private to Woo himself, as is the motivation of the protagonist (Kinnaman) in this film. For film historians of the far future, the inane amount of time and trauma (to both Kinnaman's character and to viewers!) spent on backstory may well be a \"clue\" as to why Woo himself went down this lonely (and silent) road. Best guess? Just to show he could. Just to remind the young whippersnappers that he invented this genre, and that gives him the right to deconstruct it if he wishes. Even if the end result -- while technically perfect -- is somewhat less than entertaining, ((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"

Those movies were stylish, fresh and (although most age badly) very entertaining. This wave eventually inspired the John Wick style action films that dominate today's non superhero action films.\n\nAlthough an original in American film, John Woo shows he has aged poorly.\n\nHoliday themed movies are by nature cheesy. Violent Night was a treat, but never took itself seriously. Recent horror themed films echo that. The tone of Thanksgiving and Krumpus, while solid horror films, understand what they are and have a sense of humour about themselves.\n\nSilent Night is a dreary, slog that takes itself way too seriously for a movie named after a X-mas song. The plot is unimaginative and tired (this is where I say 'much like the director!\"). Joel Kinnaman (does he actually have a name, and if so, who cares?!) family is killed. He gets shot in the neck and now can't talk. He is sad and wants revenge. Following along so far? You can guess what happens next.\n\nThe movie is very boring. The acting is shockingly poor. Remember, the main character can't talk, so figure that... Actually, I'll give Kinnaman some credit here. He is able to make some expression with his face and eyes that carries a few small scenes. But, the worse part should be the best part. By the time you struggle to get to some action, it is plain poorly done.\n\nI'm not sure why you would watch this movie. Because it is an X-mas movie, nope. Because it is fun or entertaining, nope again. A good action flick? No way. Well, at least good choreography? Wrong again.\n\nThis has nothing going for it. This isn't much more than a b-movie, from the 90s! John Wick has passed John Woo, and beat him by a mile.\n\nA generous 3/10."

Directed by the action, Master John Woo who spent nearly 20 years making historical drama films in China returns to the genre that put him on the map in the first place. Nobody can dispute the peerless action drama of the likes of hard boiled, hard target and face off. But those were all long time ago.\n\nI don't know why he decided to make another American movie after such a long hiatus, but he is back with an intriguing idea of doing a film with no dialogue at all. There are a few moments of showing newspaper cuttings or texts to add a little bit of flavour, but he wanted to come up with an idea of explaining an entire story with no dialogue, and it works. The idea of a bereaved father going for revenge and slowly coming up with his plan is really intriguing and Woo does it extremely well. Let's be honest a lot of action dialogue is really there to set up the conflict and is often criticised for being cheesy.\n\nThe problem is after an opening action scene when there is nothing except seeing the father train there isn't enough in this film. It could've really of done with a big action sequence in the middle to reassure you. With no funny dialogue no plot twist you've seen all of this done before in a more entertaining way and without the dialogue no matter how well done it is it is, I'm sorry to say, a bit dull. When the action comes, it's good, but it isn't peak Woo.\n\nIt turns out there's a reason why we have dialogue in movies after all."

In fact, I get those non verbal communication by their acting and soundtrack or music injected, but it doesn't gave genuine justification of all the characters showed, to the point you might just keep guessing or build your own story, which I find it intriguing.

CGI cars, bad CGI blood, a lot of \"invisible\" cuts. From people not being able to hit anything with automatic weapons just metres away from each other to people not being able to see a huge forklift standing in their way - it's all hilarious if you can see this as a comedy. But the sheer pretentiousness of the no dialogue gimmick and the overall overly heavy tonality sadly spoil the fun, leaving you clueless whatever happened to one of action cinema's greatest directors.\n\nNo character has any backstory, personality, meaning. It's all nothing. As a consequence, you will probably fail to have any empathy and enthusiasm for the protagonist's progress. The only thing that made me feel anything was seeing Kid Cudi's incredibly gross fingernails.\n\nMan, I'm afraid John Woo lost it for good. Where there was once delightfully absurd, visionary, fast-paced, over-the-top action and mastery of bending time and space, now only absurdity remains."

Set during the holiday season, the film follows a grieving father's quest for revenge after his son is tragically killed in a gang-related shooting.\n\nJoel Kinnaman delivers a powerful and nuanced performance as the grieving father, Brian, who is determined to avenge his son's death. His portrayal of a man consumed by grief and anger is both raw and captivating. Catalina Sandino Moreno is equally impressive as Brian's wife, Saya, who struggles to keep their family together in the face of tragedy.\n\nSilent Night's unique storytelling method, which features little to no dialogue, is a bold and daring choice that pays off in spades. The film's visual language is rich and evocative, with each frame brimming with emotion and meaning. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and thrilling, with Woo's signature flair for cinematic spectacle on full display.\n\nWhat truly sets Silent Night apart, however, is its emotional core. At its heart, the film is a story about the power of love and the lengths we will go to protect those we hold dear. It is a poignant and moving exploration of grief and the human condition, one that will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nIn conclusion, Silent Night is a must-see film that offers a fresh and unique take on the revenge thriller genre. With its stunning visuals, powerful performances, and heartfelt storytelling, it is a cinematic experience that is not to be missed."

After the rocky reception of his 2003 film Paycheck, Woo returns to Hollywood after two decades, armed with something to prove.\n\nSilent Night opens with a promise - a dialogue-light script that hands the reins to Woo's visual storytelling prowess. Woo, often tagged as a one-trick pony in America, dispels that notion, showcasing his versatility across genres. The film's simplicity in premise does the job, providing a canvas for his directorial finesse.\n\nYet, the central gimmick of a nearly mute cast becomes a double-edged sword. While initially inventive, it wears thin as the narrative progresses. Early on, the absence of audible dialogue is intriguing, but later, it risks becoming a distracting hurdle as the initial creativity wanes.\n\nJoel Kinnaman leads the charge, delivering a fair portrayal of grief early on. However, as the film unfolds, his silent expressions of pain, anger, and frustration veer into the comical, creating unintentional moments of levity that disrupt the intended gravitas.\n\nThe film's saving grace lies in its action sequences, notably the impressive car chases. Woo's trademark slow-motion techniques are supported by the razor-sharp cinematography, providing a visceral and visually striking experience.\n\nIn Silent Night, Woo may not hit the bullseye, but he certainly hits the target. It's a return worth noting, with moments of brilliance amid occasional hiccups. For action aficionados and Woo enthusiasts, it's a watch that offers glimpses of his directorial prowess, even if the silent experiment falls a tad flat.\n\nFORMAT: Cinema\n\nVIDEO: 10/10.\n\nNative 4K cinema presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: Excellent\n\nAUDIO: 10/10.\n\nDolby Atmos cinema audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: Excellent\n\nMOOFIEMETER: 6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes! It's been a while, but John Woo is back with a bang. The man still knows how to make an action movie and it shows. This feels good, reminded me of the 80s and 90s action style. The bad guys are basically just there to line up and get taken out. Hard. It looks stylish and violent at the same time.\n\nSure, this flick doesn't bring anything new to the table, we've seen it all before. Many times even. But this one is definitely highly entertaining and above average.\n\nOne thing though, whithout giving away too much, our main character (very well played by Joel Kinnaman) loses his voice in the beginning of the movie. This could've led to some interesting and tense moments during the movie, but it doesn't. It seems more like an excuse to create a cool, tough and silent \"hero\", which I consider a missed opportunity. How good would it have been if at some stage he desperately needed his voice to rescue someone or even himself from a dire situation, but was unable to produce a single word? None of that though. Like I said; missed opportunity.\n\nNonetheless, I'm more than happy John Woo is back on the scene and hopefully more will follow.\n\nIf you like action/revenge movies and are looking to be entertained without having to dig too deep into your emotions, definitely give this one a shot. 7 out of 10."

There has to be some sort of savant film maker to be able to pull this off, and Woo is more of an action director, and it just doesn't work.\n\nSadly, even if you add in a script and additional veteran actors this is still a mess as the story is just simple.

I loved how bloody it was yet it wasn't gruesome enough to make you uncomfortable unless you're squeamish.\n\nThe movie does go out of its way to spend time building this would and showcasing how much gang related stuff is going on. I kinda loved that no word was spoken for a good chunk of the start. There were some small issues, like why'd you leave your car unlocked, windows down in a neighborhood with high crime?\n\nLoved that the fights seemed real later on, the hand to hand combat scenes better than the shoot outs at the start. The movie starts out slow, but it's building up to what you'd anticipate is an action packed third act. And my god is it worth the wait, kinda. I wasn't entirely blown away, still felt like it took too long to get there. And the fact that it's a Peppermint(2018) copycat didn't impress me so much."

However, the difficult premise that the maestro is in connected territory, but on foreign soil, which, see the past, doesn't always go well.\n\nWe start with supposed ordinary citizens whose lives are massively enriched by unappointed professionals, in this case those involved in drug dealing, prostitution and other bread and luxury purchases in the gang milieu. The instruments of these explorers into the distant spheres of the human imagination - demons for some, demons for others - are fire throwers and all the utensils that doctors have for their interventions on the human body.\n\nWoo tries to transport us into the pain and despair of the protagonist. It's only partially successful, not only because we just want it to pop, but also in terms of craftsmanship. And unfortunately also because Kinnaman simply lacks that certain something. But we get it, that would certainly be our mindset, at least in the fantasy of this scenario.\n\nWhether the blinding thirst for revenge is the best motivation, internet to-do's the best teachers and only about 1 year of transformation from civilian to professional killer is enough, everyone has to decide for themselves. But we're all clamouring for 80s action, so let's have 80s action logic. And Woo doesn't refrain from showing, at least to some extent, what can go wrong and what firestorm each new spark ignites. This blazes in the final third, action galore, high body count, no prisoners. The blood spurts violently, but unfortunately not by means of blood packs but CGI. And only at the end is there the artfully arranged Woo action style, without which we probably wouldn't have got John Wick 4. Not a film for the Woo-Collection, but 100 minutes of entertaining revenge action without any great lengths."

What are the people who reviewed this film favourably thinking?\n\nIt was a relief there was no dialogue as at least it offered the possibility of a nap at any stage during the film. There were intermittent scenes of sentamentality which appeared insincere and forced.\n\nViolence as in John Wick can be entertaining but none of the violence was entertaining. The over the top violence surrounding where he lived was almost like a parody. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever. It's a waste of time. Don't bother."

I enjoyed the first part of the movie the most, going through the emotions in a very realistic way. The second part works fine, but covers more known action territory, leaving realism out of it. The storyline is an old friend to anybody that has seen Charles Bronson in Death Wish and does not add much to the legend at all, which is a shame and devalues the entire work quite some. Too bad, a better script would have done wonders. But the movie is absolutely worth watching."

Acting is very, VERY bad, and here's the kicker, it's NOT because of the actors, it becomes very obvious that the actors - who by the way have almost ZERO lines of dialog for some reason - are INSTRUCTED by the director to express themselves by facial expression and body language, in the most idiotic possible manner.\n\nThe action scenes are going to look stupid to anyone who knows anything about guns, cars, or fighting. Cars are bullet proof, automatic weapons fire 300 rounds without changing a magazine, but for some reason the producers decided to make some of the bad guys basically bullet proof.\n\nThis kind of movie practically REQUIRES a stoic hero, but the director probably wanted to make him more \"human\" and instead turned him into an idiot.\n\nIf like me you've watched the trailer and thought this was going to be a good movie, you can still avoid wasting 1h45m of your precious time and spare yourself from the cringe and annoyance, fair warning."

This is the new John Woo's style for the last 3 decades. A far more grittier atyle.\n\nKinnaman, as main actor and producer, understood it well. Silent Night will become a movie to talk about in the future. The dark lighting, grittier car chase and hand to hand fight (with or without guns) were amazingly choreographed.\n\nIf there's anything to improve, I would cast a better actor to play the main villain. The cruelty was there, but lacking memorable evil was very apparent.\n\nAnother signature Woo's style was the hero and another counter part in law enforcer, which played by Kid Cuddy. Cuddy played the character with cold calculative eyes and done a very good job.\n\nOne big note: Silent Night is not a movie you can watch once and to be judged how the movie quality is. You need to watch it 2-3x to understand the strange story telling approach Woo had taken and made Silent Night a strangely captivating cinematic experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Right, well of course it was nice to see John Woo return to direct a Hollywood movie. And naturally, I must admit that I was indeed harboring a certain level of expectations to his return to the US cinema. So how did he manage with \"Silent Night\"?\n\nEssentially well enough, I would say. Sure, the script and plot in \"Silent Night\", as written by Robert Archer Lynn, is a bit generic and linear. There wasn't really any twists or turns to the narrative throughout the course of the 104 minutes that the movie ran for, which sort of made \"Silent Night\" a bit generic and rather predictable.\n\nSure, \"Silent Night\" is a watchable enough movie for what it turned out to be. But it wasn't exactly an the grand return to direct Hollywood movies that it could have been for director John Woo. Entertaining? Sure. Enjoyable? Sure? Outstanding? Not so much.\n\nThe acting in \"Silent Night\" were good, but I have to say that leading actor Joel Kinnaman wasn't really given all that much to work with, since his character was deprived the ability to speak. So it felt like he was left with two options throughout the course of the movie; and that was either rage or self-pity. Not really the best of writing from Robert Archer Lynn here in terms of character depth and development.\n\nOf the entire cast ensemble in the movie, then I was only familiar with Joel Kinnaman.\n\nNow, with \"Silent Night\" being a John Woo movie, there is something you can count on. And that is a good amount of action and adrenaline-packed scenes. And true enough, John Woo certainly delivered here with \"Silent Night\". There was an abundance of action scenes, fight scenes, car chase scenes and such, as you would expect from a John Woo movie. And it looks good and it feels very well choreographed and executed. And that most certainly made the movie all the more enjoyable to sit through.\n\nAnd the ending of the movie was just a bit too sappy. It seemed like the writer was trying to add a level of sympathy for the Brian Godlock character with the audience. However, it was such a bizarre change of style to the movie, that is came off as being really campy and cheesy.\n\nIf you enjoy John Woo movies, then you definitely should sit down to watch \"Silent Night\". And if you are unfamiliar with previous movies directed by John Woo, then you can very much still enjoy \"Silent Night\" for the action movie that it turned out to be.\n\nMy rating of \"Silent Night\" lands on a six out of ten stars."

After the action-packed opening scene, it then takes 50 minutes for the action to start occurring again. The set-up is too long!

The conceit here is that he doesn't say anything. Neither does anyone else, save a few whispers. This gimmick gets old fast. Especially when he walks into a police station and we expect someone to explain why there is no investigation on the dude who shot him and left him for dead. I mean, he was a witness to his own shooting. And it't not like the police didn't know where the gang boss was. Yeah, dumb.\n\nI suppose they were attempting to show a degenerated community much like \"RoboCop\" where the police are ineffective.\n\nThe bones of this is clearly trying to make Kinneman something like...John Wick meets the Punisher. Down to the stupid duster jacket.\n\nThis movie is so derivative of better movies and none show the essence of what was once great John Woo. There are glimpses, such as in \"The Killer\" where a guilt ridden gangster tries to atone for blinding a innocent bystander. Or guns akimbo. Or having a cop and a civilian go for gunplay. Somehow,. This felt EXHAUSTING. And not in a good way.\n\nI want to say Woo wanted a message here...somewhere but not necessarily sure what it is. This felt very cheap. Almost as if it were a faith based film ala \"Sound Of Freedom\"\n\nI digress.\n\nThis movie is anemic, at best."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you're a fan of films such as John Wick, Nobody, Kill Bill, and Equalizer, think of this movie as a lower budget, much more down to earth addition to the whole vengeance genre. The main character has absolutely no history as a skilled assassin, and you're not going to see him undergo any drastic transformation from regular dude to badass hitman, because it's just not that type of movie. Like many movies with the similar vindictive theme, it's filled with cliches. But what it does with this is really why I give it such a high rating compared to most everyone else. We're used to all of this beautifully choreographed combat from especially John Woo, but, that's not what we get from this movie. The man is completely inexperienced in the field of *extermination*, so there really is no smooth slide into the ending, which I won't discuss because this is a spoiler free review. It's not fun either, so if you're expecting brief moments of grief in between all of this flashy action, you probably need to fix that, because the his fury and drive throughout the movie is not purely from the death of his kid, because this man is not trying to just avenge his son. He's not trying to take out a whole agency of killers who murdered his family. The gang that was responsible for his child's death is the cause of much chaos in the town, which is much of what sparks his desire to go on the killing spree. He wants what he believes would be better for the world, these criminals off the streets, so really, he's a much lesser Batman without a cape. And he's in no hurry to kill anyone, except for the head honcho of the whole thing, but once again, that's not for this review. He's not exactly a master of strategy, but he takes his time, and he actually has a plan that arguably got him where he wanted to be. And yes, it is a silent film, but don't assume the worst from that, because there are plenty of other movies such as \"No One Will Save You\" which use this trait beautifully, and Silent Night is no exception.\n\nIn summary, it's not particularly entertaining and it's somewhat drab at times, but it's the closest thing you can probably get to something like this happening in real life. The bar is risen quite high for this sort of movie, but I propose that maybe we rate this under a different bar. But if you are looking for some bloody vengeance flick, this movie probably isn't for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I always like revenge thrillers, especially the more brutal ones, chockfull of adrenaline-fueled action by a sympathetic, wronged and relentless hero. Well, as far as the action goed, they certainly delivered, although it took almost 50 minutes to come to that point, after a rather tame, on the brink of tedious ouverture.\n\nBut they went totally in overdrive after that: the way Brian (Joel Kinnaman) singlehandedly shoots dozens of heavy armed thugs from out of the window of his racing car, or on a long stairwell going up, amidst showers of bullets, was a tiny bit unrealistic, to put it mildly. As were the actions of the police detective (actor Kid Cudi) who followed him, all alone, without any back-up, although he knew that he would get in the middle of a heavy gang-fight. It was hard to sympathize with main character Brian anyway, the grieve over his dead son was of course relatable, but the way he treated his equally grieving wife was appalling. So my advice: wind on to 50 minutes in the movie, and then enjoy the subsequent violent ride without thinking too much."

        "review_title": "John Woo's Silent Night; A Tragically Shallow Experience",
        "review_detailed_main": "Prior to watching Silent Night, I wish I was aware of how important the word 'silent' was in the title. This is not like a silent film from the early twentieth century - sound effects and music (diegetic and non-diegetic) are used; characters scream and occasionally mutter; and scenes are interspersed with the rare radio broadcast, contextualizing date and time. Apart from this, there is almost NO DIALOGUE in the entire film.\n\nThis gives all new meaning to the phrase 'actions speak louder', while inadvertently showing why verbal communication is so important. Focus instead goes to facial emotions. Brian (Joel Kinnaman) spends most of the movie switching between outrage, shock and bereavement. Brian's wife, Saya (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is mostly limited to extreme grief, and Detective Vassel (Kid Cudi) spends most of the film looking, I don't know; curious? This detracts from the main cast, by making all of them very shallow and one note - characters need to be more than just the sum of a couple emotions.\n\nThe film begins on Christmas Eve, with Brian and Saya's young son being gunned down during a drive-by between two rival gangs. In the grip of fury, Brian pursues those responsible, only to be shot in the throat by Webface (Acoyani Chacon), a wound that prohibits Brian from speaking. The film's title works as a pun, for not only does the story happen around the festive season, but on the anniversary of his son's death, Brian will take his silent revenge over one bloody night.\n\nThough Moreno's character is severely underused, it is antagonist, Webface, who is really done dirty. Appearing for maybe a total of five minutes in the film's entirety, he becomes the focal point of Brian's rage, though it's never revealed if he is the gangster that killed Brian's son. The villains of a John Woo film are often a highlight, but here; absolutely not, and though Webface is shown to have ties to the community, in an attempt to make him morally gray, the real crime here is his complete lack of personality, depth or motivation.\n\nFurthermore, a lot (and I mean A LOT) of the film focuses on Brian's transition from Arnold Average to Arnold Schwarzenegger after he leaves the hospital. Despite the necessity to establish Brian's change and determination, this has been done to death in other vigilante style films, and essentially feels like padding. Like Team America said, there's nothing wrong with a training montage, but scene after scene after scene after scene of it, seems overblown. I mean, at the end of the day, we're all here for the same thing, right?\n\nIn that case, John Woo's visual flare *occasionally* has a chance to shine - sadly though, there are no doves. Slow motion sequences look sublime; scene transitions are well executed and moments where characters wield two guns looks alright. Sometimes text messages and letters are used to push the plot forward, and though this works to show the growing distance between Brian and Saya, it does little else.\n\nAs an aside, I've been reading the Orphan X books, which thematically explore if a killer can maintain their humanity. This same idea is raised in Silent Night, with Brian on occasion sympathising with a criminal. However, after witnessing him kill gang members by the dozen, having him suddenly care about one villain, especially one who we witness commit a crime, is poorly handled.\n\nTo be frank, this is not a return to form for John Woo. Silent Night is unfortunately forgettable when compared with Hard Boiled or Face off.\n\nAside from its gimmick - that characters hardly utter a word, a schtick that seemingly works against the film - this is just another revenge thriller, akin to Death Wish, Death Sentence, Hero Wanted, or even John Wick, and with Woo's hypnotic and hyperbolic signature style largely absent, it leaves the film without much of an identity. As an experiment, Silent Night is not half bad. But as an action experience, it's just above average."

There is just times you wait for some speech from someone but it never happens.\n\nDue to know one talking it makes it a very hard to watch and is rather boring. It's like watching all sports on your tv with no crowd noise or commentary and if you ever tried that it makes the sport very boring indeed.\n\nAll in all I gave it a 6 star as the action was good. Not so sure why woo took out his doves and replaced it with some strange looking CGI love bird though.\n\nBut all an all if this had a script with actual voices I'm sure the movie would of been much better to watch and would of recieved better reviews."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Silent Night,\" the 2023 holiday film, leaves audiences with mixed feelings in this peculiar take on a Christmas gathering amidst an impending apocalypse. While it boasts a unique premise and an ensemble cast that delivers commendable performances, the execution falls short of fully realizing its potential.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its exploration of the human psyche in the face of impending doom. The tension builds steadily as a group of friends gathers for what may be their last Christmas together. The character dynamics are well-crafted, and the ensemble cast, featuring notable talents, injects authenticity into their roles.\n\nHowever, the pacing of the narrative often falters, leaving some scenes feeling drawn out and others rushed. The dark humor, intended to provide comic relief in this apocalyptic scenario, occasionally misses the mark, creating an uneven tone that may not resonate with all viewers. The film struggles to balance its existential themes with moments of levity, resulting in a narrative that feels disjointed at times.\n\nVisually, \"Silent Night\" captures the eerie beauty of a world on the brink of collapse. The cinematography and set design contribute to the film's atmospheric quality, creating a sense of impending dread that permeates each frame. The use of a muted color palette effectively complements the somber mood of the story.\n\nThe soundtrack, while fitting for the film's apocalyptic setting, occasionally overwhelms the dialogue, making it challenging to fully engage with the characters' emotions. The sound design, however, effectively enhances the film's suspenseful moments, adding to the overall tension.\n\nIn summary, \"Silent Night\" offers a thought-provoking exploration of human nature under extreme circumstances, coupled with strong performances and a visually striking presentation. However, its uneven pacing, tonal inconsistencies, and occasional missteps in humor prevent it from reaching its full potential. While not a must-see holiday classic, \"Silent Night\" manages to deliver a unique take on the end-of-the-world genre, making it worth a watch for those seeking a different kind of Christmas tale."

The sound-based gimmick makes it almost unpalatable as it sets its pace at 0 for a very large part of the movie. It makes a lot of the scenes feel lifeless, the insistence that everybody be as silent as the protagonist feels out of place and makes a fairly story feel even flatter.\n\nI really wanted to like it, but I was suffering through most of it honestly."

        "review_detailed_main": "John Woo, a renowned director, has been absent from American cinema for 20 years, but his influence remains evident. His films, such as Bullet Train and John Wick, are heavily influenced by Woo's operatic style. As the action movie industry continues to boom, Woo is expected to return to reclaim his throne with his revenge thriller Silent Night. The film serves as a warm-up for the lead character, Godlock, who trains to transform from a milquetoast family man to a ruthless killer. The story takes place in a post-Taken world, similar to 1974's Death Wish, where fathers overcome trauma by tracking down and punishing those responsible. Silent Night is virtually dialogue-free, starting and ending at Christmastime, and serves as a challenge for both Woo as a filmmaker and for the audience. The film serves as a competent exercise rather than a victory lap, serving as a warm-up for the film's future. Kinnaman's father is rendered mute after being shot in the throat, requiring limited facial expressions to convey his grief and determination. The films are structured like video games, racing from one end-of-level-boss to the next, leaving the film largely on Woo Woo's shoulders. Woo's stylistic choices range from ingenious to ugly, and his love of all-consuming melodrama only emerges in flashes. The film's structure is often more entertaining to watch the prep than the carnage that follows, as it allows for a more involving journey than usual. The film's aesthetic prowess needs to wow us enough to make all other markers meaningless, and Woo's stylistic choices range from ingenious to ugly. John Woo's \"Silent Night\" is a predictable revenge thriller set during Christmas. \"Silent Night\" is a film that communicates innocence through the hero carrying a wind-up toy that still plays its plaintive melody. The film's simplicity and simplicity often resemble passages from the Old Testament or epics. The director, John Woo, is a virtuoso in the role, and the film's success relies on the filmmakers not being afraid to push beyond what's considered good judgment or taste. Some of the greatest operas and pop songs take this risk, pushing beyond what's considered good taste without fear of offense or embarrassing themselves. By pushing beyond rational objections, the film overcomes any rational objections and opens up a magnificent, rare, and sublime feeling. Woo's performance is a virtuoso in this music-driven film. The film, directed by Woo, is one of his best and one of the most deliriously cinematic of the year. The story follows a couple (Joel Kinnaman and Catalina Sandino Moreno) who lose their son to a stray bullet after rival gang members shoot at each other. The title is unrelated to the holiday carol, but it's a silent movie with sound, showcasing the idea that the telling matters more than the tale."

        "review_title": "A bittersweet return to John Woo's action",
        "review_detailed_main": "Silent Night marks John Woo's return to Hollywood, a nostalgic ride through his cinema of excess. However, the film stands out for its bittersweet melody, a work that oscillates between moments of mastery and falls into banality. The Chinese director, acclaimed for his epic Hollywood adaptations, returns with an action thriller imbued with shades of melodrama. Set on Christmas Eve, the film follows the story of Brian, an electrician played by Joel Kinnaman, whose life is shattered by the death of his son in a gang shootout. Woo, the Hong Kong master, approaches the film with a decisive attitude, focusing on the essentials and stripping away the embellishments of plot and contextualization. Brian's loss of voice becomes the key device, rendering the film almost mute and devoid of dialogue, a bold choice that helps define the silently intense tone of the work. However, despite the potential for originality, Silent Night encounters some narrative obstacles. The plot, centered on Brian's revenge against the gang responsible for his son's death, feels thin and conservative. Melodramatic clich\u00e9s emerge in the family dynamics, lacking the authenticity and depth desired. The film plays with evocative visual symbols, such as the red balloon symbolizing lost innocence. Woo, while attempting to convey his authorial signature, engages in a complicated endeavor, as his vision seems discordant with modern audience expectations. The lack of dialogue, while on one hand imparting a unique atmosphere, on the other may seem like excessive artifice, compromising the emotional connection with the characters. The choice of a dark visual style and Marco Beltrami's soundtrack amplifies the resemblance to grindhouse, but at times feels out of place, especially in the Christmas violence sequences. The performances of the cast, particularly Kinnaman's, are commendable. However, the lack of psychological development of the characters relegates them to stereotypes rather than authentic individuals. Silent Night distinguishes itself in action scenes, typical of Woo's repertoire, with well-executed combat choreography and a suggestive shootout sequence on the stairs. Unfortunately, these moments of brilliance are diluted by an inconsistent and clich\u00e9d plot that leaves the audience with a sense of dissatisfaction. Silent Night represents a return to John Woo's past, but fails to fully capture the attention of the contemporary audience. A work that oscillates between the exceptional and the banal, between spectacular action and a lack of narrative depth."

It's a shame because I'm a really big John Woo fan and he is always coming up with great action flicks. This one just happens to be one of his minimal few ones. This action film is pretty much a silent film as it contains no dialogue at all from any of it's characters. Our main character seeks revenge on bad guys who had something to do with his son's death. While trying to save his son our hero damages his vocal chords so he can no longer speak. This sets up the premise of the film and let me tell you it gets very old after a while.

Plus I haven't seen such a fake, phony cartoonish set of bad guys since DEATH WISH 3 - where a ridiculous fake \"punk street gang\" battled Charles Bronson. Here our broken, enraged father - called Godlock - get it - sorta close to God Like - wow, a stoned freshman would think that was totally cool, man - anyhoo, the Latino gang he is after in this breathes not one breath of reality - every stock cliche is there so by the end, you don't even care that Woo knows how to place a camera during a gunfight.

On the face of it, it's another familiar DEATH WISH clone, with the twist that there's no dialogue here, a la Kim Ki-duk's MOEBIUS. The build-up is fine and the action in the second half is entertaining, even if there's too much reliance on CGI these days for my liking.

It's exciting, it's emotional, goddamn movie made me cry twice. Maybe you have to be a parent to see this movie to really feel the true rage of the main character.\n\nIt lets the action speak for itself without tedious and redundant dialogues you seen every other action movie. To me this is by far the best movie I've seen this year and John Woo is just one unique incredible director that cannot be compared to any other today.\n\nIf you like revenge movies, this is really top shelf.\n\nForget anyone who tries to put this movie down. There are a lot of haters out there for no reason at all. They shouldn't be watching these movies if they're so easily offended or don't get the style of John Woo.\n\nI just watched it last night and I'm already gravitating to watching it another time right now! 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The novelty of a movie with no dialogue only lasts for about half an hour. Once you're over that, it's just an excruciatingly slow movie. Storytelling without dialogue ends up being tedious, requiring your complete attention while progressing at a snails pace. I only made it half an hour into the film, which (not surprisingly) was the exact time I made it into A Quiet Place. The performances, writing, cinematography, pretty much every aspect of the movie is done well. The premise simply doesn't work. With no dialogue, the movie is doomed to be slow-paced for it's setup, and you simply can't make a slow-paced action movie. I have no problem with slower-paced movies, but that pace needs to be earned. I just don't have the patience for this."

But if you line violence filled films you'll like this one\n\nThe story is very basic and not really well paced in the beginning. The arc of the main catcher is pretty meh. I just didn't feel connected to toss story that much. But the action scenes were great and well choreographed. There's plenty of slow mo which OS pretty typical for a John Woo film.\n\nThe lack of dialogue does hurt the film. Very few films have been able to pull of a film worth next to no dialogue from the main character. You need powerful supporting characters and's this film didn't have it. The main actor OSS great but he's not an emotional actor so he's alil out of his element imo."

A dialogue choice by the director which was meant to be clever made it hard to connect to the main characters and made the pacing of the first 35 minutes almost unbearable. The main training montage which was intended to be hardcore and inspirational came across as laughable and cringeworthy. The few moments where good fight choreography and beautiful violence poked through we're not enough to overcome the abysmal acting and nerve straining soundtrack/audio devices. This is a movie that is not worth watching on cable while laid up in a hospital bed. It's honestly that bad. If you go forth anyway, at least I did my best to warn you."

        "review_detailed_main": "So where do i start with this one? Its basically John Wick but replace the dog by a child and add a twist that the character is muted due to his previous encounter with the peoples he will go after. Exept its nowhere as good as John Wick. On paper that sound for a cool action flick... but the movie sadly got its 3 strikes.\n\nFirst of all, this is a movie without dialogues minus a few voices on radio and a rare cellphone text lines. If this was made in Japan, you could had watch it in original language without english subtitles and still not have any problem understanding. They do try to create emotional connections trough physical acting and music but it just can't replace words for me. Not when everyone in the movie does it. And some situation make little sense due to the writer insisting on not having dialogues. It didn't felt natural.\n\nSecond strike came in the fact that the movie despite being deprived of dialogues ... goes on for about an hour of \"plot\" and nothingburger. When i saw the trailer i was expecting some crazy action movie. If there had been a 20m max intro and then boom boom gunshots, explosions, whatever, it may had worked a bit better? But here i just kept looking at the time and it took about an hour until action kicked in.\n\nAnd finally the third strike, the action is not that special... Its good yes, but it ain't mindblowing or original. If you take something like John Wick 3 and 4, it tried to outdo the other movies everytime with cool set ups and concept. Here its basically your general gunshot and car chase without much that come out of the ordinary. A few slowmos that were cool but thats it. Plot armor also show its ugly head ... i guess the gang members are all former Storm Troopers.\n\nOverall in the vein of these John Wick type of action movies i saw much better ones like Extraction, Nobody, and various ones from Streaming services. This movie plaster John Woo's name everywhere because its recognizable, but if i didn't know he directed it, i would had assume its just another streaming service production with a modest budget.\n\nI wouldn't go as low as to see the movie was \"terrible\" or anything, its simply i expected a lot better and it disapointed me. I will surely not go trough the 1h of \"plot\" to get to that small action part at the end again."

The Plot is a typically generic Revenge Action Thriller, this Film also disappoints with his emotional elements, It tries to be very emotional but failed and why must be the action scenes so John Wick oriented ? There is very little John Woo Style in Silent Night and the CGI Blood was also annoying. At least 2-3 Action Scenes in the Final Showdown were decent. As a Big Fan of John Woo - I would rate this with generous 6/10 Stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "John Woo's \"Silent Night\" promised a high-octane, bullet-riddled take on the Christmas movie genre, and in many ways, it delivered. The film's strengths lie in its stylish action sequences, masterfully choreographed by the legendary director known for his balletic gunplay. From the opening heist gone wrong to the climactic showdown in a snowy cabin, Woo's signature slow-motion shots and intricate fight choreography were on full display, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats.\n\nWhile the action set pieces were undoubtedly the film's highlight, the plot itself felt somewhat convoluted and underwhelming. The story revolves around a group of thieves who find themselves trapped in a remote cabin during a Christmas Eve heist, forced to fend off both the authorities and a mysterious group of heavily armed assailants. The premise had potential, but the execution often felt muddled, with too many characters and subplots vying for attention.\n\nThe ensemble cast was a mixed bag, with some standout performances overshadowed by others that felt one-dimensional or underwritten. Veteran actor Michael Madsen shone as the grizzled leader of the thieves, bringing a gritty authenticity to his role. However, some of the supporting cast members struggled to make their characters memorable, often falling into action movie clich\u00e9s.\n\nVisually, \"Silent Night\" was a feast for the eyes, with Woo's signature style lending a sleek and stylish aesthetic to the proceedings. The cinematography was top-notch, with the snowy landscapes and dimly lit interiors providing a striking contrast to the explosive action sequences. However, the film's tonal shifts were sometimes jarring, veering from intense violence to moments of dark humor that didn't always land.\n\nWhile \"Silent Night\" delivered on its promise of high-octane action and stylish visuals, it ultimately fell short in terms of narrative cohesion and character development. Fans of John Woo's signature style and over-the-top action sequences will find plenty to enjoy, but those seeking a more well-rounded and emotionally resonant Christmas movie may be left feeling a bit underwhelmed. Despite its flaws, \"Silent Night\" remains a guilty pleasure for action junkies and a unique addition to the holiday movie canon."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the 90's I saw an action movie that forever changed my appreciation of that genre: Hard Boiled. This film went on to become a cult phenomena and created its own action sub-genre.\n\nWoo returns six years after directing Manhunt(2017). This marks his return to American film-making following his last venture Paycheck(2003). So it has been a really long time he had last directed a film with American actors made for a mainstream American audience.\n\nPlot: a man's seven year old son is killed by a stray bullet fired during a gang related shoot-out. The man vows revenge at any cost. This then is the simple plot of this film. Now with movie like these and also the fact that it is directed by an action director, you can expect intense car chases and firefights and close-up action scenes.\n\nVerdict: I consider movies like Hard Boiled, Hard Target Broken Arrow and Face/Off John Woo's masterpieces. This film, though very lovingly directed, lacks rewatchability. This is mainly due to the fact that the script is a dull one. Also I found the background music rather poor and unsuited to a film of this caliber. On the bright side the acting and photography is excellent. I would consider this a decent time-pass film.\n\nP. S. Fans of Chow Yun-Fat(Hard Boiled) should watch this excellent movie Prison On Fire(1987). Thanks for reading this review and as Mister Spock always says,\"Live long and prosper\"."

He then starts planning his revenge throwing himself into a number of major training routine montages ready to take the gang members down on Christmas Eve.\n\nWith the 'novelty' of no speaking in this thriller, it is left to famed action director John Woo to deliver a number of mostly impressive action sequences leading to a predictable John Wickesque finale. The trouble here is that a vast chunk of the film is Kinnaman's character wallowing in understandable depression with lots of emotionally charged flashbacks. This would be fine if it wasn't so obviously just the counter to the crash bang wallop that Woo so loves to bring to the screen - and in fairness he does do it well. So whilst these scenes are played out well enough, there is a sense that this is the price Woo must pay to do his thing and therefore we tend to feel - yeah, ok, we know what you really want to do John so let's get on with it. Not a very good film really."

It follows along in typical John Woo fashion but with better visual effects. A lot of single shot kills that you say to yourself \"he's going to pop back up\" while watching. It's definitely not the next Die Hard that sparks debate over whether or not it's a Christmas movie. It won't be a film that you put into your annual Christmas rotation but it's worth a watch if your not expecting too much. The first few minutes get you excited with some real action then expect about 40 minutes of drawn out story at time filler."

So basic and lame for about everything about it.. so basically not worth your time at all. Action mid, script zero, scenarios none, i don't know how it's 5 on IMDB. It should be below that that, and the trailer made me watch it, the trailer has its the better good scenes action from the movie. Other than that none.

It's an explosive Christmas themed action film with no dialogue, loads of action, violence, battle sequences, car chases, stunts and a beautiful score from Marco Beltrami... Silent Night is a movie that is up there with Die Hard, Violent Night and other action films that will be awesome to see every year during Christmas time...

He falls apart then is galvanized into revenge, the usual plot.\n\nThere is some artistic Woo action, and way too much flashback pushing his agony in your face.\n\nI grant you that it is dark and grim, with a message about society letting things happen that should be tamped down, so the only way to solve it is to \"Kill Them All.\" But that doesn't make a good movie.\n\nIt does have great villains, though, which is one of my key criteria."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know what happened here. I believe there was a good concept behind all this mess, but it got lost during production, or in the editing room, who knows.\n\nJoel Kinnaman plays a father out for revenge after his son has been killed by a stray bullet from a gang related shooting. Real clich\u00e9 story but with John Woo there is always something special - this time it's the main character's silence, since he lost his vocal cords when he was shot in the neck. Good idea, poor execution.\n\nI think by making all the other characters silent as well it took away from the story and what's more important, it took away from the isolation of the father character. It could have been a great symbol, father loses son, loses voice as well, but they really wanted to stick to the concept of no dialogue with the rest of the characters as well, and it just doesn't make any sense.\n\nThe action scenes are mostly cool as you would expect from John Woo, but the editing feels like a mess a lot of times, creating odd scenes and logical jumps. For example Kinnaman pins two guys against a wall with his car, but in the next cut one of the guys is on the top of his car, how did he get there? There are a lot of these kinds of weird jumps in the movie, I really wonder if it's because they wanted to make the movie shorter or just didn't get the right shots to make the scenes make sense.\n\nIt's a pity because there are great shots in the movie, some scenes have great atmosphere and tension building, but it all falls apart in the next scene or shot, when some nonsensical thing happens.\n\nMy suggestion is to skip this one, especially if you like John Woo, you are going to be disappointed."

And at its premiere in Buenos Aires, in its first performance, I was one of the lucky ones who saw this work of art. Woo has given us some of the best action films of all time when he worked with his actor fetish, the great Chow Yun Fat. In this case Woo returns to work in the US to deliver a film that is a challenge; Can you tell a story without dialogue? Normally an action story requires defining a situation, drawing the characters, showing their motivations.... But it is a huge challenge to do it simply by relying on acting and music. It is a fantastic film with wonderful moments. It's not Hard Boiled or The Killer; With this I say that you will not find extreme moments but you will find beauty, action and emotion that will penetrate your heart and leave a mark. With the right preparation and attitude, this film is a transformative experience."

This whole thing could have been done in about 30 minutes and it would have been better. The aspect of the movie where nobody talks got old real quick. It works with the movie \"A Quiet Place\" but it was just stupid in this movie. I'm usually a big fan of the revenge killing type of movies but this one misses the mark. Definitely not the same caliber of movie as the John Wick series. Don't waste your time."

Which still works. Weird in some scenes as other characters do not speak. Understand with Joel Kinnaman as he gets shot at his throat which he cant speak at all. The action delivers. The music score is good that works with the tone and direction. May not be Woos best film but it is a good comeback."

        "review_detailed_main": "Woo at his worst. I recently had the misfortune of watching the much-hyped action movie, \"Silent Night,\" and let me tell you, it was a colossal letdown. From start to finish, the film seemed more interested in showcasing mindless explosions than telling a coherent and engaging story.\n\nThe plot, if you can call it that, felt like a mere afterthought. It was a mishmash of clich\u00e9s and tired tropes, with muted cardboard-cutout characters going through the motions of a generic action movie. The protagonist, a supposed \"tough guy,\" lacked any depth or charisma, making it impossible to invest in his journey. I found myself struggling to care about the fate of the world, as the filmmakers failed to create any emotional connection with the audience.\n\nBut perhaps the most egregious offence was the excessive and gratuitous use of gunfire and explosions. It's as if the filmmakers believed that more equals a better movie. It doesn't and the constant barrage of it quickly became monotonous and numbing, overshadowing any potential excitement the action sequences could have generated.\n\nMoreover, the special effects were subpar, resembling a video game from a decade ago rather than a blockbuster film in this day and age. The CGI felt lazy and uninspired, detracting from the overall viewing experience. I couldn't help but cringe at the poorly rendered explosions and lacklustre visual effects, wondering where the budget for this film actually went.\n\nThe dialogue was another sore point. The muted characters were cringe-worthy. It seemed as though the writers were absent due to the recent WGA writer strike so dialogue were non-existent.\n\nOverall, \"Silent Night\" is a prime example of style over substance. If you're looking for a mindless spectacle with no regard for plot or character development, then this might be the film for you. However, if you prefer action movies with substance, compelling characters, and a thoughtfully crafted narrative, I suggest you steer clear of this cinematic disaster."

None of it actually benefits the narrative or cinematic experience. Even once the action begins the rudimentary choreography and lack of dialog graduate from burdensome to frustrating rather quickly. Some of the visuals would be interesting if divorced from the context of the disjointed storytelling. Even if sentimentality was the intended narrative anchor it's quickly lost in the sophomoric tropes that belie a certain tinny immaturity. I didn't have high expectations for this movie, familiar action and revenge were the low bar this had to reach to satisfy, and somehow it didn't measure up to any reasonable sensibility to be enjoyable at all."

Every single bad guy aims directly for the obvious bulletproof vest worn by Kinnaman, who seems to sleepwalk through the majority of the movie. It is filled with eye roll inducing cliches and artistic-for-the-sake-of-it shots that may have fresh in the 90s but now just look stupid.\n\nI really really wanted to enjoy this film and watched all the way to the end hoping for a reason to like it but sadly it reminded me just how terrible John Woo actually is."

        "review_detailed_main": "The concept of a mute protagonist seeking vengeance following a tragic event holds promise, but the execution of the narrative fails to capitalize on this idea.\n\nOne of the film's major drawbacks is its lack of coherent storytelling, exacerbated by rushed pacing and disjointed editing. The plot follows a father who witnesses his son's murder on Christmas Eve and embarks on a quest for justice despite being mute due to a previous injury. However, the decision to have the entire movie devoid of dialogue, even when the protagonist can still hear and potentially communicate through other means, results in confusion and undermines character development.\n\nThe absence of dialogue contributes to a lack of depth in the characters, making them feel dull and one-dimensional. Without meaningful interactions or development, the audience struggles to connect with the protagonist and other characters, further detracting from the overall viewing experience.\n\nAdditionally, the film's action sequences, typically a saving grace for movies of this genre, fall short of expectations. The fight scenes lack creativity and intensity, with basic choreography and uninspired execution. Furthermore, subpar CGI detracts from the realism of the action, further diminishing the film's impact.\n\nDespite being directed by John Woo, known for his expertise in action filmmaking, \"Silent Night\" fails to deliver on its potential. Predictable villains and forgettable antagonists further contribute to the film's shortcomings, leaving little to redeem it.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Silent Night\" disappoints on multiple fronts, with a lack of cohesive storytelling, underdeveloped characters, and uninspired action sequences. While the premise held promise, the execution falls flat, resulting in a film that fails to leave a lasting impression. Viewers are advised to skip this one in favor of more engaging cinematic experiences."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the kind of movie that you only watch when you have nothing else to watch, just to pass time, it is bad without being horrible.\n\nThe movie recycles the theme of movies like Taken, Retribution, Edge of darkness, etc.\n\nThe acting is mid, you don't really get the feels that one usually gets when watching a movie with no dialogue, so they failed abysmally there.\n\nThere is no character buildup, we don't know nor do we connect to any character, not even the grieving father, who in his path to revenge, puts aside the woman that loved him and cared for him after he almost died.\n\nIt has many dumb moments, like leaving a knife ready for a cartel member, no matter if it is just an accountant, to take advantage of it, and that is in reality what cost him his life, because if he had not been stabbed in the leg and IIRC the arm by that dude, he'd've been much more aware later on\n\nWe also have the music engine thingie, who thought of that? You bond over a music box, not only its engine lol, but that is minor\n\nAfter a few good action scenes(although pointless, like that drifting the car shooting people) that are passable and \"realistic\" if we can call them that, we get the tower climb\n\nIn this part we get the hillariously bad scenes where hardened criminals come out guns in hand but incidentally everyone is either shooting at the ceiling or come out gun front, then they put the hand up and back down to shoot him\n\nThe only realistic bit of all this is that after a tough chase, with a crash, being hit multiple times by the cars, shot, stabbed, he can barely walk, so yeah, that part is realistic.\n\nThen we get the police officer, what a joke of a representation.\n\nThe final face off with the \"miniboss\" 1 is sort of ok, but again, we have the big bad guy that has like a dozen chances to shoot the goof guy(Not a typo) and he does not because #plotarmor\n\nWe then get to the face off with the second \"miniboss\" between captain dirty nails and goof guy, they wait until she actually reloads and starts shooting to come out and get shot\n\nBiggest goof of the film, the goof guy comes out from cover and doesn't shoot, so gets fatally wounded, then Captain dirty nails comes out and gets shot 3 times, no attempt at shooting back, the 3 distinct shots in different parts of the stomach\n\nAfter Goof guy fights the big bad boss, he gets his ass handed to him, and as he was about to get shot, Captain dirty nails comes back from the dead and shoots Big bad guy, then Goof guy strangles him to death, dies himself, and it is implied that Captain dirty nails also dies, but we do see him and instead of the clearly visible 3 shots, he now has only one\n\nAnd then wifey dear gets a letter where he sort of berates her about stopping loving him... what a slap on the face that is, ungrateful blind man.\n\nSo again, only watch this if you have watch all other movies around and have 1.5hrs to waste(Like if you are in a bus ride and the only option is this movie, or an airplane or such things)"

Although it is stylised, it focuses on the characters and their emotions. I was a bit sceptical about the lack of dialogue, but everything binds together and flows very well.\n\nI found it a lot better that the John Wick films and not as wooden and over the top. However, it is still very raw and violent and cathartic.\n\nProbably the haters expected the usual American-save-the-world Mission Impossible type of film. Silent Night is a lot deeper in terms of emotions and acting. Kinneman is great, like he was in Altered Carbon.\n\nIgnore the bad reviews - a must see!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Silent Night, with its ambitious premise of a dialogue-free narrative, initially presents an intriguing concept that holds promise. The idea of storytelling through silence and visual cues holds an allure, setting the stage for a potentially immersive and unique cinematic experience. However, the execution of this concept ultimately falls short, leaving the audience more frustrated than engaged.\n\nThe absence of dialogue, intended to heighten tension and convey emotions through visuals, unfortunately becomes a hindrance rather than an asset. While the silent approach has its moments of atmospheric intrigue, it struggles to sustain engagement throughout the film's duration. Instead of drawing viewers deeper into the narrative, the lack of verbal communication feels forced, leading to a disconnect and hindering character development.\n\nThe characters, despite commendable efforts from the cast, suffer from a lack of depth and meaningful interaction due to the absence of dialogue. As a result, the emotional impact and investment in their stories become diluted, making it challenging to establish a genuine connection with their experiences.\n\nMoreover, the pacing and plot development suffer due to the reliance on visuals alone. What could have been a refreshing take on storytelling ends up feeling like a missed opportunity, with scenes that drag and fail to capitalize on the potential of a dialogue-free narrative.\n\nWhile Silent Night should be commended for its bold attempt to explore a different form of cinematic storytelling, the execution ultimately falls flat. The concept, while intriguing on paper, struggles to sustain engagement and deliver a fulfilling viewing experience, leaving the audience longing for more substance and depth in its silent approach."

There is background chatter, like radio and TV sound. To have dialog would have made this less compelling. No talky passages to slow things down. There are a few scenes where you really feel this man's pain. His muteness stands as a metaphor for single minded payback. Great performances all around including a particularly slimy villain.

I always watch to the end, though I also always choose a bit more carefully, and I picked this on a whim, based on the \"John Wick\" marketing and Joel Kinnaman. When \"John Woo\" popped up as the director, I actually got excited, as a very big fan of his early Hong Kong movies (and to a lesser extent his classic nineties ones). Then, I had to switch it off after about 30 minutes. So feel free to move onto the next review, or...\n\nHaving looked though some of the reviews here (after I switched it off), there are many valid reasons why this is such a mess. The opening sequence was silly but had that classic John Woo touch. What did it for me, was that the \"emotional\" build up was so overwrought and unbelievable, that I couldn't take it anymore. The acting was fine, but the film was so steeped in Technicolor, a la Wizard of Oz, that the world they existed was more like GTA. The \"gangsters\" were laughably stereotyped, which is ok in a video game when every character is an intentional stereotype to drive the gameplay, vs. This utter nonsense. It is a funny moment when the original Death Wish series manages to feel more emotional and connected with reality than this 2023 attempt, which played like a parody that was actually trying to be serious.\n\nI am going to watch the rest, out of principal, and because I want to see at least a spark of John Woo's trademark gun opera, otherwise I will only be left with the 30 minutes or so of sugar laden emotional garbage I managed to sit through already. Though apparently, I have at least another 30 minutes of that to trudge through first."

Violent, tick, story, well there is story, so tick. But ultimately this is a grim, grim film of a man in pure raw grief. Could never have a happy ending. In many ways it reminded me of 3 Billboards..... A great film, but half way through you realise that Frances mcCormand would get her revenge but never get her daughter back. We made it to the end, but it's 1 hour 44 minutes of my life that I can never get back. Nothing wrong with the activity, but a grim movie that I (and husband) disliked intensely.

He survives but can't speak anymore.\n\nThe parents now has to live through the nightmare that all parents have, losing their young child. The father breaks totally, now the mother have to cope with the loss of a child and a totally absent husband. She has to be the strongest of the two.\n\nFather starts drinking, totally ignoring the mother's grief and struggle. But one day the father more or less awakens, now with just one thought, revenge.\n\nNow we're at least half way through the film. We watch the father prepare for his plans to kill every gang member. We witness what the mother has to do, we witness the dilemma of a policeman, and we witness the revenge.\n\nThe drama part and the action part are very well made.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is really a fundamentally good example on how not to make a good action movie. You have seen the lead actor Joel Kinnaman in a lot of better productions like in House of Cards and in the remake from 2014 called Robocop. In this movie I can't really see why he wasted his time even producing because it is really a mid action-movie at best. John Woo who is an expert at making action movies and has always been able to make decent movies despite hardcore action, like you see in the second Mission Impossible movie or in the first Red Cliff. But here it seems that he either ran out of ideas or that he just tried to be way too ambitious.\n\nBecause when he tries to make a more serious movie without too much dialogue than reminds you of a scuffed version of Death Wish where it is nowhere near the violence or intensity of those movies you end up with a bad result, and even the Bruce Willis version from 2018 is better than this movie. There are so many moments where it had been way more natural that the characters actually had some sort of dialogue especially between the lead character and his girlfriend. Inistead he just sits sobbing drinking alone, and the movie tries to create this dark and devious mood that you never can live yourself into. Also the movie is vashed away by flashbacks a highly emotional mood by the beginning, when actually John Woo could have given us the classic revenge thriller a lot faster without going through all the side roads, with the emotional arc and long planning sequence in the garage leading up to a kill spree on christmas. Yes I get that he misses his son but it does not have to go through half the movie to deal with that loss, and because of that the movie at times seem more like a drama movie than an actual action movie.\n\nYou have some good scenes with the high-octane opening sequence and it really looked better on the trailer than the on the final result. In addition you also got the fight scene right before the first hour is done, but rather than that the action scenes are done in a sloppy way where the main character is really not that challenged apart from the last fight. The action scenes really lack intensity and it is nothing like John Woo used to do in some of his earlier movies. You miss better characters and while these gangsters I am sure some of them could maybe be real characters you just feel they are portrayed to be too dumb and stupid to really be realistic.\n\nWalking into I expected a more hardcore and less sentimental drama/action movie where the main character actually said a few lines: \"John Wick\" does not talk that much either but it works better with a little dialogue in these sort of movies, at least if you do something with a lot less dialogue you need better imagination and a better plot. Of course such movies like these never have a good plot, but then at least the action scenes need to be more intense the main character need more challenges and the characters need to be a lot better. Jason Bourne may at times have it easy because he is a one-man army too but at least he struggles a lot more in some of the fights and some of the action movies these days are just not able to actually make gunfights or fist fights that entertaining anymore. Of course you have seen a lot of revenge plots in action movies, but this is one of the most mid I have seen at least and for me it's a 5/10."

The poignant loss felt by say Chow Yun Fat or John Travolta offsetting their killing, is lost as angry unredeeming revenge that doesnt even contain pathos or any feeling of justice. It is just watching a man lose his son, and then walk away from everything else becoming obsessed with killing those who caused it. There is no YEAH...SHOOT HIM AGAIN DAMNIT joy in his quest!\n\nIts just, dark, gritty, fairly UN-entertaining death. None of his revenge victims had any idea who he was or that he had any reason. They just were people being killed.\n\nI dont recommend this to fans of revenge drama or artistic gunplay. Frankly it was very disappointing on all accounts. Woo has done better. MUCH better."

What makes it even more tough is the aforementioned absence of proper dialogue from the movie, so it's very hard to relate to this couple who can't even properly communicate their feelings to each other.\n\nOh well. I can't help thinking the film would've been better if they'd ditched the stupid 'silence' gimmick and just done a straight action flick. Plus a bit more humour would've be nice... apart from the bizarre opening sequence involving hero wearing a Rudolf jumper whilst chasing the bad guys, there's not much funny here at all.\n\n5/10 mostly for the last half-an-hour or so... once you get there, decide for yourself if it was worth it or not."

The film from the producers of John Wick, so of course we can expect action and bloody, messy shooting battles. But unfortunately, this film disappoints with almost everything. First the plot. So ok, do you know the story about Baba Yaga (John Wick) that takes vengeance on a mafia because they killed his beloved dog? Well, this is kind of the same, but this is just a different person, and they killed the protagonists son, not an animal. And he has to massacre a gang, too. Let's go over the good sides just to get it through. First, the camera filming. Great angles that made the action better. More excitement and dynamic in the scenes that I appreciated. The ending was good too, with a good conclusion to a generic story, but still, good ending, very emotional and makes impression. But that's about it. This was just not for me. I like the John Wick movies, and Violent NIght was ok, but in here they didn't have any ideas. Most of the runtime felt improvised, and the acting is very plastic and didn't have a good impression. They tried to give the non-speaking killer dad a development, but it was showed very weakly and his emotions didn't come as bright as I wished. His enemies were no IQ antagonists that couldn't have been more generic. The non-speaking killer dad killing them one by one was showed in a weak process, and the action wasn't that interesting, a few good moments but it was mostly saved by the good camera filming. The script felt fast paced, and as I mentioned, the limited dialogues in the film felt like it was written by a filmschool student. You know, just disappointing crap, I expected something much better, especially from such popular producers, and next time I wish more originality, power and taste into the stories they make, included the action."

        "review_detailed_main": "So, I assume the low ratings are from people complaining about the slow, teary, pace of the first 40% of the movie. But, if you keep watching, it does get better after the 60% mark. As for that last 50% of the movie, see below.\n\n\"Silent Night\" is a gripping and stylish action thriller that marks the triumphant return of legendary director John Woo to Hollywood. Starring Joel Kinnaman as a vengeful father who loses his voice and his son in a gang shootout on Christmas Eve, the film is a masterclass of visual storytelling, with minimal dialogue and maximum impact. Woo's signature style of slow-motion, dual-wielding, and doves is on full display, as Kinnaman's character embarks on a brutal and relentless quest for justice against the ruthless gang leader Playa, played by Harold Torres. The film also features a strong supporting cast, including Scott Mescudi as a sympathetic detective, Catalina Sandino Moreno as Kinnaman's estranged wife, and Angeles Woo as a badass policewoman. Silent Night is a must-see for fans of action cinema, as it delivers a thrilling and satisfying ride that will leave you breathless."

I understand the build-up and setup.. but there's always a better way to do it more efficiently. Constantly stopping the momentum becomes an annoyance. Then, the movie isn't trying to be fun, even once it gets going (with all the killing). There's a constant contrast of imagery and a will to maintain a more sentimental weight to the execution.. and that contrast hurts it, IMO, even if it's necessary due to the events and main character's thrust. It's somewhat realistic, which I appreciate, and not at all X-Mass-y.\n\nBut I can appreciate the \"no dialogue\" execution, \"interesting\" editing and camerawork, and decent action. At least it also ends in a somewhat satisfying manner.. if not predictable."

If only the rest left more or less the same impression, I would have been more generous with the rating!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had intended to watch this movie in theaters, but there were too many other movies I chose to pay for in theaters and missed out. It may have been good I did. I finally saw this on a streaming service and I was blown away. First, I usually run my sound system at level 20. I thought my ears were messed up and turned it to 25 and still heard very little. I had no idea this movie has nearly no dialogue. While movies have been able to pull this off for effect and purpose, I don't see why no other character in the movie could say anything. Lots of texting and sign language. I guess John Woo was challenged to direct a movie with no actual dialogue.\n\nSecond, this movie, while cliche to the max, could have been way more entertaining. Everyone loves a revenge / payback movie. However, this was a complete mess. The storytelling was all over the place, and without anyone actually talking, you, the viewer are left trying to learn how to read body language and texts. Third, this is a huge drop off for both Kinnaman who I loved in Altered Carbon Season 1 - IMO, the best single season in Sci-Fi TV history, and John Woo who directed Face / Off.\n\nLastly, the ending of this movie was more of a comedy than anything. I really don't know if John Woo was trolling the studio for the ending or what. The action scenes were ok, but the rest of the movie was a complete mess. The only positive is it's only around 100 minutes so you can watch in one sitting."

However, it soon became clear that this film was going to be completely void of any dialogue between the characters. I think one of the gangsters mumbled \"f*** you\" toward the end of the picture, but I wouldn't really say that that was dialogue. I was half expecting Marcel Marceau to pick up a phone at some point and utter the word \"non.\" I started thinking that perhaps halfway during filming one of the actors lost their voice and the production company decided to just eliminate the dialogue to make it work. In other words, this dialogue-free production was such a bad idea, I believe it would have had to be a desperate one.\n\nBased on the synopsis I read, I didn't expect much more than a shoot 'em up action movie with a lot of gritty inner-city hip-hop music and blaring gunfire. I probably would not have gone for a movie like this, but I was bored and I like Joel Kinnaman, but I usually prefer to hear him speak.\n\nAnother goof I noticed was that when Brian delivers the greeting card to the detective, the detective just picks it up and puts fingerprints all over it. Even if he already knew who it came from, this was still evidence. Even I know that you don't put your fingerprints all over evidence and I'm dumb as a box of rocks."

It wasn't exactly Christmas John Wick like I was hoping for.\n\nIt was just tragedy turns man into PTSD- overwhelmed killing machine, it was both too real to life and not realistic enough. From the protagonist's perspective it was very single minded, which makes sense because he can't stop making the bad guys pay. But there was too many looks into his mind that shows us that he is just sad and traumatized inside."

While the film boasts some well-choreographed action sequences, it's ultimately let down by a predictable plot, mediocre acting, and a protagonist whose decisions often defy logic.\n\nThe action scenes are competently handled and provide moments of excitement. However, these thrills are fleeting as the film quickly falls back into a narrative rut we've seen countless times before. The story offers nothing new, and the uninspired script fails to generate any real suspense or intrigue.\n\nAdding to the film's woes are the uninspired performances from the cast. While no one is outright terrible, the acting is largely forgettable. Even the usually charismatic Joel Kinnaman seems to be phoning it in, delivering a performance devoid of any real depth or emotion. Furthermore, his character's actions are often baffling and illogical, leaving the audience scratching their heads rather than rooting for his success.\n\nUltimately, Silent Night is a passable way to kill a couple of hours if you're desperate for some mindless action. However, with its derivative plot, uninspired performances, and questionable character choices, it's unlikely to leave a lasting impression."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched the film on Christmas night last year. This film was genuinely amazing, by the unique mostly silence from unbelievably bad dialogs, this film will make you listen to some music while watching, with the actual revenge movie with the closest we can get for a Christmas Special of Max Payne, this film is perfectly good for Christmas, Joel Kidnnaman is the perfect performance for his character. After 20 years of John Woo being silent from Hollywood this is the definition of a comeback for a director, although my only criticism is that Goodlock didn't train more enough but the ending was so sad it was so good. Welcome back John Woo."

        "review_detailed_main": "Silent Night depicts a man on a revenge plan after a traumatic loss. The twist? He is unable to speak. Following from this, the movie has little dialogue with the characters not speaking directly on camera. Thus, the film is focus more on the action set forth by the main character as he seeks his revenge.\n\nJoel Kinnaman is the highlight of this film. He expands on his acting abilities as I felt I knew what his character was thinking and feeling even though he didn't utter a single word or convey anything with words until the very end (in written form).\n\nI understand why many feel this film is underwhelming or a disappointment. They were expecting a John Woo film, a slick stylized action film that hyperextended reality for the violence. And, they only get half of this. The violent action is well choreographed and film. There is a sleekness to some sequences.\n\nBut, much like the lack of dialogue, the base reality of the action makes the viewer recognize the imperfections of the hero, and the actual impact of violence on the human body. It's too real for the expected sleek John Woo action film. And for that, I liked it better than the hyper stylized depiction from the past. The reality of the violence drew me closer to the main character, and thus closer to the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film is a masterclass of visual storytelling, as Woo uses every cinematic tool at his disposal to convey the emotions, motivations, and actions of the characters. The film is full of stunning action sequences, ranging from car chases, shootouts, hand-to-hand combat, and explosions. Woo also pays homage to his classic films, such as The Killer (1989) and Hard Boiled (1992), by incorporating elements of slow motion, doves, and dual-wielding guns.\n\nKinnaman delivers a powerful performance as Brian Godlock, a man who loses everything and becomes consumed by his quest for vengeance. He expresses his pain, anger, and determination through his body language, facial expressions, and actions. He is also convincing as an action hero, displaying physical prowess and agility in the fight scenes. The supporting cast, including Scott Mescudi, Harold Torres, and Catalina Sandino Moreno, also do a great job in their roles.\n\nSilent Night is a film that will appeal to fans of action, revenge, and John Woo. It is a film that does not need words to tell a compelling story, as it speaks louder than words through its action. It is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, as it is a cinematic spectacle that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Silent Night is the best action film of 2023, and one of the best films of John Woo's career."

        "review_detailed_main": "I read a few negative reviews before watching and I ended up being surprised at how entertained I was! You had some classic John Woo moments, but also brings something that's never really been done before. Joel Kinnamon the main character of the movie has his voice box blown out early in the movie so he loses his ability to speak. Rather than having your typical action movie with the typical cliche lines throughout the newly mute main character has to communicate with body language and other ways than speaking. I think Joel does a smashing job of expressing the pain he's going through over his son's death without speaking a single line throughout the film. As a goal oriented person I enjoyed watching the growth of our father seeking revenge as he gets physically stronger and better with guns and driving from the start of his training as well. Amazing story of personal growth. Fantastic action sequences in true John Woo fashion and just a very cool all around movie. I give this one 8/10."

Losing your child caught my attention because the reality of every family living in a gangster place is terrifying and very dangerous, and when a child dies, everyone finally pays attention. The phenomenon of this film has been the revenge of burying these savages with their weapons and movements without saying a word and in every step that the father took when he destroyed the entire gang until he reached the idiot who killed his son. The greatness of this movie and the lead actor considering the ending makes me feel melancholy and gives me peace knowing that he died knowing that he would be with his little son."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie isn't as high energy as the John Wick movies, which I assume is what everyone is expecting since it carries the name of the action director John Woo who is known for his work in John Wick. But this movie isn't a high powered action movie, but a slow innovative silent movie.\n\nThe story is still completely expressed despite the absence of words, which is remarkable. Each seen makes you look, think and understand the story. While I agree that the movie does have a slow start, the actual training and revenge are reasonably executed. They show that he's a common man, doing what he can to take revenge within a year. He's not a trained hitman, so he starts out clumsy in first few fights, but this shouldn't be treated as a negative, but a testament to how real the fights are. Similarly, there are scenes where there is adrenaline pumping, and realistically the enemies don't go down in 1 bullet to the abdomen.\n\nThis is a good simple action movie in and of itself, but the fact that it goes beyond that to try out a new style of cinema should be applauded, especially when no one else is trying anything new."

Some of the reviewers her don't accept the stylization or the time spent on character set up Woo embraces some newer film technology in the action here. The plot is nonsensical but I loved it. I'm now not so worried about him remaking the Killer in the US\n\nmy vote 9/10 just to balanc esome of the haters."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was very curious to see how Master film maker John Woo would re enter the US market with his new film and I also love Joel Kinnermann acting chops.\n\nThe film is probably not for the younger gens that do not appreciate the slow emotional build up that Master Woo is known for to create a closer connection to central characters journey. However this one does take its sweet time almost an hour of back story and yet doing it without any vocal dialogue is extremely challenging but it's done majestically and by the 2nd and 3rd act it is a crescendo of a finale.\n\nThe action and stunts are top notch and it's not a very complex plot as it's a simple revenge story with lots of solid action that almost feels more like a John Wick film in the 3rd act\n\nLooking forward to his new film a remake of The Killer\n\nA solid 8 stars."

While I understand why some people don't like this movie, I absolutely loved it.\n\nPositives for Silent Night (2023): First off, Joel Kinnaman's performance in this movie is absolutely phenomenal to where he has no dialogue and yet he's able to capture a lot of emotion with his physical performance. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie to where his performance has me crying. In fact, there is no dialogue in the movie and while it's the main element of this movie that will divide auidences, it absolutely worked for me. The action sequences in this movie are absolutely phenomenal and it's some of the best action in a John Woo Movie since Red Cliff (2008) & Red Cliff II (2009). And finally, the ending to this movie had me crying because of how sad and heartbreaking it was and yet it made me so happy because of what happened prior to the movie's ending.\n\nOverall, Silent Night (2023) is a phenomenal comeback movie for John Woo to American Cinema and I am so excited to see his remake of Killer later this month."

        "review_detailed_main": "Director John Woo (Hard Boiled/The Killer) is back, on the big screen, in this interesting effort from last year. After losing his son during a yuletide drive-by by some Hispanic drug thugs, a distraught & now silent father (after getting shot in the neck where he loses his power of speech), Joel Kinnaman is on a mission to take down the ones who took his in a year's time even though his wife, Oscar nominee Catalina Sandino Moreno, fears she'll lose him in his quest & a cop, Kid Cudi, is on his tail to thwart his efforts. Using Kinnaman's silence carries over to the script itself where any dialogue heard is tangentially in the background leaving everything in the film motion & action based which almost becomes an antidote to something like the John Wick series, where Woo, the action master, shows all comers how he got to the top of the heap."

        "review_detailed_main": "Personally, I can't understand the negative reviews. Silent Night is like a colorful mix of John Woo's earlier works. Is that bad? Not for me. Woo always stood for melodrama paired with grandiose and bloody action where logic always falls by the wayside stayed. But this isn't about logic either. It's about family, loss and revenge. Simple and poignant. Heroic Bloodshed meets New school is how I would describe it. Okay a lot of things are exaggerated in the action scenes, but that didn't appeal to me least disturbed, because Woo has always crossed the threshold into logical action at some point in his films and at a certain point simply unleashes a death ballet of blood and tears. I like Silent Night both in the action and in the quiet scenes and I have to admit that I had a tear in my eye at the end."
