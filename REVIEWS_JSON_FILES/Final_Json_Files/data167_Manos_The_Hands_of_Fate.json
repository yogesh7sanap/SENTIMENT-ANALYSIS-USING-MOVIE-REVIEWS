        "review_detailed_main": "I watched Manos last night.\n\nOh, I was the cocky one, intrigued by all the attention Manos receives, even though it is, after all, 40 years old. Sure, I thought, it'll be a laugh to investigate the claim that this might be the worst film ever made. Why, if its that bad, there must at least be comedy value in its awfulness? And in consolation, it is only an hour long.\n\nNo, the warnings are true and serious, this is bloody terrible.\n\nAfter twenty minutes, I had stopped sniggering at the unimaginable ineptitude. I only realised that twenty minutes had passed when i flicked on the timer on the DVD; I honestly thought it was closer to forty-five.\n\nAfter forty minutes I was shifting uncomfortably in my chair and I wanted to cry.\n\nAfter an hour, I was submerged in despairing, pointless anger. I was angry with everyone involved in the film, angry with my cup of tea, my flat, the world, even God Himself (or Herself).\n\nYou will lose faith in humanity watching this film.\n\nImagine any conceivable measure for any possible aspect of film-making, and Manos still gets zero out of whatever. This \"film\" fails so utterly in every way, you'll wonder if anyone involved in its creation had ever seen or even heard of films or television. No, more than that, you'll wonder if they'd ever even spent a day on this planet. There isn't one single moment that you forget that these people are standing in front of a camera, ineptly executing one of the most awful scripts ever imagined.\n\nI've never been so insulted by any form of \"entertainment\". I lost count of the number of times I was beaten over the head with a totally obvious point. I lost count of the number of times completely random stuff just *happened* with no genesis or consequence. I certainly didn't lose count of the number of locations used, or the number of musical cues, you could count those on one hand, after a circular saw accident. It baffled me that they never realised that you can't shoot film at night without some form of lighting. And the music itself... oh God.\n\nI don't need to warn you about spoilers, there's plenty to complain about without resorting to inconsequential detail. Like the way that every time it cuts to the family, they're just standing, for no reason, in the same spot, waiting to talk to the camera. Like the absolutely shocking and disgraceful editing. People jump from awake to asleep and back, from one spot to another, from happy to sad, instantaneously. The awful acting... I don't know, its like everyone was given a piece of paper with some emoticons for happy, sad, scared and angry, and told to learn them off. The dialogue... well, technically it *is* dialogue, in the same way that McDonalds is food. Well, some people might enjoy McDonalds. See, I can't think of a parallel awfulness; \"Manos\" is to \"bad\" as... you can't finish that sentence.\n\nGood Lord, I could go on, and on, and on, but I won't. This film cannot warrant anything but a 1/10 on IMDb. I haven't seen any of the other bottom 100 as of today, but i'm willing to bet that they are at least a rough approximation to what we call a \"film\". This is not.\n\nSeriously, you really, really need to be in a masochistic kinda mood to see this out. I had to leave the screen timer on after 45 minutes just so I could keep reminding myself that, second by second, it *would* end. Because Hell itself might just be never-ending Manos."

What can I say about a movie that has endless looped scenes of driving, the worst evil henchman in movie history, the lamest dialouge this side of my first grade hebrew school play, a movie that seems to have put together by people with utter contempt for the audience's intelligence?

        "review_detailed_main": "Equaled in clarity of vision and flawless execution only by the greater works of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock, brilliant independent film auteur Hal Warren's \u0091Manos: The Hands of Fate' transcends its genre to do everything that it should and even more. Not only is it riveting edge of your seat entertainment, it also boasts a psychological depth unequaled by any other horror movie, achieved mostly through John Reynold's Oscar-worthy, divinely subtle performance as the tormented, tragically misshapen caretaker Torgo. Part Quasimodo, part Hamlet, this gentle soul's noble end, in which he is massaged to death by a group of terrifying succubae in luscious robes, is unarguable one of the most poignant in motion picture history \u0096 it is both a tragedy and a triumph of the human spirit. Oh, was I alone with a tear in the eye at the end!\n\nIndeed, Hal Warren's masterpiece achieves the perfect balance between the heartrendingly sad, the refreshingly sardonic, and the chillingly satanic. The Master and his hellbeast are as much evil personified as Margaret is the embodiment of goodness and chastity. In a way, this is the definitive modern-day equivalent of Goethe's Faust, though even more sublime in the simple poetry of its dialogue. When Torgo describes his master as being `not dead the way you know it' and `with us always' he is speaking for all of us, how we truly live on through the memory of our words and deeds in the minds of those who follow us, be they righteous or malevolent.\n\nHal Warran not only changed the face of the Texan film industry by encapsulating such a grand story in less than 75 minutes, it also helped usher in a whole new perspective of looking at film, discovering different forms which never would have been conceived. Also, it's obviously a very personal film for Warren, who allows us to share his love and devotion to the project, and it is a truly moving, cathartic experience.\n\nIt will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and maybe \u0096 just maybe \u0096 you'll learn a little bit about yourself."

        "review_detailed_main": "This isn't a movie. This isn't even a home video. It's a home video that aspired to be a movie but crashed somewhere in-between, and plummeted through the abyss to depths unimaginable by the mainstream. Coherence is the film's greatest foe: bizarrity and incompetence its watchwords. This is it, bad movie buffs. This is Manos: Hands of Fate.\n\nYears ago, in the dusty desert outside El Paso, an unknown fertilizer salesman decided to craft a horror film with the assistance of friends throughout the El Paso area, and a legend was born. Armed with $19,000 dollars, a cheap 16mm camera, and absolutely no knowledge of the art of film-making whatsoever, Hal P. Warren set out upon his masterpiece.\n\nThere is absolutely no redeeming quality about Manos. There is no directing, the editing appears as if it was done by a blind member of some mud-crawling insect species, the artwork is a stain upon the name of art, the script is a poorly cluttered and illogical joke masking the director's fantasies, the dialog will have you tear out your eardrums with your fingernails, and the acting is so atrocious you will feel as if the movie has violated you. It isn't as bad as Monster-a-Go-Go, but it almost manages to snatch the sorry laurels of worst movie ever made from that Lovecraftian abomination.\n\nManos must have put good directors like Kubrick or Capra in convulsions during its production: so powerful is the elemental force of badness flowing from every stinking pore of its perverse form. It is the polar opposite to the good movie, the parameters of its illogicity and non-acting existing to defy the borders of taste, and ultimately, sanity. Every grainy, scratchy, blurry frame of the muddy color palette and every sound byte of the poorly synchronized and terribly dubbed dialog offers an entrancing glance into a deeper, darker world of madness that is Manos the Hands of Fate. It is not of this earth. It is not of our dimension. Surely Hal P. Warren was some malfeasant alien god from a realm far removed from our own, hurtling across the icy chasms of space with a vile mission in store for the unsuspecting members of the cinematic world.\n\nIts legacy, however, lives on in the form of Mystery Science Theater. The acid-tipped barbs flew fast and furiously, striking the venerable beast in its countless weak points, crafting from the chaos a comedic gem that approaches cinematic perfection stamped into the world of movies in its own stinking ichor. This is Manos: Hands of Fate. This is the purifying baptism of fire that scourges the detestable vestiges of mediocrity and normalcy from the mainstream viewer and forever makes them a member of the cult world, the world of bad movies and weirdness that cannot be imagined. It is the cornerstone, the figurehead, the mighty totem representing everything that Mystery Science Theater and the legions of bad movie sites across the Web hold dear to their hearts.\n\nRejoice, connoisseurs of bad movies! Fall upon the dark altar of Manos to pay homage to Torgo and the Master, and forever remember the twisted legacy they wrought from the tangled celluoid! Imitate Torgo's stumbling walk and high-brained drawl, until it fuses with the very core of your being!"

I was age 16 back in 1966 attending Andress High School in El Paso, Texas and heard about the WORLD PREMIERE of the movie \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" .... there were write-ups about it in the two major papers and coverage on the local TV stations. I did not attend the WORLD PREMIERE, but I checked the newspaper listings and went on a Saturday afternoon.... I thought it was going to be a scary movie, and after about ten minutes or so I started to giggle a little. I noticed others at the downtown El Paso theater were laughing a little too. Well, I can't recall what the exact scene was, but suddenly it was so funny I had tears rolling down my face! The movie was worth the ticket price (probably a Dollar) but I thought I was going to see a scary movie and it turned out to be a comedy. Long before the media called it the worst movie, I knew it was the worst for me even before the movie was over! People were laughing and smiling as they left the movie; and, I and they did not know that years later it would be famous -- but not in a way the cast and crew would have ever envisioned. Perhaps the movie was too misunderstood my many. God Bless all of those -- living and dead -- who were involved with the movie \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" back in 1966....."

Its absolutely ridiculous, yet somehow it is probably one of the better parts of the movie.\n\n2-Directing The directing is probably the worst part of the movie, I don't know how any person could put so much filler and actionless situations in a movie.\n\n3-Editing Wow. That is the only word to describe the editing or lack thereof. People will be standing one moment, and sitting the next. They didn't even bother making clips look similar, the movie is not smooth at all. I couldn't tell if the actors were purposely repeating this over and over, or if the editing was just so bad they forgot to take out the second line.\n\n4-Acting The acting is one of a kind. In this case, that is not a good thing. The acting is extremely forced, especially in the case of Torgo. All of the actors are incredibly phony. Torgo's repetition of his lines, the delayed reactions, and Torgo's drunk motions are simply awful. I swear at times I thought the actors were mentally retarded.\n\nWhen you put all of these together, and add a master with a weird cape and a black dog, you get the worst movie of all time.

The negative criticisms and those slamming it as the worst movie ever do not lie, Manos: The Hands of Fate is as bad as all that. There is such thing as a terrible movie that has novelty comic value, but there is also such thing as a movie that is too inept to take that into consideration. Some will disagree, but I consider Manos: The Hands of Fate as a good example of the latter. To call the way the movie is made amateurish is being too kind, the camera work and editing are all over the place and makes anything that happens incomprehensible. The visual effects are dated and make everything even more artificial than it already is, while the bizarre and often out of sync sound effects and a score that is shrill and monotonous are enough to make your ears bleed. And even when your poor ears are suffering enough, they are assaulted even more by dialogue that is stilted, insultingly cheesy and too talky and some of the worst and annoying acting ever in film history. The villain is quite possibly the most laughable and underwhelming villain ever and you'd be hard pressed to find one that is worse-acted than here. Torga is the best thing about Manos: The Hands of Fate, but that's saying nothing as he's still irritating. The direction is so flat that you have to look hard to find evidence of any direction at all, while the story is incredibly thin and is so plodding that you're dying of boredom. In conclusion, hopelessly inept. 0/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Manos: The Hands of Fate, currently ranked #5 on IMDb's Bottom 100, is a rite of passage for serious fans of trashy horror movies, marking the transition from 'merely bad' to 'completely and utterly inept in every way imaginable. It's a test of fortitude that sees many fall by the wayside; however, those who do manage to go the distance can wear their achievement as a badge of pride, knowing that they have taken the very worst that z-grade horror can throw at them and survived the ordeal (albeit with possible mental scarring).\n\nThe one-and-only film from Harold P. Warren, who obviously realised thereafter that film directing wasn't his fort\u00e9, Manos opens with a family driving through the desert on their way to Valley Lodge for a vacation. Unfortunately, father Michael (Harold P. Warren, proving that acting wasn't his fort\u00e9 either), his wife Margaret (Diane Adelson), and daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman) soon find themselves lost, eventually pulling up to a strange desert hostel where they are greeted by twitchy manservant Torgo (John Reynolds), who looks like he stores bags of popcorn or cotton wool down his trousers.\n\nTorgo warns that his master (Tom Neyman) won't be happy if they stay the night, but they won't take no for an answer; their stubborn insistence puts them in serious peril, for the master is the head of a Satanic cult and he wants to add Margaret to his collection of brides.\n\nTo list everything that is wrong with this film would take longer than it took me to watch it (including the times where I fell asleep and had to rewind), suffice to say that there are fewer examples of poor editing, dreary pacing, atrocious direction, woeful acting, and diabolical dubbing. Quite how Warren and company managed to mess up in all departments is one of the great mysteries of cinema, ranking right up there with the inexplicable popularity of Seth Rogen, but it has ensured the film a notoriety that means it will never be forgotten."

The problem is not that the person is too close to the picture, and therefore cannot see the mistakes he's making. The problem is also not an inability to make necessary adjustments after stepping back to look at one's work. The problem with this film's direction is much deeper. Do not be fooled into thinking that this film was bad \"on purpose,\" because if there is a God, this cannot be true. In the history of the world, no manure salesman has decided to make a crappy (pun intended) movie for the purpose of defining \"the crappiest movie.\" No. The problem here is about the complete and utter failure of humanity. The word \"never\" had not yet been defined until this movie was \"made.\" In the end, there's no reason to consider that this movie had a director.\n\nEditing: When you were a child, you probably tried to shove two mismatched puzzle pieces together -- I admit, I've even tried this -- but you and I eventually learned that this is wrong. The editor of this film did not learn this valuable life lesson. The credits at the end of the film are the centerpieces of the editing. I only now understand that, quite possibly, editing did not occur in the production of this film.\n\nWriting: This movie despises its writer, hates him in fact. In truth, there is no reason to think that this movie was actually written. I babysat an autistic child once. Even HE couldn't have written this tripe.\n\nActing: I understand that some people don't really get what it means to be in front of a camera. This is not the problem here. Although they have human faces and voices (all dubbed, of course), these \"actors\" are unable to even imagine themselves as being in a film. The uniqueness of their ineptitude is overwhelming at times.\n\nThis is a horror flick. The actual film isn't the horror; the horror isn't even filmed in fact. The true horror is this movie's sweeping destruction of the elements of film -- direction, editing, writing, acting, etc. Even the title, which translates to \"Hands: The Hands of Fate,\" would baffle the Sphinx. I know that Duran Duran named themselves twice, but this title is something else entirely. It is a sucker punch to everything linguistic and meaningful.\n\nWhy this movie took 2 and a half months to film is beyond me. This movie is 74 minutes long. There is no reason to believe that this movie took more than 74 minutes to film. After all, without a director, editor, writer, or actors, it's truly difficult for me to say that this is a film. There are those who want to find genius in such a deconstructive expression. Make no mistake, this movie is not smart, is not clever. The deepest meaning one can glean from manure is to never again step in it. If you value anything even remotely artful, you will keep yourself oblivious to this \"movie.\" This movie will scar you and shape the rest of your life, I guarantee it."

That was without question the movie I have ever seen. The plot was horrendously constructed. Without the possible exception of the family, the writer poorly conceived his characters. I think many people gave it a 10 for its vintage quality. For some including myself, bad movies (particularly during the sixties and seventies)have more aesthetic quality than many good movies. Make no bones about it, however, anything more than a 1 is too much and is quite deceiving. Having said that, Please watch it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've long been fond of horror delving into America's weird interior. The spectacle of city-folk burrowing unknowing into uncharted realms where all their order, their civility means nought, where even sanity has made little purchase, these journeys fascinate me. So it is the case with Manos, a notorious film and one of the stranger examples of its genre. It tells of a happy family, Michael, Margaret and daughter Debbie on their way to a countryside lodge, one which may not even exist. They lose their way and end up at a mysterious domicile run by the anxious, strange walking, staff bearing Torgo, and as their tale unfolds they come to know the nature of the place and regret ever stopping there. Manos wields a strange power, and I think it comes from the way in which the fearful foundations of the plotting find their oddity echoed in the construction of the piece. The film dwells on primal fears of the unknown, of dislocation from ones usual milieu and ultimately of the break from ones one control. Whilst other films might array a number of editing tricks and a spot of meaningful dialogue to convey such fearful atmosphere Manos relies on guileless amateurism and succeeds precisely because of its lack of control. The audience knows anything can happen, that the film lacks reason and control, so the perfect conditions are established for the films effect. Which is not to say that there aren't some legitimate qualities at work here. The score mixes simple but menacing riffs with good looser moments, piano that sometimes ripples and sometimes spikes and some tensely thudding percussion, it has quite a potent presence. There are interesting images too, Torgo approaching with his staff penetrating the frame from bottom left, Torgo holding his master at bay, his staff playing back and forth in front of the Master's face, wives bound to pillars like living statues and so on. Best of all comes when the wives arise, their depiction has a playful art to it, they are something like an insane Greek chorus. Performances are decent too, Hal Warren has a perfect stolid and dull presence as Michael, Diane Mahree appropriately perturbed as Margaret, while Tom Neyman is wondrously campy yet menacing as The Master. Best of all though is John Reynolds as Torgo, his pained and fretful weirdness exerts a powerfully strange hold. Production design is simple yet weird, and the dark cinematography works well in creating a bleak, unsettled atmosphere. I guess this one has put a lot of people off since it currently holds the no. 2 spot in IMDb's bottom 100 but to me it was a real treat. It might best be called anti-art since it was made by a fertiliser salesman for a bet, but whatever its genesis I think its something of an off the wall gem with only a few moments of blatant ineptitude (like a visible clapper-board) to spoil the fun. Not for everyone, but a happy 8/10 from me."

The shocking orgiastic violence and the horrifying screen presence of Torgo, the master's minion, have yet to be topped by today's unassuming and bland filmmakers.\n\nI have watched Manos several times and each time I see another facet of sparkling genius in this diamond of a movie. I cannot recommend it enough. To anyone with a modicum of self respect, by all means watch Manos and prepare for the ride of your life.\n\nYou might wonder why I only gave it one star.

Many of IMDb's wonderfully entertaining Manos writers say, \"Even Joel and the Bots couldn't save this\". We respect their opinion on that, but in the special case of Manos, it doesn't really matter. If you have a taste for BAD movies, if you like to sample IMDb's bottom 100 list, if you enjoy watching MST3K and other hosted bad-film shows, then you MUST see this episode.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have actually watched this entire film, without the Mystery Science Theater riffing to ease the pain. If you can help it, don't do what I did. It was very, very difficult to sit through, and it used up pretty much all the resolve I had. I'm not an expert, and I have not seen every movie there is to see, so I can't definitively tell you that this is the worst movie of all time, but it is, without question, the worst movie I've ever seen.\n\nThere is something to be said for movies that are \"so bad they're good\". But this film goes beyond the realm of \"so bad it's good\" straight into confusion, dullness, and straight-up unpleasantness. It's so bad, it's just painful. I know probably every other person who's written a review of this has said this almost word for word, but it's so true, it's impossible not to say it.\n\n\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", often considered the worst movie of all time, is a magnum opus by comparison. Yes, \"Plan 9\" is nonsensical, unintentionally funny, and not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but at least it counts as a film. It is a heartfelt, genuine attempt at filmmaking, and it was evident that Ed Wood really believed in it and gave it his effort. I would even go so far as to say it's entertaining. Much of it is, anyway.\n\nI really don't know that \"Manos\" qualifies as a film. There is something passing for a story in it, but it is so poorly told, acted, and directed that I really don't know that it counts. And even if you could follow the plot, you wouldn't really want to. It's certainly not entertainment. What story there is is buried in the complete lack of pacing. The long driving sequence at the beginning is painfully boring to sit through, and it never really gets more interesting than that. May as well just go for a drive yourself. You'll have a lot more fun.\n\nIt was made on a budget of about $19,000. And it shows. Even if you know nothing about how movies are made, you can't help but see how unfinished and unedited \"Manos\" is. The clapboard is blatantly left in one of the shots. There's a young teen couple who make out in their car, and they appear a few times, yet are completely unnecessary to the plot. There's no reason for them to be there. The jazz soundtrack, while I don't entirely hate it, is completely unfitting and just adds further to the unpleasantness. Just awful.\n\nThe one thing about the movie that held my interest at all was the character of Torgo. Even though he really has no back story (there's no such thing as back story in a movie this awful), he does have a bizarre presence that is somewhat compelling to watch, and he even has his own musical theme, as MST3K pointed out.\n\nDon't get me wrong, he's not a pleasant character. His dialogue is just as stilted and awkward as anything else in the movie. But honestly, with what he obviously had to work with, he really wasn't that bad, I guess. Maybe it's just that the rest of the film was so incompetent that he looks really good by comparison, but he was the best thing about \"Manos\" by far. At least he left an impression. John Reynolds, the actor who played Torgo, shot himself a month before the film premiered. Apparently his suicide was not related to the film, but I can't help but feel sorry for the guy. This was his only film role, the only legacy he got to leave behind. This is totally hypothetical, and maybe not even true, but he just might have gone on to something decent, if he'd survived. Even if he only did b-movies, anything would have been better than this.\n\nThe only reason I might recommend watching this movie is if you want to know just how bad a movie could be. Before I saw this, I really had no idea movies could be this bad. But if you absolutely must see this film, please, do yourself a favor and watch Mystery Science Theater's riff of it. Even they have a hard time making it funny, but it helps a little, because this film is just...well, I've said it all. I've also heard the guys from MST3K (who now do RiffTrax) are doing a completely different riff of this movie that might be worth checking out. But please, don't watch it without their comedic assistance."

Soon the malignant master (Tom Neyman), with his evil hell-hound, manifests, intending to add the terrified family to his cult of murderous followers (or something to that effect). The femto-budgeted, near-amateur production dominates the top of the bottom of the charts of 'bad movies' as it massages incompetent direction, inept filming and editing, an incoherent plot, insipid acting, soporific pacing, and cretinous script into a preposterous film known only for its awfulness. Lacking the goofy charm of typical 'bad movies', 'Manos' is watchable only as a curiosity or a 'how-not-to' instructional video for aspiring film-makers and, like most of its bottom-of-the-barrel ilk, a lot has been written about the film's provenance, myriad continuity errors, and production flaws. The movie's only redeeming factors are The Master's striking red and black hand-themed cape, shambling minion Torgo's intriguing walking stick, and the ultimate dark fate of the innocent family (in other circumstances, the final scene could have been genuinely creepy)."

        "review_detailed_main": "For many people Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst cinematic atrocity to ever have been unleashed upon the world. For the average film-goer this is entirely understandable. Manos uniquely fails badly in almost all cinematic criteria. It's badly paced, terribly photographed, edited abysmally, acted appallingly, it has extremely limited sets, bizarrely inappropriate music and it doesn't make an awful lot of sense. It's basically a textbook example of a bad movie. And yet, it has a certain something. Despite, or perhaps because of, all the faults listed Manos remains a very strange film. Its very oddness is what makes it fascinating to watch in my opinion. The Master, and especially Torgo, are interesting characters. The latter is played by John Reynolds in a very strange performance where he constantly jitters in a most unusual way. Torgo is supposedly a satyr, except that you would be forgiven for not realizing this seeing as his goat legs are never actually shown. Only in a film as strange as Manos would this happen. Also only in a film like Manos would all actors be dubbed by only three people \u2013 two men and a woman \u2013 and this leads to some very inappropriate voices, such as the one given to the little girl. It only adds to the overall whole.\n\nManos isn't even close to the worst film I have ever seen. Sit through the likes of The Boys in Blue, Psyched by the 4D Witch or Car 54, Where Are You? and tell me honestly do you think Manos rots the brain like those? It may be technically and artistically awful but it works as a sort of half-remembered fever dream. Terrible but quite compellingly so. Probably a film that every film fan should see, just so they can make up their own mind."

Wild cuts, horrible voice overs, bad acting, and a 6 minute intro that's nothing but someone driving with background music are just a few of the wonderful moments you have to look forward to. Bottom line if you don't want to watch a bad movie , then stay away from this film. If however, you're morbidly curious enough to seek to answer the question \"Just how bad can a movie be\" then give it a try."

First of all, this film has no budget, shot as it was on a cheap film camera WITH NO SOUND! The editing was choppy, and there were some pretty funny snafus along the way (notice the constantly fluttering moths, which even MST 3000 did not make fun of). Best of all were the excellent villains: The Master and his manservant, Torgo (a really cool monster name, by the way!). I loved The Master's strange gesticulations and his long, droopy \"fingered\" cape. Torgo is the man! How can you not laugh at his clumsy groping and hilarious lechery, not to mention his gigantic, goofy prosthetic thighs? Let us not also forget the long, gratuitous \"girl fight\" scene between The Master's wives, all in their see-through nightgowns. This film has \"camp\" written all over it. Watch it! You'll find it funny with or without the MST 3000 commentary."

They wind up at a spooky lodge. There they meet Torgo, the guy who takes care of the place while the Master is away. Eventually the Master shows up. He has a fetching cape with the \"Hands of Fate\" (registered Trademark of \"MANOS\"...) logo printed on it. He worships \"Manos\", an evil deity of primal darkness, who dwells in the depth of the universe and the black chasms of night and is essentially very very bad. So after a lot of talking an less of doing, the movie ends...?\n\n\"Manos\" the Hand of Fate is a horror movie through and through. The plot, the acting, the MUSIC...HORROR. It is quite remarkable though how the crew (yes, they had a crew) managed to put in so much sexuality in a movie of the 60s...hmm.\n\nI have seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but none of them came even close to the HORROR that is \"Manos\" th Hands of Fate. Was it fate or just the hands of a very untalented director that lead to the making (and release) of this movie? Perhaps we shall never now...\n\nIn conclusion (did I mention how horrifying this movie is?) this IS the absolute WORST movie ever!!! I can only imagine they spent the entire budget on renting the cabin,so there was no money left for acting lessons, or directing lessons for that matter...\n\nIf you are one of those people who gets a kick out of sharpening pencils, suffer from schizophrenia, personality disorder or have had HALF OF YOUR BRAIN REMOVED, I highly recommend you watch \"Manos\" the Hands of Fate. If not, watch the MST3K version...it's a blast."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently watched the MST3K version of this movie, and believe it or not, it made me want to watch the original. Joel and his robots were very entertaining, of course, but I got the feeling while watching it that if they weren't there bashing it to pieces, it wouldn't be nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. And since there's probably about five people in the world who have actually seen the original film, I doubt anyone can really argue with that.\n\nFirst of all, bad editing aside, the movie has an eerie, surreal atmosphere that makes it seem more like a long dream sequence than an actual movie. It's as if we're watching someone's nightmare played out on a movie screen. Whether Hal Warren intended it to be like that or not, I think it works.\n\nI also think the concept is pretty good. A family gets lost and has to stay at an insane cult leader's house, who wants to brainwash the woman and take her for one of his many wives. The ending is one of the creepiest endings to a horror movie ever (there is even a sick little hint of pedophilia). I honestly believe that with a MUCH bigger budget and better actors, this could be remade into a really good movie.\n\nNow, with that said, I must admit that \"Manos\" has one extremely funny element that is the downfall of the entire movie, and that is Torgo. What Hal Warren lacks in film-making talent he makes up for in imagination, because he has dreamed up one of the funniest characters to ever appear on film. Torgo is a stuttering, wobbling, neurotic troll of a man with an out of control sex drive. His expression when he looks in the window and watches the woman undress is classic. It also doesn't help that the way he talks is uncannily similar to Milton from \"Office Space.\" I suppose Torgo could have been scary if he was a little more aggressive, but he is such a complete loser, it is just too funny. His tragic end of being slapped to death by a bunch of women is a classic movie scene. I think if Warren had written this as a comedy, it could have won an Oscar.\n\nSo all in all we have a movie that tries really, really hard, but is ruined by terrible editing and the funniest villain in history. If this had been made right, it could have been excellent, but unfortunately it has become known as the official worst movie ever. Personally, I am giving it 3 stars out of 10 for pure effort.\n\nIf you watch it, watch it for Torgo."

Filmed on a less-than-shoestring budget in my hometown of El Paso, Texas, I've had more than one run-in with this picture and I even finally acquired it on DVD. Over the years, this has been a piece that I go back to as a foundation for low-budget film anomalies.\n\nShot in what looks like my grandfather's super 8 camera, Manos is the story of a family of three lost in a desert maze in search of a vacationing area. They end up shacking down for the night with a strange cult that worships hands or \"manos\". Memorable characters include Torgo, a spastic underling of \"the Master\"(the ashen, mustached leader of the cult), Michael,the father/husband of the family who may well be the worst actor in history aside from being the director of the film. Some highlights include a dead dog, a fight amongst chicks in togas, a crazy 1960's bebop jazz soundtrack, and a strange but smart ending.\n\nMost people who regard this movie at all have only experienced it on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. However, I find that it is also very fun to watch on it's own. Fans of extremely cheesy cinema (ala' Ed Wood) should not miss out on this cult curiosity."

        "review_detailed_main": "After reading all the negative hoopla surrounding the \"worst film ever\", I decided to rent \"Manos: Hands of Fate\" to see if it was really as bad as everyone says it is.\n\nAnd they were right. This film is absolutely atrocious. Bad films usually have a habit of having one aspect of film-making that's done horribly while all the other aspects are sub-par. Manos did everything horribly and made sure they drove the point across.\n\nBut if any one aspect was more horrendous than the others in Manos, it would definitely be the cinematography/editing (if you could even call it that after \"Manos's\" creators butchered it). Hack-job isn't the word to describe it. \"Rape and torture\"-job is the word for the filming and editing. There are moments in the film where the camera would be firmly planted at some obscure place (such as the back of someone's head or not even at the actors speaking) or switch abruptly to some badly-framed object. Editing was equally horrendous, as transitions would either be completely black screens or annoying white flashes, and actors/objects/animals in the last frame would change position or pop in at the next frame.\n\nScenes in \"Manos\" have an odd habit of having no relevance whatsoever. One re-occurring scene in particular (a viscous five-minute lip-locking session involving 2 twenty-somethings and a bottle of cough syrup...err I mean whiskey) served no purpose whatsoever except to add more characters to a story which already had too many characters with 4 mains. Add to this ten minutes of driving through non-descriptive fields with soft jazz (bad jazz at that) in background, another five minutes of women in translucent nightgowns wrestling, three minutes of one of the women groping and nuzzling the Husband, 2 minutes of Torgo (the huge-kneed, mysteriously twitching servant to the \"Master\") nuzzling a sleeping women, and some more scenes where the characters stand in absolute silence waiting for the next cue, and you've got a movie with at least 50 minutes of filler.\n\nWriting is well... nonexistent. The writer seemed to take clich\u00e9 lines, then copy and past them on every other line. Seriously, a good 60% of the film's dialogue is one corny phrase repeated after another.\n\nAnd there is no plot. To say that the plot is clich\u00e9 is incorrect; the plot cannot be clich\u00e9 because the plot does not exist. In place of even a poorly scripted plot, there is a assortment of random events, each more logically absurd than the next. Plot-lines also have a tendency to pop-out of nowhere and leave just as quickly (which is surprising, given that a five year old could comprehend the basic premise of such a simple story). The characters that make up this jumble are less than cardboard cut-outs (To be cardboard cut-outs is a phrase that suggests that characters are clich\u00e9 and fit into a nice niche completely lacking originality or complexity); No characters exist. People are merely there quoting atrocious writing (acting isn't even the proper word; more than once I caught the wife attempting with every fiber of her being not to look directly into the camera). The only exception to this is the misshapen, Parkinson's Disease-afflicted Torgo, which comfortably plops into the monstrous-servant roll (I mean, come on, they might have well given him a humpback and put him in a castle with a mad scientist).\n\nThe sound in \"Manos\" is terrible at best. The background music sounds like the creators took the tracks they play at supermarkets and mixed it with every other horrid B-Movie of the 1950s-60s. Sound effects and dialogue had to dubbed in later as the camera the creators filmed with could not record sound, and as a result almost every piece of noise or sound in the film is about a second and a half late.\n\nSo, in short, if you decide to take the plunge, at least do it with the MST3K crew by your side and laughing all the way (even then you might not make it to the end of \"Manos\", I didn't).\n\nTechnically, in everyway, this is the Worst Movie Ever. Are there or have there been worse? Probably. Have any of them made it to distribution in theaters? Probably not. And yet, there have been movies I've seen that I've disliked much more than this. Don't see \"Manos\" looking for... well anything. You won't find it. Just expect to laugh until your gut hurts or your mind melts from the sheer crappiness."

This leads to the resurrection of a satan like character named the master and his hounds of hell.

Warren of Texas.As the result of a bet, the movies budget was only $19,000.Anyway,this movie begins with an absurdly long driving sequence with an annoying soundtrack.Then, they end up lost and found a hotel owned by Torgo, a man who is oppositely\"taking care of the place while the master was away\".Then the family wants to leave the hotel but cant because its dark and the car wont start.When Debbie(the daughter)is found after she was lost, she shows her parents the \"tomb\" where the master and the wives are sleeping.When they learn the hotel is owned by a pagan cult,the family tries to escape.But then they are captured by the master.At the end, the family end up as members of the cult.It is just a movie that makes you kill yourself over,literally.. After its release in 1966, it became almost unheard of because of its obscurity for 23 years.That is until the fateful day of January 30,1993 when it premiered on the show Mystery Science Theater 3000. After that day,\"Manos\" became more popular than ever before. In 2004, the documentary \"Hotel Torgo\" was released.It was then considered the Worst movie ever according to the June 10,2005 issue of Entertainment Weekly.It also was shown in an article of the El Paso Times.And as of August 16,2005 it was # 1 on the 100 bottom list on IMDb.\"Manos\" the MST3K version is available where videos and DVDs are shown.I recommend that.But I'm not going to tell where the uncut version is because some of you freaks up there will get it and end up on the news because you killed yourself because of the movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Einstein once said, \"only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And I'm not so sure about the universe.\" \"Manos\" is the celluloid evidence that proves Einstein correct. This film is human stupidity taken to infinity. In a century of film making, there have been some wretched pieces of work, but Manos is the undisputed heavy weight champion of ineptitude. When we discuss the merits (or lack thereof) of a film, elements such as script, screen play, directing, casting, acting, cinematography, composition, continuity, visual effects, sound, lighting, set design, editing, post-production and numerous other aspects must be considered. As several other reviewers have stated, Manos is a total train wreck in every conceivable category. It was filmed with a single hand-held, spring-wound 16mm camera that could only shoot for 32 seconds at a time. And in order to save film (and money) H. Warren (Director) did almost no retakes. So, as you can imagine, the camera movement is closer in technical proficiency to a backyard birthday party video than a professional feature film. The film was also shot with no audio. All of the dialogue and other sounds were dubbed after shooting, with predictably dire results. From a purely technical perspective, this film would be 70 minutes of blinding pain, were it not for the fact that, much like the visual quality, the sound transcends the realm of bad to the point of being comical. What about the acting? Hold on a minute. I'm still searching for a word that might begin to describe the shear debacle of the performances. I can't seem to find just one word, so I'll give you two. John Reynolds. His portrayal of the character Torgo has gone beyond legendary and reached mythical status among the movie-going public. And for good reason. Please read some of the other Manos reviews for the particulars about Torgo, there are just too many to go into, and I really wouldn't even know where to start (although the ridiculous \"goat legs\" would probably be the logical starting point). One would think that given the numerous technical and artistic elements involved in a feature film, something, just one thing could be done at a mediocre level, even under the direction of a snow-white amateur like Harold Warren. And therein lays the reason for our fascination with Manos. That is to say bar none, absolutely every possible mistake imaginable was made in this movie. Viewing Manos is much like gawking at a horrible traffic accident, you just can't seem to look away even though you know you should."

(\"the camera could only take 30 seconds of film at a time\", what kind of camera ever did that?) It had $1.98 written all over it!\n\nI read that 4 cast members committed suicide after this picture was released.

        "review_detailed_main": "There are many ways in which you can approach the question of the worst movie ever made. There are conceptually bad films that should never have made it out of the meeting room (Emoji Movie, Jack and Jill). Those with ridiculously bad effects and painful visuals (Birdemic, Foodfight). Obvious ripoffs seemingly made for tax avoidance schemes (Little Panda Fighter, Ratatoing). Films that have manipulative and destructive messages, those with legal controversies around its production... the list goes on.\n\nEach of the films above and more are as deserving of the crown as Manos in their own rights. However, if one has to make the decision on one definitive \"worst movie of all time\", I will confidently name Manos: The Hands of Fate.\n\nThe fact that Manos is none of those things is what makes the difference. It's not a conceptually bad film as the premise itself is just a standard horror film. While the production design is awful, it's not at the point of being as actively painful as the films listed above. Manos is not a ripoff of anything, doesn't promote a particularly bad message or have a major controversy around its production (though there were definitely issues with it).\n\nManos is not bad due to any reason aside from the fact that it is simply bad. Bad in every single way. It undermines all of conventional filmmaking by ignoring plot, structure, continuity, development, plausibility, verisimilitude and countless other similarly insignificant details. Even Jack and Jill and the Room has very rudimentary levels of such basic film fundamentals. Only the Neil Breen films could compete with their incoherence and incompetence.\n\nOf course, one could always name a worse film if one delves into the most obscure, low budget productions. The Neil Breen films mentioned above are definitely on a comparable level after all. But notoriety is a significant contributor of being the worst film, for if nobody had seen and suffered through it, does it really matter at all? All in all, Manos: The Hands of Fate has a perfect balance of painful incompetence and cult reputation, earning it the crown of the worst film ever made."

We were trying to figure out why his legs were twice the size they should have been, and only thru IMDb were we able to discover that he was supposed to be a half goat/half man. I don't know what the point of the story was, nor do I care. The person who made the movie was a fertilizer salesman, which is fitting, cause it's a pile of manure."

        "review_detailed_main": "Manos: The Hands of Fate is widely known as one of the worst movies of all time. As of writing this review, it holds the number three spot on IMDb's Bottom 100 list. Which is legendarily bad.\n\nAnd yet I'm unable to give it a lower score than I did. Because this film brings me joy. I think that from now on, whenever someone talks about \"so bad it's good\" movies, this will be my personal go-to film.\n\nBecause this film is bad. The camera work and editing are amateurish, either holding the shots too long, lingering where not needed or just jumping around too much. The acting is hokey and banal for the most part, with some glorious exceptions, but we'll get to those in a moment. The plot is derivative of all the known cultist slash vampire movies there is, but tied to the cheapest location they could get, while at the same time not even working in either of those genres.\n\nBut it's also so good. The lines of dialogue are pure Gorgonzola and the best of them are delivered by two of the best characters. First of them is the Master (Tom Neyman), who seems utterly incapable of deciding whether he stars in a less than subtle satire parody or Shakespearean drama. Either way his delivery of his typical cult leader lines of dialogue is completely over the top.\n\nAnd then there's Torgo (John Reynolds), the Master's dimwitted henchman. Torgo is hands down the best thing about this film. I have no idea what kind of directions he was given in regards to his character, but whatever they were, Reynolds took them and cranked the dial to twelve. I suppose he's trying for spooky mentally ill hillbilly. But he does it so over the top and so jarringly that it goes the full circle around and lands in adorable.\n\nLook, it's a bad film. Definitely a film that would be so much worse if watched alone and sober. But, in the right frame of mind, with the right friends, it can be one of the most memorable movie watching experiences you'll ever have. Try it out."

The narrative is jarring and odd, the actors are amateurish at best and the dubbed voice work is just hilariously awful.\n\nTo top things of, Manos is lazed with a bizarre fusion jazz sound track, which knock the movie in an entirely different ball park among bad movies.\n\nFor people, who like bad movies Manos is a must watch event. Everything that can be done wrong in a movie has been made wrong in it. And even then some."

That's why I watched even I know this is a bad film.\n\nAfter I watched this film, I was like yeah, it's totally the worst film of all time like they said. The performances of the actors and actresses are very bad, the directing is really bad, the editing, the original score, the script and all, everything in this film is terribly bad. No wonder this film has become the worst film of all time. How could the director make this kind of terribly bad film? I have no idea.\n\nAnyway, this film is terrible, so, if only you want to taste what the worst film of all time is, you should watch it. Otherwise, I recommend you to skip it.\n\nP.S: I forgot to mention one more thing. The genre says \"horror\". Because of it, I was feeling afraid to watch before. I always consider the genre horror is those kind of films that make audience(s) feel afraid. But when I watched it, I found that it's not a scary film. I even feel like the genre horror doesn't have anything to do with this film. The film is just a normal thing and doesn't have anything scary. So, why they put this film into horror category?"

Here are my reasons why: 1. The soundtrack. It is the worst. Sounds like elevator music but 100 times worse.\n\n2. The dialogue. They take forever to say their lines you wonder if they forget their lines and someone is trying to whisper them their lines because they totally forgot what they said, so it takes them like 6 seconds to remember their lines. Also their voices are annoying and just old.\n\n3. Plot is just stupid and boring Even though I know this is from the 60's I cant help but hate this movie. Avoid at all costs. It is not one of those so awful its good like sharknado. It is so bad it is torturing to the soul and body. If MrBeast did another solitary confinement and they made him watch this, he would quit in 30 minutes."

I warn you, if you've little patience for really really really bad movies, you may want to skip this, or at the least watch the MST3K version.

This is one of those movies.\n\nThe basic premise, a family in a remote town happening upon a house which is run by a maniac, is fodder for heaps of horror movies through the ages. In the hands of a better writer, better director, better producer, better editors and better actors, this might have been a 5-7/10.\n\nHowever, the actors not knowing that the camera was on them at the start of a shot, the poorly written dialogue, the extremely sloppy editing make this move unwatchable. The acting is terrible, overly hammy.\n\nAvoid watching this movie, it will be 90 minutes of your life that won't be wasted."

Disaster movie - that movie will hurt you physically, this one will give you some cheap laughs and for the most part just bore you to sleep - it's not bad, when you compare, I've even found first ~ 20 minutes of Manos somewhat entertaining and well built, if they had scary villain and maybe some monster to back it up I would've actually enjoyed it. I would say - give it a try, or - give Targos a try, that guy really nails the role and for someone like me, who's into bad movies, that's enough to find some fun in this underrated flick."

This awful movie has generated such a dazzling amount of weird anecdotes and goofs, and in that way it's actually far more entertaining than the average film. One of my personal favorite bits is the one where the cop gets out of his car to investigate, takes two steps, and then just walks back because producer/director/writer/lead Hal Warren couldn't afford more than one light. And who doesn't love the highly threatening daytime stock footage snake in a nighttime scene, or the little girl that has her lines dubbed over by an adult with a hilariously forced high-pitched voice? Or the moths, who steal most of the scenes because they can't stay away from the lighting? Or the part where Warren clearly mouths \"CUT\" to the cameraman? Or the endless night gown wrestling matches? And Torgo of course. It's a huge accomplishment to stand out as bizarre in this movie, but Torgo manages with no effort whatsoever. What a hero. This movie has its dull bits (the driving scenes are almost in real time), but it makes up for that with its ridiculously awesome bits. It's an enriching experience you'll never forget, and it even comes with a twist that's genuinely pretty clever. Recommended, and with good reason."

To start off, bad cinematography, no plot, bad acting and (obviously) a low budget.\n\nA family is going on vacation to the Valley Lodge, but gets lost on the way. When they stop to ask for directions, they encounter Torgo (the caretaker) a half goat/half man, but with the bad prosthetics, it just looks like he has footballs shoved in his pants so you can't tell that he is actually a satyr. Although Torgo is reluctant, he lets the family stay for the night, knowing that his 'Master' will get mad for letting a man and young girl stay at the house (all he wants is a new wife).\n\nThe voices of the characters were dubbed (mostly) by Hal Warren and Diane Mahree, but it isn't exactly in sync. The soundtrack (if that is what you want to call it) is very bad jazz and doesn't seem to flow with the film. The first scene when the family gets lost, seems to take forever because they forgot to put the credits in the beginning, so there is no talking, just driving.\n\nThis movie is for a tough audience and is also physically draining, so if you watch it, make sure to get the MST3k version and/or lots of caffeine."

Well, I may stick out like a sore thumb, but I liked this movie. Not enough to watch it over and over and over again, but I think that the fact that its low budget helped it be a little creepy. It has a documentary-like quality that makes it look eerily like a snuff film. The bizarre music, the bad lighting, the average acting, Torgo's sickening costume, and the strange dubbing help make it one of the more intriguing low-budget films of the 60s. That's right, I liked this movie, it didn't bore me very much, and I would watch it again. You can watch the MST3K version of \"Manos\", but you'll lose a great deal of the movie and its atmosphere. Give it a try without MST3K (who also ruined \"The Brain That Wouldn't Die\", \"Revenge of the Creature\", \"Squirm\", and several other underrated classics), you just might be surprised. Given that I have actually SEEN the original \"Manos\", I think I deserve a bit more credibility than those who have relied on MST3K's judgment, not their own."

First of all, I have seen far worse films and ones which are almost unwatchable(The Beast of Yucca Flats comes to my mind readily). I dig the music. The girls are appealing...all seven. The film is such a bad film that it made me laugh. None of these folks can act. The guy playing Torgo is so atrocious that he is mesmerizing. The gimpy leg, the curled lips, the \"master will not approve,\" and his quest to get him his own woman. Funny stuff. How about the family? Daddy, Margaret, and Debbie. MIchael(played by director/producer/writer Harold P. Warren looks like he just left a rotary meeting. He has no conviction in his lines, lines like, \"Get back in the house dammit!\" The dialog is abominable. The camera-work is horrific. I could go on and on. It is easy prey, so again I like the title, Torgo, the girls, and the groovy soundtrack. The film is garbage but has a following after all these years. We remember the best and the worst. Mediocrity is oblivious in nature."

When it's not it's just wasting time badly developing characters that are weird, stupid, naive, ignorant, useless, creepy, and boring. I'm not even sure I get it. This is my first review without spoilers because this completely fails in telling a story correctly. It also makes no sense; it never explains anything! And there are also shots that go on for way longer than they need to. It would have been more enjoyable if the movie was just a bunch of random pictures thrown together. But instead it's just boring nonsense. I felt like the film was so dumb that I got dumber watching this. Avoid this film at all costs!"

It's \"Casablanca\" and \"Wizard of Oz\" rolled into one next to \"Manos\".

It's on the top of IMDB's Bottom 100, many name it as ''the worst movie of all time'', and it was even riffed on MST3K by Joel and the Bots. And yes, it's horrible as everyone said. And not in the sense ''so bad it's so funny''. NO!!! This movie is so poorly made that is a chore to watch it until the end.\n\nThe plot, if anyone cares, is about a family that gets lost in the desert and end in a home that at night becomes a underground devil-worshiping cult, led by the Master and the caretaker Torgo. And horrid things start; Torgo likes the woman of the family, the Master's wives start bickering, and Torgo gets killed just by burnign his hand (!!!)\n\n''Manos The Hands of Fate'' is a movie that caused me pain watching it. The other time I felt ill watching a movie and it was fault of the movie was when I watched the FRED movies with Lucas Cruickshank. And everything in the movie is very hideous: the filming is sloppy and some scenes seemed lasting an eternity! The music... ughh. It was very creepy, monotonous, badly made and disturbing. And the acting is the worst I ever saw in a B-movie, I mean, worst than the other movies featured on MST3K. Hey, they look like Oscar-worthy movies compared to this! And the script was written in a room full of mandrills.\n\nSo, inept and horrid in every way you look at it. I recommend this movie to NOBODY. Neither humans, dogs, pigeons, baboons or parrots - NOBODY! Even them would find the movie very painful to watch."

But some movie masochists out there may find this entertaining. Hell, at least it's more creative than Bloodrayne."

It's obvious that some of the reviewers are picking on certain movies because the plot was ludicrous, or the direction was incompetent, or they hate the stars.\n\nMTHOF, on the other hand, is the clear winner (loser?) by virtue of being awful in every possible category. This isn't a movie that failed to live up to its potential, or cast the wrong actors. No, this is a movie that shows what happens when absolutely no talent is available at any level.\n\nIt is a chore to force yourself to watch this movie, but I think that all those reviewers who were apparently horrified by \"Justin and Kelly\" need to take the time to see what a really bad movie is. But, do yourselves a favor and watch the MST3K version...at least you won't be as tempted to just give up partway through the movie."

I'm gonna go through all the motion picture arts, and see how \"Manos\" - The Hands of Fate adds up Acting -- Horrible. The best actor in this movie is probably Torgo, and thats not saying much. IT sounds like their yelling at you. Their unnatural, emotional depiction, looks, everything dreadful. To give you an example of how bad it is, take Tom Hanks, Johnny Depp, Russell Crowe, and Jack Nicholson, and think the COMPLETE opposite.\n\nArt Direction -- Not much to say here. They used an existing house, and the stayed in basically two rooms the whole time, so there isn't enough room to talk about how bad it was.\n\nCinematography -- Ghastly. The angles in the ten minute car ride, showing the Masters picture 5 times in 30 seconds, while the picture is at the other end of the screen, it really makes me wonder how it can be that bad.\n\nDirecting -- Hollow. Maybe the reason was because the director really was tied to a tree the whole time Editing -- I can't decide whether it was done with cut and paste, or a hammer and chisel Music (Score) -- They used the wrong music at the wrong time Music (Song) -- \"Row Row Row Your Boat.\" Very bad singing Sound Editing -- Most of the duologue was dubbed. They did a very bad job at it. Their lips would start moving and two seconds later you would hear them talk. Mixing that with the music, it was very poorly done.\n\nWriting -- Not bad. When I heard of the plot, I was attracted to it, so I bought the movie. If all of the above would of been changed, this script would of made a good movie.\n\nOverall picture quality, just bad. I guess i this is the movie to see if you have ever been sitting around at home, and your wondering what kind of film a fertilizer salesman from El Paso, Texas would make. I thought i could put up with it, but I starting clawing at my face when the movie was finished, only taking breaks to kick myself in the head.\n\nI can say with true confidence that this is the worst movie ever made"

        "review_detailed_main": "Not the worst movie ever made but almost certainly a contender for worst production value. I can complain about how bad the film is but that seems fairly pointless since about 1000 people have already beaten me to it and while many of their gripes are unreasonable Manos doesn't deserve to be dubbed the worst film ever. Manos actually had a decent horror story to it and I think would have made a very good horror film but it suffered from an exceedingly low budget and abysmal production. The movie was an editing nightmare with such bad camera cuts it left me asking the question, what were they thinking? There were many other examples of what to avoid in film-making. There were long, tedious shots where virtually nothing occurred; superfluous panning of the open Texas range or simply watching characters stand silent for extended intervals as Torgo (very interesting character) hobbled around. But before I deal out unreserved criticism of this film, I make note of the fact that the technical aspect of its production was doomed to disarray due to the camera.\n\nAccording to IMDb, Manos was \"Filmed entirely with a hand-held camera that could only record thirty-two seconds of film at a time. The film was shot without sound.\" No wonder they had such a hard time editing it. It is for this reason that the film is an editing disaster. It would be nearly impossible to produce anything remotely well with such a technical handicap. From a more conceptual perspective, Manos is an interesting idea and the film had a spooky quality to it.\n\nLike another user stated, awarding only one star to a film should be reserved for only the most inane of cinema, the kind of film that leaves the viewer angry at the sheer stupidity of the project. If you want examples, modern film-making has generously provided them. Films devoid of intelligence; movies made on large budgets, solely for monetary gain, generally just to capitalize off of some pop singer or pop culture icon (Paris Hilton for example) truly deserve the ridicule . Mano isn't a terrible concept, just an example of how technical barriers can cripple production."

I knew right from the get go this would be a bad movie from the reputation it's garnered here on IMDb. However this takes the cake. It ends up being more embarrassing, more horrendous, and more offensive than anything cooked up from the Ed Wood school of low-budget, horror movie-making. On top of every performance (even John Reynolds' Torgo, who does pull off that insane servant look, despite no voice to match) stinking to high heaven, every single bit of craftsmanship takes everything that was set up in the cinema world right out the window.\n\nThe good news for people who wish to see it out of sheer curiosity is that it's now available from the Mystery Science Theater 3000 people (as it has been for ten years, one of it's most infamous specials). Their commentary is a plus, and just when you think it can't get any worse, it gets funny by way of them. It's hard to heckle a film. This is the prime exception. All the music, the camera shots (though, giving the benefit of the doubt, it's all shot with one camera getting 30 seconds at a time with no sound attached on location), the atmosphere, the flimsier-than-ripped-flip-flops storyline, it sets a standard that few movies can go to. Maybe that's its most impressive feat, that it takes itself so seriously as a legitimate, circa mid 60's B horror film, that it's fun just to watch and experience the depths it goes to. F+"

If anything, (even though the film sucks) I applaud them.\n\nON THE OTHER HAND (no pun intended), take a movie like Battlefield Earth. There's others, but this one get's my vote for worst film ever. There's a fine difference between Manos and Battlefield Earth. Think of the concept behind this. FIRST, some nit-wit (we know who) wrote Battlefield Earth. THEN it had to be pitched to an agent. Agents takes the project on, THEN it needed to be pitched to a producer(s), THEN the producer needed to package it with big name actors and take it to the studio. THEN the studio has to green-light the damn thing. Then a bunch of Hollywood idiots invested MILLIONS with the anticipation that the film will be a success. Hal Warren and his little Manos film shouldn't even be ranked in a worst category, simply because it didn't take much of a budget and no one was destroyed (except maybe Warren's ego.)

        "review_detailed_main": "\"'Manos': The Hands Of Fate\" is bad, bad, bad. This is perhaps the ugliest film of the 1960s, and I'm counting Zapruder. The only way you can truly appreciate the badness of \"Manos\" is by seeing it, but that's like my recommending you go and get scarred for life.\n\nI guess there are those who will object I really didn't see \"Manos.\" I saw the Mystery Science Theater version with some bits cut out. But that's like saying I really didn't see \"Sideways\" because I went out at one point and got popcorn. It's hard to ignore that what's on the screen is bad, not because there's silhouettes of a guy and a couple of robots making fun of it but because of the sheer, relentless amateurishness of the film. Out-of-focus shots, long pointless silent scenes, women wrestling in togas, moths bumping into the lighting, and a stupid two-set horror play with a depressing ending. What's wrong with having someone talk over that? Would you deny morphine to a gunshot victim?\n\nThe only things I thought okay were the music, which was pretty fair dinner jazz, and the actress playing the young wife, who couldn't act but was beautiful to look at. Also, there's a bit where the Master's half-dozen wives awake from their ageless slumber and start to talking all at once. The camera cuts to the Master, and I'll give the director the benefit of the doubt and assume that look of put-upon henpeckitude on his face was intentional comedy. But there is nothing else worth discussing here.\n\nA lot of times, bad films are fun to watch because they are so supremely silly and full-of-themselves they become perversely entertaining. \"Manos\" is just harsh and ugly. Joel Hodgson, the MST3K ringleader, says at one point: \"Every frame looks like the last known photograph,\" and it's true. What's on screen are talentless people who are obviously miserable about what they are doing. Poor Torgo went and killed himself shortly after completing his role, and he may not have been the only one according to the info on this site. It's painfully to watch films like this and feel like you are a party to someone's endless torment.\n\nSo I maintain watching this with MST3K is not only preferable but necessary. As the little girl in this movie said later to interviewer Richard Brandt, \"without their commentary, it would be painful to watch.\" Well, hold up there, sweetiepie. Let's just say \"more painful.\""

The same thing can't be said for this travesty. Sure you can get together with a group of friends and riff the hell out of it, but you can't really say that you enjoyed watching it.\n\nThis movie was the brainchild of a fertilizer salesman who made the film on a bet. He used a wind up camera that could only record 32 seconds of film at a time meaning that no scene lasts longer than that. There were also no microphones meaning that everything had to be recorded in post. Add to that nobody involved in the entire process knew anything about acting or film production. The result was a hot mess of a movie that honestly doesn't make any sense.\n\nA family is driving in the desert on vacation and wind up at a compound where the father decides this is the hotel they've booked at. Why? It's the only thing around for miles so it must be the place. There, to greet them, is Torgo. He's a strange little man with huge knees who seems to have trouble walking. Torgo takes a liking to the mother. Stuff happens which is mostly forgettable and we find out the owner of the place is this weird dude with a harem of mind controlled women and he wants the mother and her young daughter to join his harem. There's some badly choreographed fights, one of the women in the harem dies from a light slap and like in the song \"Hotel California\", the family never leaves.\n\nThe only actor to get anything out of it was the young girl that played the daughter. She got a bicycle out of it. The rest were supposed to get a share of the profits. But since it was shown in only one theater and people hated it, nobody got anything. The actor playing Torgo died before the movie came out from a drug overdose. Some say that it was partially due to the leg prothetics he wore. he was supposed to be a satyr but either the devices they designed for him didn't work or he wore them wrong and they caused him extreme pain.\n\nThis really only should be watched out of sheer curiosity or masochism because there is no way to enjoy it.

Torgo to his credit told the couple to stay away from the house because his Master don't want anyone there. But Michael and Margaret just ignored him and made themselves at home and even had Torgo help them move in.\n\nTorgo looked like he was recovering from a really bad LSD trip and when you saw him walk he would sway from side to side with his legs looking like they were suffering from a very severe case of elephantiasis. The Master, who has a striking resemblance to Frank Zappa, was at the time asleep, in a zombie-like trance, in his tomb with his six wives located somewhere outside the house.\n\nTorgo was very angry at the Master for having six wives while he had none and had his eye on the nice looking Margaret for his future mate. We see Torgo later trying to grope Margaret but his actions are so weird that it really looks like he just wanted to hold on to her in order for him not to lose his balance and fall on his face ending up breaking his head.\n\nWhen the Master finally awakes he finds Torgo out cold as if he were a corpse and after bringing him back to life he berates him for letting the strangers into his home. The Master also accuses Torgo of fooling around with his wives while he, as well as they, was asleep in the tomb.\n\nLater that night the Master gets the whole crazy crew together and the wives become enraged over Torgo letting Michael and the two women, Margaret and her little daughter Debbie into the house and want to have them all killed. But the Master's first wife only wants to have Michael killed and have the women, especially little Debbie, left alive. A fight breaks out between the wives over who should live and who should die of the three strangers but the Master settles to only kill Torgo for letting them in the house in the first place.\n\nHaving Torgo tied down the Master then orders his wives to beat him to death. But it looks more like they were giving Torgo a total body massages instead of beating him and Torgo looked like he was really enjoying all of it. The Master then has Torgo's left hand blown off by touching some magic staff that he has and we then see Torgo, minus his left hand, running into the darkness never to be seen again in the movie.\n\nHaving his #1 wife tied to a poll for talking back to him the Master then proceeds to beat her to death. But the beating, like the one that Torgo got from the Master's wives,looked so harmless and phony that his wife must have died from laughing herself to death instead of the beating that the Master gave her.\n\nMeanwhile back at the house Michael and Margaret and little Debbie make a run for freedom in he dark desert but are caught by the Master and his wives before they get too far away. The movie ends with Michael replacing Torgo as the Master's care-taker and both Margaret and Debbie becoming his two new wives replacing wife #1; Or let's just say two for the price of one if thats what it all meant?\n\nWhat can be said about this movie that hasn't been said already. The two things I can add of what I noticed about \"Manos the hands of fate\" is that it was shot in color which was rare for a super low-budget, $20,000.00, film like it was back in 1966. As for the syrupy soundtrack it sounded like a music for a romantic or love story type film not the horrible horror movie that \"Manos\" was and is."

Yes, it is and maybe even worse.\n\nWhat makes \"Manos, the Hands of Fate\" a bad movie is that it was made with no talent or imagination, quite sad to watch really. I don't know what is the worst; The acting, the script, the sets, the editing. The most likely answer is that it's all just simply plain bad. Especially the editing is the worst I have ever seen. Some scene's seem to be endless while nothing is shown at it at all and most of the time they don't even have anything to do with the movie. The movie is full with this long endless shots that are really about nothing, very boring to say the least.\n\nThe story is just laughable bad, if you asked me what it is about I think I can not even explain it. It's just about nothing and lot's of it makes no sense at all. It feels like someone is poking you in the brains with a stick. The movie is full with silly moments that makes you think; What the **** is that?\n\nThe actors are by far some of the worst ever. They show absolutely no talent or what so ever.\n\nThen we come to the only good thing about the movie: Torgo. Oh boy what a character! I doubt it was intentional but this guy is absolutely hilarious with his strange ticks and movements. He alone makes this movie still watchable. He is a real classic.\n\nI also must admit that I liked the ending a lot. I even found it surprising and shocking but a good ending can't save a bad movie.\n\nCongratulations Hal Warren, you created one of the very worst movies of all time, you make an Ed Wood movie seem like a masterpiece.\n\nA must see for bad movie lovers.\n\n1/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "As I write this, there are already 143 previously existing comments for this film, and nearly every one of them mentions MST3K at some point. That's the irony of MST3K-- if not for Crow and Servo and Joel and Mike, no one would ever see or even hear of movies like Manos. It isn't lovable garbage, like the often-referenced Plan 9 from Outer Space, that you can watch with friends and laugh until your face hurts. It's painful garbage, the kind of movie where you chuckle a little towards the beginning but after a while it stops being funny. Is it the worst movie ever made, as is often claimed? I personally don't think so. It probably was the worst film that MST3K managed to obtain (and that episode, which actually makes something good out of this film, is some kind of comic masterpiece), but MST3K was by no means comprehensive. Remember, they weren't allowed to show anything with any real level of violence or sexual content, so there are lots of sneaky movies out there ruining lives because they don't have the reputation that MST3K grants. And I guess calling something \"the worst movie ever made\" is just a matter of personal sensibilities-- Manos is really boring, but there are movies that go far enough beyond the limits of bad taste to make me feel sad and angry and hopeless, like Necronomicon: Book of the Dead, Sword for Truth, Eaten Alive, Igor and the Lunatics, Knightriders, and even the illogically popular and overrated Dawn of the Dead. Manos is a complete waste of time, but there are movies out there that are bad enough, in terms of both craft and content, to make you want to kill them. And I personally don't think Manos goes that far. You can make up your own mind, though, if you're ever unfortunate enough to see it."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is no denying it: '\"Manos\" The Hands of Fate' is a terrible, terrible film. With, seemingly no plot, and some of the worst acting ever caught on film, '\"Manos\"' is an incomprehensible mess. It doesn't help that it was filmed on a silent-film camera and that the voices were dubbed in by a team of only three voice actors. Add the inept direction of Hal P. Warren, and '\"Manos\"' hits excruciating levels of awfulness. But I'll be damned if I couldn't take my eyes off it for a single second.\n\nStarring Torgo, a strange grounds keeper, '\"Manos\"' is supposed to be a horror film about a satanic cult. Hal Warren lets us know Torgo is evil by giving him a near-crippling knee deformity. OOOOHHH...SCARY. Torgo mumbles and stutters incoherently about his master, who wouldn't like having guests at their one-room motel. Mike, Maggie, and their daughter Debbie wind up said motel and then...basically nothing happens for the rest of the film. The plot moves so slowly and laboriously that it's better to just sit back and watch without thinking. At all. By doing this, I managed to make it through this awful movie and find out the \"mysterious\" ending, which I genuinely can not understand. Maybe it's better that way.\n\nThe problems with '\"Manos\"' are numerous. Warren couldn't frame a shot to save his life, the actors couldn't act if you put a gun to their head, and the sets are cheap and poorly made. The film begins with an endless driving sequence, which was supposed to be the opening credit sequence. However they forgot to add the credits, so we're left with ten minutes of nothing. The two policemen in the film spend all their time hunting down a teenage couple who like to make out on the side of the road, and when the cops do investigate Torgo's motel, they do so by walking two steps in each direction. The dubbing is off. WAY off. And I do believe this is the film that originated \"Hey! I can see the zipper on his back!\"\n\n'\"Manos\"' has gained a cult following thanks to a spectacular episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Joel, Crow, and Servo provide their trademark witty remarks throughout, and also take time to remind us that we are indeed watching '\"Manos\" The Hands of Fate'. They can't believe they have to watch this, of all films, and neither can their tormentors, Frank and Dr. Forrester (and they picked the damn thing!). It's amazing that such a terrible film could turn out what some consider the greatest episode of MST3K.\n\nSo, why did I give '\"Manos\"' a point? Because it's fascinatingly bad, and provides an important lesson in how not to make a film. This movie is so bad, that it warrants serious studying, just to find out why it wound up so bad. The documentary \"Hotel Torgo\" should provide some answers, and I hope to get the chance to see it.\n\nShould you see '\"Manos\"'? Yes, but only the MST3K version.\n\nThe Master commands you!"

But when we get to the part about a satyr with a nerve disorder and the film showing you a portrait three times over just to make sure you figure it out, when you're watching IL' Torgo go scampering off on fire and not making a sound, you realize: The director was lacking basic brain function. A camera with no sound I can handle. That's basically what happens with animated movies, after all. But a movie where they have three people total on the voice-acting cast? A movie with no music at all? A movie with novice actors AND no post-production to remove their blunders? SUCKO, man. There's this one bit of the movie that I love: the bit when the family first enters the house where the wife is looking around, focuses her attention on the camera, rolls her eyes as she realizes she's not supposed to, then hurriedly looks away. Hehehe. This movie had on the floor for weeks. It's quite possibly the worst thing to come out of the movie industry. I'm not surprised four actors did themselves in after this; it's the cinematic equivalent of Hiroshima."

And anyone who watches this vile, sickening, inept, insipid, stomach-turning, bile-inducing piece of garbage WITHOUT the aid of MST3K is either a sadist, or deserves a Purple Heart. If you do, then my only advice would be to hunker down, and pray for daylight!\n\nThe plot? Well, um a family made up of incompetent dad, mom and little kid drive off for a vacation. They drive . . . and drive. And, did I mention that they drive? Well, they do. When they're done, (after the harrowing \"getting pulled over for a busted taillight\" scene), they proceed to keep driving. After about 20 minutes, they finally happen upon a run down shack in the middle of the desert, and a chap named Torgo, who \"takes care of the place while the master is away.\"\n\nAfter about another 30 minutes of nothing, the Frank Zappa/Bill Buckner \"Master\" guy wakes up, intent on . . . doing something . . . bad to them. His shear-nightie dressed wives begin to wrestle in the dirt for his affection. Poor sap Torgo is slapped around, had his hand burnt off, and then just sort of wanders away . . . right out of the movie.\n\nWill the family escape the horrors of this place? Will the wives decide to help the family or harm them? What about Peppy? (\"You never had a dog! I want you to stop this foolishness about a dog!\") And, really, more importantly, does anyone really care? I know I didn't.\n\nIf only Hal Warren had been as plucky, and prolific as Ed D. Wood and made more than one movie in his short, brief career. Compaired to this, PLANET 9 FROM OUTER SPACE looks like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.\n\nAnd who knows what depths of wretchedness MANOS PART II: TORGO'S REVENGE might have sunk to?"

Don't get me wrong, I think that everyone should see this one, if only for the Bragging rights. \"Forget Anzio, Never mind Iwo Jima. I've sit through Manos, Hands of fate\"!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Well... not all the answers. I read in Entertainment Weekly last week all about this movie. Seems it started as a bet. Hal Warren thought directing a movie was easy. Anyone could do it. Hal Warren was given some money and the rest is history. Most of the people working on the film knew something was up. They all agreed to do it in return for shares of the profits. But in Producers fashion, the shares added up to 300%! In the end, the only casts members to be \"paid\" were the little girl (a bicycle) and the dog (50 lb bag of dog food). They knew they were in trouble, but were assured all the mistakes could be fixed in some magic editing room. Which ceased to be an option when the money started running out. There was a premiere which the casts went to.. all but Torgo, who committed suicide a few weeks earlier (not resulting from being in the movie). It was at the premiere the cast found out their voices were all dubbed! There was silence for about 15 minutes.. then some chuckles.. which evolved into out and out laughter! The producer and director didn't stay, and went to a bar. The place where it was filmed is still around and somewhat of a cult tourist attraction. The little girl remembers the guy who played Torgo as being the nicest, but others thought he was on acid the whole time!. The girl remembered the director as someone who yelled all the time and wasn't very nice. Say what you will about this movie.. it certainly has it's place in history, but people need to stop calling it \"genius\" or \"classic\". It's also wrong to compare it this to Ed Wood Jr. At least he had passion about what he was doing.. he thought he was making classics.. Manos: The Hands Of Fate was made on a bet!"

Unless you can say the acting, the directing, the scripting, the cinematography, the editing, etc., were bad its not really a bad movie. its probably just an uninteresting movie.\n\nManos: The hands of Fate is a bad movie for all the reasons listed above and more. I don't know why, but when a movie is very terrible, i tend to enjoy watching. maybe its because i'm a filmmaker and like seeing others fail. i don't think its that though, i think its more that I understand the process going on to make this junk and its delightful in a funny way.\n\nKeep in mind, Manos is Hal Warren's first and only film. Losts of people overlook that fact and its taken for granted how hard movie making truly is. Even Warren took it for granted by making the bet to make this(He lost the bet obviously. The guy he lost to went on to win an Oscar(Screen writing) for In the Heat of The Night for those of you who like Manos trivia). Most directors today who come out with a great big first feature have actually been directing for decades in music videos, television, and commercials. You hardly ever will meet someone who just all of sudden picked up a camera and begin making gold.\n\nOrson Welles had much knowledge of what makes a great story and had a flare for the dramatic. He was also a very talented magician. all which aided him(along with others like Toland) to make him great. Hal Warren sold fertilizer, he shouldn't have been able to make a good movie even in the 1960's.\n\nThis is one of the strengths of the film i feel. Its a raw look at someones first attempt in to the art of cinema. I would really have loved to see Warren make a few more films. Every film is a learning process, he might have learned from his mistakes how to shoot a good action scene, how to write good dialogue, and how to treat a crew and actors to maximize the film.\n\nAll in all, it's a dreadful film and most everyone hates it. I love it cause like an Ed Wood movie, it's a sincere attempt at something, and its an absolute car wreck.\n\nNote: The rating of one is to reflect the value any normal viewer will feel. for film fans or film junkies(if you like bad movies) this is certainly a ten."

But, since the movie is from the 60s, I guess the topic was new/trendy?\n\nMusic: The probaby worst thing about this movie. At first I liked it, but it soon gets boring since its repeated during the whole movie. The most \"original\" song is in the beginning, where somebody sang some \"opera\" but when one of the characters say something you barely hear anything from them, due to the \"opera\" Other than that, expect some maniac playing the piano and somebody blowing their lungs out on a saxophone.\n\nThe only \"good\" thing is the camera angles.

When Joel and the 'bots cannot wring humor from something, then you know it's a lost cause.\n\nThere are simply no words to defame this movie any more than the simple watching.

The result is so bad, the only reason it hasn't been banished to the darkest corner of hell is it's immortalization through Mystery Science Theater 3000- a blessing and a curse.

How else was I to know how bad movies would get without watching what is called the ultimate in cheesiness? Well, Manos sure didn't disappoint. Or should I say, boy, it disappointed. I've seen many an Ed Wood movie, and I can say that even Mr. Wood himself seems like a master film maker next to the diseases that this movie is. Don't get me wrong, I mean that in a good way, really I do. There is nothing better then popping in the Mystery Science Theater version of this movie and hearing them poke fun at this movie. I laughed hard, and it made me think, what if? What if this movie was burned and never found... we would have lost a treasure! Watching the movie is a test in patience. It also ruins your intelligence and makes you feel that rather then watching a movie, you are watching a bunch o' hippies that are high and/or drunk sort of flow through an imaginary script. They should show this movie at a stress test, perhaps give you a passing grade, or a degree or something that states you've accomplished a feat that only a few can do.\n\nI can't even begin to tell you what scene would be the worst! Was it the loooong drive in the beginning, where nothing happens except driving set to some jazz music? The \"teens\" making out for days? The fact that the father is an idiot and led his family to all the craziness, amid the danger? The laughable audio that was dubbed in? The cat fights? Even the title of the movie, Manos, which means \"hands\" in Spanish, effectively makes this movie title \"Hands: The Hands of Fate\".\n\nWhat I can tell you is the best part of the movie: watching the \"Master\" come out with his robe and show off the big red hands stitched into it. That amused for about 4 seconds. All downhill from there. Actually, the whole movie was a downhill that kept going into the ground and never stops, winding up in some inner core lava.\n\nOne gets the feeling that perhaps some of the actors, like maybe Tom Neyman or John Reynolds would have better served their art with a better script. One also gets the feeling that each and every person associated with this that saw the script, or met the director, or even smelled the manure on him should be drawn and quartered. It seems, though, that the cast DID indeed see how bad this movie was going to be by making fun of it, as they started calling it \"Mangos: The Cans of Fruit\".\n\nSo, should you watch this movie? Oh yes, you must! ONLY if you rent the MST3000 version (I heard that an unedited version is now available, now THAT must be eye-gouging torture). It's good to see how bad a movie can get and still laugh at it. I give the movie a rating of 1, and the MST3000 version a 9!\n\nI was interested enough to try to find out as much information about this movie as I could when I found that a documentary called Hotel Torgo (2004) exists. There, they interview one of the last surviving members of the cast (I don't think they found any others that may still be alive) and even bring him to the location of the set, an old run down house in the middle of nowhere. It's worth a watch.\n\nA review of another film within a review? It can only happen with Manos: The Hands of Fate!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is astonishing at just how ridiculously bad it is. It's the ultimate test for Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fans at how strong their tolerance level for Z movie garbage is. This uniquely inept film really is a challenge to sit through, even with the Bots hammering it with some of the best riffs of their career. Where \"Night of the Living Dead\" proved a great horror movie could be made on a shoestring budget; Manos proves exactly the opposite.\n\nThe film opens with an excruciatingly drawn out road trip of bland scenery. There's a couple in a sports car making out every time you see them, and two cops with nothing much to do except constantly annoy the couple. Neither cops nor couple have anything whatsoever to do with the plot (if there is a plot, that is). The grainy film is obviously cheap Super 8 that the director Hal Warren, the auteur behind this, bought at a dime store somewhere, all dialogue is poorly dubbed by the same three people, and the acting defies description by any adjective in the English vocabulary.\n\nYou must see Torgo. It is the Master's will. You must see Torgo. He has obtrusively huge knees, a deteriorating hat, goes through odd muscular convulsions when he's about to talk, mumbles and stutters, and always repeats phrases twice in a speech. The family's first encounter with Torgo is probably about 30 seconds worth of information, and runs about 3 hours. Rivalling Torgo are the Wives, and their Battle Royale pillow fight, so funny it's painful. Because of them, Torgo, and the laughs this movie offers, this ponderous work of art staggers into a 2 rating.\n\nThe Master would approve. Only MST3K would dare unleash this upon an unsuspecting world. The Master would approve."

I love watching cheesy old oddball B-movies, but not with a bunch of silly robots ruining the experience. I treated \"Manos\" as it should be treated -- I let it speak for itself.)\n\nThere's not much to be said that's already been said about this movie's lack of... just about everything. I saw it for the first time just now, and I'm still baffled. This is not a case of \"so bad, it's good\". It's not even a case of \"so bad, I want to spew my run screaming into the woods, using my own hand for a torch\".\n\nThis movie reaches beyond \"bad\", and comes out on the other side. It's set entirely in a parallel universe, where time and logic are twisted beyond recognition for mortals. What looks like Texas is actually the other end of a worm hole, where the fabric of space has turned itself inside-out.\n\nIt HAS TO be this way. How else could a movie be so indescribably... not \"bad\", that word is to simple and two-dimensional... mesmerising, but yet so extraordinary painful and genuinely creepy... you feel the movie slowly pressing a pole into your blackened heart, and you make sure to keep the remote control near in case you should feel a psychosis coming... but still you're always on the verge of laughing your head off... and at the end, you can almost feel your brain suppressing the whole experience, and you will never, never be sure what actually happened during these 80 minutes.\n\nTHIS MOVIE IS EVIL. If you're looking for a great turkey experience, something out of this world, that leaves you with a smile on your face and a somewhat altered way of relating to movies in general, I suggest \"Glen or Glenda\".\n\nI guess I will never look upon more ordinary B-movies the same way again. The thought isn't pleasant, but I still don't regret watching \"Manos\" for a second. It had to be done."

        "review_detailed_main": "Update: 11-5-16 - !!!HAPPY 50th BIRTHDAY MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE!!! I'm off to Arby's....\n\n*********** *********** *********** *********** *********** *********** ***********\n\nManos: The Hands of Fate, one cinema's best known and most beloved bad movies. It's by-product-on-celluloid created from the singular mind of a certain fertilizer salesman from El Paso, namely: Hal P. Warren. How old Hal thought he had the knowledge and ability to make a movie (that people would actually want to/pay to see) is anyone's guess, but he did try and I'm very,very glad he did; because Manos: The Hands of Fate is, indisputably, one of the pinnacle of achievements of crap-cinema.\n\nA man with a vision! Hal P. Warren, a man of many talents, not only sold fertilizer, but also wrote the script, served as director and \"starred\" in his own movie, in the role of \"Michael\" clad throughout the film in a hip white cardigan, combined with one of the wickedest widow peaks ever seen in a movie. Then there's his wife \"Margaret\".....does anyone hold the same opinion that she sets a new level for on-screen patheticness? Because she can't do ANYTHING without, crying and whining, falling down or repetitively yelling \"Mike! Mike!, where in the world could he be, Mike!\". I challenge anyone to find a character in a movie who's less capable then her. Then there's the couples, 5 year-old daughter \"Debbie\", who like all other characters, had her dialog dubbed in after filming, except for her they chose a middle-aged women to do her lines - with less than convincing results. It sounds like she's channeling the voice of her dead grandma some have said, it's certainly a somewhat creepy and unnatural sounding voice. And let us not to forget their little black dog \"Peppy\".\n\nDoes anyone really not yet know the plot of this movie? The plot is so pointless - so it's pointless to talk about it. Things really get interesting when Torgo shows up, \"I am Tor-go, I take care of the place, while the mas-ter is away!\". He functions as the motels caretaker, a rather short, bearded, quirky fellow with big, puffy, highly abnormal knee's and is always carrying a staff, presumably to help him maintain his balance as he slowly and awkwardly shambles to and fro. Torgo is propelled forward by \"The Haunting Torgo Theme\" an exceptionally catchy and charming little ditty, consisting of a repeating 3-note keyboard pattern, a pulsing bass drum and crystallized with tinkling xylophone. Torgo has a highly memorable introductory scene, with some funny dialog, which is often repetitive and contradictory - his opening line is a one of the all-time greats. Without a doubt Torgo is one of the oddest and quirkiest characters ever depicted in any movie. The actor who played Torgo, was the doomed 25 year-old John Reynolds Jr., who was reportedly very depressed and on drugs when filming the movie, to further make life miserable for him, the rigging that he wore under his pant-legs was unknowingly worn wrong and caused him to have chronicle knee pain. He killed himself with a gunshot to the head on October 16th 1966, about three weeks before Manos' world premiere in El Paso Texas, which occurred on November 5th 1966, a highly laughable, budget-restricted event (just like the movie itself) from what I've read. Torgo has several great scenes, watch and be rewarded.\n\nThen there's The Master.....Torgo's boss, along with his six wives, who apparently hang out in the desert and sleep during the day. I've always loved The Master's awesome robe, it's jet-black with gigantic bright red hands, with splayed fingers, one hand on each side (purportedly, Hal P. Warren kept the robe after filming and for years afterward wore it on Halloween night when greeting the trick-or-treater's - THAT ROBE should definitely be in some sort of movie museum) and it simply looks spectacular when The Master raises his arms when he prays to Manos, which happens frequently. Played by actor Tom Neuman, who pretty much has the perfect look happening for this role, especially his great villainous mustache. His lunatic rantings and raving are even more ridiculous and repetitive then Torgo's. Then there's The Master's six wives, dressed in all white, partially see-through gown's of some sort, which you THINK would look sexy, but I assure they do NOT look sexy, these six harpies's proceed to bicker at each other and get into cat-fights in the night, some of that cattiness is eventually directed at Torgo. The plot of this movie was an afterthought, but they had to give the ladies something to do. They proceed to clumsily (that word is particularly apt for Torgo) harass Mike and his family in and around the motel at night, apparently there's an undead angle to their existence, because they're solely nocturnal.\n\nPrimitively filmed, by an assortment of novices and semi-pros 50 years ago, on 16mm film, with a camera that was unable to record sound, the end result, not surprisingly is pretty wretched looking to say the least and the editing in this movie is among the very worst ever seen. Though it has, within the past several years been restored and thankfully, from a visual standpoint greatly improved. Reportedly Hal P. Warren had a real short-fuse, did a lot of yelling and was hated by his entire cast and crew. Also there's the fact that Hal was so ignorant about film-making, that his cinematographer said that he often feed him lines such as \"We'll fix it in the lab.\" which was pure BS, just to speed up production, Hal must have been hell to work with. But I must say I wish the man had made more movies, he could have been the next Ed Wood, but sadly that never happened and Manos: The Hands of Fate remains the one and only Hal P. Warren production.\n\n.....................................................but the guy sure could sell some fertilizer, couldn't he??!!"

No cameras were properly focused during the production of this film. b) Most, if not all of the footage is poorly chroma keyed -- it's washed out and dull looking. This impacts not only the overall film, but also makes \"c\" below even worse... c) It's about 30 minutes worth of actual footage/story padded out to 74 minutes by endless -- and yes, I do mean truly interminable -- shots of passing scenery -- along with throwaway scenes of people and events who appear nowhere else in the film and have no relevance to the plot or the story or anything except adding time to the movie. d) Oh, gad, the dialog is soooo slow and boring you want to rip your ears off just so something interesting will happen. e) Acting? Wut dat? f) Music. Ewwww. Just ewwww.... Either the soundtrack was also sold as the intermission music used in Drive-Ins throughout the 60s and 70s, or the other way around.\n\nIn fact, it would be hard to list a single redeeming feature ANYWHERE in this movie. The only reason it got a \"1\" rating from me is because they don't allow negative numbers.\n\nI do not recommend you find an original copy. It's only tolerable with the MST3k commentary track. In fact, it's so full of things to complain about and make fun of that this is clearly the only way to watch it -- either with friends just as capable as the Mistie writers, or with the assistance of the Mistie writers."

It is so incredibly bad that if it were broadcast on every channel in the world simultaneously, non-stop around the clock, it would have succeeded in breaking the will of every human being on Earth and forced them to obey the one man capable of turning it off: Clayton Forrester! This movie should have been the final episode of MST3K in which Mike/Joel/Crow/Servo's will is finally and permanently destroyed and they bow before Dr. Forrester and beg him to end the movie (Crow's line's lifted from 'Aliens' during this episode \"Game over man, game over!\"). Thus the series should have ended with Dr. F. sitting in a throne wearing 'the Master's robe with T.V.'s Frank beside him holding the Torgo staff in his hands and stock footage of various people bowing in worship. If anyone that has actually seen this film thinks they have found one even worse please post it's name here so that I, and everyone else, can be forewarned of the potential terrors that lie behind that seemingly harmless Blockbuster rental that exists in our future.\n\nP.S. Vote to make 'Manos' #1 on the bottom 100!"

Every aspect of this movie is horrible. Any present day filmmaker (professional or amateur) would have to work awfully hard to deliberately make a worse movie. The acting, dialog, sound, cinematography, plot, subplot, action, and music are all the worst I've ever seen. I'm a screen writing major and amateur filmmaker myself, so I've sat through a lot of movies. I was laughing hysterically (mostly at the MST3K's jokes) at how bad and horrendously this movie was put together.\n\nFor anyone out there making a movie of your own, and tormented with feelings of inadequacy or doubt at your own talents, I would advise you to watch this (the MST3K version first). Nothing you make could possibly be this bad. FYI: The regular version is available on DVD. I bought it cheap online to see if I can stand to view it.\n\nAnd as the movie's stupid, insulting ending finally faded out, I got up with an uneasy feeling in my body, knowing I'd never sit through a movie that bad as long as I shall live. I think I've made my point."

So my friend shows me the movie, and I feel like I've learned something about the world. You know, the way that third -orld criminals learn something when they have their eyes gouged out.\n\nThis movie is a must-see for anyone who has an under appreciation for movies. The phrase \"at least it wasn't Manos\" will become the new norm.\n\nI'm usually pretty generous with movies. I work in a theater and see films for free on the big screen on opening night (or later if the former statement is not possible). I've even come to appreciate Steven Seagal's career as a result of Manos.\n\nIt isn't possible to explain WHY it's such a bad movie, I guess the only real purpose of this review is to help put Manos back on the top of the worst 100 list. Back where it belongs.\n\nSee it, and you too be awed at shocked at what is without question the reigning lord of all terrible movies."

Everything about it, and I mean everything, from the wholly inappropriate soundtrack and pathetic sets to the leaden-paced direction and bizarre \"plot\", is about as inept as could be. Yet somehow it actually seems to be a sincere attempt at making a serious thriller! Equally surprising is that this appears to have been created by (apparently) functioning adults and not a group of 10-year-olds who have been given a camera and some cheesy costumes. The tired phrase, \"What could they have been thinking?\" only begins to express one's incredulity.

Even the \"evil\" scientists in MST3K were apologizing for showing Joe and the robots the movie. I hope that no one else will have to go through the pain that is watching this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm talking about Manos: Hands of Fate, which is widely regarded as the worst film ever. I first saw it thru MST3K, like most people. I found myself wondering what the \"uncut\" version had been like (the MST DVD did not come with the \"original\" version of the movie, like many MST DVDs do.) I finally broke down and bought the unMSTed DVD on Amazon, just to see the \"unedited\" version. (I'll say this, the MST version was actually in better, less crackly shape.) Yes, the original \"Manos\" is still slow-moving, with endless shots of countryside that serve no purpose. Yes, the acting is atrocious. Yes, there's continuity holes galore (When exactly is the Master going to actually kill Torgo, anyway??). These are all things that can also be said about the original \"Carnival Of Souls\", which is (rightly) considered a classic camp/horror masterpiece.\n\nThe characters of the Master and Torgo are two of the most widely laughed at in film history, but they're also the best performances in this film. Tom Neyman as the Master is honestly evil-looking and scary, especially in the couple of scenes they cut out for the MST version. The late John Reynolds' spazzy performance as Torgo can only half be attributed to the drugs he was allegedly on at the time; the guy was either a for-real mental case, or he was damn good at acting like one. Director/Father Harold P. Warren voiced all the male characters in the widely-razzed voice-over-- and I happen to think he did a rather good job. Sure, they all sound alike-- but only a little bit. And tell me you can imagine Torgo with any other voice! In nearly every frame, you can see what they were *trying* to do (and might have succeeded at, had they been in more capable hands). The seemingly pointless teens kissing in the car serve as part of the \"fate\" concept-- if only the cops hadn't come along and shoved them off, the father might have been able to ask them for proper directions to get out of there. Or perhaps the teens are prisoners of the Master themselves! The ludicrous name of the \"god\" Manos-- actually quite fitting, since the cult is worshipping the fickle hands of fate. The ending is honestly skincrawly, finding out what happened to the couple's little girl-- and what's about to happen to the two new, roadtripping girlfriends.\n\nIt's said that various people (Tarantino for one) are thinking of actually remaking \"Manos\". Here's hoping they never do. The fact that no one ever heard of any of the cast before or since contributes greatly to the eerie, last-known-photograph feel of the film. To see it remade with big name actors who are only capable of playing themselves-as-cult-hero would make it every bit as inane and bad as people are already saying the original \"Manos\" is. Let's leave it with the little bit of dignity is has, shall we?"

After sitting through Manos (if you can) you'd pay big money to watch Glen or Glenda instead, so excruciating is the experience. Even watching the much lauded MST3K treatment of Manos proved to be a chore, even with Joel and the Bots mercilessly ripping the film to shreds with wisecracks. I don't think I've actually stayed awake through the entire movie in one sitting yet, only catching it in installments between lapsing into defensive comas during several viewings.\n\nI realize people might read these reviews or check out the bottom 100 listings here at IMDb and think, \"wow, I must watch this film that's getting all these comments\" but you have to believe me when I say that you REALLY don't want to sit through this garbage if you can at all avoid it. Films like 'Space Mutiny' and 'Future War' are hilariously bad, something you can laugh at because they're so ineptly made, but this one lowers the bar even more and frankly it just hurts to watch. It's very very slow, stupid, poorly lit, badly acted and the highlight of this crap is Torgo, a character that in any other movie would get about a minute of screen time and be forgotten. In this crud he shines like a silver coin in a chimney-sweeps earhole."

Tor-goat seems like a bum they pulled out of the streets and slapped prosthetics onto. The \"wonderful\" subplot of him being a Satyr is killed by a deadly team of bad camera-work and sloppy writing. To those not in the know, he's just a creepy beard-man in serious need of more comfortable kneepads. He and the master's \"eerie\" presence is denoted by \"eerie-er\" free-style jazz that sounds like something Charlie parker threw up, Tito Puente cooked and Kenny G garnished and ate.

Funny why this guy with a leg problem cares to help carry the luggage, he can't even walk! If you dare to watch the real Manos the Hands of Fate, you will fall dead. Please watch the MST3K version. Be warned, you will go into comatose."

No matter what the cost, no matter what you would lose, YOU MUST TAKE IT! Nothing that could happen to you would ever top the experience of seeing this movie!

Manos should at least be in the bottom 5. If you try to view this piece of sh*t without MST3K, you'll understand how dreadful this misadventure really is, and want to see it in its rightful place in history: on the very bottom of the bottom 100.\n\nOn another note, I've seen Superbabies (don't ask me why), and if MST3K were still around, this garbage would be on it. It's pretty damn funny, and truly as terrible as it's #2 rating would suggest. Superbabies is what an Ed Wood film would have looked like if he had a budget.

Even a five year old could see this was a stinker.\n\nThe first to realize this film, or whatever it is classified as, was a bomb, were the musicians who scored it. The music is pitifully poor quality throughout. It must have been the only way for the horn players to keep their dignity intact, by trying to match the movie's rock bottom status with something that sounds atrocious. They were successful in reaching a depth of screechiness and an end song with lyrics that sought and found zero listenability.\n\nI want to say something nice about the movie. The two 35 year old teen-agers necking in the car were not as bad as the deputies who mimed interest in gunfire at night in the desert. The catfight scene made other scenes in the movie seem better by comparison.\n\nDo you suppose a real script of this exists today or ever existed? If there was a script would someone have saved it for some reason? Do you think there were any rewrites to the original story that might actually have been worse? Who was the doberman's agent?

They have absolutely nothing to work with and it shows, even Hobgoblins and Future War had unintentionally humorous moments that Mike and the Bots could capitalize off of. Joel, Tom, and Crow were not so lucky here, for Manos did not even manage that, it is bad in the same way a failed comedy is. The only laughs come from stunned disbelief at how truly hideous this films is and even those will fade as the movie wears on and on and on and on.\n\nAs mentioned, the problem is that there is nothing to see in this film, nothing to laugh at or to spark the interest. Plan 9 From Outer Space was a bad film, but at least it had the benefit of being laughably inept. Most bad horror films share this, as, if nothing else, you can always laugh at the poorly realized monster and cheesy plot. Manos, on the other hand, is just there.\n\nIs it the worst film of all time? Probably not, there's bound to be something out there that is even worse; a few completed films were never even released because of how bad they were.\n\nDoes it have the worst direction, acting, and production values ever? Doubtful, I am quite certain there is a student film out there somewhere that exceeds Manos in all of these categories. Besides, the crew actually managed to turn the camera on.\n\nIs it the most loathsome film ever because of the ending? Not at all, there are many German films out there after all and they are quite bad all the way through.\n\nNo, Manos even refuses to excel at being the worst. Anybody who loves movies should see it though, just to see how not to make a movie, even a bad one."

Several times while watching the film (especially during the opening segment which features endless minutes of the main characters driving around) I thought I'd die from laughing too hard. This film makes your stomach muscles hurt. Even after the film is well over, you're still laughing, wondering how such a film could possibly be made.\n\nWhile the technical mistakes might be able to be forgiven, make no mistake: Warren effortlessly throws in every bad movie cliche in the book without even knowing it, from the stereotypical \"weak\" female protagonist, to the laughably bad wrestling scene. To give you some idea, one of the main characters is nearly killed by women in white dresses who slap him.\n\nCombine this with a script that is about three pages long, a plot that doesn't even make sense, banal music, and out of focus camera work, and you have a truly horrible and wonderful experience known only as \"Manos\": The Hands of Fate."

However, in a way, all these problematic technical aspects sum up to a fascinating experience that doesn't bears any resemblance to what most come to expect from movies in general. Therefore, it can be watched for escapist entertainment, mocking the low quality or even for technical analyses.

The actors all just happen to be completely talentless, and I'm pretty sure that the majority of them are on Valium or something. They don't make the mistake of overacting, which at least would be entertaining to the audience. Instead, they underact in the worst way. No matter what the situation, the dull, drugged expression will not leave their faces.\n\n2. The dialog, or rather the lack thereof, is simply atrocious. There is so much repetition, which might have been okay if the actors had only had any feeling or emotion in their voices.\n\n3. The story. Some parts of this movie were so bad that I couldn't even watch anymore. I had to just close my eyes and force myself to breathe. I'm pretty sure that at one point, the overall atrociousness of this movie brought tears to my eyes.\n\n4. The action. WHO taught these actors to slap? Who taught them to fight? Those fight scenes were pathetic, and no human could ever have been injured in one of those rows. Honestly.\n\nThere are at least three hundred other negative things to say about this movie, but if I got into those, I'd be here all night. I swear, I couldn't have made a movie that bad if I'd tried, and I doubt anyone else in the universe could either. It's almost as though they were trying to make THE worst movie ever, and succeeded.\n\nThe MST3K version of this movie is absolutely hysterical, however, and I think that everyone should watch it.

I don't do drugs myself, but I felt like I must've been on something to be able to sit through this snoozer for that long.

I don't care. They have all the time in the world to get back in the car and go. Good grief, they could have slept in the car. Then there are those two kids, necking in the other car. It must be a marathon session. They have been parking for about four days. Oh well. We get to meet the master who runs around in funny pajamas and apparently has a way with the ladies who do weird things, crawling all over each other. Of course, by the time they do decided to leave, the father can't get the car started. The wife wails and that insipid little girl just kind of stands around.

The direction of Hal Warren is amazing, and ranks at the top with other grand master visualists such as Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Truffaut, Scorsese, Kubrick, Michael Bay and McG.\n\nThe acting is compelling. John Reynolds perfectly embodies the deformed \"Torgo.\" Hal Warren display similarly impressive skills in _front_ of the camera as Michael, the dense man who, after being told \"The Master will not be happy\" about his family's presence at a creepy old mansion run by a weirdo who can barely walk, tells his wife she is \"imagining things\" when Torgo tells her that the Master likes her, and is dead, but not dead the way they are familiar with.\n\nThe screenplay is superb. Realistic dialogue flows like cheap champagne at one of Paris Hilton's parties. I also particularly loved the Bergman-style shots of nothing-ness -- for example, the opening, which is a ten minute montage of mid-west scenery. Kubrick would be jealous.\n\nI also loved how all the conversation takes place through facial expressions. When Michael and Normal American Family first meet Torgo, no exchange of dialogue takes place for over thirty seconds. At first, I thought it was just due to Hal Warren being a totally incompetent director with very poor editing skills. But later, I realized it was all in the gestures of Torgo's face, as he stares at them with icy emotion. He's translating a message: \"I'm here, I'm Torgo, I'm sad and lonely.\" What a beautiful, poetic and truly moving scene. It made me cry, Warren has transcended the genre here - this ranks in the top class of all films of the past century - forget \"Citizen Kane,\" forget \"Seven Samurai,\" forget \"Pearl Harbor.\" This is the best movie ever made, and if you disagree, you're probably just stupid and ignorant."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's just a shoddy 70-minute grade-Z feature, but watching it you feel like time becomes molasses, it passes so slowly. It's an ordeal to watch MANOS, it truly is. Good for a drinking game (like: which shots are in focus or not, or spotting continuity errors - Hell, the whole movie is a continuity error!), but only with beer, not hard liquor! Every 3 seconds or so something goes wrong: continuity, framing, dubbing, acting, editing (!!!!), dialogue, music, cinematography - EVERYTHING goes wrong, and all of the time. It becomes clear after the first 10 seconds that no person involved in the production had ANY history in making or starring in movies. The incompetence is unparalleled. Edward D. Wood Jr. (Glen or Glenda, Plan 9 from Outer Space) would rotate in his grave to witness such rampant inanity. They used 1 woman and 2 men to dub ALL the characters in the film, which was shot with a silent camera (Brilliantly, they did no record the audio separately, leaving the dubbers without a clue about what was actually being said!!!). MANOS is fascinating for two people involved in the production: John Reynolds, who played Torgo (and is obviously on LSD all the time - he killed himself shortly after production had wrapped and never saw the finished film - lucky him!) and Tom Neymar, who not only played The Master (whose plans remain as foggy as the cinematography) but also made his own costume and painted his self-portrait which is central to this movie. They're all dead now, including Harold Warren, who made this \"film\" on a whim. MANOS stands there as the epitome of cinematic ineptitude - but it's not funny bad, it's just bad. Now, if you really want to watch a so-bad-it's-good movie, seek out SAMURAI COP! Now, that's an entertaining fiasco. This one, it's just a fiasco."

It actually keeps your attention. If this was a concept piece like a Warhol film or something it would be more explicable at least.\n\nPlot? Some family, with a kid who randomly disappears from the shot then reappears gets a flat tire, and meets some weird guy at a house, then you fall asleep for awhile due to lack of dialogue or anything and wake up drooling on yourself when the movie is over."

But be prepared for mental mutilation(I can't shake Torgo theme out of my head). Only thing this piece of carbage can be used, is torture(Speak, or you'll watch Manos non-stop for week!).

        "review_detailed_main": "A family go on a road trip to\u0085somewhere and wind up getting lost. This is within the first fifteen minutes. How did they manage to pad out a simple plot like that into a quarter of an hour? With tons of shots of the passing countryside as they drive! By the time they get to the house and meet a guy I believe is named Tardo (who has the kind of swag you'd only expect from a guy whose bones are made of gelatin (apparently we're supposed to be scared by gimp-walking)), and I'm not saying that as a joke, I literally think that's the name they call him, you'll be bored out of your mind. Then they get to the house and stay the night because\u0085I guess people were more trusting back in the day. We're given tons of shots of African furnishings bought from the local Pier One Imports that are supposed to be horrifying.\n\nAnyway, the house is home to some creepy porn-star-cum-cult-leader who wears the stupidest looking poncho/robe I've ever seen. He has a harem of women and sacrifices people to the dark lord Manos. Blah blah blah he takes the family and turns them into his slaves and this movie has no point.\n\nEverything about this movie is stupid. It's not helped by the fact the film is shot horribly and they dub over the film, because getting a microphone would have cost way more than this movie was budgeted! What's even worse is that this movie is seventy minutes and is padded out so much just to reach that mark! So many landscape shots and this pointless focus on a couple of kids making out in the desert (who keep coming back to the same spot again and again for some reason).\n\nThe only thing I can give the film credit for is a shot where we're shown the owner of the house and his dog and it cuts to a painting of the two. In better hands, that could have actually been eerily effective. I also thought that the ending, as clich\u00e9 as it was, would have worked if I understood how the owner of the house survived being shot four times.\n\nManos is a watchably terrible movie, but it's still garbage."

Oh, and the great scenes of the characters just staring at each other for minutes on end, I can't forget those.\n\nThe best part was when the wife looked for the child. She opened the one door a few inches, peered in, and closed it again. What a thorough inspection! Later we find that it's the same room where Manos (it feels ridiculous to write that every time) and his wives were hibernating. How could she not notice them!?!?! Joel & the Bots made it watchable, barely. Even they didn't have a lot of material to work with, having been reduced to saying, \"'Manos' Hands of Fate\" about 10 different times because they didn't know what else to say.\n\nI am pretty depressed right now, and this misery will probably be with me for a very long time after watching the dreaded Manos.

And this movie, I could honestly say, is one of those little movies that's off in its own (dream) world. It plays out like the events of somebody's insane dream.\n\nBasically, a family - mom, dad (played by writer / producer / director Harold P. \"Hal\" Warren), and daughter get lost on their way to a place named Valley Lodge and end up at a back-of-the-beyond abode guarded by an oddball named Torgo, played by John Reynolds in all his twitchy glory. Torgo's guarding an entity he dubs The Master (Tom Neyman) who lives with an assortment of \"wives\". Will this family act normally, and get the Hell out of Dodge, or fall into the standard movie trap of being Stupid People Who Do Stupid Things? You'll just have to watch and see.\n\nThe jazzy music score, by Russ Huddleston and Robert Smith, Jr., is just one of the hard-to-resist elements of this thing, which you'll likely watch while shaking your head, and laughing (sometimes simultaneously), or at least shaking your head. Warren stretches out moments to absurd lengths, presumably to get his movies' running time to over an hour long. Torgo in particular operates at about half the normal speed of regular people. And lines of dialogue tend to get repeated over and over - just to make sure we get the point. There's no danger of not knowing any of the character names here!\n\nThe acting and the pacing is all awkward, yet Warrens' fumbling of his own material gives \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" a genuinely dreamy, out there quality that would make this a perfect midnight movie. One could easily watch this with friends while drinking and making their own wisecracks as it plays out. If they love bad movies, this one has to rank as one of the all time \"greats\".\n\nFive out of 10."

Particularly, the \"Dog Storyline\" will tear at your heartstrings. The strings of my heart were torn. And if that wasn't enough, the gripping soundtrack kept me on the edge of my seat. The composer gives Beethoven a run for his money. As for the other reviews of this movie, I do not agree tut-tut. They are mindless, clueless hooligans. So much can be said about this movie, but the most important part is that you must watch this movie RIGHT NOW! RIGHT AWAY! NOW! Please and thank you. The world is waiting. TA-TA."

They come across a house tended to by Torgo and owned by a mysterious master.\n\nTo review it fairly is difficult it's not a horror. Not one moment of tension, shock or terror is generated in this entire movie. Confusion and amusement will be your most likely reactions and the bad dubbing could even annoy you. It is filled with pointless scenes, repeated scenes and long periods of the character Torgo going through what look like facial exercises in the attempt to convey well something.\n\nBut i am not really being fair to this movie, for one thing it is not is boring. We were hooked from the beginning as the movie lived up to every bad review being as shoddy as we had hoped with amusing lines, the make out couple continuously making out (will they never learn), the cops attempts at a search, the master's amazing robes and of course Torgo.\n\nI rated this movie low because in fairness it is a bad movie, badly made yes but I cannot recommend it highly enough."

It turns out this house is full of some weird, stupid secrets, like the master's wives who all sleep on a wooden stake.\n\nThe main characters are idiots for staying at the house to begin with, and the daughter has a really annoying voice. The character of Torgo is another strange guy who is always repeating himself, which gets very repetitive. Another element that adds to the strangeness of the film is the weird jazz music playing nonstop. It is about the worst music to play during a movie like this, and I have no idea what made a composer come out with this.\n\nOverall, this is one of the worst movies of all time, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.\n\nMy rating: BOMB/****. 72 mins."

Warren's tattered vision for an exploitation endeavor provided ideal fodder for comic riffing, instantly making it one of their finest episodes. However, jokes are no longer attached to the new Blu-ray edition of \"Manos,\" which presents the effort in its initial state, trying to reclaim the no-budget charms of the production on its own terms, without ace comedians making the viewing experience passable. It's a dangerous, sobering proposition, but there's something intriguing about the distraction-free picture, revealing Warren's ambition to make junk food cinema through hasty experimentation. This very well may be one of the worst movies ever made, but here, on the Blu-ray, the viewer is now free to study what was originally intended and, in some cases, actually achieved. Do not watch under any circumstances."

It somehow appears to be a \"snuff film,\" I don't know if such movies exist, but Manos: Hands of Fate is a good piece of evidence that it does.\n\nOnce I learned that the actors who played the Mother, the Kissing Girl, and Torgo had all committed suicide the same year the movie was made, I was freaked out. You almost think that the whole cult and sacrifice is probably real. It's probably not true, but watching the movie with a viewpoint that these people are filming a documentary about their cult gives you a whole other feeling, one of unsettling curiosity. Hey, maybe this movie could be considered the father (or Master) of \"Blair Witch Project\"!\n\nMaybe I'm just crazy. Probably the whole reason this movie was made was so we could see the Master's brides wrestle in diaphonous gowns. Despite the wretchedness of the movie, Torgo is an incredibly unforgettable character. You can't help but think of what his ambitions, goals, and motivation. Once you really dig deep down in his character, you realize how disgusting it is, and try to free yourself from the grossness of it all.\n\nFinal word of caution: don't watch without Joel and the Bots.\n\nLong Live Torgo!"

I don't know how you can top this as a bad movie everything about this is so boring awful and just down right BAD. I refuse to think this is a real movie. There's a few things that this movie does a lot of times one is like the hard cut used properly it can't be very effective but this movie does it at the most random times and it makes everything (Hard cut) very confusing. Another thing is the dialogue. It is so bad man like geez I can't even tell you how bad the dialogue (hard cut) is. Another thing is that sometimes the camera just goes out of focus then in the next shot it goes back to normal then it goes out of focus again then they do a hard cut. I hate this movie SO MUCH!! In almost every B-movie there obviously going to be some bad acting but geez this movie just keeps on impressing me. The acting is on a another level of cringe and bad, there's this one scene where the wife is crying and it is so obviously a fake cry it's like funny just like this movie. Then the Sound an audio is like words can't describe how bad the sound is. The movie score and the soundtrack, I can't handle it like one second the music stops then the next second it starts and it stops then it starts again and it does that for the whole movie it's fricken annoying. This movie redefines the word bad it's not even like \"it's so bad it's good\" it's just so bad. (Hard cut) that's about it if you made it to the bottom of my review thank you let me save you some time DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!"

Roughly half the films on the Bottom 100 are there because of their being showcased on MST3K. And while I am not going to say they are not bad movies, they are not among the worst in the world (especially if you keep in mind the bad prints that MST3K often used).\n\nThat being said, \"Manos\" is an exception to that complaint -- it truly is among the worst films ever made. The plot has no rationale, the scenery is begging for something more... the extended drive time in the beginning is unbearable. Torgo is awesome, but we really never begin to understand his issues or why he likes to stuff his pants with pillows...\n\nI see Shout Factory has a special edition of the film, and I think it would be worth picking up. Not because it is a good movie, but because I am just curious how much they could improve on it by touching it up and adding special features. As they say, you can polish a horse apple, but it is still a horse apple."

Was it abysmal, such a Technicolor abortion that it warranted the lowest score possible? I don't think so. This film, though...\n\nLet me make something clear right now: I've only seen the MST3K version like most sane people. I couldn't put myself through the unedited version, though I tried the next best thing and just tuned the bots out. What you have left is a script that is just awful all across the board: dialogue comes off as either cheesy, hokey, or stupid. The characters are either stereotypes or make no sense, with the exception of the servant Torgo, who is purely by accident one of the funniest things ever to happen to movies. And of course, there's the cinematography, using the word in the loosest sense possible. The film was shot with an antique camera that could only record 60 seconds of film at a time, sound not included, and couldn't be moved. The results are just about what you'd expect from a fertilizer salesman trying to edit together an ungodly amount of 60 second clips; jerky, boring, and bad bad bad.\n\nThe story was pretty unamazing by itself. A family gets lost, finds a house/hotel/thing, and winds up right in the middle of a cult. THat's about the extent of what you get; continuity and cohesion go strait out the window here, and what little plot there is gets split up between scenes of The Brave Father trying to be brave but coming off as a clueless pecker-head, the Evil Villain being Evil, or some other mishmash. The \"surprise ending\" is laughable; by the time you hit it, you're just glad its over.\n\nLook for three scenes in this flick: anything with Torgo in it, the gigantic cat-fight whose only plot purpose was to have fairly attractive women fight on screen while Torgo leers Torgoishly, and a scene where two officers of the law \"investigate\" the situation. UNfortunately, because the camera couldn't be moved, the \"investigation\" consists of three steps taken away from the car and a resoundingly satisfactory \"Well, things seem okay here\" from Cop Number One.\n\nThe Trivia section speaks for the rest. The voices were done by two people, no one got paid, and Torgo committed suicide after this was released. I can understand hyperbole, I can realize that yes, there are some truly bad movies out there today, but this one takes the cake. The true Worst Movie of All Time, saved only by a little show called Mystery Science Theatre 3000, where even with the nonstop jibes, the movie is still rough. If you feel, however, you must watch it, get some popcorn, strap yourself in, and see if you can survive the (non-existant) opening credits. You'll see what I mean."

A typical middle-class family gets lost while going on vacation and winds up having to stay the night in the Master's home. All the wives wake up and bicker about whether the Master should marry the woman and her six year old daughter who are staying the night. It's a kind of creepy insight into the mind of the man who made the movie, actually. Not much more than that, though. No plot, no action, and a horribly depressing ending.\n\nThe only reason I ever watched this movie is that I had heard that the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment of it was pretty funny.

But as I said, there's nothing like it, and at the end of the day, with the nonexistent budget and non-professional crew, the film could have just turned out plain awful. Since it is instead bizarrely unique awful, I have to give it ten stars. It really is an achievement of sorts. Final remark: the general idea for the film is fine, and if someone had re-written the script and used professionals to produce it it could have been a pretty decent film."

I could never sit through it again and I can't believe it is not ranked the #1 worst movie, but at this point I'm not about to watch Phat girls to see why it is worse. Watching it took 3 years off my life and lowered my self esteem. Be prepared to go into therapy after viewing it. It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen."

But you did have a director who'd done other films. Granted, they were bad films as well, but there was at least some experience. The actors in RZC had done a little \"acting\" as well. So, is it the worst? Yes, I think so - in the \"no budget, no experienced director, no actors\" category.

Every person that I show this movie to has said the exact same thing. I think the reason why people are giving it 10's is because Manos has been the #1 worst movie of all time for a very long time. It's been the worst for so long for a reason. Manos should go down in history as the single worst movie ever created. It helps me sleep at night to know that I have seen the worst movie ever made.

But in this case the talent-deprived actors should have realized halfway through the project that they'd be better off having gone back to their day jobs, whatever they may have been.\n\nAre there any bright spots in this abyss? The only performer who displayed any recognizable talent was John Reynolds as Torgo. I write this under the assumption that the late Mr. Reynolds was not mentally handicapped, and that his pauses and stutterings were him desperately trying to bring his ill-conceived character to life.\n\nEven Joel and the 'bots, our fearless bashers of stupidity, had trouble making this movie entertaining. What's there to say about a movie that takes ten minutes of dialogue-less driving? The Ultimate Raspberry award goes to \"Manos: Hands of Fate\", which should be placed in the condemned spot of Worst Movie Ever."

If you ignore the misguided and uneducated popular opinion long enough to treat yourself to this gem, you will be rewarded for years to come. It is perhaps the most disturbing psychological thriller ever made.\n\nAlthough, at first glance, elements like the protracted cuts of the car driving through the desert seem to be gratuitous incompetence on the part of director Hal Warren, they are actually expertly calculated devices designed to engender unparalleled tension (I felt like I was actually experiencing the horrific events myself). What is considered \"bad acting\" and boring, inane dialogue by most, is in fact Warren's almost supernatural ability to weave a sense of ultra-realism from his supremely skilled thespians. The delicious set design and cinematography are gothically postmodern, conveying an atmosphere of impending dread. Last but not least, kudos of kudos must be given to the brilliant score, particularly the haunting, minimalistic \"Torgo\" theme. All of these components converge to yield a profoundly subtle epic, a superlative achievement in innovative film-making - in short, one of the greatest films ever made. I could tell you more, but I don't wish to spoil a second of this masterpiece, nor its climactic twist, which would turn M. Night Shaymalan green with envy.\n\nGod rest your soul, Hal Warren. One can only imagine what other cinematic wonders you would have blessed us with if only your uncanny genius had been recognized and appreciated. Films like \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" are the reason celluloid was invented."

This is a movie where somehow, in some way, the people working on it managed to do EVERYTHING wrong.\n\nActing? Horrible. Costumes? Laughable. Lighting? Umm...What lighting? For the love of God, the film and camera used were even of sub-standard quality (and I mean by 1966 standards, not modern day)! This movie reminds me more than anything else of when a loving parent goes to their son/daughter's third grade play and video tapes it. Except the plot to that play is probably a lot more coherent, less disturbing, and the acting is only slightly worse. That is no exaggeration.\n\nI can't really sumarize this movie since it doesn't really seem to go anywhere. A lot of it is downright confusing. There are several scenes of a young couple kissing that could just as well have been from another movie for all the impact they had on this one. Torgo, the only memorable character, has been given the sinister affliction of gigantic thighs. It seems he was intended to be some sort of goat-man, but that isn't really explained and isn't readily obvious. His death scene looks more like a massage than a brutal beating. Worst of all, in the end, our heroes (such as they are) fail to escape from Torgo's creepy Master, sending the uplifting message that evil pagan gods always win in the end. The final scenes of the movie also hint at pedophilia.\n\nFor all of the cast members, as well as the writer/director and I imagine the greater portion of the crew, this was to be their first and only film. A sequel is hinted at in the final credits, but thank goodness it was never made.\n\nI have been trying and trying to come up with some explanation for how this movie got released in theaters. So far, the only one that made sense to me is that Satan himself appeared before the studio executives and made some kind of payoff. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and although I have yet to see Plan 9 From Outer Space! (though not for lack of trying) I cannot imagine how it could exceed Manos in failure.\n\nI should mention I saw only the MST3K version of this movie. I cannot imagine sitting through the uncut version. This movie churns my stomach as it is. Nothing can prepare you for this movie. It has to be seen to be believed and to see this movie is to take your life into your own hands. For those who have seen the uncut version...you have my sympathies."

If someone gives it two, they are VERY nice.\n\nThis is definitely the worst movie that has ever been made, I have no doubt about that.

It gives a sense of scale. (It's a bit like taring a scale to 0.) The only way to possibly enjoy it is to watch it with the MST3K comments. When the master confronts Torgo, a full two minutes goes by watching him wordlessly approach Torgo and we watch Torgo struggle to his feet. After some funny patter during this scene, Joel finally screams \"Do something!\" The MST3K crew is the only life given to the film where aiming the camera at an average street corner would provide more action and plot."

Except, Harold knew nothing about making movies, he had no professional actors and only had one hand-held camera that could film for only 32 seconds at a time. Without sound.\n\nIt's the story about a family who get stranded in the middle of nowhere and look for help in an old scary house. The only one who's there to welcome them is the creepy servant Torgo. Before the night is over they find themselves at the mercy of The Master and his evil cult.\n\nPlaced at a #4 spot on the IMDb bottom 100, this has got to be one of the worst movies of all time, right?\n\nI think it depends on how you define a bad movie.\n\nI've seen plenty of million dollar Hollywood movies that bored me to death. And Manos didn't. In fact, I loved it. Warren's pure lack of cinematic vision and experience is what gives this movie its unique atmosphere. The recurring library music, the choppy editing, the weird sound loops all contribute to the movie's surreal qualities. For instance the scene where Torgo (in my opinion, one of the most enigmatic heroes in B-movie history) tries to touch the face of Margaret goes on and on. In and out of focus. Nothing's really happening, but still you can't look away. It could have come straight out of a David Lynch movie. The fact that Warren probably didn't mean this scene to be weird and surreal doesn't mean that it's not working on a whole different level. It is what it is, intended or not.\n\nI've never seen the MST version and I'm not going to. It's like kicking a dog when it's already down. Watch the great documentary Hotel Torgo instead to learn something about the movie's interesting and often hilarious background. And watch the normal version of the film. You might see Harold P. Warren's dream of making his masterpiece. He invested his money, wrote a script and made his damn horror movie. He followed his passion and the fact that he failed completely is utterly irrelevant. 47 years later, people still watch it. They love it or hate it, but they'll never forget it.\n\nNow does that sound like one of the worst movies ever?"

Everything about this movie reeks: the dubbed-in voices (they lost the original soundtrack), the repetitive dialogue, the huge-kneed Torgo (you will see if you watch, although don't take that as a recommendation to see this), and the stupid plot. That isn't really a long enough list, but I don't think they would allow me to write the sheer amount of words it would take to describe how truly revolting this movie is in every way. If you really, really want to torture yourself, and you have plenty of experience with other bad movies (it helps to have seen such cinematic masterpieces as Hobgoblins and Red Zone Cuba), then prepare yourself for one heck of a ride. (Well, not really, but I just like saying that, since my therapist says it will help the healing begin.)"

Despite Joel and the 'bots frequently hilarious banter, Manos somehow manages to pull ahead and, by the end laps the Satellite of Love by producing more pain than laughs. Now, to describe the plot......... um, well, there's this guy driving forever and he's supposed to be doing something. Then, there's this LSD-driven \"guy\" who has big knees, and he kind of interacts with this black robed Frank Zappa, who happens to have a dozen or so \"wives\" who wear next to nothing and tend to get into big mud-wrestling brawls. Then, these people drive and act stupidly and then other people drive to exactly the same place. It took months of therapy and multiple viewings to gather that synopsis for your reading pleasure. If you do view this on MST3K, then stay tuned through the very end for a hilarious encounter with Torgo, who now works at TORGO'S PIZZA (with free crazy bread!)."

Oddly, the only vaguely redeeming quality was John Reynolds portrayal of Torgo, you know, the guy with the goat legs who \"takes care of the place while the Master's away\".(which still isn't saying much).The rest is painful to watch. The characters are incredibly stupid, made all the more so, because their voices were badly dubbed.\n\nAs bad as it is, I'd still have to say \"Mac and Me\" (which I reviewed a couple of weeks ago) and \"Underdog\" are even worse. On the other hand, there are many reasons why \"Manos\" belongs on the #3 spot on IMDb bottom 100, one of them being that it may have even contributed to the untimely death of John Reynolds. The apparatus he wore to give him the \"goat leg\" effect (Torgo was supposedly a satyr) resulted in permanent knee damage and his subsequent addiction to painkillers. He committed suicide shortly before the film's premiere.\n\nAs to being \"so bad, it's good\", Manos is too bad to be of any good. It's not fair to compare it to \"Dark Star\" or \"The Lost Skeleton of Cadavera\", two films I highly recommend. This, however is to be avoided at all costs.\n\nRating: 1/2* out of *****"

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, I applaud the idea behind this. The goal of creating a piece that wins over audiences in spite of a low budget is a commendable one, and had this had much merit, or even any, beyond said concept, I would be giving them props. Not so. It's surely all been said. The production value on this is zero... where did the money go? Credit for that, along with the summary, goes to my fianc\u00e9e. Having read the Trivia, I still don't understand how this got to be this bad. The pacing is nonexistent. The plot... what there is of one... is rehashed and poorly told. The twist and the acting(save for obviously the voices, among other things, they don't mix them up enough) aren't(all) necessarily the worst ever, though the way it's captured destroys the very hope of what might have been(the fact that the main guy behind this was a stage person with no directorial training whatsoever explains a lot). The attempts to master the cinematic language are marred by dyslexia and a nearly incomprehensible dialect. As basic a matter as the focus wasn't always achieved. The editing is just... while they did only do two takes of everything, and it was all in 32 second segments, that doesn't actually mean he had to do such a lousy job of putting it all together. There is a single good cut in the entire thing. That's it. The effects and believability, save for the aforementioned exception, are simply painful. The lighting varies from uninteresting to \"not there\". The dialog, which there is a decided lack of, is uninspired. An almost unforgivable amount of this consists of people... standing around. It's not shot well, either. Where is the horror? The atmosphere? The mystery? The scares? *What* is the soundtrack? Who thought to have jazz in this? This builds no suspense and contains no thrills. The framing is downright ugly. Between the never-ending sequences and scenes, the house of maybe(but certainly no more than) three rooms total, the four characters that could be excised with nothing lost other than running time, this is really barely worth a viewing, and if you must, I suggest the MST3K episode(albeit you can tell they were struggling for material... it's limited how many jokes you can do on this without repeating yourself). I can't say that I would have survived it if it had been the straight version. This is a textbook example of how not to do a movie, if it does tend to make the same mistakes constantly rather than numerous different ones. The title has an inherent ironic ring to it, as this was clearly made by a crew with broken hands, and of course, arms. I recommend this to anyone into B-flicks, and/or whatever else is this awful. The common theater-goer may want to avert their eyes, as this is likely to induce bleeding from them(meanwhile, that would be cooler than anything you'll see in this). 1/10"

Think about this: years after our time, mankind is completely eradicated from the face of the earth. And some kind of alien species finds the earth and decides to send an expedition team to discover if any kind of intelligent life form exists. And during their search,they find \"Manos the hands of fate\" and somehow manage to watch it.

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, let me stress that I watched the MST3K version of this, so that may have helped to cushion the blow. I also prepped myself for this movie by reading a ton of reviews about it. Therefore, I was expecting this to be an insanely mind numbing experience that I would never be able to make it all the way through. After having seen it, I have to admit that it wasn't the monstrosity that I built it up to be. Make no mistake, this is NOT a good movie, but I wasn't as astounded by the poor production of this movie as others. To me, it came across as a high school production of a play written by one of the students. Knowing in advance that the vast majority of people involved in this movie knew next to nothing about making films helped me be a little more forgiving of the vast array of technical flaws. The basic story that Hal Warren devised could have worked in the right hands (no pun intended). What he didn't understand was how to take that idea and turn it into a full length feature film. Hence we get pointless scenes of endless driving, teenagers making out, people staring at paintings, girls wrestling, etc.\n\nI'd love to see a remake of this movie with the following changes: First, I'd spend more time in the beginning with the family before they leave for this trip, to help us identify with the characters. Maybe the relationship between husband and wife isn't going so well, and they hope that over vacation they can try to bury the hatchet. Then, I'd lose those teenagers and change the cops to detectives investigating the disappearance of six couples over a period of years in one small town. These six couples would represent the Master's six wives and his male slaves. I'd change the circumstances of how the family winds up in this house. Big change: Torgo. I'd make him appear completely normal, albeit quirky (think Norman Bates). This serves two purposes - first, it would be easier to believe that the family would stay there in the first place. Second, it would help throw off suspicion of any wrong-doing. As for the Master, I would make him Manos, instead of having Manos be the deity that the Master worships. He would be a Devil-like creature - the epitome of all evil. He would have very definite powers such as the power to possess and the power to shapeshift. I'd probably have the Torgo character and Margaret find a mutual attraction, to add motivation for Torgo to defy the master and to add conflict between Mike & Margaret. This is just an example of the many things that could possibly make this movie an enjoyable experience.\n\nIn the end, I have to give Hal Warren a little credit. I'd be willing to bet that there are far worse things that were put onto film by well known directors on their first try - I don't mean their first feature film, I mean the very first time they ever rolled film to try to tell a story. Hey, almost 7,000 people have rated it on the IMDb, and I'm sure that thousands of others have seen it. For a horror movie that was made 40 years ago on a shoestring budget by someone who'd never been involved with the movie industry, I'd say that's pretty cool. Worst movie ever? No, and here's why: Hal Warren & the entire cast and crew just didn't have the know-how to make a better movie. I'd reserve the honor of Worst Movie for something like \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\", where EVERYONE involved should have known better."

I feel that it was one of those things that slips through the cracks or cheats its way into the public consciousness. 'Manos' has a lot things that shout amatuer filmmaking -- but it successfully brings to the screen a story and yes it has a plot. I am not going to sum this movie up like so many other people do. The plot is simple, a family encounters something dark and horrific. The problem that so many people have with this movie is the lame script, disasterous sound effects, the muted color, and the meandering plot. You know what, that is comparable to a lot of people's opinions. Say what you may, but I have seen so many \"works of artistic expression\" that are the equivalent to 'Manos.' Yet, these people were constantly lied to about how great their poem, short story, painting, etc. was. It was the level of amatuer that kept these pieces of artistic expression from the public eye. As stated before, 'Manos' just simply slip through the cracks. Also, it did not try to exploit me, say like a _Gigli_ or _Batman and Robin_. 3 out of 10 stars"

But now, cult film fanatics, fans of the show, and film critics alike have almost unanimously dubbed this film \"the worst movie ever made.\"\n\nBut what makes it so bad? Let's see: corpse-like emotionless acting ( except perhaps Torgo who is the best character the movie has to offer ), the worst editing I've ever seen ( and I've been editing high-school DV videos for 4 years ), audio dubbing reminiscent of old Godzilla movies, and a script that makes \"poorly-constructed\" seem insignificant, for starters. I gave it a 2 just because of the possibility that the filmmakers weren't serious and that it has maybe one or two good transitions/ideas.\n\nPlot summary: you know the drill, lost family in the desert winds up at a house where they need to spend the night with a weird housekeeper named Torgo who guards the place while the \"master\" is away. Things get worse and worse until they discover that it is home to a dark cult who worships a deity known as Manos. Throw in some bad plot deviations such as teenage romance and feminine competition... it's so fragmented it's impossible to do an accurate plot summary.\n\nBad? Definitely. Fun to watch? Absolutely. I recommend the MST3K version though, or else you might just consider suicide, as that is exactly what 4 of the people involved in the making of this movie, including John Reynolds (Torg ) did after its release. No, I'm not kidding. Oh, and not to mention, the commentary is hilarious. In the case of a worldwide nuclear crisis, all United States missiles and those of friendly nations calibrate their weapons on the town of El Paso for allowing this movie to be made in their town.\n\nThe End ?"

On a more serious, much more appreciative note, Manos the Hands of Fate deserves respect not for the film, but for the fact that this was a movie made on a whim that managed to get made, despite many setbacks. Even more surprising then it getting made, is that it got picked up by a company and was distributed to major theaters.\n\nAnd nowadays, the film has a large fan base. Well, I would hesitate to say it is a \"Fanbase\" seeing that many of us are dedicated to hating this movie. It is a God awful film. Though I would have to say that if it was a better film, the ending would have been seen by many as edgy (though only a year or so ahead of its time). Though it really didn't matter how it ended, because most people couldn't get through the beginning.\n\nI warned people that this movie is not for the weak. They must have thought I meant weak stomachs because they laughed it off. I have had so many people come up to me and tell me just how much they despised the movie. I guess they thought ten minutes of dialog-free driving was an exaggeration. The script was written within one week, but it's not like it's a complicated story. Family takes a wrong turn, ends up in a lodge run by a cult. It's about them trying to escape their clutches. Bad dubbing. Bad camera work. Good acting destroyed by bad dubbing. This just is a bad movie that seems to drag on forever.\n\nAnd I am proud to own this film. Seriously. Some movies are so bad they are good. Some are just so bad they are, well, bad. This one is the latter. So unbelievably bad that one can call themselves a fan but refuse to watch it time after time, because they know the horror that is Manos: the Hands of Fate."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm sorry, but I really have to weigh in on this puppy.\n\nI think everyone is making way too much of 'Manos'. Sure, it's fun to queue up and pound away at this pathetic punching bag of a movie, but that's hardly a worthy challenge, is it. One might as well stuff a runty, two-day old kitten into a pair of wrestling Speedos then drop Andre the Giant onto it like a bomb. Wow. What a contest.\n\nPart of the problem (well, my problem) with the reviews, springs from the tacit notion that this film is legitimate. That is to say, legitimate to the extent that there is a general assumption that because it actually made it into the theaters, it belonged there at all. With that legitimacy lent, it then became fair game and, hence, worthy of any level of consideration. But knowing that the film's creator attempted to distance himself from his own creation, leads me to believe that, ultimately, 'Manos' was never intended to be released into the world of Man. (Well, at least not into the world of THIS man.) Consider: Should the impromptu Super 8's of your infant nephew Stevie explosively pooping into his Pampers hit the local Cineplex? Of course not. So your Sony camera caught all the hot action when that errant barbecue spark got to your new Ferrari Modena which then sent your flame-engulfed great grandmother on her merry way through the garage door. You really want moviegoers to sit through that sort of thing? Come on.\n\nAnd something else. There is no great profundity or meaning in the fact that some cast members took their own lives, and perhaps due to the incredible shame they felt in participating in such a crumby venture. No one kills themselves over appearing in bad movies (although some should). It is more likely that anyone disturbed enough to volunteer for 'Manos' is disturbed enough to \"off\" themselves without 'Manos' as a catalyst. 'Manos' was symptomatic; it wasn't the cause. Those four actors? I feel for them, but their days were numbered long before 'Manos' ever steamily plopped into the theaters. Okay. It's possible that 'Manos' accelerated them toward their common doom like an F-16CJ in full afterburner. Still, it was gonna happen. Further evidence as to the psychological state of the cast members? (Notice that I avoid calling them actors.) The performances throughout. Case closed. I won't waste IMDb server space on this one. Although, going by Torgo's performance, one could be forgiven for assuming that his suicide preceded the making of 'Manos'. That would nicely explain much of what I saw (and smelled).\n\nWith that said on the suicides, it's quite possible that the four in question faked their own deaths in order to escape the ignominy associated with their hideous doings. Sort of an augmented version of the witness protection program, although, in this case the witnesses are also the perpetrators. Doesn't seem fair, does it.\n\nFinal Comment: I was 10 years old and in Brooklyn when 'Manos' was released. So it's highly unlikely that I had anything to do with it. I just wanted that out there for the record. Thank you."

But look at the bright side. At least it has a beginning, middle, and end. Once again, I have seen movies which do not.\n\nActing: Again, it is bad. But at least you can make fun of some of the acting, laugh at it. The rest is just pathetic.\n\nAction: All the \"action\" scenes in this movie, of which there are very few, are pretty lame. Moving on.\n\nHumor: The only thing funny in this movie is Torgo, though he is not meant to be.\n\nMusic: Heh, well, let's just say it is really, really bad.\n\nAll of these things are reasons to rate Manos as being a very bad movie, but the worst movie ever? Hardly. Here is how I would rate Manos:\n\nHere is my scale for bad movies\n\nLevel 1: Standard bad movie . Level 2: A movie so bad it is funny. Level 3: A movie so bad it has stopped being funny. Level 4: A movie so bad it is even worse than 3. Disturbingly bad.

And of course to make this movie worth watching you should watch the MST3K version.\n\nThe acting is horrendous, the lighting is poor, the sound is bad, and the video a bit fuzzy. Typical for amateur, low-budget movie efforts. Also typical for low-budget movies is the plot. Travelers get lost, find a group of weirdos, then try to escape from said weirdos. Tell me you haven't heard that one before. And yet another typical amateur low-budget mistake are many scenes which seem to go nowhere, along with confusing plot lines. But you have to see the Master's wonderful cloak.\n\nInterspersed with the plot are a couple of policemen who don't seem too keen to investigate anything except for the couple who seem to be interested in making out in a sports car 24/7.\n\nIf there is one bright spot in this cinematographic dungheap is that the character of Torgo really did come off as creepy. I understand reading the trivia was that the actor was on LSD at the time which caused his twitchy, out-of-it behavior. That's not to say that the part was good or that he was a good actor, though, but you really wouldn't want to spend the night with Torgo.\n\nI can understand why this movie bombed at the premier and why it's consistently been rated as one of the worst movies in history."

As a result there are countless clumsy jump cuts, continuity errors, and dialog that was (very badly) dubbed in later by only three people. When you combine that with horrible cinematography, limited lighting, ugly sets, uglier music, and repetitive dialog you get what probably deserves to be called one of the worst movies ever made.\n\nDespite all of these shortcomings, \"Manos\" has gained something of a cult following among fans of so-bad-they're-good movies. While I wouldn't go as far as to call myself a fan of this movie, I can kind of see why it would have such a following. There is a certain charm to this film that suggests that everyone involved was really trying their best to come up with something good (they were just really bad at it, so they failed miserably). The plot, which centers on a lost family stopping at a lodge in the middle of nowhere and being tormented by its mystical \"master\" and his (oddly likable) satyr henchman, probably would've been salvageable in the hands of the right filmmakers. There's also a somewhat creepy atmosphere that almost makes itself felt through the film's shortcomings. Sadly, it isn't enough to save this mess (only enough so that I can give it a score of two out of ten instead of a one).\n\nIf nothing else, I can honestly say that \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" is one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. I don't know if I could recommend it to anybody that I would consider a friend. I would tell them to watch the \"MST 3K\" version though, if only because it proves my theory that that particular show is at its best when the movies are at their worst."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"MANOS\" THE HANDS OF FATE is the worst movie there is. I find it hard to believe that so many people were able to sit through this unforgivable mess, even with the MST3K commentary! Furthermore, I find it impossible to believe that anyone actually liked it! 541 people thought this was great? You fools! That's like drinking hemlock and calling it Koolaid! I am not exaggerating here, there has never been a movie worse than this. Some say that GIGLI is the worst movie ever made, but they are simply overreacting to a fresh stinker (I mean Ben Afflec and Lopez are irritating and all, but they could never make a movie worse than this!). I am voting in to tip the scales and put this trash on the bottom where it belongs.\n\nThe film opens with a seemingly endless series of establishing shots that are so lifeless, it would be a compliment to call them 2 dimensional. After what feels like 20 minutes of boring travel, our heroes: a couple, their daughter, and a dog, come to a house in the middle of nowhere. That's when we meet the freak Torgo, who has giant kneecaps. The husband talks to him asking if they can stay the night. Sounds simple enough, right? They can't even finish a simple sentence without stumbling and pausing for small eternities! They are allowed to stay and the \"horror\" unfolds very slowly. Later we meet The Master, who wears a cape with hands on it as he worships Manos (which means hands, making the title a pathetic redundancy). The Master has wives who wrestle for his favor in nightgowns. All of it is presented in static shots, on very low quality film, which are all held for too long. The dialogue, acting, design, script, direction, music, photography, you name it, it all stinks! In fact, it is all the absolute worst it can be. The movie is such an enormous failure, one wonders if they were even trying. It all builds to a weak horror-movie conclusion and the mercifully ends. The 74 minutes it takes to watch it feels like about five hours.\n\nThis movie makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE seem like CITIZEN KANE. I myself am one who can enjoy a movie when its bad enough (why else would I watch MST3K?), but this thing is just too terrible to enjoy, on any level. The only reason to watch the MST is to hear the comments, which still don't protect you from the utter pain of viewing the movie. MANOS is a one of a kind pain, rivaled only by THE INCREDIBLY STRANGE CREATURES WHO STOPPED LIVING AND BECAME MIXED UP ZOMBIES. The film, the director, the actors, and the entire crew should have been publicly burned for this crime against the cinema. It doesn't get any worse than this!"

        "review_title": "Probably the Most Boring Horror Movie Ever Made",
        "review_detailed_main": "Back in the mid 1960s, a Texas fertilizer and insurance salesman named Harold P. Warren made a bet with screenwriter Stirling Silliphant (writer of In the Heat of the Night) that anyone can make a horror movie. Soon afterwards, Warren created his own horror movie on a budget of $19,000, with random people cast to play the characters, and a 16mm camera that could not record sound, causing the film to be dubbed in post. The result was Manos: The Hands of Fate (literally translated to Hands: The Hands of Fate), which despite going largely unnoticed for many years due to only playing in drive-ins and one Texas theater, it soon developed a cult following after MST3K lampooned it and turned it into a famously bad film. Me personally, I wish this film would remain obscure, for it's not even so bad it's funny, it's just pathetic.\n\nThe film revolves around a vacationing family who end up getting trapped at a lodge run by a pagan cult, and they try to flee them as the cult's members decide what to do to them. Now this plot may seem really basic on paper, but with the right amount of pacing and momentum, this film could elevate its thin narrative into something with lots of substance....that is not what happened. Really, the whole movie could be cut down into 10 minutes, not only because of several insignificant scenes, but also because it drags certain moments on for no reason. There are many times when characters just stand around doing nothing even after they're done talking, and it becomes very awkward and even frustrating to watch. In addition, a whole mini plot with a couple making out in a car feels like it belongs in a completely different movie. Even an out of place catfight breaks lose with the cult master's wives, showing off pure incompetent storytelling as far as the eyes can see.\n\nNow I'm well aware that Warren could only use nobodies to play the characters, but ho'boy does nobody look like they have any idea what they're doing. Warren plays the main character Mike, and it looks like he's trying to figure out what to do on set rather than giving a performance. Same can be said about the rest, especially Mike's wife Margaret, the daughter, and the infamous Torgo. Speaking of Torgo, he's probably the most interesting character in the film from his design alone, mainly because his actor John Reynolds was high when he played the character, making his scenes hysterical but also questionable. The only other actor who seems to be having some resemblance of fun is the one playing the cult master, but he feels like a hammy cartoon villain with all the wackiness sucked out. Also, it is painfully obvious that the movie was dubbed in post, down to the young daughter clearly being voiced by a grown woman, but they had to work with what they were given, so I'm sure they tried in that aspect.\n\nLastly, in spite of the shoe string budget, there's way too many infamous technical deficiencies to behold. Probably the biggest sin is the editing and continuity flaws, showcasing the never ending scenes and confusing side narratives that have nothing to do with anything. There's even a moment where you can clearly see the clapperboard right when the film cuts to the makeout couple. In terms of story errors, Torgo is supposed to be a satyr, so John Reynolds wore metallic rigging, but he accidentally wore it backwards which made him look more like a man with oversized knees. Also, it is never once mentioned in the film that Torgo is a satyr, so anyone watching this film will forever see him as some weird deformity. Not to mention, the soundtrack is poorly synchronized, and they even repeat the same tracks and voice recordings multiple times just to pad things out. Lastly, the whole opening showing the family driving feels like it was meant to have opening credits that were never added in, proving that the best solution would have been to trim the scene down, like the rest of the movie.\n\nOverall, Manos is a painfully incompetent and abysmal watch that can only be admired by Mystery Science Theater and RiffTrax fans for its disastrous technical failures and horrendous writing and acting. It's true what they say, nobody ever sets out to make a bad movie, and I admittedly do respect Harold P. Warren for actually making this film out of a bet, no matter how incomplete it is. Besides, plenty of filmmakers have proven to make their own successful horror movies on shoe string budgets, such as George Romero with The Living Dead series, John Carpenter with Halloween, Peter Jackson with Bad Taste, Sam Raimi with The Evil Dead, and more. However, given that those people have talent and experience in film-making, Manos is an example of why films need to be made by people who actually have some background in the techniques of crafting films, not fertilizer salesmen who make bets with Hollywood writers with a rich profile. Unless you're a cynic who adores riffing on the worst of the worst, I think Manos is better off left deep in the heart of Texas where nobody will ever seen it again."

This is a new level of bad, an unapproachable, incomprehensible kind of bad. So bad, so very very bad, that it flies off the low end of the continuum and emerges... where???\n\nNote that the most popular user rating for this movie is 1, and the second most popular vote is 10.

I've rarely seen such a thoughtful review on a message board site. Most of the time, people either gush about how great a movie was or gripe about what a miserable failure it was. I've been guilty myself of doing both in the past. I've also managed to write some balanced, thoughtful reviews too. It's not easy to do, especially if you have very strong feelings either negative or positive about the film. This Alienator person should be a professional movie critic like Roger Ebert if he or she isn't one already.\n\nPersonally, I find the non MSTK version of this film to be very bad, but not the worst ever. The MSTK version is quite funny at times due to the trio's antics. I won't go so far as to say that it is the worst film of all time though. Like Alienator, I agree that given the conditions the film was created under and the skill of the filmmakers it's actually an amazing achievement that the film is still well known after all these years. Think of all the bigger budgeted, better casted films that have been made that have been all but forgotten. \"Dr. Who and the Daleks\" anyone? I'm a Dr. Who fan and own many of the TV episodes and movies including this one and even I think the movie is pretty horrible. I'm not sure that a non-Who fan could stand to watch it. How they ever got the great Peter Cushing to be in it is beyond me. Must have been really low on money.\n\nOr how about the great Orson Welles' version of Macbeth? He worked on it for a very long time and was never able to make a polished movie out of it. I really like most of Welles' work but Macbeth is terrible. Talk about poor editing, timing, lighting etc. The only saving grace of the entire film is Orson's acting. Every other aspect of the film is pretty bad. It was made early in his career and he was still learning. The main difference between Welles and the guy who directed Manos is that Welles didn't give up after his early attempts and kept trying and got better. Maybe with enough encouragement, funds and a lucky break or two the guys who made Manos could have done better in future movies instead of giving up after their first one."

There was absolutely NO continuity to the movie. It is funny to see all the shots filmed at different times of the day. One shot will be at dusk and the next will be at high noon and back to dusk. Plus, the sound was just horrible. Plus, I think there might have been a plot around here somewhere. Oh well, MST3K made it most bearable."

I literally had to close my eyes to avoid being overly terrified. Torgo set the stage for characters such as Hannibal Lecter and Leatherface. For I'll forever be haunted by Torgo's menacing voice and the terrifying theme music which will always challenge my sanity. There's no question in this author's opinion that there will be a much anticipated sequel. With such a terrifying movie, one can only hope that the second time around will be half as frightening."

I want you to think of all the things that made Shawshank Redemption ( or what have you ) magnificent and take all that and completely flush it down the jon. Now if my useless rambling isnt enough to convince you then check out some of these facts.\n\n1. The director and overall creator ( Hal Warren ) was a fertilizer salesman before this movie. 2. Hal made this movie on a bet that he could make a decent horror film ( wonder who won that one???) 3.Manos is spanish for hands, therefore the true title is \"Hands, The Hands of Fate. 4. The camera Hal used could not record sound and could only record 30 seconds of film before the film was replaced\n\nNow if this isnt enough, then hey watch the movie. Trust me it is even difficult and agaonizing to watch with the help of the bots and Joel. I suppose some of the people out there think i am being too critical, and maybe i am, but i dont care. I will grant those people something and that is they are right that some newer and more expensive movies have been made and come close to this one. The only good thing about this movie is that it can substitute as a sleeping bill. Overall a movie with solid bad directing, acting, writing, and all the other stuff. 2/10\n\n\" There's no way out of here, it'll be dark soon, there's no way out of here\""

Anyway, movies that are being worked with multi-million budgets have been a disaster...Vertical Limit? A complete waste of time! Watch it, try not to pick out it's faults and appreciate Hal's work.

Seriously, I couldn't even tell you what genre this film could be classified as, nor could I tell you what the plot is about.\n\nApparently, filmed in a matter of days, on a budget of only a few thousand dollars, and screened only a couple of times in El Paso ( where it was filmed ) , and then lost for decades, until its rediscovery by Mystery Science Theatre 3000, this is seriously one of the worst, most excruciatingly boring films ever made. It's barely even mockable, let alone reviewable. The music score consists of competing sax, and ivories being tickled in the most obtuse, out of place fashion, seemingly intended for some other movie, and it's used throughout almost every scene. Most times I've heard the title/ lead character's name spoken, it's MAN-os, but in the dialogue in the film, it's pronounced like MAH-nos. However his name is correctly pronounced, I kept waiting for his dog to bite him. No such luck.\n\nA middle aged nuclear family ( a grumpy old man in ridiculously over-sized trousers, his whiny, nagging wife, and their young daughter, who serves absolutely no purpose in the plot of film ) are driving in the desert ( for the first nine minutes of this movie ) and lose their way. They babble about the weather, are stopped about a broken taillight by a cop with nothing else to do, who later hassles a young couple kissing in a parked car ( and the visible guy holding the clapperboard ) on the roadside. The female half of this couple is clearly bored, as she repeatedly delivers her lines while looking directly into the camera. Was this nine minutes long scene really necessary in setting up the plot of this movie?\n\nThe family comes across some type of home, inhabited by Torgo, a 25 years old man in old age make-up ( because that always works so well ) , hobbling around, who repeats almost every line of dialogue twice. After their car won't start, they're stuck in this desert overnight, where slightly weird, but mostly just interminably boring, things happen. Torgo tells them \" The Master \" is dead, but eventually, a hidden, sort of Satanic-looking room is found, where \" The Master \" is shown apparently alive after all. He's a John Astin lookalike in black robe with red hands, acting grandiose, in front of a group of women, who do little more than sit around and talk for several scenes, before a catfight erupts. The family from the first half disappears for most of this second half, while the John Astin clone and his six wives do ... stuff, ... possibly killing Torgo, because yeah, sure, of course they do.\n\nThe kissing couple appear again, at night. It looks like they're parked next to a gas station, judging by the lighting equipment reflected on their car.\n\nAbout an hour in, it's revealed the father from the first half has a gun... ( ! ) He's been armed for this entire time? He shoots ( shoots at? ) The Master, then for some reason, a lesbian couple is introduced in the last scene, and it appears as though the entire plot is starting again, as this pair of girls get lost, with writer/ director/ producer/ star Harold Warren standing in for Torgo.\n\nA lame joke in the closing credits reads, \" The end? \"\n\nYes, it is mercifully the end.\n\n\" Our sincere thanks to the city & county of El Paso for their cooperation \" I bet they just LOVE having their name attached to this one.\n\nI then shouted at the screen, \" What? \"\n\nIt even has 666 in its url!"

It's a tough enough task for a major Hollywood facility to do properly. Godzilla, anyone? -What provolked someone to make this story, or lack thereof, into a movie? A dare? A bar-bet? Shades of \"The Producers\" if you ask me. -Is the cast's acting style a salute to German expressionism of the 20's? Or was everyone simply fatigued from their day-jobs and lacked the energy to move at normal human speeds? -What's the deal with Torgo? Knock-knees is an affliction that is neither frightening nor sympathy inducing. If it's such a chore for him to move, as evidenced by the incredibly long sequences of him loading and un-loading luggage, shouldn't he sit down and rest those weary limbs from time to time? -Isn't that tiny two room shack a little small to be housing all that evilness?

It actually hurt my eyes to watch it! Even Plan 9 was in focus! What really made me question my sanity was the soundtrack. The bulk of the music(?) sounded like a jazz pianist and clarinet player noodling around for an hour! To this day, I have nightmares about this movie. Not because of the evil dude with the iron-on hands on his zippered, polyester costume, and not because of the skeevy, one-too-many-sessions-on-the-stairmaster Torgo. I have nightmares because it was so bad, that not even the geniuses at Best Brains could save it. It was physically painful, and should be considered by the chinese as a new form of mental torture.

The acting is done by the guy's family and friends, and it is obvious. No one here had any inkling on how to act. Second, with the exception of the mysterious Torgo, none of the characters have the least bit of... characterization. The film is blurry, shot with a camera that had no sound. And all the dubbing was done by 2 people! So when someone talks, it's hard to tell who, because all the voices sound the same and you can't tell whose lips are moving. There are points where the movie is so lost that even the keenest of spectator will have to laugh out loud at the movie. An absolute must of bad movie buffs.

His lead role of \"Michael\" was a true inspiration for many up and coming actors like Leonardo Di Caprio, Jerry Seinfeld and Mako. Tom Neyman's depiction of \"The Master\" was awe-inspiring and evil. He displayed almost a divine aura on the screen. The true gem of this film was the depiction of the quasimodo like \"Torgo\" by the unforgettable John Reynolds. Its a shame the film world loss such talent due to his unfortunate suicide in 1966."

Anyway, if it were not for the guys from MST3K I wouldn't have made it through the whole thing. I looked into why this piece of crap was even made, and I found out a lot of information that kind of made me take a second look. The film was made because Harold Warren made a bet with a friend of his that he could make a movie. The guy was a fertilizer salesman. Made and sold it apparently. He didn't really know anything about making movies. Well, he had this junky camera that had to be wound up to film. It only filmed 30 seconds of film at a time and it did not record sound. He and another guy and some woman did all the voices for the film after filming. I didn't even realize that until I read it, so I got to give props to the guy for being inventive enough and to be able to have the patients to do all that work that had to be done to make an actual story. Not a good one, but still a story. He tried to make a sequel, but for some reason was turned away about it. The sequel was written as a book, but I unfortunately do not know the title of it. For some strange reason I would like to read it just to see what else Harold had in mind for a sequel. Its like a train wreck, I shouldn't be looking but I can't look away. I just don't think a sequel to this movie would work without Torgo.\n\nYes, it is a bad movie. Yes, it has really bad acting. Yes, if you haven't seen it, get the MST3K version. Yes, if you are a fan of \"so bad it's good\" kind of movies, check it out."

They drive. And they drive. Then they drive some more. And when they're through, they drive. The highlights of this part is the thrilling \"Getting pulled over for a busted tailight scene\", and a scene of a couple out to break the Guinness Book of World Records record for longest time kissing in a car, while drinking what appears to be Coppertone suntan lotion.\n\nFinally, they come to the \"Lodge\". And now we meet the experience that is, Torgo. Torgo cannot be fully explained. He must be witnessed. But, let's try. He moves about as if he's walking on Jello. He talks in this kind of up-and-down sing song that sounds like someone is giving him a very slow wedgie, kinda like Foster Brooks, and every time anyone asks him a question, he looks like his thinking process has been permanently removed. But he does have delightful theme music, as long as you like four notes being played over and over until blood comes out of your ears.\n\nI thought the best actors were the moths that circled around the lights on every night exterior shot. The master's wives looked hideous. The scene where they're bickering while he's scowling at them is as good a testimony against poligamy as you'll find.\n\nDid anyone count how many times Maggie's (the female victim) kerchief appeared and disappeared? It was really starting to annoy me. How did you like Torgo's \"execution\"? The biddies slapped and massaged him to death, but at least he was able to walk away. He wanders out of the movie, probably looking for someone to give him a hand! (sorry).\n\nThe ending was abomidable. Bad enough we've been subjected to nearly two hours of utter disregard to our psyche, but to offer as climax the father as Torgo-lite, the mother and child (app. six years old!) as new additions to the harem is sick! Depraved. Disgusting.\n\nThe worst part is, a movie like this was once made. Such a movie can be made again. And, next time, MST3k won't be around to protect us. I must go now.

I even don't know if it's possible to find the original Manos, anyway.\n\nNevertheless, I have no doubt that this film is the worst one I have ever had the 'pleasure' to watch.\n\nBut I have to point something important: this film is an amateur film, although it was released in a theater. It's uncommon to see an amateur film get into a cinema theater. Maybe that's the reason why it's so bad. It's like a third division soccer team playing at the first division, it's like my local basketball team playing at the NBA. It's a matter of mathematics that it will go right to the bottom. There must be lots of amateur movies even worse than Manos, but they will never be shown at a theater, so they will never be known and rated. Manos is an exception, and MST3k has a lot to do with the film's immense popularity.\n\nIn a few words, I must admit that this is the worst film I have ever watched, but I also must admit that it's just an exceptional amateur movie which had a lot of luck to be picked by Joel & the Bots."

No it wasn't well made. The production values sucked. The acting (thanks most probably from the dubbing) wasn't spectacular.. But the movie was great. It imbodied the central idea of an independant film.\n\nIt showed us that even a fertilizer salesman from El Paso can make a film that gains any sort of status (in this case, cult status.)\n\nSure, Hal Warren's dead and gone, but \"Manos\" is still here, it lives on, and look at where it is now? It was on MST3K, and the main reason why any of us really know the movie exists. You can go online or to your local video retailer and pick up the MST3K version. Heck, oldies.com is selling the original version of it.\n\nWhat I think \"Manos\" really stood for was that anybody could make a movie. Hal Warren did in 1966, and it's something people still do today. Sure it's more difficult now. But look at Lloyd Kauffman and Troma entertainment. He's doing the same thing now that Warren did in '66, and people love his stuff.\n\nIf anything, that's what \"Manos\" is a good movie for... That and Torgo.

I wholeheartedly recommend watching this film, for it is not until you have seen the lower echelon of the very bottom of the barrel of filmmaking that you truly can appreciate a cinematographic work of art. If you can make it through the film (try the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version, it helps), you will never forget the experience as long as you live, and you will have a newfound appreciation for the movies at the top of the list. So, long live Manos! in the number 1 position.\n\nI Take Care Of The Place while the Master is Away,\n\nCarter"

Torgo had skills in acting, and I wont deny him anything. He made his own braces for his legs, so that he would walk funny, rather than just having huge knees. But he didnt do his own voice.\n\nThe whole film was shot silently and then redubbed. The only people that dubbed in their own voices were Mike, Margaret, The Master, and the Wives. Im sad that the actor who played the Master dropped out of sight after this was made, and very sad that Torgo killed himself(It was because of family troubles). With better camera shots, a better actress to play Margaret, destruction of the pathetic policeman scens with the teenagers,if the hands of fate actually did something perhaps, and better sound quality especially for Debbie, I would love this film much more. I find it disturbing that Manos was left unfinished(Director couldnt get funding). I imagine Torgo would have made a return to save Margaret and the rest. I give it a 6 out of 10 for some mistakes, but whos perfect?"

Even though I'm very poor with my free time and choosing what to spend it on, I couldn't resist my curiosity. I watched it, it's bad, very bad, but nowhere near the worst. I've seen a couple of thousand movies and some were quite worse than this one.\n\nBasically, the idea and the script aren't that bad at all, the problem is that it was shot totally amateurishly, with an obviously ridiculous budget and equipment, by people who barely knew what they were doing. It's as if someone without any film experience filmed a home movie for the fun of it. It could pass as the first attempt at a feature film by first-year students, but mostly it looks to me like a recording of a theatrical performance of some amateur theater. Seen from the latter perspective, it is not so catastrophically bad. I wouldn't even rule out the possibility that it was done that way on purpose, because at times it has a vibe of a misunderstood art.\n\nAll in all, \"Manos\" is a very bad movie, but it's not bad enough to deserve the cult status of the worst, nor is it bad in the way that some movies turn the game around and fall into the \"so bad it's good\" category. Any way you look at it, it's a waste of time.\n\n3/10."

(For example: Vampyros Lesbos, Samson VS.

Those guys (and puppets) took this gosh-awful film and made it one of the best gosh-awful films you MUST not miss.\n\nI never laughed so darned hard in my entire life. You can't even use the word \"bad\" for this film, that is being too kind. Whether you see it by itself (and God help you if you do) or via Mystery Science Theater 3,000 (MST3K) which I say is THE best way to view this with any redeeming qualities what-so-ever, its the pits.\n\nIt's low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low budget. If they spent more than $300.00 to make this back in 1966, I'm shocked.\n\nThe acting is horrid. The sets are horrid. The story is....what story?!??! The filming is...well if they used a five year old drawing a storyboard it would have given this film a quality.\n\nThis is a film where you grab your rowdiest friends, your loudest movie lover friends..you know the ones..order all the junk food available..partake in kegs or wine or whatever gets your party going and enjoy to your heart's content. This IS a \"only have a few good friends over for Halloween because I'm too old to go out trick or treating\" kinda film. Do NOT watch it alone. Do NOT watch it with intellectual people. This is a party film if ever one was made.\n\nYou'll laugh -- till you cry, its that bad. Rent it today via MST3K. You'll be glad you did!"

A really terrible score possibly the worst use of music in a movie ever. The way music follows Torgo around is very odd indeed.\n\nThe plot or lack of it has to make this the worst movie ever after 30 minutes in i decided to go through what had actually happened; family going on holiday, couple kissing in a car to the dissatisfaction of the police, meet Torgo, look at picture of the master, nothing really happens and when something happens it happens with no logic at all.\n\nThe script and acting also makes this film the worst ever with exceptional note on the character of Torgo (John Reynolds).\n\nI could go on but i think by now you should have got the picture of what I'm trying to put across this is th worst film ever.

I must admit, I am glad to own the film in both versions because now I have the ultimate torture device for my b-movie loving friends.

Don't forget to look at his death scene near the end where he pulls a Keyser Soze and runs off screen.\n\nThe only thing worst then the acting is the editing.

If you listen to the inane dialog you'll notice that most of the women sound alike as do most of the men probably because the film was shot without sound and dubbed later using only a few of the cast members to provide the voices. Settling in to the house it's unbelievable that anyone would consider an overnight. The place looks like it was decorated with items discarded to city dump, a horrible picture of the master with his evil dog dominates the room and the deformed caretaker should scare off anyone. The atmosphere is claustrophobic even when folks venture outside. Still morbid curiosity kept me watching. Devil worship, satanic rituals and human sacrifices and even girls wrestling in nighties round out the build up to what happens to our vacationers and to our caretaker Torgo. Unless you see this you won't believe it. The only film I can come close to comparing this with is \"The Beast of Yucca Flats\" which at least had the fairly well known Tor Johnson running around the desert as far as I can determine no one in this film ever appeared in another movie before or after this spoiled turkey.."

The film was full of oversights (how many times did Torgo 'die' before running off into the night with his sleeve on fire?), bad dubbing, worse lines, and much time-wasting to cover up the fact that nothing happened. The audience were laughing themselves silly at the stupidity of it all - even the soundtrack was funny! (not only due to the record being restarted every time it finished....) After the (admittedly BAD) ending, the audience stayed through the credits and applauded, with the biggest cheer saved for Torgo. You must see this film. \"It's shocking!\""

The acting is horrible and amateurish. Hal Warren is a terrible director even for a fertilizer salesman. It has even less camp value and lower production values than Plan 9 from Outter Space. The story behind the Manos and the making of the film would probably make a much better film. The film would certainly have toiled in obscurity if not for Mystery Science Threatre 3000. Manos is now a cult classic and landmark is cinematic Crap. Manos is likely the Worst Film of All Time. Beating out the likes of Battlefield Earth, Plan 9, and Garbage Pale Kids the Movie. The movie belongs back at #1. 1/10 Bad Stuff."

Poor camera techniques and dreadful acting are just two horrendous elements that make up \"Manos\". In my opinion, Ed Wood's Plan 9 is better made than this. Despite the sheer atrocity of this film I feel that it must be seen in order to properly enjoy a good film. I mean, how can one say a film is good without experiencing a truly bad one? When I read the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, i was very surprised that this was not in it. I feel that it is a film that must be seen, if only for 90 minutes of gut-busting enjoyment."

It's not a matter of professionalism, but of having the right resources and a handful of friends available for a whole weekend of shooting. In that respect, it's required viewing for any disillusioned person attempting to 'break through' in the industry.

I ponder the reasons any cast member other than Hal Warren agreed to take on such roles. Surely they read the script before hand. How could they ever think this film would be something somebody would want to watch. I've read that the city of El Paso held a gala premier for this awful film. Did they know nothing of the script or production? If one reads how actors in the film snuck out of the theatre at it's premiere, one must conclude that all involved in the production had blinders on during the making of the film. Was Hal Warren was such a feared tyrant of a director that no actor or crew member dare suggest a dialogue be reworked or a scene re-shot? Maybe the entire crew (including Hal Warren) thought they were making something great. I know nothing of Hal Warren besides his career selling fertilizer. I must admire the fact that Hal Warren somehow convinced a distributor to distribute this film and had the city of El Paso hype it up for him. I even heard he had other ideas. Maybe another effort behind the camera would have been much better as Hal Warren learned from the mistakes made in Manos The Hands of Fate. It would have been a great opportunity because the film presents every mistake a film maker can make.\n\nUPDATE 2009- I was in a low budget film produced in my hometown. Well, they only gave me the pages from the script that involved my scene. I did not get to see the rest and assumed the rest was a \"good movie\". I was wrong. It was a confusing collage of action scenes and dialogue. Maybe a few actors in \"Manos\" can explain away their participation as having been involved in a situation similar to mine. Also, my hometown hosted a grand premiere at the city's most elegant theater. I guess getting municipalities to give poor films shot within their city limits unworthy premieres is more common than most would think."

It's hard to follow the story when it diverts you in awkward moments from a cop harassing a couple trying to makeout on a freeway to a cult trying to assume to control the family staying.\n\nThis is a horror film but it's only cringe is of how little to no budget was given for it. It is a warning to those first time watchers that this will not scare, will not give suspense but will keep you on the edge of your seat that feeling of embarrassment."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every once in a while, there comes along a film so epically bad that any attempt to discern the possible rhyme and reason behind it (I.e. artistic ambition, greed) would be an absolute exercise in futility. There is not one single thing this film has going for it. The music seem more appropriate for a third-rate dance routine. The acting is best described as constipated. The cinematography is horrendous. The plot (a family checks into a satanic lodge and a whole bunch of nothing happens) makes no sense. The protagonists are bland and unlikable. The antagonists are hammy and impossible to take seriously. Torgo provides a few fleeting laughs but he is ultimately as repugnant as the rest of the films.\n\nTo add insult to injury, there are implications of rape, necrophilia, and pedophilia. So not only is this film bad and impossible to enjoy but it is also unpleasant and sleazy. What stoned insane masochist could find this film entertaining? This only serves as a cautionary tale of what not to when making a movie. For example, don't make a film just because you were bet into it like Hal Warren, this film's actor and supposed \"hero\", did. Ambition often exceeds actual talent.\n\nThe MST 3K version hilariously tears this film a new and makes the flaws even more apparent as if that were possible. View this version only for the sake of your time and sanity."

It looked like something I would've made with my Dad's old movie camera in junior high, but a lot worse.\n\nEven with my robot buddies and Joel, I found this extremely difficult to sit through in any kind of coherent state. I think I actually drifted out of consciousness a couple of times, crippled by this \"film's\" horridness. My sister actually managed to watch every agonizing minute, so she's made of stronger stuff than I am.\n\nTorgo and his leitmotif cracked me up (especially when reprised at the end of the MST3K version), as did the ridiculously redundant title (as pointed out by another astute viewer here). I just have flashes of this movie in my mind, like something from a surreal, horrible nightmare.\n\nAt first, I was going to say that \"Manos\" should be able to inspire anyone to make a movie, since there's a pretty darn good chance that it would be better. Then again, someone could just go out and inflict another \"Manos\" on an unsuspecting world.\n\n\"Manos\" proves that the movie camera is a weapon that can inflict real suffering on viewers and should never be used lightly! Watch this movie with extreme caution!"

Its filled with flaws you can even see the zipper on the back of one of the costumes! this movie gives me nightmares it was just so awful nightmares that the director is coming over to visit me.

It was shot without sound so all the dialogue was (badly) dubbed. The plot makes little sense and ALL the acting is terrible! There's no suspense or horror at all. Frankly it's just boring! No action either. The closest we get to something exciting is when the Master's six wives are fighting each other. Even then it's so badly staged it's laughable. It all leads to a stupid surprise ending that had me wanting to throw the TV out the window! It's incredible how this movie did everything wrong! You can safely skip this one."

Everything about it is poorly executed, acting, camera, lighting, editing, and music(a saxophone piano and drum trio!!!). Not only are they bad they transcend themselves(ei: the sax theme for Torgo). Even films like \"Beast of yucca flats\" have some professional crew people(the film is in focus, for example) Manos is a totally unique film and deserves to be at the rock bottom for as long as film are made and viewed. I know it sounds cruel but it's a compliment really. Everyone who loves bad movies should get online and keep this film right at number 1."

Is the hero, Micheal, a complete moron? Why the tour of a boring Texas landscape? What evil cult leader actually choses southern Texas as his base of operations? So many questions, so little concern.

This movie could only be improved by adding those things to it. Aside from there being no discernible plot or acting skill, the movie was physically filmed poorly. Sometimes, the frame wasn't even in focus, making it painful to watch.
