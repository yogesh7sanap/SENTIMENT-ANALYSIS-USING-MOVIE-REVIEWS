        "review_detailed_main": "TEES MAAR KHAN Bollywood is replete with examples of fetishes of film makers who closely associate these fetishes with the success of their films. The earliest example is that of film maker J Omprakash who always wanted his movie titles to begin with A; and in recent times we have the example of Karan Johar, who has a similar fetish with the letter K. Farah Khan, who began her career as a choreographer and quickly moved into the shoes of another Khan choreographer (Saroj Khan) quickly won a lot of acclaim for her work and then decided to expand her role to include film direction. Having got the box-office ringing with her first two ventures, MAIN HOON NA and OM SHANTI OM (both of which had Shah Rukh Khan playing the lead), she perhaps concluded that since both the films had three words, three is a lucky number for her. So soon after the success of the first two movies, she gave birth to triplets and her husband, an electronics engineer, Shirish Kunder and she floated a production house called Three's Company! She also perhaps knew that the presence of Shah Rukh Khan in the first two movies was a big factor for the success of those movies, but because she was not having him in her next movie (I will not go into the reasons for that here), she felt that the word KHAN appearing in the title would help. When she was finding it difficult to combine the word KHAN with her fetish for \"TEEN\" to get the title of her new movie, I presume a well-wisher perhaps told her that using a multiplication factor of ten would triple the chances of the movie's success; thus the word \"TEES\" came into the title. The choice of the third word was relatively easy, since the phrase TEES MAAR KHAN connoted a braggart and which was in tune with the character of the script itself. The next exercise was to find an inspiration for this tale and happily for her, that was also a three worded Peter Sellers starrer: AFTER THE FOX. Also, perhaps other well wishers suggested to her that she must have as many Ks as was possible in the film crew and therefore had her husband Kunder work for the background music, write(?) the story, co-produce and write some of the lyrics. The star cast also had a number of Ks: AKshay Kumar, AKshaye Khanna, Katrina Kaif, Sachin KhedeKar and special artistes like Salman Khan and Anil Kapoor! Now about the movie itself. Claiming to be a parody, it turns out to be a rather inane effort. Several scenes of the movie looked utterly pedestrian both in conception and execution and the only saving grace is the performance of Akshaye Khanna in the role of an Oscar hungry actor. Of course, the review will not be complete without the mention of the much touted Sheela Ki Jawaani number by Katrina Kaif; but Katrina with her innocent looks doesn't ooze with oomph despite the raunchy lyrics and the dance movements. I would rate Munni Badnaam from Dabangg (also choreographed by Farah) as a better song although the joke which I heard when I was coming out from the theatre was: Agar Sheela Ki Jawaani Pehle Aati, to Munni Badnaam Na Hoti!"

The script is pretty nonsensical and a stretch even by outrageous plot standards (a conman making a fake movie and convincing a big Bollywood star that it will win an Oscar? Seriously, give me a break!!) and the jokes are pretty weak all through. Tees Maar Khan, for lack of a worser word, is utter trash!"

Bollywood movies are so much disappointing me, like never before. what is happening. i am so stupid i expected a good movie from the great Farah Khan. the music already wasn't much impressive, considering Vishal Shekar's other 3 movies.\n\nStory was very much weak and completely annoying. screenplay was weak. nothing great about this movie anything. disappointing. silly bad movie."

Some of his cheeky dialogues will make you laugh but again its not worth to watch the movie.\n\nMovie has copied several scenes from various movies and Farah has tried to put all Masala in the movie for which she is famous for. But unfortunately story don't have the weight to carry this movie. Senseless jokes are not going to make a movie entertaining.\n\nDon't watch the movie. That's my verdict. Forget about previous movies of Farah Khan, they were good because of SRK and the direction tips she were getting from Karan Johar. This movie seems good only during the songs.\n\nWorst movie of 2010."

Even inside i didn't get nachos, on top of that i also did not get the sandwich inside PVR. I ignored all these bad signs and went ahead to see this AWFUL, CREEPY, MINDLESS movie.\n\nAkshay kumar once knew acting, he may know it now also but the great director Farah Khan is utilizing all her resources to bring the man (Akshay) down by using cheapest of cheapest PJ's in the movie. I wonder who write these, moreover who approves these... Once upon a time she also made a movie known as \"Main Hoon Na\" which i liked to some extent as it is a light hearted movie, but TMK is not something i expected.\n\nI still like akshay as a hero/actor, he has done so many good movies.I beg him not to do movie like these, plz plz plz.\n\nBelieve me friends you can laugh at least 100000000000 times more by just watching 1 performance of any character in Comedy Circus.( i don't know how many zeor's i added here because of frustration) Please avoid this movie to save yourself from heart attack.\n\nLast night i have vowed not to see any forthcoming Farah khan's movie unless and until i get at least 100 out of 100 good reviews.\n\nI think this is a scam by which Hindi film industry is trying to make films which ppl will leave before ending (like i got 15 minutes after the interval) and they still have to pay money for the full movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't worry I don't intend to dish out spoilers, giving away the synopsis or plot or even a hint on the story line. The movie opens with Sanjay Dutt narrating the hind sight into the protagonist's current state of affairs. I was wondering why Sanjay Dutt's voice was chosen, my roommate was kind enough to educate me on this choice. To start with Sanjay Dutt's voice is kind of synonymous with the comical negative character (read gangster, thief ...), attributed to the fame of Munna of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. The start to the movie though does not leave a bad taste in the mouth, is not what a comedy flick should begin with.\n\nThe movie lacks a theme or story line that would inherently support the intended comedy. For most part of the movie it seemed that the actors are trying in desperation to make the audience laugh. For example, a meeting of top cops of Mumbai chaired by the commissioner discusses the possibility (or a lack) of ancient treasures getting stolen. Gibberish is introduced in the form of a participant interrupting the speaker every few seconds. These puns cry for a few laughs at best, and in time become annoying.\n\nAkshay Kumar seems to have made a resolve to sink deeper with every new comedy flick; TMK adds value to that resolve. With such frivolous plot, the burden of carrying the movie rested solely on the shoulders of the actors, and they have done a fine job of letting that slip. Katrina Kaif with little or no role in the plot was intentionally brought in for her dancing prowess. I would suggest she take more dance classes before venturing this path again. Moving on to Akshaye Kanna, I'm not sure as to the link between his role and comical intent of the movie. His claim of donning a guest role in this movie is weak, he is present on screen through most of second half. This movie probably will do more damage to his acting career than fix it. The background scores and the songs are definitely not worth mentioning, half the numbers are remixes thus taking away the need for remix artists and DJs. None of the songs are worth humming, even the sticky \"Sheila ki Jawani\" with its bad hinglish lyrics. The movie sports an occasional burst of a kid shouting \"Tees Maar Khan\", ruining the few laughs for your money.\n\nTMK is bad rip from a 1966 movie \"After the fox\", which was a fun movie with character. TMK's story line is like evoking laughter by beating below the belt. The script fails to build the lead actor's character and hence does not muster any sort of harmony from the audience; it fails to evoke any kind of sympathy for the lead role as the story line jumps from comical to scary and to serious. The transitions, being abrupt keep the audience guessing the genre of the movie through its length.\n\nHalf way through the movie the story line, actors, guest actors completely lose direction and wander in different direction. Some sequences either have no bearing on the movie or lack the chaining required in storytelling. The director seems to have lost the purpose when it crosses the half way mark. Many of the obvious realities have been over looked or abandoned to make room for mindless comedy which by the ways fails to make people laugh.\n\nA few takeaways from the movie, There are many ways to make the audience laugh; this probably is the worst way. Now that the benchmark for the worst, other would only need to just do incrementally better. This movie is a must watch to expand your scales for rating movies. I have expended time and money in watching this movie, I urge you to watch this movie to make me look less gullible."

Not sure what the writer and director where thinking, but I guess they tried to mix and match or spoof movies like Austin Powers and Sholay to name a few.

Akshay Kumar seems to have gone mad or desperate being part of such lame stuff. First with her brother in Houseful and now this. Comedy isn't about obnoxiously overdone loud gestures. To make an audience laugh one needs to think. Shirish Kunder deserves a slap on the face for his effort in the 'thought' department. 'Sheila ki Jawani' is all that the movie has to offer but that can be seen at home on the television."

The story line is nowhere seen in the whole script and it makes your head feel terrible when you exit the cinema hall.

Those days the concept of troll was not well known amongst Indians and hence they took such films seriously and got offended.\n\nIf you can keep aside your critical viewing eyes like I do everytime i watch it and treat the film as a mere troll film, you will enjoy it quite a lot from moments like --> 1. Confusing Danny Boyle for Danny Danzongpa 2. Akshaye Khanna and Akshay Kumar's interactions were hilarious especially his constant assurance that he will get an Oscar and literally the Jai Ho tune starts to play 3. That milk like white guy who is told to chew a gum making him look like he is speaking constantly cracks me up.\n\nOverall, this is my personal veiw, not affected by anyone's negative review or anything. I can still watch this film a 1000 times as it is much funnier than the crap hamming like comedies that come out these days."

The so called gags are not funny at all. There is oodles of overacting by all actors and full use of clich\u00e9s. Having seen Main Hoon Na and OMO, I know that Farah Khan likes to make brainless masala movies, but TMK is beyond brainless. The entourage of Burger etc. that follow Akshay Kumar, the stuck to each other brothers who speak at the same time, the gay CBI officers - it is NOT funny.\n\nWhat does one want from TMK - slapstick comedy - None ; humor - NONE ; great acting - NONE. I don't think Akshae Khanna will take much time to pull out his newly weaved hair when he sees this movie in a multiplex.\n\nWatch this movie only for 2 reasons: 1. You want to compare it with the worst movie you have ever seen 2. To watch Shiela ki Jawani on a big screen"

I can't believe Farah Khan will deliver such a dud, after entertaining movies like 'Om Shanti Om' and 'Main Hoon Na'.\n\nI guess what people have been saying is right.. Farah cannot deliver a movie without Shah Rukh Khan. It's a relief to see that SRK is not part of this movie!! Thank you, SRK!\n\nWatch it at your own risk!"

I believe Akki must understand now that the monotonous style of comedy has been common and audience has shown the feedback on the movies 'Khatta Meetha' and 'Action Replayy'. Undoubtedly Akki is one of the most talented actors and he must not do the foolish activities. As far as Katrina is concerned, She was there in the movie for no reason but only to show the \"Jawani\" of \"Sheela\". I give this movie a poor 2 out of 10."

        "review_title": "Incoherent, garbage bag of hamming entertainment",
        "review_detailed_main": "TEES MAAR KHAN\n\nEntertainment is a tricky affair. On one hand, film makers present their conviction in an idea or story that can be moving or heart warming whereas some choose the shorter path to success by giving the audience a mindless mess of comedy that can only be short-lived. Careers have been established with the former ideology but disaster has struck when in the name of entertainment, what was served to audiences was a garbage truck full of forced humour, mindless plots, overacting and trashy dialogues. That has happened far too often lately. In retrospect, 'Main Hoon Na' was at least sincere with its story and performances. The actors, music and comedy combined to produce a refreshing entertainer. 'Om Shanti Om', at least the first half, was funny, musical and refreshing as well. However, while riding on the success and fame of two somewhat convincing successes, one does not gain the right to take the audience on a ride. Farah Khan has done just that and brought the audience down to her own level with 'Tees Maar Khan'.\n\nA supposed con-artist named 'Tees Maar Khan', along with his aides \u2013 Dollar, Soda & Burger is out to execute their greatest job so far: Looting the royal treasure from a running train with the help of villagers who have been beguiled into believing that it's all part of a movie being filmed. Get the point? Right from the beginning, nothing seems convincing at all. Akshay Kumar lauding his character with a multitude of dialogues indicating that 'capturing him is pointless' has no effect. DON says something similar but with lasting effect. It's because of something called 'direction' which is missing from this movie. The greatest Con- artist who fools Indian Police and the Interpol is so unconvincing that one would wish he would take up another job. Akshay Kumar overacts his way through a character that has no life, background or foreground. Numerous flops in the last 2 years still has him playing the repetitive roles in brainless flicks. Hopefully, 'Patiala House' can change things for him. Akshaye Khanna. What can one say for him. The Oscar hungry character of Atish Kapoor is funny at first but when he hams through every incoherent scene, it becomes an overkill of the once wonderful actor from 'Dil Chahta Hai' who was unforgettable as Sid. Some of the supporting cast that includes Arya Babbar, Sachin Khedekar, Murali Sharma and Apara Mehta have done better justice to their roles than even the lead actors. The only reason why people will knowingly spend money on this movie is because they were lured by Sheila Ki Jawani. That song is worthy of its hype. Rather, Katrina Kaif is worthy of her position in Bollywood right now. Her moves, classy attitude and to-die-for looks in the 'item number' will thoroughly entertain and Farah Khan has done her primary job of choreography quite well. We only wish for Katrina's versatility to be challenged as she was in 'Raajneeti'.\n\nVishal & Shekhar will only ride on the success of Sheila and nothing else. Compared to Farah's previous two, this film's score is a dud. Even Salman Khan's cameo cannot save the mediocrity of Wallah re Wallah.\n\nThe editor in the film must surely be the security guy outside Dhuliya bank since he was asleep all the time. The dialogue writer churned out only a handful of witty one liners before they too were lost in between the hamming, overacting, repetition and senseless situations. The key to successful comedies of late, has been in dialogues as one cannot really create funny scenes without a screenplay in existence. Cinematography was very average and this film lacks the big budget feel if at all it had one. In case it did, UTV will have to rethink Farah Khan's calibre as a director they can invest in.\n\nFarah Khan literally showcases her stupidity on multiple occasions. Take the airplane scene for instance where it all seems so over-the-top. The prolonging of the train's arrival in Dhuliya prepares you for the worst. The headless horse rider sequence was among the most incoherent of all, while the in-film director Tees Maar Khan's clueless behavior on the film's set must be an enactment of Farah Khan in reality. Finally when the train is stopped and the heist ensues, it all seems tragic as there was nothing funny, glorious or memorable about the basic premise of the 3 hour ordeal. The actors too, look weary of the proceedings in the end and one cannot help but dread Farah's intention of making a sequel to this time-wasting garbage of nonsense.\n\n5.23 on a scale of 1-10."

Then I heard that SRK and Farah Khan had fallen out with each other and that Akshay Kumar was in along with Katrina Keif.\n\nWritten by Farah Khan's husband, Shirish Kunder, the theme of the movie is based on an old Peter Sellers movie, \"After the Fox.\" A thief gets his chance to plan to rob a train and he does this by hiring a actor and a movie shoot in a village nearby.\n\nStarring Akshay Kumar, Katrina Keif, Anil Kapoor, Akshaye Khanna and Arya Babbar, the movie is directed by Farah Khan, written and Produced by Shrish Kunder and Ronnie Screwala. Vishal Shekhar provide the music score.\n\nFarah Khan has had a previous \"flop\" on her hands - \"Janemaan,\" though it was not directed by her but by Shirish Kunder. That movie did not star Shah Rukh Khan either but the other two, \"Mein Hoon Na\" and \"Om Shanti Om\" did and proved to be successful for her, though the latter did have some problems.\n\nKatrina Keif, though has lost a lot of weight and ensured that her style of dancing could be compared that of Malaika Arora Khan in \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" compared to \"Munni Badnaam Hui.\" Serious roles, such as the one in \"New York,\" suit her better then the one she plays in this one.\n\nAkshay Kumar, perhaps needs to consider doing serious roles than this. Certain types of comic roles do suit him and he does execute them very well. But unfortunately, this cannot be said here.\n\nThe music! Well the only thing that can be said is that at least one song - \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" is a memorable number, though it has come under a lot of criticism since the release of the movie. One other member of the industry that Farah Khan had always had but didn't this time was the music director, Anu Malik.\n\nThe plot fails to lift off, the comic lines and the dialogues could have been written well and its with this that I conclude that this was a movie that was riddled with disaster from the moment it was announced."

The Oscar isn't even that great an award.\n\nYou need to watch this movie with family or a bunch of friends who have some exposure to Bollywood movies.

At lease I liked Om Shanti Om not because of SRK but for the making of the film.\n\nAkshay Khanna: tried his best Story: Nothing Dialogues and Punches: Golmaal-3 also did not have any story but it had a good number of gigs and punches which make that movie such hit. But this movie does not have anything like that. The only interesting dialogues you can get which you already got from the trailers.\n\nMusic: Not so good.\n\nChoreography: Not so good.\n\nThose who are thinking of watching the movie be warned. It is better to spend the money anywhere else."

Well I am not that disappointed cuz I never expected much, but I know there are lot of fans who were thinking of spending a fun filled 2 hours in a holiday season with friends or family. For those, the movie is a huge letdown. Sorry guys !\n\nMay be farah was considering audience first and critics later but she lost both of'em. Audience are as disappointed as the critics. All the hypes created around 'Sheila Ki Jawani' could not safeguard the movie.\n\nAnd for Katrina, Wow! she has luks, she has moves, she has everything excepting the most important of all - ACTING. :(. The only thing that was still fine was the akshay khanna's role . Otherwise the movie was full of overacting, stupidity and dumb jokes. And the last thing, I m a big fan of Raghu (Roadies) but farah made him look like a joker in the movie. Please please give him some serious villain role and he'll do awesome, I know. :)"

The only appeal in the movie is Akshay Kumar (lead actor) who is known for his excellent comic skills and brilliant dialogue delivery to make even a dead body laugh... BUT he fails with a Rock Bottom. Movie is not only loose but have extremely bad jokes. Even a 5 year old can come up with better jokes. Heres an Example: Mohan Night Samalan (also know as M Night Samalan), the director of Sixth Sense... His middle name is night because he was born at night... also, explains why he is dark in color (because he was born at night). Farah Khan as a director has slapped bollywood across the face and made all Indians around the world humiliate. Took my Mexican friends (who are big fans of bollywood movies) and kept laugh all through the movie... NOT because it was funny but because it was so bad. The end credit shows all the film crew (like director, producer, story and screenplay writers, costume designers,etc) accepting Oscar Awards. I think they expect this movie to win awards. Here it is... WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES !!!\n\nPlease don't get me wrong. I am not giving a bad review because i hate the movie but because its a very bad movie. Though i wanna say one good thing before i end this review. The only worth watching few minutes of the movie are during the song SHEILA KI JAWANI. Song is Awesome and Katrina Kaif is Gorgeous. Unfortunately, the song is at the beginning of the movie and from their movie is a landslide to hell.\n\nI wish i could give those $10 to Charity so some kid could buy his/her books and pencils."

IN OTHER WORDS THE MOVIE IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. INSTEAD GO FOR ANY PRIYADARSHAN MOVIE OR EVEN \"NO PROBLEM\" WILL ALSO DO. \"MUNNI SET BADNAAM HOGAYI\" BUT \"SHIELA KI JAWANI NA BADNAM HUII AUR NA MUNNI KO TAKKAR MARII\" AS I MIGHT ADD AGAIN: \" TEES MAAR KHAN NA DABANNG HAI AUR HAR PROBLEM KA SHIKAAR HAI\".

One star is to the song SHEILA KI JAWANI(although it is awesome to watch but sadly it lasts for only 4 minutes or so) and the another star to Akshaye Khanna and Akshaye Kumar(yes, both deserve half-a-star).\n\nIt revolves around one con artist (Akshaye Kumar) who can never be kept in prison and whatever the circumstances he manages to escape every time. He gets a contract to commit a heist of Indian antiques by two brothers who are connected physically(Raghu and Rajiv)and he accomplishes it with the help of residents of a village and an actor aspiring to get an Oscar(Akshaye Khanna) in the most ridiculous manner. Then TMK is double-crossed by his bosses and he overcomes it to a HAPPY ENDING.\n\nThis movie revolves around a heist which is supposed to take place from an unstoppable train. But the biggest irony is that the train stops in just 10 seconds and the robbery thing is just plain rubbish. Akshaye Kumar has just stuck to the same expressions and behavior since last year or so and it is not funny anymore. Akshaye Khanna as an Oscar-crazy actor is over-the-top but induces laughter in some scenes. And now, Katrina Kaif. The only reason i suppose she did this movie is to show her toned body. The song Sheila arrives quite early in the movie, and after that all Katrina Kaif does is show some skin and tries to act like a bimbo. And oh yes, she also does a Marilyn Monroe.\n\nThere are so many more absurdities that it is impossible to point out why i disliked it. Please try to avoid this one or you are going to regret watching this nonsense."

If you are looking for fun, time-pass entertainment than you will certainly enjoy Tees Maar Khan!\n\nThis movie is SUPPOSED to be dumb. That is what makes it brilliant. The silly puns and obvious jokes... they're supposed to make you roll your eyes and laugh while thinking 'Oh my God, did they just really say that?' Each character is larger than life, from the \"blonde\" bimbo Anya (Katrina Kaif) to the suave, catch-phrase using, wanna-be \"Don\" Tabrez Mirza Khan (Akshay Kumar). The plot is your average story of a conman attempting the heist of his life. The clich\u00e9s are what make this movie great... I guess some people just don't get that. Those people need to stop taking themselves so seriously.\n\nAm I perhaps giving Farah Khan too much credit for creating a brilliant satire when really it is just a poorly made comedy? Maybe. But even if that is true you will find moments where you can laugh, even if you're doing it while thinking WTF?\n\nI do agree that Akshay's brand of humor and Farah Khan's style do not mix too well. I think both are fantastic at what they do, but in this movie their skills clash and are ultimately compromised. It was painfully obvious at points that this movie was made for Shahrukh Khan in a sort of slapstick version of his \"Don\" flick. If only he had not gotten into a fight with the director...\n\nThe best performance by far was that of Akshaye Khanna as the Oscar-obsessed superstar trying to give his ultimate performance. The exaggerated intensity and self-importance with which he performs every scene is hilarious. Even the long, flowing \"hero\" looking hairdo was spot on.\n\nNo, it's probably not the kind of movie you would watch again unless it came on TV, but if you need some Bollywood over the holidays just go see it. Don't think about it too much. In fact, think of it as a mental break. If nothing at all, go and enjoy the songs! Vishal and Shehkar do it again with \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" and \"Wallah Re Wallah.\" The beats are awesome and Katrina Kaif is sizzling."

His journey from the moment go, is an insult to the word 'logic'.\n\nShirish Kunder and Ashmith Kunder's Screenplay is full of loopholes. Sure, the film begins ably and the first hour somehow manages to hold your attention. But, the second hour goes for a complete toss. The jokes fall flat, and the culmination also doesn't leave any sort of an impact.\n\nFarah Khan's previous films, 'Main Hoon Na' and 'Om Shanti Om', were genuinely entertaining films, but 'Tees Maar Khan' isn't half of the entertainer one expects it to be. Her direction is hen-picked, due to the weak screenplay.\n\nThe soundtrack, as well as the background, both are good. Acting wise, Akshay Kumar as 'Tees Maar Khan' is effective. Katrina Kaif doesn't get much scope, but she still manages to make her presence felt. Akshaye Khanna, however, is the real surprise packet. He is truly outstanding as an Oscar-Hungry Film Star. Sudhir Pandey is superb! Arya Babbar registers an impact. Salman Khan, Chunkey Pandey and Anil Kapoor appear in brief cameos.\n\nOn the whole, A Half-Baked Entertainer, that fails to live up to it's gargantuan expectations. Watch it, but only if you must!"

Tees Maar Khan is a victim of it. It's far worse than any of the old comedies.\n\nWithout insulting any actor particularly, I would say all of them were poorly written. They were caricatures, they were overly dramatic, they were very unlikable and acting was over the top.\n\nBut does it deserve to be in the bottom. I don't know but I have seen movies far worse than this. Humshakals, Race 2 ,Judwaa 2 to name a few. Infact, most of the Punjabi comedy films are worse than this. Also, RGV ki aag, Himmatwala, Humshakals have ratings well below 2.0 but still not part of this list (they used to be, earlier) .\n\nDefinitely not the worst I have watched. Also, that overrated Main Hoon Na is just as bad. It's not even Farah Khan's worst. As for Akshay Kumar, he has Joker, Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi, Sabse bada khiladi in his kitty. These films deserve to be in bottom 100, 250 or whatever, before Tees Maar Khan."

You betcha!\n\nInstead of recounting the plot of this film all about the master thief, Tees Maar Khan, I'll point out why I eventually turned off the film before it was so incredibly annoying. The acting was among the worst, if not the worst, I've ever seen...and I've reviewed nearly 22,000 films on IMDB. Almost all the actors seemed amateurish and childish....with lots of caricatures instead of folks who were believable. Heck, the folks in \"Airplane!\" seemed much more real and well acted compared to \"Tees Maar Khan\". Add to that the most hellishly annoying theme song in history, a horrible opening which included a terribly rendered CGI baby and the character 'Jagtap' and you have a recipe for career suicide....and I can only assume director Farah Khan was tired of making films and he made this one to permanently derail his career! A chimp would have done a much better job than Farah...and the acting could only have been more subtle had they gotten the chimp!! It's a pretty looking film...but one that constantly annoys the viewer and makes you wonder WHY...why make a film that deliberately provokes the audience to turn off the film and find something better to do...and ANYTHING would be better!! Sticking toothpicks in your eyes would be better than having to watch \"Tees Maar Khan\" and shoving flaming spears into my ears would be better than having to hear that godawful theme song one more time!

The chemistry between Katrina and him is clearly evident in the songs, and his character along with his side-kicks do manage to entertain in pieces. Intelligent one liners , few of them, and in first half primarily... Better go with your better half !!! The story is not very strong, but the screenplay comes alive with our beloved Akki's delivery and his body communications. Raghu and Rajiv add a bit of a flavor to it, but then even that wears off after some time. Definitely not the best works of Farah, good surprising guest appearances and a lot of intended spoof of almost entire bollywood helps you curve your lips every now and then. All in all, the movie definitely could have been better, Katrina does rock you early on with her 'Jawaani'. I, particularly enjoyed her performances in all the songs(seemed as if that was her entire camera exposure in the movie) One time watch probably..."

        "review_detailed_main": "After having read negative reviews about this movie and seeing it in the bottom 100 list on IMDb, I decided to try out this movie. Obviously, it wasn't worth spending even a single cent on a movie that has Akshay Kumar as the main lead and is trashed universally. I was lucky enough to be able to borrow this movie from the public library.\n\nThe movie sets its low standards right from the opening credits - a dancing foetus in scenes that are just a rip-off from opening credits of Bond movies. The movie just keeps trying to fathom the abyss of movie making and never tries to redeem itself. Reminds me of what late Roger Ebert wrote about \"Freddy Got Fingered\" - \"This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.\" There is nothing in this movie that is worth mentioning - because this movie lacks anything that has semblance to the art of movie making - acting / story / direction / dialogues. This movie does not even fall in the category \"so bad it is good\". The movie is just based on the recent Bollywood premise that if you hire popular actors, spend money on promotion and promote it as a \"brainless entertainer\", there is a certain demographic that will flock to theatre to spend their (or their parent's) hard earned money. It is just like flipping a coin - some movies end as winners, some end being losers. Equally disappointing is the fact that movies that were released after \"Tees Maar Khan\" have followed this formula and have earned big bucks.\n\nI do not have any admiration for Akshay Kumar's acting skills since I saw \"Deedar\" in theatres 20 years ago. And after 20 years, his wooden face and expressions haven't changed a bit. To expect any acting from Katrina would be akin to expect that mortal can create miracles and cure human beings. But what is painful is to see talented actors like Anjan Shrivastav, Sudhir Pandey or Apara Mehta in roles that are an insult to their acting talents. And somehwere along the lines I have a suspicion that this movie, although credits Farah Khan as director, is ghost directed by her hubby, Shirish Kunder (who has four or five other credits to his name in this movie). Farah has done a decent job in \"Om Shanti Om\".\n\nI have given one star only because a)IMDb does not allow negative star ranking b) you can see Farah's choreography skills in the \"Sheela\" song."

Farah Khan's direction, combined with Akshay Kumar's magnetic performance as the notorious conman, Tabrez Mirza Khan, crafted an experience that resonates more deeply with today's audience.\n\nThe film's humor, vibrant songs, and audacious plot twists have aged like fine wine, and what once felt excessive now feels refreshingly bold. Katrina Kaif's iconic \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" and Akshaye Khanna's hilarious portrayal of the self-obsessed Bollywood star, Lord Aatish Kapoor, who dreams of winning an Oscar, are performances that have only grown more endearing with time.\n\nThe over-the-top performances add a layer of hilarity that elevates the film, making every scene a laugh riot. The silliness of the jokes and the absurdity of the situations create a comedic goldmine that keeps delivering laughs no matter how many times you watch it. \"Tees Maar Khan\" was misunderstood in its era but has since carved out a special place in the hearts of many, proving that sometimes, it takes a few years for a masterpiece to be truly appreciated.\n\nP. S. - Farah you are a genius, I genuinely live watching this movie atleast once every 6 months. Please ask Netflix to add it back to their library \ud83d\ude4f"

The funniest part is that the movie fails to tickle in all those areas where it was supposed to. All scenes featuring Akshay Kumar alone are unbearably boring. His timing and use of subtle symbolic devices to create humour was conspicuously absent . The story wasn't written, it was scribbled on a discarded Platform Ticket by an uninterested imbecile. The screenplay is a disaster. Even the potentially funny situations were converted into dreadfully un-funny scenes .\n\nThe movie however redeems itself through the herculean comic effort by Akhshay Khanna, a man virtually ignored if not boycotted during the movie's promotion. His performance is quite good and adds life to the dead script. He delivers the payload when required. His gestures, actions, diction is immaculate. The only character who actually plays the character he he was assigned with intensity and conviction. Cameos by Raghu Ram (ok they are two individuals) also help the viewers to stop looking at the price tags on their tickets. A movie which may tickle when viewed again in parts, but which surely shouldn't have been made with any star cast."

Akshay Kumar is a very talented actor, but he doesn't seem to do himself justice these days and wastes his talent doing movies like this. The less said about Katrina's performance,the better. Actors in supporting roles do their bit fine. Granted, this film had the third biggest opening weekend after Dabangg and 3 Idiots, but that was because of all the hype. Trust me, it doesn't live up to it at all. The music is, I suppose, OK.\n\nVerdict: it is acceptable to watch it only if you have free time in abundance. I give it 3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Almost all of us are ruing about the fact that we had gone to watch TMK with a lot of expectations after all the hype and anticipation surrounding Farah Khan's latest third movie. The problem is that Farah Khan took it for granted that what most viewer's look for in a movie is a great star cast, nicely choreographed songs and a comic like story. All of these were also widely used to great success in her earlier movies which was done sensibly around a visible story. But the problem with TMK is that it does not tell anything that the viewer can relate to and like other Farah Khan movies she adds an artificial humor to it only excessively this time. Her earlier movie characters had some true to life feel although there were unusual things happening to them but their reactions seemed real. Like SRK's emotions in Om Shanti Om when he enacts receiving an award or when he first meets his dream girl. Here Akshay Kumar plays the role of a big-time crook or con-man but his con jobs seem completely unreal and so does the way his character acts through it. There's absolutely no sense in watching someone with a brain of a monkey do feats of a rocket scientist. It's as if there was already a movie with the same concept that was made with a serious tone and Farah is trying to make a spoof out of it. The viewers don't have a clue as to what she intends to make fun of as the spoof is on an original movie that doesn't exist or no one watched.\n\nWhile no one expects real acting in a spoof, the role of an actor of Akshay Kumar's caliber is required to have some substance to it. It would have been perhaps better suited to cast some unknown or small time comedian in this completely silly role than to waste Akshay Kumar's skills and star image. Also instead of dressing up this mess with senseless scenes and songs Farah Khan should have made an effort to make the characters look real and get some sensible acting out of her cast particularly Katrina who will only be noticed for the item song. The viewer's watch comic movies to forget their worries but they're not stupid. So Farah Khan should sit down with those who write the story before deciding how to make a comedy scene than the other way round. Also the gay concept is getting kind of old but she seems to still live in the last decade. This is certainly not a good way to end a decade in Bollywood!!\n\nIts the viewers who pay the price of a ticket and they are the ones who decide if a movie is really worthy of appreciation. Patting oneself on the back and creating fake hype is just a way to cheat and insult the earnest viewers who unknowingly fall in the trap of watching these duds. A over hyped movie like this is nothing but a bad elaborate joke on the intelligence of those who spent their money on buying the tickets. But right now no one is laughing."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched the movie while vacationing in India with 5 others between the ages of 21-28 (three men, two women, and I was the only NRI). Each of us thoroughly enjoyed the movie, laughing from beginning to end. We were joking about the movie days after watching it. On our recommendation, our uncles and aunts watched TMK, and they returned with the complete opposite view -- like many of the reviewers on this site, they hated it. Immediately it occurred to me that this might be a result of a generation gap, or an open-mindedness gap.\n\nThis movie shares many similarities with Austin Powers or Anchorman or any other \"absurdly\" funny movie you're familiar with (note: I hate most Bollywood \"comedies,\" so I bring up Western titles. I loved 3 Idiots but it's a different type of comedy.) Yes, the storyline is unrealistic, but that enhances the comedic value of the movie -- it's not supposed to be serious. Yes, Akshay Kumar \"overacts,\" but that's his character and he plays that role exceedingly well. Yes, the jokes sometimes lack depth, but the movie is replete with memorable one-liners.\n\nI'm dumbfounded as to why people hated the movie so much. At the risk of sounding insulting to others, my only explanation is that many of the reviewers were simply not ready for such a film. It does feature several homosexual characters, but most younger generation Indians, I'm guessing, can roll with that. Maybe it takes a certain level of experience with absurdity or sarcasm that maybe the younger folks are more experienced with (I apologize about the \"maybes\" but I'm trying my best to provide possible explanations as to why so many people disliked this movie).\n\nI urge you not to write this movie off. Watch the trailer on this site -- if you find yourself chuckling at some of these scenes, then I guarantee you will find yourself cracking up at the movies. Like myself, you may even buy the DVD and put it in your comedy collection (next to your Friday and Big Lebowski)."

The last few bits had me in tears from laughing so hard. While some may not agree, The funny parts of the movie made up for most of the horrible and unnecessary parts. The acting did not seem to bother me too much. The songs were not too bad and the actor choice was pretty good. Over all this movie was not too bad like most people say. Taking all the positives and negatives from the movie, It deserves a 5. Honestly, I don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie though it was a decent release."

Rather it falls flat . As the promos and the preview suggest , th story is about Tabrez Mirza Khan aka Tees Maar Khan. A con artist ,a thief who is capable enough to open any lock , in any place of the world, let that be on a flying plane or a running train. the story revolves around how he undertakes a job to rob a running train containing 10,000 kilograms , worth antiques.\n\nwell , routed to be as one of the biggest hits of 2010, TMK turns out to be one of the biggest flops of the year joining Ravaan and Kites.With silly one liners and awful con tricks TMk is one of the worst con movies i have ever seen till date. With a little or no use of the acting skills of Katrina Kaif and Akshaye Khanna , Farah Khan wastes them totally.the only interesting part of the movie is the song Sheila Ki Jawani that might drag the audiences to the theaters but if you take my opinion friends don't go for it if you have no intentions of wasting your money and time on one of the awfully scripted,directed movies of all time.i would rather call it as FARAH KHAN KI AAG rather than Tees Maar Khan it worst than Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag."

Between the shoddy acting, annoying songs that come at the worst times (save for Sheila Ki Jawani), and lack of a narrative, Farah Khan truly disappoints in a way that no other director can.\n\nThe songs are absolutely terrible in this movie. The main characters will be tricking an entire village full of idiotic dimwits and buffoons, and cut to a song.\n\nIf you haven't heard the title song, you cannot say you know what the word \"annoying\" means. As for the ever so hyped Sheila (which is done within the first twenty minutes of the movie), we get introduced to Katrina Kaif's character and never see her again except for a few ditsy lines here and there.\n\nDon't get me started on the so called humour. The worst screenwriter of the year goes to Shirish Kunder. Housefull (2010) is intelligent compared to this garbage crap.\n\nAs for the two male leads - the less said the better. Akshaye Khanna's career has reached an all time low (we're talking lower than the Marianna's Trench). As for Akshay Kumar, this movie really took a toll on his career.\n\nFinally, the worst director of the decade award goes to none other than Farah Khan. The same director who brought you the excellent \"Om Shanti Om\" is now duping innocent moviegoers into wasting their money and time."

I loved Akshay's rendition of Tabrez Mirza Khan aka Tees Maar Khan's character. In fact, even Kat was lovable in her dumb belle avatar. Sheela Ki Jawani impressed and so did the song with Sallu in it. You could see the chemistry between Sallu n Kat in the song. I even liked Akshay Khanna in it!

I can't sit through a full Bollywood Movie at any given time without being bored out of my mind. But Tees Maar Khan occupied every single minute of my time and I honestly thought the movie was only an hour and a half.\n\nIt was the overacting that made this movie simply beautiful.

The action & acting of each actors is amazingly done the music is excellent except the song \"Happy Ending\" is not that good but the rest is amazing my favorite choices are: \"Wallah Re Wallah\", \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" & \"Badey Dilwala\". My recommendation is go out watch this movie in the theaters forget about stress and pressure of school/work, trust me you will have an amazing time. Akshay Kumar & Katrina Kaif couple is yet successful again after the successful hits: \"Namastey London\" & \"Welcome\".\n\nMusic Rating: 8/10 Movie Rating: 10/10 Acting Rating: 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Western watcher here and no nothing of Indian cinema. Typical musical comedy. Great songs and choreography mixed with silly gags and running jokes held together with a paper thin plot. Very traditional in a hollywood 40s-50s POV. Lots of fun. Watched several times. Sad no longer available. The girl is very easy on the eyes, the action hero lead is done with a great comedic touch. Two closeted gay cops are pretty funny as well. Worst part is the beginning where they try to set up a backstory that is pretty weak. But it gives us an escape to start with and the chase is on from there. If it ever comes back into distribution will definitely give it another go."
