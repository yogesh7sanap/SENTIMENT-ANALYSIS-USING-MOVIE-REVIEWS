It was hilarious, and yes, silly hilarious. Yet I know that it would not have been so entertaining if it weren't for the brilliant actors (Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar were amazing) and pretty good songs. Anyways, it would take a lot of talent to explain the plot to anyone because it's one of those chaotic slapstick comedies that you just have to check out for yourself, and only watch once. But in a nutshell, it is about this really decent man (Paresh Rawal tearing it up as the timid doctor) that would like his decent nephew, Rajiv (Akshay Kumar) to get married. Now comes in the hot Katrina Keif (who cares what her name was?) who, after a medley of hilarious situations, falls in love with Rajiv. There's only one problem with this, her brothers are big shots in the underworld\u0085and are not very modest. \"Welcome\" is welcoming if you allow yourself to be invited. Don't go watching it with expectations that it will be the cleverest and most sophisticated movie you will see\u0085and when it's not, don't restrict yourself from laughing away to glory"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Welcome\" is a enjoyable, masala comedy with an amusing cast. It has plenty of ridiculously unbelievable, cheesy moments and the film requires viewers who don't take themselves or the movie too seriously, and who know how to suspend their disbelief. Unfortunately, there are plenty of people who are unable to take the movie in the spirit it was made. Is it full of buffoons and a silly plot? Of course! But what makes this movie so charming is that - like plenty of other Bollywood films - it tells its story with such sincere, earnest conviction that you can't help but get sucked in.\n\nThe story is centered on a mafia family headed by two dons, played by the unfailingly charismatic Feroz Khan and the gifted Nana Patekar. Nana Patekar is trying to find a boy from a nice, decent family to marry his sister, played by Katrina Kaif (surprisingly, she is tolerable in this film). Aiding the don in his quest to find a suitable boy is one of Nana Patekar's lesser dons, played by Anil Kapoor. When they find a suitable boy (Akshay Kumar), things are complicated by the suitable boy's uncle (Paresh Rawal), who is not terribly excited about his nephew marrying into the mafia. And from this tangled web of conflicting goals ensues chaos and mayhem. Mallika Sherawat is also entertaining (if extremely confusing) as a random girl who is...confusing people.\n\nIt's a silly movie full of childish, mischievous comedy and feel-good moments, but I think that, in the end, that's what we value about Bollywood films: their family-friendly messages, the dazzling spectacle in scene after scene, fun filled madness and a talented cast. Nana Patekar and Paresh Rawal were especially impressive and quite adorable. It was amusing to see Akshay Kumar play a clueless good guy after being so used to seeing him as an action hero.\n\nThe only way to enjoy this movie is to throw brains and common sense out the window and enjoy it for what it is - a family-friendly comedy with lots of laughs and entertainment. It's a question of expectations. If you get this movie expecting to see something similar to a Hollywood film, then you will disappointed. Bollywood isn't anything like Hollywood, and there is nothing wrong with that. I didn't get this DVD expecting to see an Indian version of The Godfather. There are plenty of funny references to The Godfather in this movie, but the director clearly intends to parody the world and lifestyle of a mafia don, and I think he did a good job. It's a happy story that laughs at itself at every turn, and that's great."

All the characters, oh my god, they are so strong, perfect and so solid and humorous. I've never seen so loving Villains ever before, yes they are villains but you would love them. Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar, Akshay Kumar, Paresh Sir, and allllll others of them, ten ti twelve more have done a tremendous job , nothing better could have ever been expected. I love love love this movie more than any. This is my favorite comedy movie in the history of Bollywood."

So this movie is an honest transaction with no claims to art. For the millions who want what it offers, they can go without fear they will regret it. To me, the thing I liked best was the female cast. It is rare for a movie to bring together such an eyeful. I was sold by the trailers that showed Malaika, Katrina, and Mallika. And the movie delivered.\n\nOne comparison I'll make is with Kyon Ki and Garam Masala. When I watched those movie there were many moments when I was stopped by \"what in the world were they thinking?\" By contrast, I didn't really have those moments in Welcome. Also, Anil, Nana, and Feroze really added to the comedy. All three of them are solid performers. In fact, I'd say Malaika, Katrina, Mallika, Anil, Nana, and Feroze were the best things I found in the movie. No wonder it rang up such high sales."

        "review_detailed_main": "Welcome takes bollywood's modern movies to a new level. Anees Bazmee comes up with a very well directed comedy unlike his previous and 1 or 2 next ones as well. It is a mixture of a little senseless comedy, great situational comedy and even some intelligent comedy.\n\nThe movie really builds on its very one-line story. This is because of its characters and the performances of the actors. Nana Patekar has really not given as much to comedy film as he could have given. As Uday Shetty, in his very own style, his expressions and involvement are a toast to watch. He sort of does what I feel Paresh Rawal did in the all-time-great Hera Pheri (Though, he was not as hilarious as Babu Bhaiyya). But I really loved his character. Equally good is Anil Kapoor who himself gives his best ever performance in a comedy movie. Majnoo Bhai is so caring, innocent, dangerous. There is so much liveliness and the \"taporiness\" in him that whenever he is on screen, you are bound to laugh.\n\nRest of the cast is more supporting to these two. Akshay Kumar very rightly gets a supporting comedy role at which he's very good. He takes care of his comedy and romance scenes well since he doesn't have the burden to run this comedy movie all alone. Katrina Kaif comes up with a good performance which is really charming. She really became comfortable with the guidance of many veteran actors. Paresh Rawal gets a chance to show that he knows the art of comedy even in a different style. Dr. Ghoongroo does give you the laughs in his not very much screen time. Then there also is Feroz Khan who comes and gives a direction to a movie and really holds it till the end. The only problem with this other cast is they make you smile but not really laugh. Else, Sherveer Vakil, Mallika Sheravat, are good.\n\nLastly, to generate more, this movie finds a place in an ever welcoming story that could get many more characters. Other actors like Asrani, Mahesh Mishra and all the little goons, the film-making crew are all enjoyable and have the punches. These people have some punches delivered very well.\n\nIt is a treat to watch a bollywood movie with such a good level of situational comedy and the sort of creation of comedy (Uday's horses and onions). I may be crazy in watching this movie more than 10 times but every time it makes me laugh. You just need the right sense to see it.\n\nSee this movie for its performances and the comedy that really comes out of nowhere. The lack of story never really becomes a problem, he only real problem in this movie was the music in which \"Hoonth Rasiley\" was bad while the others okay and one like \"Kiya Kiya\" fairly decent.\n\nWELCOME is a treat to watch. You will come out of the theater saying that it was a very good movie but only if some of the scenes were given a try to be made hilarious, it could have been much much better. (the one rating missing due to that)."

A lot of the time some situations don't make sense at all. Problems are created and if you think about it are no problem at all. This is done on purpose, purely to entertain. So someone saying that this movie isn't realistic is missing the point. The actors know that the story has to be taken lightly. The structure of the movie can be confusing. But that can be blamed on the director. From what I understand that this is his first project. But I must say for that he did quite OK. Even when the direction could have been better the actors do make up for that fact. Overall this is a nice little comedy that will grow on you and is purely fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "The latest in the inspired comedy series is this laugh riot which is full of stars. The basic plot is inspired from the Hugh Grant movie \"Mickey Blue Eyes\" (1999). Even the hero's profession is kept same as an art house auctioneer. But then the script takes on indianized plots and tries to make you laugh through comic sequences. No doubt the promotional packaging was superb which surely gave the movie a big initial draw at the cinema houses. But the content is rather not impressive and its like several comedy sequences joined together. The focus of the screenplay keeps shifting from one plot to another. The biggest disappointment is that it has less of Akshay and the viewer keeps waiting for the scenes with his brilliant timing. There is more of Anil Kapoor & Nana Patekar as two dons. Nana is kind of same with his expected mannerisms but Anil is superb and acts like he is enjoying every minute of his act. He even looks a lot younger than his age. Feroz Khan looks graceful but is loud at some scenes. He has more scenes in the climax of the movie and is also introduced after the interval. The heroines are only there for the glamour quotient of the movie and could not ask for more in this heavy star cast movie.\n\nThe first half of the movie has many unwanted sequences which are only inserted to create laughter and have nothing to do with the screenplay. But the film gains momentum in the second half when Vijay Raaz enters as a phony film director. In fact in my opinion this plot of making Nana an actor in a fake film should have been the highlight of the movie, which could create more laughter's in the cinema.\n\nThe songs are all inserted as usual and only few are hummable. The best part of the movie comes towards the climax after Katrina accidentally shoots the son of Feroz Khan. The chase and the play with the dead body afterwards is surely hilarious. It is the main highlight of the movie as you get to see some quality comedy scenes and timing in this. In all the film is not as expected but still will brings audiences to the cinemas due to the superb promotional packaging, immensely popular catchy title song \"Welcome\" and due to the current hot thing in Bollywood \u2013 Akshay Kumar."

There is hardly any 10 min stretch in the movie that won't make you laugh or admire the creativity and sarcasm of the writer/director. The characters of Udai, Majnu and Ghungroo will always stay in our funny memories. Akshay does a decent role, and Katrina, with her beauty, pulls off another one with the Khiladi. It is one perfect movie to watch with college friends, or family members. All the songs are still pleasant to hear, make your feet move, all while keeping the humor level decently high.

He despite being an underworld figure wants his sibling marriage to be arranged with a decent respectable and well to do family. In such a serious tone, the BGM with desi beats of 6 measure adds the hilarious sense. Uday trying his hand in acting despite being ruthless, Rajeev turning into an astrologer for a moment, Vijay Raaz as the fake director, are some of the memorable funny scenes of the film.\n\nSanjana, the sibling falls in love with Rajeev, and then the twist starts to unfold. Majnu, younger brother of Uday who is perhaps feared more than Uday clashes sourly with Rajeev's uncle. But within that serious tone of hooliganism, majnu aspires to be a painter who paints pictures in the middle of road, even creating traffic without any sense of civil life. That particular character through various ups and downs progresses hilariously throughout the film.\n\nAll these issues complicates further when Uday and Majnu falls for the same girl set up by Rajeev in order to deflect them away from their illegal businesses. When all these intertwines, then suddenly their boss RDX appears and this becomes further complex when RDX's son appears in the scene. I will stop here and urge you to watch it, to get a full funny scenario, with lots of masks getting unmasked, lots of fake drama getting real and vice-versa etc, which finally ends in reunion of the whole characters involved in a happy ending. My favorite funny scenes are that of Majnu vs Ghungroo. The statement 'Sirf naam Ghungroo hai mera lekin koi baja nahi sakta mujhe' still retains the fun flavor in 2024. There are many such kind of....\n\nWelcome is really a comic film that intends to deliver a fun time with different types of funny traits all combined into one. It well succeeded in its attempt, though some songs were not needed I feel. The romantic songs weren't important, but of fun scenes. Some scenes were also not funny either rather serious but as a whole it is well made family watching funny film. A 71/100 based upon it's merits and flaws."

        "review_detailed_main": "When you have such a strong cast, you also have lot of expectations from the film. 'Welcome' does not live up to the expectations at all! It is a \"so-so\" film, okay to watch on cable, but definitely not worth spending money in the theater. There is nothing new to it; it is another example of good actors coming together and not being able to create anything special! The story is very predictable, and is a kind of patchwork from various films. For example, Nana Patekar's character Uday Shetty is a cross between Shankar from Major Saab (a don, who is a loving brother), and Aslam Bhai from Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega (LKLKBK)(a don with a strong passion for acting). He is a goofy goon, as portrayed by various actors in innumerable films; Sanjay Dutt in Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahi (2002), Johnny Lever in LKLKBK (2001), to name a few. Nana Patekar is his usual self, with nothing new to offer as such. Anil Kapoor is another don, named Majnu Bhai, a close associate of Uday Shetty. He has done a pretty good job with his role, and definitely adds on to the value of the film. One can easily notice that Majnu Bhai's character takes a variety of traits from Circuit of the Munnabhai series, Crime Master Gogo of Andaz Apna Apna, and other similar \"comic sidekicks\". Paresh Rawal is decent as Dr. Ghungroo, but his acting is repetitive from so many of his other movies. Even though Akshay Kumar is the hero, he is often sidelined by the dons, and we don't get to see much of his impeccable comic timing. Feroz Khan is OK as the \"Godfather\" of the dons. The heroines (Katrina Kaif and Mallika Sherawat) seem to exist merely to add oomph value.\n\nThe film drags all along until the climax, which is pretty much the only enjoyable part. The dialogues are not great..or rather, they are quite \"ghise peete\". Songs are okay, but often seem forcefully inserted into the script in places where no song is needed! All in all, a forgettable movie.\n\nIt definitely did not seem like a \"Welcome\" change from the norm!"

        "review_detailed_main": "When you know that Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal are together, you know that you are in for a typical Masala comedy. Jaded Nana Patekar, Anil Kapoor and Feroz Khan join in the Melee. While what you might expect would be another Hera Pheri or a No-entry, this one falls flat even if you get into a movie hall with Nil Expectations.\n\nNana plays Uday Shetty, a don whose sister Sanjana (Katrina) falls for Rajiv (Akshay) whose uncle Dr Ghungroo (Rawal) wants him to be married to a family with no criminal record. In a comedy of errors, Rajiv falls in love with Sanjana and is now faced with the prospect of marrying someone from a crime based family or face mafia style death.\n\nThe film\u2019s only selling point is Akshay Kumar who has been having a run with his comic Movies. With Katrina in it, this one looked like a mafia version of Namaste London, in a silly style. If Akshay continues with mediocre stuff like this, his luck may run out. Nana is past his sell by date. Anil Kapoor and Paresh Rawal are just around average.\n\nComing to comedy, the rare comic parts in the movie are when Nana, the don tries his hand at acting in a movie and is courted by Mallika Sherawat. Partly funny are scenes where Anil Kapoor turns painter and is courted by Sherawat again. The climax sequence involving almost all characters is too pointless to be even discussed.\n\nTalking of its entertainment value, Welcome makes you regret for paying to watch this movie. You may even fall asleep during some clich\u00e9d scenes. As for the songs, most of them are way below average and are all thoroughly ill timed. Keep Out!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Every time I watch this film, it takes me back to the days when we had just purchased a TV. There was no internet, the only entertainment was playing with my toys or playing those demo games I had on the family computer. And every time I watch this film, it reminds me of the exact same scenario I was in when I watched it for the first time. Welcome is my favourite Akshay Kumar film of all time, not just because of how good it is, but also because it comes from what I like to call the \"golden age of Bollywood comedy\", when films like Dhamaal, Phir Hera Pheri, Sunday used to be made.\n\nThe film has multiple characters, each one having their own thing going on. Since Ghunghroo wants to get his nephew Rajiv married in a clean family, while Rajiv doesn't like his uncle's behaviour. Meanwhile the dons Majnu Bhai and Uday Shetty want to get Uday's sister married to a clean family too and so they threaten Rajiv and his family to marry her. Then there's RDX and his son Lucky, who are much bigger gangsters than Uday and Majnu and thus don't want them to give up their ways. And RDX is triggered heavily by Lucky's false death. There are many other minor characters like the director played by Vijay Raaz and Ishika played by Mallika Sherawat.\n\nThe film is one of the better comedy films that Bollywood made in the golden age, considering it's a completely original idea while paying homage to the house scene from the end which is taken from Charlie Chaplin's Gold Rush. The movie directing scene is hilarious, and so is the part where Ghunghroo is trying his best to avoid Majnu at Sun City. The Passing the Parcel part is the one which absolutely takes me back to the child me who was playing Virtual Sailor and occasionally looking at the TV.\n\nWelcome is the film I see every time it comes on TV. I really like everything about the film except the campy acting in some scenes, especially by Katrina Kaif. I really wish the sequel captured the same essence that this film did, because it fails heavily in that aspect."

But all have been wasted without regard on a script that is worse than what kindergarten kids come up with.\n\nIt is a wonder that still some people, other than Feroze Khan himself, want to cast him in their films. Thankfully, he does not have much screen time. But even he seemed much more bearable compared to the rest of the mindless proceedings of the film. I hardly understood some of the song lyrics. I guess it was intended to just add to the crap.\n\nNot much to write about, but hope this sounds a warning bell to Akshay Kumar. He has an excellent sense of comic timing. But he is getting boringly repetitive. If he does not want to end up like Govinda, it is high time he looked seriously at his work profile."

Any thing they make and make money at the Box office How such films work?\n\nAnees Bazmee gives his worst film ever His only decent film was Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha While NO ENTRY was also quite good Music is okay, though Himesh songs sound boring and too many songs especially the item song look forced Cinematography and digital effects are bad\n\nPerformances Nana has done pokerfaced comedy several times, here too he does it brilliantly and does a good job especially in the shooting scenes Anil too is hilarious in his part Akshay Kumar is a letdown, known for his great comic performances here he just falls flat, it seems he was trying to play his part like Agastya Rao he played in JAANEMAN but his act looks monotonous here Katrina Kaif is horrible as usual Malika Sherawat is better then her in a small part Paresh Rawal is monotonous Feroz Khan hams as always"

I remember so many jokes in this that made my stomach hurt from laughing as a kid and they still do. This is still one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Nana Patekar and Anil Kapoor duo is brilliant here. If there's any reason this movie works, it's because of them and their chemistry. Akshay Kumar is great as well. The raw, dry humor combined with the fact that the movie is tongue and cheek, makes for a great time everytime I see it. The romance is where I have a few issues, but the comedy works so well that I can look past it."
