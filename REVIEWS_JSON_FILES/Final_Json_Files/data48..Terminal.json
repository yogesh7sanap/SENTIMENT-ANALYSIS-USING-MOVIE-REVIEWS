You'll have to keep your eyes and ears open and resist the temptation to walk out or switch off 20-30 mins into the movie. The stopy lines do come together, if slightly haphazardly.\n\nThere are some nice twists. One or two you'll probably have an inkling of. One you won't as there's no foreshadowing at all, and although it ties everything (mostly) together, you may well feel cheated as the writer(*/director) swaggers about thinking what a clever writer I am!\n\nStill, immerse yourself in a comic/noir-ish nightmare and see what you think."

        "review_detailed_main": "Vaughn Stein has worked for years in the film industry, largely as second or third assistant director in projects ranging from 2013 blockbuster World War Z to award-winning indie flick Pride. Now, he finally releases his first feature-length film, Terminal, to UK cinemas - a project that he's had a rough cut of since 2016, which screened at Toronto International Film Festival that year.\n\nThis noir-thriller set in an eerie, unnamed city, follows the lives of the inquisitive waitress Annie (Margot Robbie) who leads a mysterious double life, a suicidal teacher (Simon Pegg), two hitmen (Dexter Fletcher & Max Irons), and a strange janitor (Mike Myers) as their stories intertwine through the works of a mastermind criminal.\n\nThis all sounds like it would make for an enticing picture, yet in his attempt to voguishly blend themes from Alice in Wonderland together with Sin City and Blade Runner, Stein has instead created a monstrously inconsistent mess that fails to realise any of its hinted potential.\n\nFrom the clunky cut-scenes to the categorically cringeworthy dialogue, Terminal is a pain to sit through. Frankly, the only thing more confusing than the desperately shoehorned third-act plot twists is how the likes of Robbie and Pegg got attached to the project in the first place. The script is agonisingly forced, the narrative terribly structured, and ultimately neither of these stars manage to elevate the film to something that is comfortably watchable.\n\nThe story is... well, there's practically no story at all. The narrative shifts between several time periods, leaving the viewer in a complete daze as to who's where and what's what. It is extremely difficult to associate with any of the characters, despite Stein - who wrote the screenplay too - sliding in background stories in a way that tries (but fails) to emulate Edgar Wright's unique flair seen in the Cornetto Trilogy.\n\nYet after all this criticism, a strange sense of guilt arises with it. Upon reflection, Stein's vision for the finished film becomes clear, but unfortunately so does the realisation of the wasted potential that Terminal is. Perhaps with a more cultivated director at the helm and a script rewrite or two Terminal could have been an intensely thrilling experience. Christopher Ross' cinematography harks back to Roger Deakin's fantastic Oscar-winning work on Blade Runner 2049, so the look of the film is impressive, but this only adds to the sad comprehension that this project was such a missed opportunity.\n\nThe overall picture presented here leaves behind an immense feeling of dissatisfaction. Not only is it a strain to recall the last time a 90-minute feature has felt so mind-numbingly long, but the plain ridiculousness of the plot twists alone (after an hour-or-so of build-up) are enough to switch the viewer's attention off. It really is eye-rolling stuff."

I don't need any fancy references or nods to previous movies or directors etc. I don't need to be informed or moved or left speechless.\n\nThe best part of this movie is it makes it very easy to suspend belief. So you don't have to watch it and suddenly think oh man that wouldn't happen or gee that was wrong. It is highly stylized, the dialogue is great and there is a definite rhythm to it. The acting is great some of the back and forth between actors is actually very witty and very solid. It has twists and turns- none of them earth shattering but great nonetheless.\n\nI think every actor in it was great- I cannot for the life of me figure out why everyone hates it so much. My best guess is that pretentious people either thought it was going to be one thing and it wasn't so they are upset or pretentious people expected it to be more artsy like some of those noir type films can be.\n\nReading the reviews before I watch it I sort of knew it would be good. I think at a certain point people who I disagree with made it clear they didn't like it so in a sort of the enemy of my enemy thing- The bad reviews seemed like folks who expect too much of a simple small movie or tried to take this movie way too seriously and those who liked it seemed to simply take it as a piece of entertainment.\n\nMy wife and I watched it on a Sunday night after dinner curled up on the couch and felt like it sounded good, so we'll ignore the bad reviews and buy it on Xbox 1. I am really glad we did. The movie isn't going to change your life, it isn't going to be one of those life altering movies This movie was great and it did the one thing we wanted on a lazy Sunday night... It entertained us.\n\nMy God the people who hated this movie are the same type of people who loved La La Land and Mother- I will almost always enjoy a movie they hate- I watched two movies this past week- Black Panther and Terminal. Black Panther was applauded as being incredible- I thought it was just ok and I just can't get anymore involved with it than saying it was just ok.\n\nSo if you are looking for something a bit different than what has come out the last few years and can enjoy something for what it is- simple entertainment the give it a shot you'll probably also really like it.\n\nIn short, only people that hate fluffy puppies- don't like this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Unknown, bewildered and mysterious. Those are the words that appear across your mind as this tarted-up noir feelings cartoon shows itself with flamboyant colors spread around the hollow space of the ominous underground of terminal.\n\nThis dark tale focuses on a few key characters and their conversations and meet-ups with a deranged waitress played by none other than the charming with talents, Margot Robbie. The Terminal opens with Ms. Robbie as Annie who meets with a priest that will lead to a number of assassinations and overly complicated double crosses which is unbeknownst to the audience before the story uncovers itself layer by layer.\n\nThe plot is hazy and foggy for the first ride of 20 minutes but it does take shape beyond that that gives the thinking of alerting the audience to stop daydreaming and start paying attention as the story begins to properly revolve and complete its messy puzzles.\n\nMost of the plot and character developments here willingly to take in the form of twists. There are three major twists deliver within this movie and two of them are quite unexpected but stay to its relevancy of the unnecessary draggy and hard-boiled dialogues.\n\nEncountering the frequent odd happenings and disjointing scenes, time doesn't always move in a linear fashion here. The reason here is because Terminal is mainly relegated to two separate narratives that never quite intersect as a whole. It touches briefly upon another and moves on again with their story back and forth. What is even worse is those two separate entities entitle to slow down the front gear with the misdirection of irrelevant talkings however, they later on become somewhat important for the twists at the end gear that the audience could never see beforehand.\n\nRobbie serves as the personification of what we imagine a femme fatale would be, she delivers her character deep into dark territories as her face morphs into an evil-smiling mad scientist and scary-looking enchantress, hoping that the people watching may madly falling in love with her overly done character, or so you thought. Of course, Robbie does well with her performance as usual but the servings of the substances for the movie lacks the foundation of a truly good movie even far from being a masterpiece artistry of work.\n\nWhile the recent trailers and neon-lighted posters let on that this is a revenge story, well not so much. It's more of having a porn-fashioned movie with mesmerizing colors and sparkling environments igniting the dark empty world of crime.\n\nVerdict: 49/100. Hands down, I can guarantee it is one of 2018's best looking visuals, the visually stunning colors and dazzling cinematography mimics Suicide Squad, another movie with the presence of Robbie of a different genre that holds the identity of the true definition of 'style over substance'. Robbie may save this movie, cracking the judgments on two sides of which she may or may not. If you love Margot Robbie, then give it a try. Her performance here is the solid proof for her to get that Harley Quinn spin-off film made, already."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this based on the great cast and the trailer. I wish I had read a few more of the reviews before committing to watching however. This is an odd movie, in that it takes place in a strange environment lit with neon and hardly anyone else apart from the main protagonists, so its almost a kind of fantasy movie. The one star is awarded purely on the fact this movie looks pretty good, but this wears thin fairly quickly. The problem with the people as they are portrayed is that their is no one that you latch onto, everyone seems to be some type of horrible person or a psycho so you don't really care what happens to anyone. The story has a number of twists and apart from one the rest are guessable, the fact is that if there are only so many players in the game, its not hard to guess who the \"hidden\" person is, or that they may have met in the past etc. I was quite surprised to discover it was possible to have so much acting talent on screen and , albeit mostly B movie grade, and still not feel engaged with the story. The ending was particularly poor, p.s. that isn't how that procedure was carried out and it wouldn't have had the effect portrayed in the movie. It also seemed to out of step with the rest of the tone of the film, it seemed more extreme than the rest of the violence. It was also oddly unsatisfactory as an ending, like I said, if you aren't rooting for the main character or anyone then its hard to feel contentment if they find a resolution. If you liked Only God Forgives you may like this, it has a similar neon style over substance emptiness to it which will polarise an audience with a majority disliking it."

Apart from that, Terminal is a solid mystery thriller with some nice twist, for which enough hints are delivered to anticipate them, but still enough doubt is being spread to keep you guessing. What I liked most is that more or less all characters are introduced as likeable, even if some of them are not. For better viewing pleasure, I would recommend not to learn too much about the film in advance. I was lucky enough to know only a few details and would have preferred not to know that revenge is part of the plot. The writing was great, it featured enough humour to let the drama get close to you, eventually. The cast was at least convincing but mostly excellent.

        "review_title": "An Unbelievable Ending Makes Terminal Worth Checking Out",
        "review_detailed_main": "Terminal was ripped to shreds by critics, I see why but I don't think they gave it enough credit. There's a lot of futuristic noir flourishes, the movie is bathing in neon light and seedy environments. This isn't new, its Blade Runner-esque but the cinematography is admittedly gorgeous in this. Just because it has been done before (lately with Altered Carbon and Mute) doesn't make it any less impressive. It was a nice touch and it deserves to be mentioned, even if it doesn't quite save the movie.\n\nThe plot of Terminal is very reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's movies. There's some Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels moments but the whole movie doesn't operate as well overall. We get introduced to a bunch of seedy characters with dubious morals. They all come in and out of this train station in the middle of the night and the common thread between them is the character of Annie (Margot Robbie). She's an assassin who works part-time as a waitress and stripper. Through her comings and goings, we meet a terminally ill teacher Bill (Simon Pegg), a pair of mismatched hitmen Vince (Dexter Fletcher) and Alfred (Max Irons) and an odd janitor Clinton (Mike Myers). How these interactions play into the larger plot is a mystery to us until the final turn. The setup isn't bad, we've seen it before and although there are plot holes, none of them were bad enough to completely derail the movie. It was enough to keep me interested but I did find my attention drifting in and out because of the lack of cohesion. As a story, its very middle of the road for the genre.\n\nAny heat for this movie was likely due to Margot Robbie's involvement as the main character. She keeps climbing the ladder and its deserved, she's great and I consider myself a fan of hers. She's good in Terminal, she's surprisingly committed, and she carries the movie capably. I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that she comes off as British Harley Quinn, but she didn't phone it in. Pegg is his typical charming self, he's very low-key in this but he works well with Robbie and I particularly enjoyed the montage that they share near the tail-end of the movie. Fletcher and Irons were odd, neither of them were terrible but Fletcher was over doing it and Irons was a little stiff. It was nice to see Mike Myers again and I think he did about as well as he could have with the material. Its a big distance from where his character starts to where he ends up and it makes his performance a little awkward by the end.\n\nI was down the middle on Terminal for most of its run time for all the reasons listed above. It was never stellar, but it had its moments. I was more than ready to just let it float the rest of the way to whatever normal twist ending it had up its sleeve and call it a day. But when the confrontation comes between Annie and Bill, the movie doesn't just dip its toes into a pool of nonsense/crazy, it cannonballs into it. I wasn't just snickering, I was laughing when Terminal ended. Its not that the twist it takes is new, its handled in such a rough and implausible manner that I was shocked. But it didn't derail the movie for me, it actually improved it. It made Terminal memorable and while I would never say that this movie is good, its going to hold a place in my memory for insane plot twists.\n\nI feel a little guilty for giving Terminal as high of a rating as I have. I liked the style of the movie and some of the performances (notably Robbie, Pegg and some of Myers) were solid. But it never reached high enough for something great and in any other movie, that twist ending would have knocked it down to a 3 or a 4/10. But that ending pushed the movie from mediocre to so bad its good territory for me. I can't call Terminal excellent but if you enjoy campy cinema, this is something you should see. I'm giving Terminal a 6/10 and I feel like I'm being generous."

The screenplay is quite stunning visually, with a futuristic neon tinge to everything that is darkly mysterious and gorgeous at the same time. The seedy story unfolds in such a disjointed way that it sucks for a while, but just when you're about to be bored to death, it explodes with a series of reveals that explain everything by narrated flashbacks, which go above & beyond anything you could have expected. Thumbs down for the tedious buildup, especially all the f-word dialog and hateful coarseness by one of the assassins (played by Fletcher), but bravo for the ending, which is not for the squeamish."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't usually post reviews on IMDb - other people have already done it, and often better than I could - and most of the time, I find the ratings more or less on par with my own impressions of movies.\n\nHowever, sometimes, I can't help but wonder \"How in God's name has this movie gotten this rating?\" Terminal is one of those movies.\n\nThe abysmally low rating, coupled with the very few (and most of them, poor) reviews, made me want to give my two cents and try to set the record straight. Or, at least, set it straight-er.\n\nFor me, Terminal was a thoroughly enjoyable movie - it has a great cast, witty and dark humor, interesting enough plot (not too cliche or too predictable) and, being around one and a half hours long, it does not overstay it's welcome. If you're into labeling things, you could call it neo-noir or something other, but the fact is that Terminal is very much its own thing, visually and plotwise. Personally, it reminded me of a theater play.\n\nThe ending could have been executed differently or better - the plot unraveling was overly (and unnecessary) convoluted and the ending itself was a little unimaginative and disappointing. But that's just my personal view.\n\nOverall, Terminal is a good enough movie - and that is good enough for me. And even though it wouldn't make it to any of my \"top 10 movie lists\", it is still a pretty solid movie, that deserves at least a 7. Which is why I gave it an 8."

Outside being very predictable and boring the movie is also full of political correctness trying to justify the main characters actions. Margot Robbie's acting saves the movie a bit but it's too little, she does the best with her character but acting as a stripper / hitman with a proper cause and moral grounds is hard to play without making smart audience laugh. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews, those were probably of people who can't appreciate a truly good movie and are too shallow or not very tasteful or able to watch an intelectually challenging movie (to say the least)."

The set-up was very minimalistic and the story was told in a fairly unengaging manner, with the characters not drawing us in as much as I would have wished. It doesn't have a bad cast in fairness. Margot Robbie is always great and she is once again good value as a femme fatale and looks fantastic (of course). While Simon Pegg is another actor I like and he does the best he can with what he is given. Mike Myers is also notable here too in an odd role. But, overall, the story wasn't the strong point here at all and ultimately let the film down somewhat. But what it does have in spades is great visual style. The lighting and colour schemes were quite beautiful and certainly make up for the deficiencies in other areas, at least to some extent. It is an example of a neo-noir, with characters and settings which fit the bill. Without a doubt, this is an example of style over content, which is not something I have a problem with and do enjoy the pure cinema elements of this one. I just wish that the story had been a bit more engaging though."

You know who is doing what and still you are not sure why. The why part of the story is well executed. The story itself that we see is non-linear, which makes the suspense a tad bit more interesting. I loved the dialogues, one of the most sassiest bold and witty I have seen since long. You have to have a taste in the language to enjoy the conversation between the characters. What a joy it was. Margot Robbie gave a stellar performance so did Simon Pegg. One aspect that absolutely is the clear winner is the cinematographer. Beautiful sets with minimalist neons. The whole neo-noir feel makes the whole movie a delight for the eyes. The climax is unpredictable and rather enjoyable. Please don't fall for the lack of ratings. Enjoy this brilliant movie!"

Finally, with regard to the \"TWIST\" ending, it's about as well thought out and memorable as a bad Shamalan film, nearly The Happening level of ridiculous. I'm astonished they got the stars and funding to put together such a mess.\n\nWhile I won't spoil the film here, I'd suggest wiki'ing the film and saving the time.

The actors, while adequately doing their jobs, are marginalized without any attempt to explore motivations etc. There's a mechanical feel to the characters instead of a human one. They are too often depicted in conversation with only one actor in the frame, without seeing the characters together on the screen, so you rarely get the feeling of actual people communicating the way humans do. Which is a pity, because technically, the filmmakers have the chops to make a decent flick. They just seem to care more about flash than story, script or the actors."

It just has the sense that it is trying to be something greater than it actually is. The dialogue consists of every character being wise and witty and it comes across as forced.\n\nMajor concern comes from the writing. The characters besides Margot Robbie aren't as appealing as we don't necessarily care for them. The ending twist was also poorly executed and by the time it occurs, we don't necessarily care any more.\n\nAt times this film felt confusing and that it was dragging on. Besides the previous mentioned films, Terminal reminded somewhat of Lucky Number Slevin (2006), and Seven Psychopaths (2012) but those films were undoubtedly better.\n\nThere is a reason as to why Terminal was panned by critics and why it didn't make much money.

What did make me a fan of her was her portrayal of Tonya Harding in I, Tonya. She was really tremendous in that film. When i saw the trailer for Terminal I thought it was something I could love. It looked like a female driven, cult classic, that had a lot of style. Was also surprised that virtually no theaters were showing this (thank god for video on demand).\n\nThis film is about two men who have a mission they have to perform to get a large payday. They encounter a woman who becomes a key part of completing the mission. This woman actually seems to be everywhere. Shes in church, working as a waitress and a stripper, and seems to encounter all characters in the film. There is a deeper level of connection that she has with all that s going on, but that's something that would be a spoiler if I went into it. The film stars a fairly odd cast of Simon Pegg and Mike Myers (where has he been lately?)\n\nWhile I had no problems with Margot Robbie in this film, I can see her being typecast as the crazy, unhinged sexy blonde type role. About halfway through the film, I felt like I hated it. The film uses a bunch of plot twists and shock reveals later on. I don't know how effective they are but I think it sort of made me feel better of what I was watching. The film is purely reliant on its style and use of neon colors. Its very nice to look at, but the plot seems like its all over the place and is really messy.\n\nI feel like the filmmaker was trying to include a bunch of ideas and a mix of character dialogue to deliver his point, but it does not always work. Its an oddball film which is okay at a few moments but is a very confused effort. I can see why the producers didn't bother with a theatrical release as I feel like this is something that people would slate. I"

It's not the first film to do so, far from it, but it's the film that's come closest to capturing the surreal, trippy feeling of falling down a rabbit hole. The deliberately complex first half of the movie heightens the feeling of confusion, and this will alienate a lot of viewers, but it kept me hooked until it all became clear. The performances, particularly from Margot Robbie, the photography, the lighting and the Budapest locations are all excellent. It's a movie that I will enjoy watching again."

This film isn't something I'd watch over and over, but that doesn't mean it isn't a solid piece of work.

I would have liked to see it in B/W as an option just for fun, but it was good as is, witty, honest and a nice revenge scene like I've never seen before, except maybe Session 9 in a way, except no wandering around a psyche hospital basement at night looking for coins and gold teeth."

It has rich shadows and bold colors like a paint set splashed across each scene. It reminded me a lot of Punisher War Zone or Batman Forever. It worked with this movie way more than it did with those. However it seems more like they're trying to take your attention away from the rather lackluster story.\n\nThis is a run of the mill revenge story. It drags its feet taking the time for you to get to know these characters but they're dull. Margot Robbie and Mike Myers play the cartoons they're meant to be while the other characters glide in and out of the story.\n\nThis was fairly boring. After a few scenes the production design becomes normalized and it doesn't dazzle anymore. The mystery inherit in the narrative can be guessed very quickly and you're left waiting for the characters to catch up to you.\n\nNow I did enjoy some of the against type casting. It was interesting to see Mike Myers and Simon Pegg in this as their parts are vastly different than what they normally do. Margot Robbie can easily hold the screen in this type of part. They're all good actors but that story man yikes.\n\nWith all that laid out there, I would skip this one. It's forgettable and nothing good will come of you watching it. I give it a D."

But she is probably the best in the movie, and that says a lot. When I write how unintentionally funny it is I don't mean the humor in it is good, because there are jokes in the movie, but none of them are funny. This movie doesn't see how ridiculous and stupid it is and tries to go for that Tarantino dialogue, the only problem with that is that it wasn't writen by Tarantino so it just sounds dumb.\n\nI would not suggest you watch this movie because it isn't good at all. Even the cinematography began to feel obnoxious after 15 minutes. But I must say, I was definitely enjoying myself in terms of how much I was laughing. Also there are a lot of 'twists' in the movie and I called every single one of them so they are not suprising and the ending is just dumb.

It allows your senses to adjust to the core plot without allowing other background stuff to distract attention away from the auditioner's focus. Having said that, the screenplay was freaking awesome, the shots, the cuts, the long shots...reminded me of old 40's films, and to newer watchers, Pulp Fiction. Even the clothing was euro-vintage a bit. Euro accents for the star cast of actors was straight up. I was hooked after the intro of actors and their roles, but it took 30 minutes to really solidify everything and dive in and forget your surroundings of audition environment. After that, the plot hook is on and we are moving fast enough to stay interested.\n\nIn the end, the last 15 minutes, we learn alot about the plot, and I think it should have been played more, vignettes of the main characters would have been better, but I commend the Highland Studios for an overall very fun and enjoyable time! On a side note, these filming locations that require very little CGI really is cool and makes for a better product."

I realise that this might come up as an unpopular opinion so I'll attempt to explain. The writing wasn't much to my taste. Quick-paced, punchline-after-punchline, full of 'cool' references, yes it succeeds in being edgy but it has a great deal of pretentious in it too. As such, it fails to give substantial depth to the dialogue and the characters. Along with an interesting neo-noir (or is it neon-noir?) photography and some really cool soundtrack, it sketches an outline of the statement it wants to draw. Even the twist and the double twist are not hard to expect if you keep your eyes on the screen. Enough with the writing. Margot Robbie's performance makes the movie. As I said before, this is an exploitation film. It talks about the evil of men against women. Man is not to be perceived as nothing else than a monster; The hero beautiful, righteous, vengeful and badass. Perfect in short. That's the writing. MR and her emotive performance add a grey area in all this black and white ridiculousness. Her acting is full of hate, she overgrows Annie's 'perfect' persona and she turns the saying-nothing-hero to a saying-something-anti-hero. I could see this film growing to have a cult following in the years. But then again it could get forgotten really easily too."

The production and cast, even the story and the \"revealing\" of the whole at the end are solid but, and that's a great but, whereas in movies like Pulp Fiction I liked the dialogues a lot, the many talking scenes in Terminal are rather boring, tiresome: they are not witty, not dark, not interesting enough. And as there is rather a lot of talking, this drags the movie a lot down for me. Anyway, I won't recommend Terminal but also will not warn against giving this one a try. This review I close with a \"watch it and make up your own mind\" note - if the story and the cast sound interesting to you."

It was so slow and boring it motivated me to get off the couch, do two loads of laundry and make dinner, all while listening to this movie in the background.\n\nI am certain the writer/director thought he was being so very clever, creating a movie with a bunch of disjointed stories in the fashion of Quinten Tarantino. Problem he is not Tarantino, and his skills are considerably less honed. In a Tarantino film the disjointed stories are compelling and complete on their own, whereas the stories in this film are plodding, uninteresting, time fillers. Tarantino created individual stories which didn't require the ending to give them meaning, it was just a bonus for the viewer. This movie however, didn't have a single compelling story in it, including the ending which was supposed to tie it all together for the viewer, but unless you are brain dead, you will have seen this ending coming from miles away, and didn't need the droning narrative at the end.\n\nAnd here's a twist, the twists in the film are not twists but a straight line down a formulaic path, which is used all too often in Hollywood. Oh wait, that was no more of a twist than what this script contained.\n\nThe acting was fine, they all very convincingly portrayed their characters. The photography, locations and set decorations were also quite good. In the end I guess I have to thank the producers for financing this loser film, which so motivated me to get up from in front of the TV and accomplish mundane tasks around the house."

It must also be said, the wonderfully charismatic actors Dexter Fletcher and Simon Pegg were both on especially engaging form here. And while it might be strongly argued that 'Terminal' is demonstratively more snazzy, eye-popping style than substance, perhaps, in this specific instance that just might be the very point, being undeniably cinematic and more than just a little bit naughty, mayte! The luxuriously photogenic Margot Robbie's mercurial murder mistress was a dangerously dazzling damsel of dispassionately delivered death, her morbidly mesmerizing Annie sinuously stalking this gaudy, shadow-slaked Sin City like some sinisterly sublime, stilleto-savvy, single-mindedly vengeful vixen!

I predicted what I believed to be the main twist relatively early on but was surprised and thrilled to discover there was much more to follow after that reveal. Bravo to the writer and director. Margot Robbie gives an electrifyingly crazy performance with some great dialogue that keeps you captivated - in fact thinking about it there isn't a bad performance in there. It really is a brilliant film with so much to offer and I bet this will be one to look back on in a few years and reevaluate. From an amateur filmmaker, thank you to all involved for making this."

Mike Myers and Dexter Fletcher they are an A listed Actors in the UK ,, so i'd say the movie is no where near an average budget movie .\n\nso overall, , the movie is nice the plot is strong and the soundtracks are stronger ,, recommended."

The rest of the cast wasn't bad either even though the star of Terminal is definitely Margot Robbie. The major bad thing was the plot, at least that's my opinion.

It feels like you 're watching a combination of Inception, Punisher, with Harley Quinn in her first movie role. And for some reason all the main actors where/ looked like old men and I'm not sure if that was intentional but the end result didn't make the movie any more appealing or desirable."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Terminal' is nothing if not full of style.\n\nShots emphasize a singular point of focus, with one aspect invariably drawing our attention. That may be particular vivid color, notable lighting, a specific object, or some other arresting visual. This is true throughout the entire length of the movie; to be fair, it's certainly eye-catching.\n\nThe dialogue is full of wit and cleverness, immediately reminding one of the repartee we get from Guy Ritchie, or Quentin Tarantino. Whether writer-director Vaughn Stein's script matches such acclaimed company is up to any given viewer to decide for themselves, but it's decidedly entertaining, one way or another. It's worth noting that the bulk of that choice discourse is reserved for scenes between Margot Robbie and Simon Pegg; skilled actors that they are, I'm hard-pressed to think of scene partners more perfect for one another.\n\nThe plot progresses ever so slowly, with either the visuals and or the conversation being the real draw for most of the duration. It's only within the last half hour that one really feels the movement of the narrative - and yet, like the mystery laid out for the characters, this is all by design, and it's certainly been unfolding all along.\n\nSo it is, too, with the characterizations Stein has written. Robbie and co-star Mike Myers chew a lot of scenery - especially since there's a lot of it to chew - but it is 100% deliberate and built into the screenplay. These are portrayals that in other films might elicit derisive chortles, but purposeful as it is, and coming from performers of this caliber, it's entrancing. It is a gift that Margot Robbie, above all, is the chief star here - she has a great intensity to her gaze, her expressions, her delivery, that is impossibly alluring.\n\n'Terminal' seems a little bit self-indulgent - very wrapped up in its own cleverness and style, while feeling a bit lacking in substance. Even so, it's sufficiently entertaining, and not a bad way to spend 95 minutes.\n\nRecommended especially for fans of its stars; less recommended if you're looking for a deep narrative to get invested in."

I believe that the movie uses those resources to look and seem \"cool\" but it ends up being completely average, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent effort, but far from impressive. Still, I was mildly entertained, so maybe if all those ingredients this film has to offer are appealing to you, then Terminal could be right up your alley. Me, I doubt I'll watch it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can appreciate some darkness in movies. But having every single last one of the characters detestable with no redeeming qualities, while at the same time dragging things out with self fellating artsy nonsense taken from better movies, to the point that the entire movie essentially lacks a plot and instead only has singular cardboard cutout events and characters and a ton of talking.... that is pushing it too far.\n\nI really wish directors who think that disturbing the audience is a valid replacement for creating actual excitement, fear, and suspense would get booted out of mainstream hollywood already. Along with all the critics who will gush all over any movie with praise as long as it does a few lighting tricks, and weird cuts for dat sweet artsy cred.\n\nDon't get me wrong the movie is absolutely beautifully shot, and the acting is nice, but the singular motivation throughout remains the one from the trailer: revenge.... And while that motivation is understandable in some of its incarnations, it's not so much in others.\n\nAlso everything ABOUT the variations of revenge is so hollow and grim and evil in every line and action that one comes away feeling dirty just having observed these characters for a while, as well as a sense of having been attacked. The only things it accomplishes are to make one feel really disturbed by a too creepy and sad portrayal of psychopathic insanity. So if that and a sea of artsy stuff is all you need to like a movie you'll love this one.\n\nGlorifying revenge is bad.\n\nGlorifying murder is evil.\n\nThis movie attempts to do both.\n\nThe only reason it might not succeed is because all the characters are actually detestable despite their cool demeanor. Plus sympathetic characters are revealed to be monsters. Which is thoroughly uncomfortable. But this means that if it isn't damaging because it glorifies revenge, it's damaging for being incredibly depressing. Seriously, even Tarantino movies are less depressing to watch.\n\nAlthough maybe this could actually be a meta cautionary tale against how hollow people become when consumed by revenge. Though with how low brow the artsy stuff in the movie is i wouldn't bet on it.\n\nIn either case a movie needs to have some characters the audience at least isn't creeped out by. This one doesn't. Its awful to watch awful people do awful things, so 3 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Terminal\" (2018) is a twisting crime drama about a waitress named Annie, played by Margot Robbie, as she pioneers a take over from the concealed crime boss, Mr. Franklin. Through her escapades she encounters two assassins, Vince played by Dexter Fletcher and Alfred played by Max Irons, a terminally ill school teacher, Bill played by Simon Pegg, and an eccentric janitor, Clinton played by Mike Meyers. The film is chalked full of foreshadowing, which is a good thing since things become very confusing after the opening scene. There were times in the film where I was lost and wasn't sure what was going on, but the end makes it all worth it. There is a lot of mystery in this film that keeps viewers' attention as to not miss the little details that pay large dividends at the conclusion.\n\nVaughn Stein wrote and directed this film in a manner that is intended to keep the audience guessing. Even though the viewer may figure one thing out, there are so many other layers left to understand. The acting, though slightly anger inducing at times, was incredible for this story. For example, the way Vince treated Alfred would never be accepted in modern times, even as assassins. I think one of the main reasons this may not be considered a top-notch movie is that through all the attempts to conceal the finale, much of the film just seemed to be very jumbled. This can be a complicated watch if you are a viewer that doesn't give a film your full attention. However, I feel that if you can, this film is well worth a view."

Starring Margot Robbie, Simon Pegg, Max Irons, Dexter Fletcher, Mike Myers.\n\nIf you are a movie fan, and wished for something cool and sexy during this summer season, then \"Terminal\" looks like an answer to all of your prayers.\n\nSadly, all this coolness and sexiness can't compensate for uninspired writing - resulting in presentable but soulless story where there's not enough exciting stuff happening.\n\n\"Terminal\" is definitely intriguing in small doses but the quality of its individual aspects such as performances or atmosphere do not mesh into one satisfying whole. The crucial part gluing it all together - a strong story - is just missing.\n\nThe debuting screenwriter-director Vaughn Stein has tried to renew the noir genre - the classic American crime story -, adding modern touches such as dazzling visual side, Quentin Tarantino-style dialogue (the characters are cool and talk a lot), and bagful of nods to other works, including early Guy Ritchie works, superhero and modern spy movies, \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"The Usual Suspects\".\n\nFreshening a classic genre with personal touch is nice in theory, but of course everybody is not Tarantino who can somehow pull this kind of thing off just about every time.\n\nThe movie mostly consists of writing for writing's sake, lacking inspiration or meaningful content. And it can be theatrical in a bad way: more interested in how the dialogue sounds and how the actors look like delivering it (a lot of close-up shots!), rather than having interesting things to say.\n\nNot judging by the whole but its individual aspects, \"Terminal\" has enough goods to earn a recommendation, at least for crime comedy fans. Stein has achieved admirable things in general, deserving kudos for that.\n\nWhat one probably notices first is the overall visual side. The atmosphere is just delicious: the noir's classic moody, shadowy aesthetics meet with glossy surfaces and screamingly strong and bright colors straight out of the most flamboyant of superhero movies.\n\nSecondly, the dialogue does have a distinctive feel - a kind of sensuality to it - which makes it captivating to follow, just like Tarantino's. Sadly, there's so much of it that at one point, one begins to wish for something interesting to happen instead.\n\nThe main actors listed above do admirable job also, although revealing much about the characters would end with spoiling the story, so I'm not gonna.\n\nThe biggest surpriser is veteran comedian Mike Myers of \"Wayne's World\", \"Austin Powers\" and \"Shrek\" fame, who gives an intriguing and enjoyable creepy performance, and demonstrates surprisingly strong acting chops.\n\nHe takes a paper-thin character and truly makes it his own. The walk, the talk, the facial tics... after all these years, the 50+ man looks like a great actor all of a sudden.\n\nUnusually cool-looking Pegg is also solid as a supporting character but he's almost always better supporting. As a leading man, he usually suffers from typical star comedian disease: a talent in need of decent movie. Max \"the son of Jeremy\" Irons is attractive as a young hit man too.\n\nBut the star of the show is undoubtedly Margot Robbie as the mysterious femme fatale. \"Terminal\" is basically the showcase of best of Robbie, taking everything good about this versatile and talented actress, pressing it into one juicy entertainment grenade.\n\nThe character feels much inspired by her turn as Harley Quinn in the superhero movie \"Suicide Squad\", and will probably be better than the whole of her future independent Harley Quinn project.\n\nRobbie is just phenomenal here, so confident and sensual that her carefully measured performance commands the screen every second she appears on it. A true star power!"

Margo offers up a decent, alluring as well as charmingly aloof character. Yet, she is let down by the uneven tone and slow pacing of the script. The movie doesn't have the expected witty charm of the wry, dark-humor of the captivating female assassin in Miss Meadows (2014) or the Jodie Comer's seriocomic psycho-assassin thrills found in Killing Eve (2018). Terminal instead has more of the style and pacing of the espionage thriller The Tailor of Panama (2001) but adds a darker more colorful garish motif. But it is the script that lets the audience down with its much plodding pacing that fails to sustain a compelling engagement with the audience like John Cusack character gets to survive through in the delicious seedy, mystery thriller The Bagman (2014). One curiously distracting casting distraction is Dexter Fletcher as the not so nice Vince. Maybe nobody else would notice how coincidentally the deliciously delightful Tom Hank's Dr. Henry Goose character in sweeping sci fi epic Cloud Atlas (2012) would have brought an amazing contribution of creepy vitality to the movie. Finally, Terminal just lacks that tight intensity for its climax in comparison to the nicely edited, well-crafted delivery with its powerful reveal in the mystery thriller Lucky Number Slevin (2006) or the intensely fun assassin thriller with its number creative twists and turns in 2 Days In The Valley (1996). Audiences would to better to consider: The nicely crafted mystery thriller of Bad Times at the El Royale (2018), assassin comedy of The Matador (2005), crime comedy of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), the riveting crime cult classic The Usual Suspects (1995). Of course there is always the David Lynch off-beat mystery thriller classic Mulholland Dr. (2001)."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK - I'm British, so I was bound to cringe at Margot's \"London-ish\" accent which was - at best, twisted - at worst, strangled. I picked the title because - well, the cast of Margot Robbie and Simon Pegg intrigued me. I also saw Mike Myers on the cast list and sucked my teeth a little but, still - in for a penny... in for a pound!\n\nWith Sin City-esque (2005) film noir undertones, the story line focuses - in the main - on one night in very close quarters around a (London?) city train station. The attention to some detail was novel - the old money and dress styles placed the film somewhere between 1974 and 1990 - my guess is early 80's from the location shots other scenes - but that is purely incidentals, and I digress...\n\nAs the movie progresses, sufficient back story fills in some of the gaps - but you can't help yourself from trying to guess the plot as it unfolds. And that plot stutters at first, as you try to orientate yourself to the presentation style - which is very much comic-book. You can almost imagine moving from pane to pane across a page. The shadowy, nighttime contrasting darks and lights drew me to compare the cinematography to Dick Tracy (1990) - which is not a bad thing.\n\nThe story line itself is clever, if not a little strained. You'll need to suspend disbelief that all of the \"required\" characters can be brought together for a climactic period which has been allegedly plotted and schemed out over a protracted period of time. The weaving back and forth gets dizzying as the plot progresses into the final quarter, making you wish you'd paid more attention throughout!\n\nThe acting was - again, for the most part - very good. Notably bad was the dumbing-down of what I assume was intended to be an \"East End\" gangland script, ably supplemented and portrayed by Dexter Fletcher - sadly destroyed (ironically, since he is actually Camden-born) by the wooden-ness of Max Iron's delivery. To be fair to Max - he clearly spoke the script as provided - so I'll have to put the blame on the screen writer. Margot Robbie's part to play gets a 6 out of 10 (sorry - the accent wobbling all over the place was way too distracing!), Simon Pegg gets an 8 for a solid performance, with Mike Myers coming in around an 8, too (bearing in mind we know Mike has roots in the UK, so it's all good!)\n\nI enjoyed this film as a quirky piece which has some stand out moments. The all-too-sudden lapse into gore was a little disappointing and, as others have commented, that finale tied all of the lose ends together but, ultimately, lacked \"closure\". I gave it a 7 - it could've been an 8 if I wasn't so distracted by Margot's accent which, if you're not British, won't bother you in the slightest!"

It wants to be a clever noir filled with chocking twists and turns. But after 30 minutes all twists were severely telegraphed and by the hour mark all threads were effectively over and done with. But this director decides to wave the script in my face and prance around with endless montages of stuff we've already figured out just to show me how clever he is and... because he had to pad it out to a contractually obligated 90 minutes.\n\nIn that way it reminds me of Black Mirror.

I stayed because of the lovely Hopperesque photography, for the beautiful custom designs and for my affinity with the writer's/director's taste in movies and artworks.\n\nBut regrettably, Mr. Vaughn Stein's script feels more like a handful of beautiful fragments of dialogue written on the back of envelopes and napkins over the years and haphazardly quilted into the above-mentioned movies; which results in a visually beautiful noir half baked idea, with good performances by Margot Robbie and Simon Pegg, that plagiarizes the storylines and characters of the works above mentioned, more than it pays hommage to them."

It really is bad.\n\nMargot Robbie is wonderfully watchable as always and Simon Pegg (cast against type) does well too, but they're working with material like a fifth former's fan fiction.

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a decent idea for a film, but it was just disappointing to watch. I won't repeat what other reviewers have said. I'll just say that the film dragged on for so long that it took all of the oomph out of the twists, especially because the twists were lazily developed to begin with. They were easy to guess not because the movie is full of clever clues that subtly point you to them but because they're the only logical explanation for some events and/or the set up is so blatant that it's hard not to see them coming. I really love being surprised by a good twist, but nothing in this movie surprised me. The script was a tortured parody of a Guy Ritchie film peppered with heavy-handed references to Alice In Wonderland, and half the time I just wanted the characters to shut up. I kind of liked the stylized design, but there was nothing unique about it. It just kept making me think of Sin City or Brazil.\n\nIt was worth the watch if only for Margot Robbie and Simon Pegg, whom I thought both delivered nice performances and whose scenes together were by far the most compelling. Tbh, you could've just plucked them out and made an excellent movie with just the two of them alone--although I like the idea of overlapping, semi-related stories taking place and coming together to provide a background for why everything is happening. I also like that it isn't obvious who exactly this film is about until the very end. But overall, I think it's too middle of the road, so it comes across as either trying too hard or not trying hard enough. I wish they had either a) kept it simple and forgone the overwrought script and most of the goofy atmospheric stuff in favor of something a tad bit more realistic or b) pushed it to the extreme and made it ten times more campy and crazy."

The acting is spot on, the cinematography is impeccable, the director has all narrative threads evolve and come together, nothing is forgotten and neglected.\n\nThe characters are typologies, are bigger than life, are in your face and so enjoyable constructed.

The rich and original performances of Pegg and Robbie, as well as the imaginative presentation of a neo-noir world (which can be credited to director Vaughn Stein and cinematographer Christopher Ross), were overshadowed by a dull twist of events. There were countless ways to go, but it seems everyone involved in the creative process of writing the script wanted to take the easy way out, and that just won't cut it."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Terminal (2018)' is just so messy and misjudged, relying on a bizarre and occasionally 'trailer-like' structure that often results in irreverently irrelevant plot-strands and a floaty feel that sees most moments slip by with an almost utter non-urgency. This leads to an experience that isn't engaging, often isn't pleasant and certainly isn't as clever as it clearly thinks it is. I'd cottoned on to its two biggest twists incredibly early on, while most of its other reveals come out of nowhere and don't really matter to the point they could be considered tangential at best and immaterial at worst, though certainly not surprising. On top of the generally abrasive characters and the lack of a proper driving force, there are some real problems with perspective. The picture often feels unsure as to whom it wants you to root for. When it finally makes up its mind about that, it seems confused as to why you ought to do so; really, it doesn't convey any compelling reasons for you to be engaged with anyone on screen. This leads to some bizarre and strangely unsettling sequences in which we're suddenly asked to change allegiances and excuse the cruel, almost sadistic behaviour of another character simply because we now know of their real motives, which doesn't do anything other than further distance us from the flick's core players and prove that the filmmakers don't really understand their own material - or, rather, the effect it will have on its audience. This is especially relevant as it pertains to who is the 'hero' and who is the 'villain', the indistinguishable nature of which would be a nice theme if it were explored properly and not cast aside for a last-minute revenge plot that asks us to root for, ostensibly, a text-book bad-guy just because the person they're hurting has done some bad things in the past. Let's not forget, however, that everyone in this dingy little piece has done terrible things on or off-screen at one point or another and that our 'protagonist' does stuff to rival most of it, no matter what their motivation is (I'm sure all the characters have had rough lives, by the way, it's no excuse). Overall, there are some interesting ideas and moments that have potential, but nothing ever comes to fruition and there's never any proper entertainment to be had. There aren't any genuine characters to invest in, things don't really pay off in a satisfying way and, when it comes down to it, it's not really all that enjoyable. In the end, it's just quite boring. 3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "About halfway through \"Terminal,\" my wife turned to me and said \"We can turn this off if you don't like it.\"\n\n\"No, let's keep going,\" I said. \"If we stop now, I'm just going to wonder if we gave up just as it was about to get better.\"\n\nReader, it did not get better; in fact, it somehow managed to get worse. The story is confusing from the outset, though I initially assumed (too generously, it turns out) it was intentional: non-linear storytelling is a useful-if a bit overused-way to advance a story while slowly revealing everyone's roles within it. When it's done right, you get \"Pulp Fiction\"; even when it doesn't quite work, there's still some fun to be had in seeing how the writer pulls together all these disparate story arcs into one final act (\"Lucky Number Slevin\" comes to mind). With these labyrinthine plots, viewers will endure pretty much any amount of setup, as long as you make it worth their while in the end.\n\nTrusting that it would be worth my while in the end, I sat through scene after scene of Margot Robbie trying to exude a perfect blend of mystery, danger and sex appeal. She does manage to strike that balance, in that she fails equally miserably at all three. With the notable exception of Bill (Simon Pegg in a customarily entertaining performance), the few breaks we do get from Robbie are no better: Vincent (Dexter Fletcher)'s irascibility is entertaining for the first few minutes, but quickly grows stale. His partner Alfred (Max Irons) serves little purpose beyond as a way to move the story on to the next scene. One minute he's human velvet, a suave, assured ladies' man; the next, he's salivating over strippers like he's never seen a (clothed) breast before. Even a good actor-say, for example, Max's father Jeremy-would struggle with a character this poorly-written. Max doesn't stand a chance. Mike Myers turns in a solid enough performance as Clinton, the night supervisor, though it's soured by some truly uninspired acting during the big reveal at the end.\n\nI held out hope that my patience during the interminable middle acts would eventually be rewarded. It was in vain. Not only does \"Terminal\" fail to justify its plodding, self-indulgent existence, it almost does the opposite. About 3/4 of the way through, with practically zero warning, one character's horrific true nature is jarringly revealed; we barely have a chance to digest that information before *poof!* they're gone. At that point, the wheels truly come off, including a scene in which one character essentially admits to the viewer that an entire subplot of the film serves no purpose.\n\nIt all culminates in a \"twist\" ending that viewers will mostly see coming a mile off. There are a few elements of the climax that are truly surprising, but only because they're so unnecessary and, frankly, idiotic that it's genuinely astonishing that they ever made it past the first draft of the script, let alone into the final cut of the movie.\n\nAnd then, mercifully, it ends. I only wish I'd throw in the towel when there was still something left of my night to salvage."

Most of the character reveals are entirely predicatable, the one that isn't is so silly and unnecessary as to be doubly irritating.\n\nI admire directors and actors willing to take a risk and do something different, and I did genuinely like this up to a point, but in the end I'm simply amazed that such an ensemble of actors with plenty of opportunities to make better and/or better paying movies would sign on for this. OK, Dexter Fetcher and MIke Myers do exactly what they always do, but what on earth was Margot Robbie thinking?"

Original? more Blade Runner vamped up to Neon fantasy, All form, no substance. there is no narrative, or little there that makes no sense. So dialogue that says nothing, scenes that make no sense. The end is disjointed. It is all meant to create an effect with nothing behind it. Rather than feel it is inventive or experimental, it seem to have an agenda to \"surprise\" and astound\"'.\n\nI have to think that the actors, like Simon and Mike, did their scenes without having an overall view, trusting that the film maker had a real vision (that worked). Some reviewers said there was a surprise ending with a twist- At the end I don't know what I was watching, it made no sense. It seemed the whole thing had no purpose, and nothing to say. so while it was trying to create an effect, definitely a fantasy, it was much ado about nothing. there seemed to be gratuitous violence (bloody) not even tied to a plot point. the end was supposed to some kind of reveal; it wasn't. \"Revenge\", I guess so.\n\nin a weird way, it remembered me of \"Last Year at Marienbad\" the iconic French film by Renais. Because it was visually stunning, Last Year in black & white, without a narrative. Scenes that were evocative, but left you, the viewer uncertain. I got Renais' explanation after I watched it 3 times; he wanted to make a movie of pure emotion. Suddenly, it made sense. Like Abstract Motion Expressionist, Pollock, Frankenthaler, or totally non-objective. Kandinski.\n\nTerminal fits the bill- but without the success. the 2 stars are for the stunning visual."

There is much dialogue that thinks it's clever because it references worthy works of literature, tries to be pithy and uses British accents, but is mostly just boring and repetitive. Even Margot Robbie's beauty and considerable acting skills aren't enough for me to want her to keep talking about various ways to die.\n\nThe stylized noir look (read: lots of neon signs and the least daylight since 'Dark City') is cool for a while but by the end feels overused and makes it difficult to suspend disbelief. I felt like I was watching a continually hosed down set with a neon sign Snapchat filter as opposed to being taken into some cool fantasy world.\n\nThe plot is very straightforward and not original: hit men trying to kill each other. Emphasis on men being the idiots and doing the dying because it's PC to have a clever woman pulling the strings on dumb, good for nothing men being killed. What's annoying is that the story gets unnecessarily complicated not in service to the plot, but in service to its relentless pursuit of stylistic scenes with English Lit 101 quotations.\n\nMaybe some people really did like this movie. Maybe style > substance or they were so smitten with Margot that they didn't care about the actual words coming out of her mouth. I'm not going to say don't watch this movie because maybe you will be one of the smitten and that's fine. For me it just wasn't all that compelling after I got over the eye candy treatment at about the 10 minute mark."

But this time let's do something different.\nWhat about making something like Pulp Fiction?\n+ Yeah! Exactly.\nPlus, I really love Blade Runner, let's add loads of neon-lighted scenes (I mean really loads)\n+ Wait a minute, What about a screenplay?\n\n\nI know it is too absurd but let's admit that it is absurd as much as the film. The first time I saw the trailer I thought that finally, we would see an amazing action film in 2018. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. The storytelling style and, indeed, the plot literally ruined the film. The film uses a lot of plot twists and shock reveals and I think the only reason made me watched the film to the end is that. To be honest, I am not a fan of Margot but I have to admit that she perfectly delivers her character and as always her evil smile is amazing.\n\nLet me summarize. For the first 20 minutes, you say \"it will be amazing\" Between 20 and 60, you say \"What the h**k did you do, Vaughn Stein? Okay, maybe I am overreacting, let's see what will happen at the end\". Finally, at the end of the film, you say \"Vaughn Stein, Look, buddy, just don't do it. Okay? Please, don't do this.\n\nIn the end, if you have enough time to watch lots of films, watch it.

Literally. It's ninety-nine percent borrowed style and one percent Mike Myers, who embodies the worst casting decision since Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi. As for the rest of the cast, they are less a cast than three confused Englishmen who radiate a collective longing for the iconic, if merely competent, dialogue and direction of Guy Ritchie whilst a since matured Margot Robbie tries just a little too hard to steal their scenes. Scenes that ultimately amount to an inadvertent parody of the rapidly depreciating noire and cyberpunk sub-genres, and leaves you feeling simultaneously lobotomized and hit by a train."

Simon Pegg adds formidable balance to that aspect, but you'll still need to be patient. Luckily in the competent hands of a really good script and some very able actors that shouldn't be a problem, particularly if you are admiring the perfect moody late night lighting, which moves from city vista to echoing spooky corridors, to platforms, and to dead end rooms that nod to the 1950s. I wasn't kidding when I described this as neon noir. A splendour worth beholding (they use really good cameras). And.... if you happen to be a literary fan of Alice In Wonderland, the cockney prose will probably tickle as well (I'm not such a fan, but that didn't seem to hurt my enjoyment, in fact, such references seemed to be a perfect spice). I liked the camera angles and frames, and the way at odd times they tried something different. Good editing I thought. The characterisations are excellent, but not groundbreakingly original, save the Mike Meyers character. They are at least perfectly cast. You'll probably guess what is going on but that probably won't spoil your movie. It's the sort of movie where they give so many clues away anyway that I think they allow for that, and it shouldn't spoil anything (you probably won't get it entirely). For me, Terminal needed something truely brutal to open the proceedings, and could have done with some beginning narration. Given the Alice references that seemed to me to be something that would have worked, but that's me. Certainly Terminal is an accomplished piece of modern noir artistry, and is well worth a look."

If you like the movie and think it doesn't deserve a 5 or less, review it with a ten to counter the hate toward the non carbon copy of the movie the kids were expecting to see before reviewing it. The story is great if you do not have the attention span of a goldfish, and even if it could have been better in some aspect it is still great. Don't hate, watch it, enjoy it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Terminal (2018) is a very stylish and stylized film with a talented cast, a very intelligent script, a Byzantine plot, numerous allusions to works by Quentin Tarantino and Lewis Carroll, and a surprise ending. The cinematography is great, with a lot of texture and vibrant colors that pop out of the murky shadows and a refreshing paucity of jiggly-cam shots. The film is minimalist, with five main characters and three primary locations for most of the action. It is not without its faults. It definitely doesn't start with a bang, but builds to a simmer that can test the patience. The plot is a bit contrived. Between the plot contrivances and the highly-stylized imagery, it is difficult to suspend disbelief. The violence isn't far removed from what might pass for primetime network fare and the sex is 99 44/100ths percent suggestion, with nothing steamier than a few passionate kisses and a visit to that strip club in the land of mid-American television fantasy, where the dancers are nice girls who don't remove their clothes. It is a bit like There Shape of Water (2017), which I confess, I haven't actually managed to finish viewing. It's very beautiful and an impressive achievement, but the style is more accessible than the substance.\n\nHowever, the performances are quite good. I found myself engaged with each of the five main characters. There are enough subtle elements, that one will want to view the film again to appreciate the allusions that may have escaped notice on the first viewing."

Everything is stripped back to focus on just a handful of characters and simple sets.\n\nThere are quirky shots, a thread that becomes more apparent as the story progresses and Margot Robbie gives it her all. The scenes between her and Simon Pegg as they discuss life and suicide are fascinating.\n\nIt's not perfect - the end is a little hurried - but it's worth watching.

Margot Robbie, Dexter Fletcher and Simon Pegg are standout performers in this but the way that the story develops and comes to a climax just when you are ready for it makes this a very rare 10/10 for me.

It is an excellent thriller with a great visual neon-like style, very good acting from everyone (Robbie was magnificent and her character gets more scary as the film progresses), excellent script with tones of black humor (my favorite), shocking plot twists and a final act that leaves you with the open mouth.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n10/10"

Very good acting all round imho. It's worthy of an 8 but I gave it 9 for the many plot twists."

Curiouser & curiouser cries Alice, and like the script of Terminal which had some references to Alice in Wonderland it too was filled w/double entendres (figuratively & literally similar to the excellent series Orphan Black), metaphor, foreshadowing, allusion, situational irony. Dialogue where \"pathetic fallacy\" is presented (that is rare) as in this situational dilemma \"emotional turmoil is reflected in tangible surrounds\". Which then proceeds to the choice of \"gravity or gravitas\". Lighting and settings that reminded me of the original Blade Runner. Script had elements of classical film noir. Lighting, camera angles, props, clothing, makeup, sound effects all creatively presented unlike the mass produced formula robotic look-alike films being fast food produced. Endings, yes there were more than one - most all unexpected. Summing up - basically an intelligent sensory experience."

If this is not enough CGI or SF for you, or you do not empathayze with thr characters or story, please go back to the last Star Treck's franchise. I would not bully you. But please stop bulling, or low-rating movies like this one, (the budget does not matter), or movies like Arrivall, What hapennd to Monday, Annihilation, TAU,2036 Origin Unknown...(the list is so long....), just because you don' get it, ot hte CGI sucks in your opinnion.

The set up, and the climax was incredibly appealing.\n\nNot just that, but the acting and the chemistry of all the actors feels perfectly natural. There are moments I find myself forgetting that most of them had probably not ever met before this film.\n\nThe only downside is that they present a fantastical dystopian world that they hardly explore. I think at the end of the movie, there's room for another film focusing on other alice n wonderland related characters to further build this crime based city.\n\nIgnore the reviews that tear down the directors writing ability. There really is beautiful storytelling in this film and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that make you theorize. This movie is very similar to Quentin Tarantinos writing."

This is an ORIGINAL film... The film does have plot twists and has a slight resemblance to sin city in it's setting, but hey we live in 2018 and moving pictures have been developed for over a lifetime... The idea of any new film not showing resemblance to another is just obsurd and does not take from its originality."

Everyone puts in a great performance, especially Margot robie, pegg and Meyers. Decentvstory it's a little confusing but comes together in the end. Ignore that reviews that dont get it.

I couldn't take my eyes away once I started watching because the story, seemingly obscure and a bit all over the place, was compelling and works in this situation. It's like watching a Frank Miller film like Sin City, with ever changing surroundings and plot twists that invariably take you through the full gamut of intertwined lives and stories, to it's inevitable conclusion. At the end, the entire film made sense and I was left amazed how fluid this confusing story actually was. The jumping around is deliberate and without it this film would have been boring, to say the least. I, for one, really enjoyed this film and without Margo Robbie as the titular psychopath with her expressive face that rolls easily from demure to psychotic, without missing a beat. Many people said they didn't like the film, and with some this is a kind way of saying how much they hated it. As a viewer, not a critic with my head in a dark place praising my cinematic knowledge, I enjoyed this film and I think it got a bad rep from people that set the bar way too high for this film noir. This film doesn't leave any loose ends, and leaves you satisfied that there were no secrets that the director left out, or added, that made no sense, like so many quick cut and run movies out today. I hope this film, not movie, makes some money in after theater sales, it deserves it."
