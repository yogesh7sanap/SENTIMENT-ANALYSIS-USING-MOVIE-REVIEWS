        "review_title": "Every bit as bad as its reputation says",
        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is so, so utterly wretched, not only in its execution but also in its conception.\n\nJust from a filmmaking perspective, it's extremely shoddy. Many portions look like home movies. A large part of the film is Cameron sitting in a car talking to a friend, and that's not interesting to watch. \"Comedy\" scenes have nothing to do with the rest of the story, and are creepily unfunny. A bizarre dance scene at the end is out of place and seems inserted to extend the time. Cameron's presence here is smarmy and smug; he lays out his spiritual views and his friend just gushes about how right Cameron is and how he's helped him see the light and love Christmas and all that.\n\nA bigger problem is the misinformation that Cameron spews so authoritatively, some of which runs counter to the Bible and to known history. To give a partial list:\n\nCameron claims that Joseph and Mary were hiding from soldiers sent by Herod to kill all babies being born. But the Gospel of Matthew says the soldiers were sent by Herod AFTER Jesus was born, when Herod was tipped off by the visiting Wise Men that a King of the Jews had been born. Joseph and Mary then took Jesus and did the Flight into Egypt to save the child's life.\n\nCameron insists the Nativity took place in a cave because the manger was made of stone. No source claims the manger was stone, or that the Nativity took place in a cave. Matthew says it was in Joseph's house in Bethlehem, Luke says it was a stable. This seems like a post-hoc attempt to link the Nativity with the Resurrection.\n\nCameron says frankincense and myrrh were \"funeral spices.\" Although myrrh had been used in Egyptian mummification, frankincense was not, and both were much more commonly used as a sacred incense in Hebrew temples.\n\nHe goes into detail about Saint Nicholas' life, presenting it as fact, but in truth very little is known for sure about him, and some Christian leaders openly suggest that he may never have existed. All that is known for sure is that someone named Nicholas was at one point the Bishop of Myra; everything else is unsure and in the territory of legend and myth.\n\nLegend has it that during the Council of Nicaea, Nicholas angrily struck Arius in the face for saying that Jesus and God were separate. Cameron depicts Nicholas savagely and brutally attacking Arius and beating him with a shepherd's crook, a scene many Christians found objectionable.\n\nCameron depicts the historical Saint Nicholas climbing on a sleigh to deliver presents to children, something he never did in any legend. He also claims that Saint Nicholas is the gift-giver everywhere, also not supported by history. Some areas give gifts on Christmas, others at Epiphany, others on St. Nicholas' day, and in some areas the gifts are delivered by someone else entirely, such as La Befana in Italy, St. Basil in Greece, the Yule Lads in Iceland, St. Lucy in Croatia, and multiple countries have the gifts delivered by the Magi, angels, or the Christ Child himself.\n\nCameron says Nicholas was \"sainted,\" when in reality Nicholas was never canonized. His sainthood was more by word-of-mouth.\n\nCameron makes an elaborate rationalization for Christmas trees relating to the crucifixion and to the Garden of Eden; this connection is very convoluted and labored, and doesn't hold water. And he doesn't address the parts of Jeremiah which some feel are a commandment against Christmas trees.\n\nHe claims that gifts piled under the Christmas tree are perfectly acceptable as they are reminiscent of the skyline of Jerusalem. By that reasoning, they could also be the skyline of Babylon or Rome, and could represent oppression and slavery. It's a poorly considered analogy that should never have been included.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing other bits, but I'm not inclined to go back and watch it again. It's unsettling to see Cameron stand and claim that it's OK to be materialistic at Christmas, because that's when God came to the Earth in material form. (That's pretty much a direct quote.) Never mind the many passages where the Bible tells us to set aside worldly things and not be materialistic! He exhorts viewers to eat themselves to bursting and buy the biggest ham and the richest butter....but isn't gluttony considered a deadly sin?\n\nAt no point does he address such issues as helping the poor, feeding the hungry, giving to charity, volunteering, or anything. One is left with the impression that one should only think of one's self and one's immediate family and friends. Does Cameron remember Jesus' command to his followers to give away all they had to the poor? Somehow, I don't think so.\n\nCameron gives the impression of someone who read parts of the Bible long ago, but rather than fit his life to the Bible, he is fitting the Bible to the life he wants to lead, and making one justification after another without ever bothering to double-check if he's remembering it correctly, or if there's something in the Bible that disagrees with him. It's clear he considers himself a better Christian than you. Many of the faithful have been turned off by this movie, some even going so far as to declare it blasphemous and call Cameron a false prophet. I'm not so sure I would agree, but at the same time, this movie does have some value of showing how even a faithful Christian can fall victim to the sins of pride and arrogance. It's clear that Cameron's ego was in overdrive, and this movie is not as much a testament to God as it is an expression of Cameron's arrogance."

        "review_detailed_main": "For those of us who have watched Kirk Cameron pontificate on the wonders of the banana, or read his musings on the legitimacy of the existence of fire-breathing dragons, we know that Kirk Cameron himself is comedy gold. One might expect more hilarity from Cameron in Saving Christmas, but Cameron actually intentionally tries to build a comedy here, and the result is an unfunny, unfocused, interminable mess.\n\nThe film begins with an uncomfortable scene involving Kirk Cameron sitting in a chair, lecturing at the audience. \"They don't want us to love Christmas,\" Cameron declares authoritatively, never bothering to define exactly who \"they\" are. Cameron drones on for several more minutes, and at this point in the film, I heard a kid in the back of the theater yawn loudly\u2014perhaps an audible protest that this film would not be the exciting romp promised on the poster.\n\nFinally, the film cuts away from Kirk Cameron, and we see several characters enjoying a Christmas party. But then we see Kirk Cameron again, the film freezes, and we hear Kirk Cameron narrating about himself: \"That's me\u2014Kirk!\" More lecturing ensues.\n\nEventually, a character by the name of Christian (almost as clever as \"Josh Wheaton\"), a Christian himself, despondently finds his way to a car, apparently disillusioned by the materialism of Christmas. Enter Kirk Cameron, who enters the vehicle and does what he does best\u2014more lecturing.\n\nThe majority of the film takes place in this car as Kirk lectures to Christian, with occasional cutaways to Biblical imagery. Cameron tries to make the case that Christmas traditions, such as celebratory trees and gifts, all somehow originated with Christianity, not paganism. (Never mind the fact that ancient paganism predates Christianity.) \"Last time I checked, God created the winter solstice!\" is the type of asinine reasoning you'll hear from Kirk Cameron throughout the film. Cameron's facts are both dubious and sparse, and his connections are spurious\u2014but Christian is nevertheless invariably blown away by Kirk Cameron's apparently amazing insight.\n\nPerhaps aware that interminable lecturing on its own would be unbearable for an audience, the film provides characters with quirky personalities in an effort to break up the tedium. In particular, we are treated to a scene back in the house of two characters rambling schizophrenically as they drink hot chocolate. It has nothing to do with Christian's story, it makes the movie feel unfocused, it goes on for far too long, and if my theater is any indication, it is not funny at all. In fact, there was dead silence in my theater throughout the entire run of this \"comedy\" film.\n\nThe film ends with a dance sequence that feels like it lasts ten minutes, as well as multiple, gratuitous blooper scenes\u2014I suppose for no reason other than to pad the running time. Just when you think it's finally over, we see Kirk Cameron again, and he continues to lecture the audience\u2014this time about how materialism is just fine, because Jesus came to us in a material body, after all.\n\nOne gets the impression that Kirk Cameron actually started reading his own Bible, was disturbed by what he found (such as Jesus' instruction to \"go sell your possessions and give to the poor\"), and produced this film as a desperate justification for his own hypocrisy.\n\nAt my theater, nobody laughed, and nobody stayed for the end credits. This purported comedy film fails at every level. If you're really looking for a laugh, go back and take a look at what Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort have to say about the glorious design of the banana."

        "review_title": "A yuletide atrocity",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's no secret that, on both the mainstream and independent circuit of film, Christian cinema has been a big focus in 2014. Films like \"Heaven is for Real,\" \"Noah,\" \"Son of God,\" and next month's \"Exodus: Gods and Kings\" have all catered to the faithful in some way and have gone on to achieve uniformly strong financial numbers as well. The independent circuit has seen big hits like \"God's Not Dead\" and marginal successes like \"Left Behind,\" \"Mom's Night Out,\" \"Persecuted,\" and \"When the Game Stands Tall,\" all of which finding ways to connect with their target audience in at least recognizing their faith in the cinema, a place where it's fair to believe the religious demographic has felt ignored. Former Television star and devout, outspoken Christian Kirk Cameron has now thrown his hat in the ring, latching on to this newfound trend, and effectively making not only the worst film of its genre but the worst film of 2014. \"Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas\" is a disjointed mess, structurally pathetic and morally bankrupt as we watch scenes interwoven with little coherency, dialog written and delivered in its most wooden form, and wonderful morals to teach our children, like \"materialism is good.\"\n\nThe film begins with Cameron sitting in a blatantly artificial living room, decorated with more Christmas lights and flair than Macy's after Thanksgiving passes, giving us an introduction to the film at hand. He states the biggest problem with the Christmas season is the \"people\" who want to segregate the spread of faith and good cheer to the private homes of those who celebrate the holiday or simply want the holiday done away with all together. He rambles on for about three minutes as the introduction sets the perfect theme for this film; it's a circumventing project that never results in a specific or thoughtfully-articulated point.\n\nWe cut to a Christmas party held by Cameron's sister, where a Santa has been hired, the tree has been erected, the house has been decorated, a feast has been prepared, and everyone is in an incorruptibly cheery mood; everyone except Cameron's brother-in-law Christian (director Darren Doane), who is seen moping around the house before quietly slipping away to his car. Kirk follows Christian and learns the materialism of Christmas bothers him immensely, as he watches kids beg for toys they won't play with in three weeks and parents max out their credit cards, giving way to the materials and the illuminating tree in the center of the room, and all while neglecting the baby Jesus in the manger, who is the ultimate \"reason for the season.\"\n\nCameron begins to initiate flashbacks to biblical times to \"justify\" why we have the Christmas traditions that we do. However, it's not enough that we get a history lesson told from the enormously biased lens of Cameron, but in a dodgy and muddled manner. Cameron gets absorbed in the significance of baby Jesus's swaddling cloth and the original mean-spirited roots of Saint Nicholas (something that will undoubtedly scare and confuse children), never addressing Christian's true distaste for the holiday season. Kirk meanders for about forty minutes, talking himself in incoherent and redundant circles, never addressing Christian's questions in a way that we can extract counterpoints or citing Christmas's Pagan and cultist roots (if you're going to show Saint Nicholas as a brute, at least address the backstory).\n\nInterjected in these ridiculously dry biblical flashbacks and in-car dialogs are exaggerated characters masquerading as likable people with personalities drawn so wide they are desperately unfunny. We see two party guests discuss \"The War on Christmas,\" relating it to several other conspiracy theories that just feels like a soundoff of paranoia. We get a few minutes of dead-end, annoying conversation and some of the worst displays of acting this year before it's back to the car for a half-assed lecture.\n\n\"Saving Christmas\" ends with an abhorrent dance number to an incorrigible techno/rap hybrid, with members of the cast obnoxiously dancing and doing slow-motion choreography together. We end things with a perfunctory voice-over with Cameron before we're greeted by almost ten minutes of closing credits showing bloopers, outtakes, and a barrage of other things padding this project to just barely being feature- length (eighty minutes). If my plot synopsis sounds like it has not made any sense, then I have effectively lived up to the structure and the narrative pace of this particular film.\n\nJust by comparing the full-length film to its trailer, you can tell \"Saving Christmas\" was Cameron's last minute idea to cash in on the Christian cinema craze of the year. The trailer for the film talks about how Christmas has been corrupted by materialism and the political correctness of the holiday. However, Cameron blatantly contradicts his thesis when he states during the closing monologue that \"materialism is good\" because Christmas is about \"God taking possession of a material body.\" Aside from ushering in a pathetic excuse for a moral at the end of a film about Christmas, the cardinal sins committed here run amuck: a sloppy narrative hodgepodge of biblical flashbacks, inept lecturing, and pointless filler clearly padding a small runtime, atrocious acting on all fronts, a desperate attempt at \"staying hip\" and keeping the attention of the audience by throwing in a hip-hop dance number, contemptible morals, and failure to address or even stick to a cogent thesis. Kirk Cameron and company should be required to volunteer at local charities or help cater several breakfasts with Santa to make up for such a yuletide atrocity."

Not at all. Most everyone I know and love _are_ Christians. Die-hard, conservative, dyed-in-the-wool Fox-news-loving fundamentalist Christians. And even THEY thought this movie sucked.\n\nThat Kirk tried to use religious guilt on people to have the ratings artificially inflated is just pathetic. Seriously, dude, you have a problem. You need help. Get some. :-/ My opinion of this movie is pretty much the same as the opinions of EVERYONE I know who's actually had the misfortune of deciding to give it a try. It would be pure camp if those who made it weren't being so stone-faced serious. It's patronizing, condescending, childish and just downright _bad_. And it's not the message, itself - even those I know who agree with the central point Kirk's trying to make see the movie as doing more harm than good.\n\nAs for that illicit ratings-inflating campaign, it appears to be bearing fruit. When you have a movie with overwhelmingly bad ratings (and I man REALLY bad, where most are just 1-star with, shall we say, \"Nothing nice to say...\"), and just a couple of profiles with 10-star ratings and glowing things to say, and ALL of those 10-star profiles were clearly just set up just to make the glowing review about just that one movie... I'm not going to outright accuse anyone of anything, but, well, it doesn't inspire confidence in their legitimacy.\n\nI mean seriously, dude, stop it. You're not helping Christianity's image at all. In fact, you're making it worse. Even if you don't care about your own image, you should seriously give thought to how much more damage you want to do to the Christian image in the U.S. today. Or are you a closet atheist trying to destroy the \"enemy\" from within? Your actions are hurting far more than helping.\n\nAnd I have nothing against Christianity or religion in general. If people want to be proud of their religion and remind themselves of the spin Christianity has added to the meaning of all these previously-existing traditions and holidays, that's wonderful. But this? This isn't _that_. This is just pandering, patronizing, exploiting - pure and simple.\n\nPlease, Kirk, get help."

I don't think anyone was expecting it to be like this with the random dance scenes, the stereotyped black guy, the stereotypical atheist, and everything else.\n\nAnd now here is an example of Cameron's crazy points about Christmas: -The Christmas tree is not Pagen, it is because Adam and Eve stole from the tree of knowledge and to make up for the original sin, Jesus returned the fruit which was part of man by hanging himself on a cross, which is made of wood which naturally comes from a tree. So trees are really crosses and the Christmas tree is a cross.\n\nI did not make that up, that is seriously an argument he makes.\n\nAnd the whole movie is so insane that you have to see it to believe it. I don't think this movie will harm society because I think most Christians who make a big deal about the \"War on Christmas\" will be horrified by this and those who actually buy into it were probably lost causes. But if you want to see a man who clearly needs to be institutionalized just be gloriously and honestly insane, then watch this movie.

It sets out to present a conservative Christian point of view, and does that openly and unapologetically.

More accurately, it never should have been released at all. All this film equates to is a big stroke of Cameron's ego. He is clearly in love with himself, and I'm sure every review, good or bad, makes him feel all the more confident. It's sad, but true. Or, maybe he was just trying to do something nice for his family. If you have the money, why not make a movie with your sister so she can feel like a star too. Unfortunately, she probably feels more shame than good.\n\nThere is no doubt here. This is a bad movie. Yes, I might even say it's the worst movie ever. I've never walked out on a movie before, and that record still holds. However, the thought passed my mind several times while watching. I now feel ashamed of myself that I did not. The bastardization of Christianity that this movie inflicts upon the viewer is almost unbearable. I'm sad to know that I supported Mr. Cameron by paying to see this film. However, I am happy to see this filth voted into oblivion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Forget the laughably shoddy production value, the overt preaching, and Kirk Cameron's epic social media temper tantrum when the film was critically panned. All you need to know is that Cameron's message about Christmas is the opposite of what one would expect from a movie called \"Saving Christmas.\"\n\nSee, that whole \"saving Christmas\" storyline has been played out in kids' movies and Hallmark specials over and over again, and it's always about stripping away the commercialism and materialism and getting back into friends and family.\n\nKirk does the exact opposite in this film: He CELEBRATES and ENCOURAGES rabid commercialism. And worst of all, he even attempts to justify his materialism -- his greed and narcissism -- by claiming that's the good proper Christian thing to do.\n\nSo if not from rabid consumerism, what is Kirk Cameron trying to save Christmas from? From people celebrating, or even acknowledging the existence of, other holidays besides Christmas, from non-Christians celebrating Christmas, and from Christians celebrating Christmas any other way than the way Kirk Cameron believes you should.\n\nIn short, this is eighty minutes of Kirk Cameron trying to cram one hundred pounds of his self-absorbed discount-salvation bull**** into a one-pound bag, slap \"Christmas Spirit\" on it with a label maker, and hopelessly attempt to cram it down your throat.\n\nUnless you are a raving fascist fundamentalist who only hasn't watched this movie because you are afraid of what will happen if you turn your 24/7 Fox News feed off, this movie is guaranteed to make you very angry. It does to Christmas the exact opposite of what the title promises: It delivers unto Christ this biggest black eye in our lifetime."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to admit, that I hadn't even planed to go to the movies on the day that I walked into \"Saving Christmas\". There was nothing on offer that interested me, so I turned to figure another way to squander my money. But then I saw the name \"Kirk Cameron\", saw that pasty face on the poster and two words came to my mind: \"Crockoduck\" and \"Banana\"! Yes, through the internet-memes and jokes I had been exposed to Cameron and his ilk. Upon realizing that those people were not comedians, I figured this was the most hilarious insane stuff I had heard in a long time and that Kirk Cameron may well be the missing brother of \"Dumb and Dumber\". So I flashed the buck, walked in and expected much unintentional hilarity and future memes in the making.\n\nThere were about 10 to 15 people sitting in the cinema, most with kids (I presume they were expecting a Christmas comedy). For a good deal of the beginning we are exposed to Cameron brattling on about some things or other, but it was mainly boring, nonsensical stuff that contained no (unintentional) comedy gold. Only when Kirk spouts that \"god created winter solstice\", there was some chuckling to be heard. Not bad, but heard before (what hasn't god created allegedly? Cars, air, shoes, bacteria, the universe and everything else, etc \u2013 this answer will give you a guaranteed A+ in any bible- or koran-school). At this point Cameron is sitting in some car with another guy and, like a true believer he keeps rambling and rambling and rambling. Nodded off for awhile but since I have a light sleep and get easily awoken by noise, I can only deduct that there was no joke missed since nobody had been laughing so far. At what I presume must have been the end of the \"movie\" there was some ridiculous dance-sequence (you know the type that should signify to the audience that they're watching a 'hip' film) and I decided to call it a day. As I turned to leave, I noticed that the cinema was empty and that I was the last rat to leave the sinking ship. So I left Kirk and his friends to dance to an empty cinema \u2013 and for all I know, they still dance there as I write.\n\nLook, we are all aware that people will believe much if only it gives them a crutch for reality. Virgins giving birth, horses flying from Mekka to Jerusalem overnight, zombies rising from the grave in order to bring world-peace, etc. It would be pointless (and perhaps even unkind) to point out that virgins cannot give birth, horses don't fly and that the dead stay dead. But that's were magic and science clash, alchemy has to make way or chemistry and believe hollers at common-sense and knowledge. Nothing new there, it's been going on since the stone-age. But the stuff that Cameron and his ilk have formulated here (to put it kindly), that's a whole new dimension of crazy. It reeks not only of fanatics but of self-serving. And the worst sin: this movie is boring, tedious and free of laughs, no matter which way you slice it.\n\nThe lesson learned: it can be mildly amusing to watch a five minute YouTube video about a deranged guy, but giving him 80 minutes of your live, that's simply not a good idea. It's like holding a 'deep' conversation with a bunch of jehova's witness or the guy on the corner with the \"the end is nigh\"-sign \u2013 what's the point if no real laughs are to be had? Just wait for the internet-meme; if there's something worth laughing about, the \"haters\" will find and post if for sure (and it's free!). \"Jesus Camp\" was funnier (and \"Jesus Camp\" was actually a very sad movie). This here is \"IMDB Bottom-100\"-material.\n\nNow, enough electronic ink wasted on this. Let's make space for those who found the movie \"exceptional\", \"inspirational\" and \"great education\" \u2013 you might be able to guess from which corner those come.\n\nWhat I give this tripe? Of course nothing. If you see a one point rating, it probably comes from god (pardon, meant to say IMDb)"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Jesus became Material... so that is why materialism is OK\" - is pretty much the summary of the movie. There are some Christians who do not participate in Christmas for many reasons. Kirk apparently wanted to respond to this crowd by producing this low budget, effortless film. Not only does he do his best to destroy any solid logic for celebrating Christmas, he paints fellow (non Christmas observing) believers as grumpy, ignorant, radical, and stupid. Thus, giving mainstream Christianity a horrible image. Essential Kirk has brought Christian evangelism 2 steps back in reaching the world with the true message of salvation and replaced it with justification, poor logic, and and a refocus of the faith, not of Christ, but on emotion.\n\nKirk attempted to encourage Christians with logic and reasoning to defend the mainstream stance of Christmas.... he failed.\n\nI left this film wanting more to NOT celebrate Christmas than I did celebrate it. Horrible film, waste of money, and waste of time.\n\nAn E for Effort would not even be suitable to merit this film... No effort was placed in it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Full disclosure: I am a Roman Catholic, raised by devout parents and taught by dedicated clergy. I happen to subscribe to the view that the \"war on Christmas\" is part of a larger, not necessarily connected, movement whose chief side effect is to eliminate or diminish the chief underpinnings and foundations of western Judeo-Christian society. Lawsuits against Nativity displays are, to me, the handiwork of unhappy zealots.\n\nHaving said all that, this film was earnest but profoundly flawed.\n\nFirst, I didn't appreciate the swipe against the Catholic Church's hierarchy (bishops with high hats and scepters) during the St. Nicholas segment. I do like the St. Nicholas story, but it was contrived here with the original St. Nicholas doing a \"ho-ho-ho\" (I am not kidding) just before being told by his assistant to start the deliveries (presumably of gifts).\n\nSecond, if indeed the simplicity of the original Nativity is to be stressed, with Jesus born to Mary and Joseph in a cave, laid in a feeding manger, then perhaps they should have cast a Mary who had not just had her nails done. There they were, as Mary was holding the Christ child, each nail impeccable - and painted. And their garments? Perfectly clean, even looking like they'd just been ironed.\n\nThird, don't direct so that we can see the direction. Head turns, puzzled looks, earnest looks . . . I shouldn't be hearing in my head the director's exact stage directions. \"OK, look right at him then turn away.\"\n\nFourth, this was not about Saving Christmas. This was about explaining our modern celebration of it - it's already been saved, judging from the frequent references to it being celebrated the world over.\n\nI liked Noah. I liked Narnia. I like the Hobbit movies.\n\nI did not like this one."

It's amazing to what extremes people will go to to trash someone they don't like.\n\nSecondly, Kirk Cameron is cheesy. Yes. He created a low budget film to help spread a message he believes in for Christmas. No, not all of what he says is historically accurate. Though, a lot of it is and he makes some good symbolic connections that we often miss when we read the words of the Bible.\n\nIf you're a Christian and can't see past the production value of this movie you're missing the the forest for the trees.\n\nWe watch this movie every year with our kids. Yes, the production sucks. That's why I only rated it a 7. But, it opens up some fantastic dialogue and questions. Even, questions around the ridiculousness of it."

This film is nothing but a vanity vehicle for Kirk Cameron, it's self congratulatory and he comes off like a 12 year old locked in a toy store over night. His performance is a wreck, his exaggerated enthusiasm is cringe-worthy and at any minute you expect him to giggle and shout \"Hey Ma!

However this film broke my spirit and has caused me to not only reject my faith in God but in humanity all together.\n\nEach scene is worse than the last as Kirk Cameron uses the first portion of the film gathering wood, nails and a microphone to construct what will be int he second half, The worlds largest soap box.\n\nAs a former pastor I once sat for a 5 hour sermon and still think this film is more preaching than that.\n\nWhen the film ended two thoughts crossed my mind, One was the strangely absent 'That's All Folks\" Looney Toones ending and the second was a written apology and or refund of my money.\n\nDon't watch this film, ever, don't subject your family, friends or even stray animals to this picture.\n\nKirk may be trying to silence the critics but the reality is this movie is so horrid so void of content and character that it may induce suicide in the depressed.\n\nIn summation a 0 ratings needs to exist on IMDb because giving this long winded rambling non non sequitur a 1 is giving it too many stars."

Here is Kirk with his usual mugging and winks to the camera as he leads his audience through a tangled and woefully inaccurate lecture on the mythical \"War on Christmas\". It is just plain awful. I forced myself to watch until the end and it wasn't worth it. It is a really pathetic attempt by a pathetic little man to grab a little cash riding on the coattails of Bill O'Reilly and Fox News. I was hoping at least it would be stupid enough to be funny, but it was just pedantic, dull and annoying. Miss this one and see a real movie."

Based on the little I saw (again, I got all this from the trailer!), this was more of a deranged sermon given by someone who doesn't really know what they're talking about and just decides to wing it and make things up as they go along hoping that you are gullible enough to become one of his followers. If the trailer alone looks like some sort of cult introduction into the land of the stupid, I can only imagine what the movie is like."

The time spent doing so, I will never get back. Disregarding my poor judgment in watching this movie I will give a few observations regarding how I felt about what I saw with these burning orbs still scarred and traumatized at this very minute.\n\nNo spoilers given. The movie opens with a Kirk Cameron monologue followed by a sad attempt at a James Earl Jones like narration on the history of Christianity and Christmas. Although I did enjoy the ska interpretation of Christmas music in the beginning sadly it all went down hill from there. The production value sound and camera-work was top notch and reflected highly on the skill of the crew in Hollywood who work hard everyday with little to no appreciation for their troubles as in most cases the only people recognized are the Director and Actors involved. The continued use of narration by Kirk Cameron interlaced by his own opinions on the matters presented begin to wear thin on the viewer in such a way as to become annoying.\n\nIt was a difficult road to continue to watch this movie to its conclusion. I began to see and think about the perfect means of torturing enemy combatants by forcing them to watch this film on repeat. It was a chore to scrub the feeling from my mind that I was in fact being tortured or perhaps hated myself for purposely assaulting my senses with this pure propaganda piece. It was highly predictable, highly annoying, and the continued forceful narration by Kirk Cameron drove rusted railroad spikes into my ears like a Toolbox Murders horror movie.\n\nI won't spoil the plot as there was none to spoil. If you value your time, your sanity and you like yourself perhaps you shouldn't be so unkind to assault your eyes and ears with this predictable, over narrated, imitation docudrama.\n\nAs a real Christian who does not follow the Pope, a Church, idolize any single person famous or infamous, I only follow my heart, my convictions, my love for humanity, my hope for peace and happiness for all mankind.\n\nIf I could rate this movie .01/10 I would, and after watching this drivel I would wish that IMDb would allow us the option to rate 0/10."

At least I suspect that's how this movie was made, Cameron was probably throwing a Christmas party and realized he could make a quick buck, got some cameras, and through this together in under an hour. There is little story to speak of, beyond Cameron preaching to the audience that rampant materialism in the holiday season is OKAY by Jesus was a corporeal being and therefore, material. Intercut within this overlong audience fillbuster are recreations of all the wonderful Christmas imagery we have come to know and love, like the soldiers of King Herod murdering hundreds of babies, and a terrifying-looking Saint Nicholas beating a man to death because he didn't agree with him. Cameron goes to great lengths to explain away holiday traditions like a decorated tree and gifts, but the audience will be far too distracted by the weird bunch-ups in Doane's Christmas sweater, and his weird, pause-filled delivery that will make you think he's some kind of serial killer. And of course, are film ends on a completely random hip-hop dance number that exists only so that Cameron can show us that yes, he can do the worm. This film we leave you scalping yourself because you're scratching your head in bewilderment, trying to comprehend what you've just seen. Even the likes of David Lynch would look at that movie and say it's too much.

His complete lack of accuracy concerning the actual beginnings of the Christmas holiday not only make the movie a laughable joke, but also showcase his ignorance, therefore ALL Christian's ignorance (He seems to like taking credit for speaking for all Christians) A 10 minute search on the internet will inform even the most staunch Catholic that EVERY aspect of Christmas including the iconic Christmas tree, gift-giving, yule logs, etc, were all adapted by early Christian leaders from PAGAN sources! Here's another quick fact; Jesus wasn't born in December! He was probably born sometime during the Summer months. He is also apparently unaware that when the Puritans settled in America, they OUTLAWED all Christmas celebrations for almost 80 years! We are also treated to more whining about the removal of manger displays, etc from public areas. Yet not a single display on a truly PUBLIC area has been forced to be be removed by public outcry (at least none that I have heard about) Instead, most manger displays that have been removed were on State or Federal property! And yes, THIS IS a violation of the \"Separation of Church & State\" laws. All in all, the movie is a complete mess! Loaded with self indulgent garbage, this waste of film is also horribly written and directed with acting so far below par as to make a grade school play seems like Shakespeare in the Round.

Kirk, there is no war on Christmas -- only people making money off of other people's persecution complexes and desire to play the victim. This film is good for a few laughs, until you realize some people actually take this stuff seriously. Looks like it was made by a high school audio video club and it consists of nothing but Fox News type statements about the demonic forces of secularism trying to destroy Christmas (which must be a surprise to those who continue to receive Christmas presents each year and the billions of adds on TV for Christmas bargains). Christians should be more concerned about starving children than whether someone says Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas."

I do not think that is a bad thing. The movie could have been much better if it removed the 'conspiracy scene' and 'the over-excitement dance scene'. It could have added more elements on why it is important to celebrate Christmas. It certainly is not the worst movie out there. 1.4 is not the rating this movie required. 4-5 would be apt but since this movie is soo underrated, I am going to give it a 7.\n\nKids may like this movie. I do not think that it is as bad as people say it is. More people with open minds should watch and decide for themselves."

The madness is universally expressed by all characters present, leading to an unsettling conclusion: this is not about Jesus at all, but a tale of a party in which the hot chocolate somehow becomes contaminated with marijuana. Suddenly the strange giggling in the car, the hallucinogenic Santa segment and the random conspiracy theory scene with two minor characters makes sense when viewed this way.

It's surprising that a man of faith like Kirk Cameron would have done something like this, since that must surely make him a lousy evangelist. What is salvageable is the soundtrack and some of the scenes that Kirk is narrating since they are worthy of a music video. The story is too short and the conflict is resolved at once, but there is a lot of filler and a lot of slow motion so that the film lasts longer. It pretends to be a comedy, but it's not funny. It also has many historical errors that are difficult to take seriously and it is not understood if Kirk wanted to give a metaphorical meaning to the Christmas things that he considers Christian. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but it's a bad movie and that's why I give it a 3/10."

This movie is a sermon, a bad one, that is nothing less than a rant about trying to redeem the holiday, which has never been Christian to begin with.

        "review_detailed_main": "Watched 'Saving Christmas' out of curiosity to see if it really was as bad as the universal panning, its ranking on the Bottom 100 and its Razzie wins and nominations in most categories made out. The film is not available in my country, but the full film can be found online for anyone to see just in case anybody is wondering how it came to be watched by me.\n\nFinally seeing 'Saving Christmas', it turned out it not only really is that terrible but is one of my most regretted film viewings. One where a very early bailing was strongly considered but generously stuck with it in order to be fair, never judge films without seeing the whole thing (wish that more people did that instead of bragging about walking out after twenty minutes or something similarly ridiculous). It is by far the worst film of 2014, an easy contender for the worst of the decade and is bottom 5 material.\n\nAnd Kirk Cameron's immature and condescending defence of 'Saving Christmas' and attacking those who hated it (note to Mr Cameron, you don't have to be an atheist or even religious to find 'Saving Christmas' a terrible film, speaking as someone who is neither but with not a biased against Christians bone in my body) is a perfect example of what is wrong with how people express their opinions on film, critics and film watchers today. People who have an inability to tell the difference between fact and opinion, resort to the \"I'm right and you're wrong\" clich\u00e9 and have to insult others, bash critics and invent ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories.\n\nBack to talking about 'Saving Christmas', the whole thing is hopelessly inept. It feels very slapped together with no rhyme or coherence, with amateurishly designed, written and acted biblical flashbacks, a lot of padding with scenes that go on forever (got tired of the scenes in the car fast, which saw lots of forced at best acting and gobbledegook that passes for dialogue), lots of repetition (like with the hot chocolate and the car conversations) and others having no reason for being there and Cameron's dubious generalisations (refuse to call them facts) and narration that come over as preachy, biased, self-absorbed sermonising standing out as especially bad. Oh and that ending dance sequence was an abomination in every sense, pacing, choreography, music, everything.\n\nIt even looks bad, with some of the most artificial production values one will find anywhere let alone a film, complete with pedestrian photography and disjointed editing. The music was instantly forgettable as soon as the film was finally over and as for the direction, what direction? There is no coherence to the whole thing, the pacing is all over the place (interminably dull mostly) and there has never been more non-existent direction of actors, even on films riffed on MST3K.\n\nWriting is appalling from heavy-handed, egotistical start to abominable finish. That for Cameron has already been discussed but there is nothing heart-warming, funny or insightful about 'Saving Christmas', nothing that makes one think hard or feel anything. For a festive occasion, one couldn't imagine and will never see again a more drearily portrayed Christmas, this actually felt like it was made by people who hated Christmas even more than Ebeneezer Scrooge did. One is just bored out of their mind and angry at their life being wasted on a film that has no engagement, is so poorly put together and made, is impossible to learn anything from or get emotionally invested in and talks at them. Am not easily preached at, but 'Saving Christmas' talked at and down to me.\n\nCameron's \"acting\" is extremely forced and patronising, pretty much like mugging, throughout and his huge ego bursts alive just as much on screen, in his material and how he delivered it, as it did when he attacked those who panned the film for far more legitimate reasons than he and the very small minority agreeing with him can ever give for finding any kind of value in the film. To me he is hypocritical as well as egotistical, due to that it is Christians that are more likely than anybody else to feel patronised to the most. The other cast members are not worth mentioning, don't even remember many, that's how much Cameron and his ego dominates.\n\nOverall, one of, and one of the biggest examples of, not many irredeemably awful films out there. Unless watching for curiosity's sake, this is a must avoid. 0/10 (an unheard of rating for me these days, have grown to hate giving them out, but 'Saving Christmas' is in the top 10 of the most deserving recipients of it).

        "review_detailed_main": "A question I kept thinking as I somehow went through Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas was 'how is this even a movie?' In the interest of full disclosure I have to admit I didn't go into this expecting it to be very good. That may be a fault on my end, to enter into any movie to do that, but the hype I had heard about this thing - that it was among the craziest pieces of WTF put to screen in the past several years (if ever) - made me too curious to not avoid it. I think also the idea of, frankly, Christian nutter Kirk Cameron going on about the War on Christmas made me wonder if he would make it a screed against those who would denigrate the most sacred of holidays... well, rest assured, it's not that. It's so much wilder than anything you'd hear on FOX News by a pundit. It's a unique specimen in how NOT to make something with a camera and sound equipment and what I guess are sets and maybe some actors(?) and a would-be director-cum-actor-cum-writer. I mean, Jesus this movie...\n\nFirst of all, it's not really a movie, not in the way that we have anything close to compelling characters or dialog together. What we get following an introduction by Cameron (playing himself) where he sips his hot cocoa smugly and bemoans those who don't enjoy Christmas whole-heartedly (smugly in that way that he is constantly smiling and literally preaching to the camera, surrounded by a fireplace and tree and the accouterments of the holiday), is the story of 'Christian' (GET IT?) who seems to be the sad-sod at the holiday party - also Cameron's brother in law - who isn't in the spirit. He is actually depicted harshly, all in voice-over of course (because why show us things when you can TELL us, at length), as someone who looks down on the Christmas holiday and isn't into the 'spirit' of the season. Cut to a Christian sitting in his parked car in the drive-way, and Kirk gets into the passenger seat. This is where the \"meat\" of the movie takes place. Boy howdy.\n\nThis is a straw-man preach-fest, where Christian, after espousing actually (to me) *reasonable* thoughts about how the money and effort spent on putting up decorations and on presents and so on could be used to help feed the poor and do things that aren't part of actual teachings in the Bible as far as the trappings of the modern holiday goes. Here's where it gets weird: Cameron basically spends the rest of the movie, in really shoddy voice-over over \"scenes\" showing things like what the swaddling cloth the Baby Jesus was covered with and Christmas trees and Santa Claus actual mean and how they're \"REALLY\" connected to the Bible. In other words, it's all deep down justifying why things like the commercialization of the holiday, presents, hot f***ing chocolate, are fine in this time and age. And if the part about the swaddling cloth, and how he makes these connections that just are not there don't make you tear your hair out, the connection with Christmas trees to the *Christ on the Cross* will get you more.\n\nOne might say that at least Cameron isn't really *mean* with his statements here, and it's certainly not the usual war on Christmas screed. No, the one part you get the latter is in a really jarring and rather unnecessary scene (as if anything here IS necessary to begin with, but even in this context) where it cuts to a scene in the party between two characters - one the (I'm not kidding) token black guy, and the token, uh, conspiracy theorist - and the latter brings up things like Loose Change and Fox News and the war on Christmas like... are we supposed to see him as crazy or a joke or believe him? Aside from being ludicrous (in the best possible way) as this character goes through a monologue with a mug over his mouth so that everything can be ADR'd, it seems so muddled. Is this a joke?\n\nWhat the hell did I just watch? Even if I believed whatever crazy horse-pucky that Cameron spouted here - and to give you an idea of how far out this stuff is, Republican president candidate (and fan of grain-in-the-pyramids theory) Ben Carson gives an endorsement on the DVD cover - the production quality is barely above that of Birdemic. Many shots are just really bizarrely staged (the scene between the two token characters is framed in such a way I want to show it to film school students to see if they know it's correct or not, if they think the former, they're automatically flunking, period). Other times, like the 'recreations' of what Cameron is preaching about in the car, it looks like they didn't have enough money for things like other actors to play the parts - I can't be sure but it looks like Kirk was \"Bad\" Santa in a couple of key shots - and on sets that look like they filmed on a stage in a high school auditorium. Oh, and there's a hip-hop dance sequence that pads out the run-time for what is essentially a LECTURE by Cameron, padded by the token characters and Christian the Straw-Man, and funded by a fundamentalist university.\n\nIf you watch this and believe this stuff, I feel sorry for you. Go do your own research, see if you can challenge this guy on his claims. But even if everything he said was valid or had some credibility (and it doesn't), the quality of what went into this production makes it easily a contender for among the ten worst films of all time."

I don't know where the symbols came from. I choose to decorate by my own personal likes and dislikes and not other people's opinions. What I walked away from the movie feeling was, 'don't let the haters embitter you and take the joy out of your own personal celebration.' Keep the joy in your Christmas celebration, whether you 100% with zero doubts fully understand every single aspect or not. For those of you who believe and celebrate Christmas, Have a joyous Christmas! For those of you who don't believe and resent the existence of Christmas, why don't you go look up something on a topic that you like rather than stress yourself out by enraging yourself to the point of wanting to attack other people. Live and let live."

If there was an option to erase the movie from my memory and from the public domain completely, I would have taken that one.\n\nChristmas (really, the holidays in general), are not about Christ. This time of year is about giving and thanking. Yeah, we all say we love to give, but oh boy that new flat screen sure makes me a happy man. And the fact that people have to pull politics and religion into this time of year is disappointing.\n\nAnyway, this movie is not worth the time of the trailer. Heed my warning, and stop now! Just love one another (or so the saying goes), and enjoy this time of year! It's cold and miserable, but somewhat magical. Just wear protection."

I mean, it definitely does reach the \"so bad it's good\" territory several times, and never seems to realize that it is indeed a bad movie (i.e. Sharknado, Birdemic 2). From strangely dated depictions of race to utterly confusing explanations of religion and holidays, this movie never lets up on the head-scratching levels of bizarre decisions. So like Troll 2 and The Room before it, director Darren Doane and producer/actor/egomaniac Kirk Cameron strike fool's gold with this aborted fetus of a film."

I don't use the word propaganda very often but it felt a little like it. Just don't see this one, its not worth the time.

At least no anti-Christian \"Away in the Manger\" reference. \"Eternal god taking on a material body\". I dislike polytheistic language - no god-type, thank you very much. Moreover, better to specify God the son as having become human. Santa Claus (Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas)) is depicted as an angry (orthodox) bishop beating the hell out of the heretic Arius at the C4 Council of Nicea: poetic amplification from a medieval folk-tale of Bishop Nicholas trying to slap some sense into a follower of Arius. In reality, Nicea probably had more freedom of speech than the BBC, really wished to hear Arius and other ideas, and probably Bp. Nicholas wasn't there. An interesting take on Christmas trees as linking Genesis to Golgotha. Arguably the film drags a fair bit (keep going at least the first 5 minutes), but some good acting and good fun sustains it, plus its invitation to at least rethink what the Christmas event really meant and means, even if we don't buy Kirk's take. Particulars aside, Kirk's generalisation is valid: instead of knocking the accrued tinsel of Christmas, see how they can point to deeper reality, but don't go singing to Christmas trees. A good hip-hop number at the end."

Apparently, Christain is a jerk and he is ruining Christmas for everyone even though he never publicly said to anyone (aside from Kirk) that he hated Christmas.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I reviewed The Last Airbender last year, I figured it would be the worst movie I would bother writing about on here. This one is something special. I have given very few films a 1/10 rating, as in order to do so, I must feel that it's devoid of all artistic and entertainment value. Because Saving Christmas fits the bill, I've given it that rarest of honors.\n\nWhen Kirk (Kirk Cameron) sees that his friend Christian (Darren Doane) isn't enjoying Christmas, he sits down with him to explain away his concerns about the holiday.\n\nI once saw a movie called Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny that was worse than Saving Christmas. I guess that's about the best I can say about it.\n\nThe movie feels like a short film drawn out to an hour and twenty minutes. The main \"narrative\" involves 38 minutes of two men sitting in a car interrupted by slow motion flashbacks and fifteen minutes afterward dedicated to a dance sequence and credits/bloopers. That leaves the remaining half hour or so for slow motion footage, plodding narrations, and an obsession with hot chocolate. This is a movie that is terribly difficult to sit through.\n\nWhile it's clear that the film's technical integrity was at best a quickly abandoned afterthought in favor of its thematic material, the fact that it fails there as well is damning evidence of how poor this movie is. Saving Christmas isn't even about putting Christ back in Christmas, as the poster claims, but is instead about Cameron making up some spots to stick Him in. Much of the movie consists of Cameron explaining to his friend how different traditions had Christian meanings all along, such as Christmas trees representing Christ's cross, presents representing city skylines, and snow globes representing nativity scenes. The cast is likely a group of people that Cameron knows, and let's just say the few non-white people present really stand out. The only black character with a speaking role, Diondre (played by a man named David), is a jive-talkin', hip-hop-lovin' DJ who fits just about every stereotype you would expect of a man in this kind of movie.\n\nThe worst part of this film, both onscreen and off, is Kirk Cameron himself. From this movie and the events surrounding its release, he strikes me as arrogant and self-aggrandizing. Every smug, nonsensical explanation that he offers to his friend is met with immediate awe and reverence. In reality, what he says throughout the film is at best naive and at worst falsehoods, distortions, and misrepresentations of both Christian and pagan histories. The fact that Cameron wrote these interactions framing himself as flawlessly as he did says something about the man's character.\n\nHe goes as far as to praise Christmas-season materialism by declaring it to be a way to thank God for taking on a material body. That comparison is inherently trivial, as beyond the equivocation of the word \"material\", Cameron is describing every holiday and how it is celebrated. That is, of course, unless there is some ethereal holiday that cannot be celebrated by any physical means. What am I even talking about at this point?\n\nSaving Christmas is among the worst movies I've ever seen. It is an abject failure in all matters spiritual, historical, visual, audible, and ethical. At the core of this travesty is a pretentious, one-man charge toward desperate re-appropriation of Christmas traditions by a man who sees himself as our cultural savior. The acting is bad, the writing is bad, the message is bad, the music is bad, the dancing is bad, the jokes is bad, and the hot chocolate is probably bad. Do not watch this movie."

Worst, the film completely misses its own point.\n\nCameron has blamed \"atheists\" and \"haters\" for the bottom-of-the-barrel reviews this pile has garnered, but he gives those groups far too much credit.

        "review_detailed_main": "Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas officially joins Santa Claus (1959), Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny, and Santa Conquers the Martians as the worst Christmas films ever made. At least those films had a few moments that were so-bad-they're good. This is an insult to intelligence! It currently stands at number 2 on this site's Bottom 100. I would place it top 10...there's just a few other films I've seen that I found worse.\n\nLet me start out by saying that I am a practising Catholic. I don't claim to be an expert on religion or the Bible as humility on the subject needs to be kept. Kirk Cameron could really use some of that too. Let me also say that there have been a few interviews where I agree with what Cameron debates. But this film made me lose all respect for him.\n\nSaving Christmas looks like a mockbuster. A \"mockbuster\" is a low-budget (sometimes micro- budget) rip-off of a huge film being released at the same time that is meant to capitalize on the bigger film's success. They look like they have a budget of $4. This movie literally looks like a micro-budget film. It stars Kirk Cameron playing himself who's hosting a Christmas party. The scenes that show the party are agonizing. The acting is unbelievably bad! His brother Christian is sick of the materialistic nature that Christmas has become and wants to put \"Christ\" back in \"Christmas.\" He hides out in his car to do some thinking where idiotic Kirk comes to talk to him about his insecurities. This is the plot and it doesn't sound that bad eh? Only Kirk Cameron and company could take a subject worthy of discussion and spin it out of control.\n\nSo what's so bad about the story? Sure the acting is horrid and the budget is low, but that's not the worst. The majority of the movie takes place in Christian's car with Cameron doing voice-overs in dramatizations of what he's taking about. Those dramatizations are very bad and unnecessary. It could have been a \"My Dinner With Andre\" style and kept the camera on them the whole time, but nooooooo. The technological issues are bad enough, and these little scenes just add fuel to the fire! And what Kirk talks about are all wrong and make no sense. The first thing that Christian complains about is the materialistic possession in Christmas and Kirk says all that stuff is great. Right away that's wrong. And he just goes on to randomly and falsely talk about Jesus' birth without even saying how that ties in with Christian's issue. Next is his shpeel about Christmas trees. Again, wrong explanation! And Kirk saying why Christmas is celebrated on December 25 is wrong too! Studies show that He was born around August. And that goes on and on with what feels like forever.\n\nKirk Cameron's buddy in Christian director and pastor Alex Kendrick who I think is great. He could not save this mess. Any self-respecting Christian or anybody with half a brain can see that this is not a good film. It practically makes a mockery of the Messiah! Cameron caused a backlash with what he said was done by \"atheists.\" It's not just atheists, it is also Christians that know better than you, Kirk!\n\nInstead of making a movie about Christ in Christmas, get somebody who knows their stuff to do a documentary on the subject.\n\n0/4"

This people, is why the evangelical prosperity business is worth billions in the US.

As he grew up however, and found religion, he moved away from the normal Hollywood fare and started making \"Christian\" movies. Now I don't care about any of that. If a movie has a Christian message it's fine so long as the movie is good. But this movie is far from good and just shows the utter drek that \"Christian\" movies tend to provide.\n\nThe movie is supposed to provide a \"new\" understanding of Christmas and what it means. When you get down to it, it's a pagan holiday with all it's trappings that was co-opted by the early church. The people didn't care because they still got to party like they did before but instead of it being a celebration of the end of the year and a feast in honor of Saturn, it was now about Jesus. What we get instead is something that looks like a home movie and Kirk Cameron and the director sitting in a car for most of the run time and talking. Well it's more like Kirk lecturing to the other guy about the meaning of Christmas and injecting new information which the other guy just accepts as being true without questioning. Kirk even admits at some point that these stories are just that, they're just stories. But new stories in an attempt to change the way the holiday is seen. In a sense he's trying to rewrite history in order to match his personal views.\n\nAlong the way there's some bad attempts at comedy here and there and, I kid you now, a 10 minute dance scene at the end that just feels like it was there to pad out the running time. And even then the movie is barely 80 minutes long.\n\nRightfully this was savaged by the critics and the audience who saw it for what it was. And the most ironic thing is that Kirk actually asked Christians to go and rig the vote on \"Rotten Tomatoes\" to bump up the score whether they had seen the movie or not. That's right. Kirk was asking people to lie which, as far as I remember, is not something that his God looks too favorably upon. That was met with the Streisand Effect and if anything it drove the score even lower.\n\nThis is a misguided movie in every sense of the word."

So what's a wannabe filmmaker to do if their film is only a scant 60 minutes long? Pad out the runtime with slow motion dancing, blooper reels, and various other outtakes and filler material, that's what! 20 minutes worth of that can barely bring the film up to its current 80 minutes run time, and it's a long 80 minutes .\n\nBarely even \"so bad it's good\", mostly just dull and ponderous, and kind of creepy at times.

Right off the bat, Kirk starts projecting by claiming there's people who want Christians to keep their holiday spirit it to themselves. Where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, like how homophobic Christians pushed \"don't ask, don't tell\"?\n\nThe entire next hour or so is just as disastrous as the introduction. Kirk tries (and succeeds, way too easily, I might add, especially when it looks like he's about to laugh in his face each time Kirk finishes a lecture) to win over his brother in law - the none-too-subtly named Christian White - with absurd arguments that today's Christmas symbolism is, in fact, rooted in the Bible and has nothing to do with idolatry or paganism whatsoever, and finally argues that materialism is good because Christ is God in his \"material\" form. Which... no. Just no. We're talking about two different meanings of the word \"material\". And besides, the gospels EXPLICITLY condemn wealth. It still feels weird having to explain the Bible to fundamentalist Christians as an apostate, yet here I am. Also, Kirk arguing that nutcrackers, who according to him represent the soldiers of King Herod that tried to kill Jesus when he was a baby, have a place in Christmas decorations because they're part of the story of Jesus, despite never actually killing him but killing a bunch of other innocent babies. Oh, really? Well if that were so, then why don't we have decorations of Judas Iscariot and Pontius Pilate out on Easter? They were directly responsible for Jesus' crucifixion, so why aren't THEY treated with the same respect given to nutcrackers/Herod's soldiers on Christmas?\n\nThere are maybe a few valid points that Kirk makes every once in a while. You know what they say about broken clocks, after all. Of course symbols see usage across several different cultures. Just look at the swastika and the pentagram, for instance. But he forgets that - according to Christianity - if the symbol is being used by pagans, it's blasphemy and idolatry, whereas with Christians, it's completely acceptable. Similarly, the movie makes jabs at conspiracy theorists who willingly swallow and digest whatever Alex Jones tells them whatever the government is secretly doing. I love a dig at those whackjobs as much as any relatively sane person, but the hypocrisy comes in when you remember Kirk believes IN EARNEST that there's a war on Christmas and that Christians are being expected to keep it to themselves, and engages in just as many ridiculous mental gymnastics as they do to justify the use of materialism and symbols of pagan origin on a supposedly Christian holiday.\n\nHonestly, I would recommend watching this movie at least once. It's good for a laugh, and unlike certain other Christian propaganda flicks, it doesn't really cause any harm. Sure, the token black character is clearly supposed to be the stereotypical comic relief, and the glorification of materialism is all wrong, but otherwise it doesn't make the dangerous generalizations or give terrible advice for its target audience that they'd expect them to take to heart like God's Not Dead."

        "review_detailed_main": "The introduction was slow. The five of us were in our queen-sized bed watching it on my laptop, and my 6-year-old passed out before the introduction was over. Not knowing about the movie prior, I would have thought this was how it was going to be throughout it, which made me a little nervous. I kept looking over at my 9-year-old to check if she was still paying attention. Thankfully she's got a longer attention span than my 6-year-old.\n\nThe movie starts with Kirk Cameron attending his sister's huge Christmas party that she throws every year. The house is gorgeous\u2013 everything is decorated beautifully, there are a ton of people and lots of food. Kirk asks his sister where her husband is, and she explains he's just not feeling Christmas this year. Kirk then goes out to the car where he finds his brother-in-law sulking and grouchy, complaining about how all of this STUFF isn't what Christmas is really about! How it's all Pagan!\n\nKirk goes on to combat each one of his brother-in-law's objections about the Christmas traditions; the Christmas tree, Santa, Christmas lights, and gifts. Each objection is given a story. My 9-year-old's favorite was seeing Santa beat a guy up! You'll have to watch the movie to find out why Santa beats this man up:)\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the content of the movie--not the fluff. Some parts were really corny, but I think that was Kirk's intent. They poked fun at Pentecostal Christians. There were several scenes where I found myself saying, \"I don't understand how this fits?\" or \"I don't feel this explains his intent very well.\" Santa was spot-on, but a lot of the explanations seemed like a very high-level overview that left me feeling a lot like Concrete Blonde's lyrics:\n\nThese little conversations Well for me they'll never do Now what am I supposed to do with Broken sentences of you? Like a book with missing pages Like a story incomplete Like a painting left unfinished It feels like not enough to eat.\n\nI would have loved to see more depth to the stories told.\n\nThe movie is about 69 minutes long, 30 minutes of which had content\u0085 the rest was just, \"fluff\". I'm not sure I would spend $10 at the theater for it. It's more suited for a TV special.\n\nTowards the end of the movie, there is a hip hop dancing scene that made me really uncomfortable. From reading the credits, I understand this is some sort of faith-based hip hop dance crew, but I felt it wasn't very appropriate for the movie. I wouldn't consider myself a prude, either\u0085it just felt odd.\n\nIf you ignore those minor details, I think you'll enjoy this movie, too! This was unlike some of Kirk Cameron's movies that are more like a documentary\u2013this was part story, part documentary...I think.\n\nI think what sealed the deal on the film was what Kirk said in summary,\n\n\"We need to make traditions of our own. We need to infuse old symbols with new meaning. We need to arrange our lives and our homes so that every single thing points to Jesus. \"\n\nAlso,\n\n\"Remind your children that every character in God's story has a place.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Easily one of the worst films ever made, Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas is a dreadful bore and an often dreadfully long cringe fest that will honestly make you never want to celebrate Christmas again. The film goes like this, needlessly long introduction scene, followed by a random scene from a different time period that isn't explained until its shown again in its full length 40 minutes later- and then we finally start the film. Those first 10 minutes already go to show you how much of a mess this film is and unfortunately, it's probably the best this film has to offer. We focus on a large generic family during Christmas and we soon see the dead-eyes of Kirk Cameron talking about beating up his sisters husband. We then see said husband conversing with an overly-stereotypical black man somehow relating Christmas and the bible to crazy shirt Fridays and playing the victim as straight men. We then spend the next 40 minutes or so (truly it feels like 6 hours) watching the husband talk with Kirk Cameron in a car in their driveway. Again and again the scene starts with the husband asking how something relates to Christmas and then Kirk Cameron goes into an unrelated monologue for about 15 minutes that's as inaccurate and tiresome as it is just poorly filmed- as the cutaway scenes are nearly all stock footage. Eventually the husband character decides to grow a pair and face his family and runs up to the door in a very dramatic fashion only for everyone to stare at him standing in the doorway for what must be like 10 minutes as he stares at them back with rage induced eyes. He then starts freaking running towards them hilariously and decides to fall on the floor and crash into the presents, and everyone's just like, okay then and walks away. Then eventually he consoles his wife for not being Christian enough for the holidays and starts a hip hop dance group scene which comes out of absolutely nowhere and may just be the longest thing i've ever had to watch. It's also not until that moment that Kirk finally comes out of the doorway he has been standing in for like 25 minutes with the door open and starts cheering and dancing. I don't have a single good thing to say about this film, and i'm honestly surprised this wasn't intended as a parody of some kind, because it's honestly so ridiculous I was laughing so hard all the way throughout. There is literally a scene where a man talks about how fluoride in the water is giving people aspergers, and that he saw it on Fox news. This film is truly everything wrong about Christians, white people, Christmas, and american society in general- and I will honestly be dumbfounded if I ever see a film of this sort of nature ever again.\n\nMy Rating: 1/10."

C'mon, the guy's coming at you with candy canes of fury, ready to win the War on Christmas by attrition. The marketing on this bad boy is nuts!\n\nThe movie on the other hand is pure garbage. Cameron spends the entire running time lecturing us on the true origins of Christmas, reassuring his audience that they have morality on their side. That's his bailiwick, but the whole movie's just a conversation in a car. That's it. The sermon's interminable.\n\nLook, I know this was never intended for me, but the overall cheapness is unforgivable.

Kirk Cameron, the formerly popular teen actor turned born-again Christian, is off to save Christmas and what does he do? He stalls inside a car with his brother-in-law Christian (Darren Doane) and lectures to him and the audience about the true meaning of Christmas and the birth of Jesus. Saving Christmas is more about inflating Cameron's ego than spreading the holiday cheer to all your friends. Despite being a Christian, Cameron contradicts his own religious philosophy of love and forgiveness and suggests that Saint Nicholas, the originator of Santa Claus, murdered heretics when not giving presents. I guess Cameron was trying to be ironic with his \"Lord of the Ringsy\" take on the figure, but instead it comes off as mean-spirited, especially in a Christmas movie. To be fair, the joke might have worked in a tongue-and-cheek sense, if the other characters weren't so poorly-written. Christian is a one-dimensional Scrooge in the mud, the atheist conspirators contribute nothing and neither do any of the party-goers, including Kirk's sister Bridgette, except a dance number. Seeing the characters' lack of onscreen presence only adds to Kirk Cameron's overlong sanctimonious preachiness; that's me a film lover in general. If Kirk Cameron is reading this post (I seriously doubt that he is), I apologize for being a \"hater and atheist,\" but Saving Christmas wasn't very good. (1 Hot Cocoa in a Mike Seaver Mug out of 5)"

He also was developing into an amateur theologian. Saving Christmas is the culmination of his self taught theology.\n\nThis film was made in response to the secularization of Christmas as fundamentalists see it. Kirk in this message gives all the religious reasons for certain holiday traditions from his perspective.\n\nThe film is an amateur job from Liberty Baptist University which should tell you all you need to know. The threadbare plot has Kirk explaining to his brother-in-law all the reasons for Christmas traditions going back to Adam and Eve. The adaption of certain pagan rituals is conveniently left out. The birth of Jesus is the reason for everything in the season. NOT.\n\nOf course there's a hip-hop version of Hark The Herald Angels Sing. I'll take mine traditional though.\n\nSaving Christmas was once at rock bottom of worst film ever. That was more a stand against Kirk Cameron's fundamentalism and all that implies with homophobia and sexism and a general war on progress. Now it may be the worst thing Kirk Cameron ever brought to the big screen or small. But there are worst films out there that have nothing to do with religion.\n\nHardly a ringing endorsement for Saving Christmas."

Well, if that's you, then I just want to tell you this: you're not.\n\nChristians should watch this movie to learn how not to debate theology.

It's not being atheist because you don't like something that someone like him makes!! Second, no where in the Bible does it say the son was born on Christmas!! The way the book talks about his birth puts it in the fall!!! Christians took Christmas, like many others for THEIR own beliefs & they condemn the holidays that they can't take!! Last, the writing & acting of this head on train wreck is god awful!! I will agree that Christmas has become more and more commercial each year but the true meaning is giving, being with loved ones, enjoying life!!! I have watched some religious movies that are pretty good, I'm not bashing this because it's \"religious\". I'm bashing it because it's awful!! Kirk did another movie that came in a pack of movies we got & that one is called fireproof & it's just as bad!! Kirk needs to step away from films all together!! Anyone who has dealings with the corrupt Liberty U is corrupt themselves!!!"

That's a not inconsiderable accomplishment; even Edward D. Wood Jr. And Uwe Boll have made movies that didn't make you want to rush for the nearest bathroom. That's one more goal Kirk can shoot for. Unfortunately for him, he didn't reach it with this one.\n\nInept at every conceivable level--and even at some that were previously inconceivable--I wouldn't even recommend seeing this just for the laughs (there are plenty of them there, although it's not supposed to be a comedy--I don't think it is, anyway. It's hard to tell). It reminded me of what a friend of mine said not long after he got hit in the cojones by a line drive while playing baseball: \"It may have looked funny to you, but it hurt too much to laugh for me\".\n\nNow I know how he feels."

Our entire world depends on the fact these filmmakers would never work again.

        "review_detailed_main": "I like Kirk Cameron's stuff. Let me put that out there. I understand where he is coming from and tend to enjoy it. \"Saving Christmas\" was informative but draggy. The format--two guys speaking together in a parked car on a driveway--tends to make the movie narrative and leads to an extremely slow pace. With a little livelier pacing and some editing (to remove the pregnant pauses), the message could have been presented in 45 minutes. I did not go into this movie thinking it would be a comedy, so I wasn't disappointed. However, the comic relief presented was a little strained and contrived.\n\nThere is, actually, very little acting. The descriptive parts frame a number of vignettes that illustrate what is being discussed. In between different themes, a party is going on. Some of the party sequences made little sense. There is one sequence where two coworkers are talking behind coffee cups (presumably to keep from being seen on video discussing things at work) which has absolutely nothing to do with moving the story and, mercifully, is never addressed again until the out-takes.\n\nThat having been said, I came away with some information that I did not know or had never thought about before seeing the movie. I believe the message should be heard by Christians and, thankfully, it is aimed directly at Christians. I don't feel like I wasted my time in the movie, but I feel like it could have been presented more evenly. My suggestion is to support Mr. Cameron by seeing his other stuff and borrowing this movie from the Church Library."

There was a good balance of scenes between Christian and Kirk Cameron and the main party. Kirk Cameron is known for producing great movies and people have a certain expectation from his films. This film seems to be marketed as a full action comedy which sets expectations different than what the movie actually is. I liked it.

Far from it! Would I watch it again? Nope. Would I recommend it to anyone else? Probably only to fundamentalist Christian friends. But it is not deserving of all the hate and the (currently) 1.5 rating.\n\nThis movie is definitely not for everyone. However, there are certainly more awful and unwatchable movies out there."

When I saw the IMDb rating for Saving Christmas, I was convinced that I had to see it.\n\nThe movie is not good, but I do not think its low rating is entirely justified. Based on the promotional image, I expected Kirk Cameron to play an action hero, saving Christmas from heathens. But this was not a plot-driven movie. We meet a character who is frustrated with the way that Jesus was put on the periphery of the season, but he is simply a device for explaining the historical or Biblical meaning of the symbols seen at Christmas. This film was originally produced to be shown in churches for educational purposes. For that venue with that audience, the film largely succeeds. That is, the information is interesting, though the acting is poor, several characters are lazily written as old stereotypes, and there are some very cheesy moments. For a broad audience, this movie has very low appeal. I consider myself an open-minded but non-religious person. I found the interpretation of some symbols interesting, and although the information was not presented in a way that I found especially fun, I think to try to do that would detract from the core message.\n\nThis film is not in the same category as The Room, Birdemic, or others of their ilk. It was not designed to be a widely-viewed masterpiece that fell utterly short. Judging the film against what it intended to be, it is fine. Not good, not bad, but fine.\n\nI do think that the Christians who complain about the red Starbucks cups introduced in 2015 could learn something from this film. The people who would gain the most from the viewing are those that are disappointed in the secularization of Christmas."

If you can make these leaps, then you can watch this film and get something from it. You just have to let Kirk take you on a ride.\n\nIt's only when we read too much into things - if that's Kirk's real sister, why isn't the brother-in-law played by the real brother? Where's Candace Cameron, his somewhat of a bigger star sister, and her husband, hockey player Valeri Bure? Why was there no hot chocolate in Kirk's mug in the overly earnest open? Does anyone who made this movie not realize that the DeAndre character is racist in its depiction of black people? Is anyone mad that they co-opted dubstep? Why wasn't POD in this movie?\n\nThat said, I'm not going to make fun of Kirk for being a child star or his earnestly vacant stare. Obviously, this was not a movie made for me. I also don't think it was made for Christians. I think it was made for Kirk, his family and close multiethnic friends. Things just got out of hand and it ended up being released in theaters and they had to go along with it."

It's not a special effects bad guy hero film, but it is what it promises to be and it fulfills its promises well. I highly recommend it and wish it was going to be in theaters longer."

These folks obviously are 'activisting' not 'movie reviewing' or they wouldn't be so emotional; but rather they would be doing a shorter 'matter of fact' review,....like is normal:)I saw Saving Christmas at the 'Egyptian' theater at Arundel Mills mall on Dec 15th. My son went with my husband and I. It was ridiculous that the movie was so hard to find. We drove 30 min to see it:)...because we heard it was really good and represented our heart on Christmas. Regardless of ones view on that matter, there is nothing to despise and attack about this light hearted beautiful film. It is great,exceptional acting (which surprised me). It was really well written and put together from start to finish. Anybody badly bashing this film in an unusually lengthy manner,is simply on a lib activist rant and should be refraining from showing that ulterior nonprofessional motive so obviously:) Mr. Cameron came up with a very good quality film with a well chosen cast. It was a highlight of our Christmas this year and it deserved to be in more theaters! I hope he initiates another film for next Christmas, I would be in the front of the line going in:)"

I saw no real reason to involve the story of St. Nicholas with the Lord of the Rings, but it was more history of the church than most people ever get."

        "review_detailed_main": "Did you seriously go expecting something else. The movie delivered exactly what was advertised a frank discussion of the traditions of Christmas from a Christian view. I knew what I was going to see and I enjoyed it. For those who have not seen it, this is a discussion of something we as evangelical Christians have heard for many years. Does the celebration of Christmas and the inclusion of everything not Jesus make us less of a believer. Cameron puts forth the argument that not embracing our long held traditions is an attack on Christmas itself and why we should be OK with each one. Could it have been more cinematically engaging, yes, but I enjoyed the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my updated review on Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas, and it has been submitted to IMDb for review.. Will it be on IMDb? I would say more of a no, than a yes.\n\n(1) Book of Genesis and the Origins of trees (God created the trees) and winter solstice (astronomy of the planets aligning with this particular solar system), and their actual meanings; (2) Book of Exodus - specifically about the Tabernacle and what inside of the Structure, and their references; (3) Saint Nick (known as Santa Clause) and that he was part of the Council of Nicea, that he was also born-again, and help others with gifts. (4) Books of the Gospels (which are technically Old Testament) - Tree is the main central theme, in that Christ is God Incarnate (Fully Man and Fully God); He (Christ/Messiah) was born in swaddling (burial) clothes, that He was meant to die. He couldn't sin at all, and He was tested at all points, and still did not sin at all; He (Christ/Messiah) was beaten, Crucified on a Roman built Cross, died, covered in swaddling clothes, then buried for 3 days and 3 nights, and rose again (Resurrected). Why did He (Jesus Christ/Yeshua Messiah) do this? He did it for you, for every man, woman, and child is born a sinner because of Adam in the book of Genesis sinned, and we inherited this sin nature. This is what the movie is really about! It's about the Gospel, that Christ died for sinners! People who say 'Christmas is pagan', need to watch this movie, and then go back to the Origins, from the book of Genesis, whether's it's in your Torah or Tanak, New Testament, Gospels, History, Apostolic Writings, and/or Bible. This movie is really a commentary of Biblical History, and that you can still receive Salvation for your sins, and that you can be a child of God through Christ's Blood Sacrifice (The Perfect Lamb of God, Old Covenant typology).\n\nThe media in news and movie reviewers view \"evil is good\", and \"good is evil\", and view this as the \"worst movie ever\" (in reference to Saving Christmas).. Really, it's the worst movie ever? Are you sure? What about James Cameron's Titanic, which really wasn't about the Titanic? I mean, you see the Titanic here and their, but it's about adultery, if you understand the term and it's origins: engagement, and it really means = to be married.\n\nWhat about Michael Bay's Transformers (2007)? You get the Transformers with very few lines to them (robot characters), and the lines are given to an actor and an actress, who are unknown until this movie came out. I felt like I was watching a cross-between Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and Clueless (which I can't recommend either movie). I would hear from people in my area, that it was \"a good movie!\" and \"Megan Fox is hot!\", and in translation: \"Good special effects, hot girl, and no substance to the story at all.\" Is their such a thing called movie plagiarism? It would apply to this particular movie!\n\nWhat about the recent Noah by Darren Aronofsky? This is behind the grade F-, and it fact, this is a very heretical version of Noah. It only had about 5 good points to the mass amount of liberties and rejects the Biblical History altogether..\n\nWhat did these three do, along with other movies who fall hard in Hermeneutical and Exegetical (Science and Art of Interpretation, letting the writer(s) speak for themselves, and having good application to what's being written/said) standards? In the fiction historical background, and non-fiction (literal history) accounts who fail to follow manuscripts in history, and it fact, people get praised to doing something that receives an F-, and get ridiculed for A+ when it comes to movies, documentaries, and commentaries. It's really: \"Let's apply A+ to Ivy Leagues with their buy-out program\" and \"Let's apply F- to who understand True Interpretation of things.\"\n\nIn today's society and since the 1920s-1930s, the view is: \"reject it: if it convicts us, you need to a full 180 in your so-called life style (it's really a death-style), corrects these forms of so-called theologians views (nazists, fascist, communists, socialists = aka liberal and moderates), has True Supernatural substance to it, and it's True Historical accounts, it doesn't do my homework (research) for me\" which Saving Christmas actually does. Yep, you get to your homework (research) on this Bible Commentary, Bible History, and actually documentational History (do Origin Source Research)..\n\nWhile the majority of society (not just in North America) embrace superficiality (i.e. Transformers, Titanic, Noah), and reject Hermeneutical and Exegetical standards, and perform Eisegesis (let's take a mass amount of liberties, and give a folklore, myths, add deceptions here and their), and it does my homework (research) for me. It's: \"Oh, I don't have to my homework for me! Hooray! I can be lazy!\" Come on! Push yourself! Overwhelm your selfishness! Do the homework! Stop being lazy!\n\nThis is a great example, to show, that Kirk Cameron wants to speak the majority who are in the two world-views: (a) Laodicean society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of Revelation, Chapter 3). (b) Corinthian society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of 1st and 2nd Corinthians)."

Although it was a different style than what I was expecting, in that there was a lot of narration, the overall content was great! Basically, it was a celebration of the meaning of Christmas and it had funny one-liners like...\"Santa's the Man!\" Plus, I really enjoyed the scene with the two guys who were rapping behind the mugs were hilarious! Lol #GoodTimes The actual filming too had some nice effects that flowed well with the story-line. I bet most of the people writing reviews are \"haters\" who didn't even see it! #YouKnowItsTrue #BahHumbug Great Job to those who made this! Great Information! Merry Christmas!"

The film, starring the charmingly witty Kirk Cameron effortlessly blends humor with meaningful messages about family, faith, and the joy of giving.\n\nThe story revolves around a man who's struggling with the commercialization of Christmas and his need to rediscover the magic of the season. What makes this film stand out is how it balances lighthearted comedy with moments of emotional depth, reminding viewers that the holidays aren't just about presents, but about connecting with those we love.\n\nThe performances are genuine, especially from the supporting cast, who bring their characters to life in a way that feels relatable and real. The dialogue is clever, with enough warmth and humor to keep everyone entertained, yet it doesn't shy away from addressing the deeper themes of gratitude and community. The movie also has a fantastic soundtrack, filled with both classic Christmas songs and original tunes that capture the festive atmosphere perfectly.\n\nUltimately, Saving Christmas is a movie that will resonate with anyone looking for a feel-good film to watch with family. It's a reminder that sometimes, the best way to save Christmas is to look inward and focus on what truly matters. Whether you're looking for laughs or heartfelt moments, this film delivers in all the right ways. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to get into the Christmas spirit."

If you just want to escape and be entertained, choose another movie, this is not that type of entertainment.

It is based around the belief that people need to realize that Christmas is a great celebration and worship of the greatest event in history!! When it comes out on video I hope the tide will turn and more people will accept it for the simple movie of truth it was designed to be. I do not always agree with Kirk Cameron but this time he has the message of Christmas in a great context. Everyone should at least watch this movie one time, Jesus is the reason for the season."

If you want to take a younger person to a move and not have to worry about sex scenes, murders, drug use or exploding cars. I do not always want to go see an over acted movie, with over the top special effects, sometime I think they have some special effect just to show off how great they are, and over directed. Some time you just want to go to a movie with a cheerful message and as a religious person I liked the message as did my niece. I do not need a movie that is as much about evil as it is about good to enjoy myself."

As I can imagine, those who would much rather take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas will feel more awkward watching a movie that is teaching Christian values then they would actually fully understanding it and enjoying it. (As you can see from the many hateful reviews). Anyways, if you're looking for a nice family movie that will give you a few chuckles, give you a few history lessons, and teach the importance of centering God around all that you do... then this movie is for you! Merry Christmas!"

It is a good way to look into the bible stories more in depth after you watch the film and after that you can come to your own conclusions. I personally know most of the stories very well but not everybody does. So it is a good way to explain in not more than 90 minutes what it is all about. I would not go to the cinema to watch it, but viewed with family I think it can open very good conversations, especially with children. It definitely does not deserve a one star rating. And it is incredible to see how nasty people can be over the internet.\n\nMerry Christmas"

The main point of the movie is that there is ample Christian symbolism in the usual Christmas decorations for those who choose to center Christmas on Christ.\n\nThe movie nowhere says everyone must celebrate Christmas only in this way. A tolerant non-Christian might not care (and can just not watch), or might want to know why his or her Christian friends are so focused on Christ during Christmas (and watch to get an idea).\n\nThere is quite a bit of history about Christmas in the early church and down through centuries. Much of the secular explanations are not factually accurate. For the curious, the topic is worth exploring."

I like his views on the manger, Santa, Christmas trees and presents. It's all about perspective: WE MAKE THINGS ABOUT GOD! It's a breath of fresh air because a lot of Christmas movies have similar storylines, such as going back to the hometown and falling in love for 90 minutes. This one is focused on Jesus and a Jesus perspective for everything. I watched it free but I bought the DVD."
