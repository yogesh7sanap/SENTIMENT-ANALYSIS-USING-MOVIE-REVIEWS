        "review_detailed_main": "Though we had a plethora of films about troops returning from the Vietnam war and trying to re-integrate back into their societies, most of which were hard-hitting, angry voices against War, here is arguably the original - and best.\n\nDefinitely a family orientated movie (Cert U) this will appeal to and find favour with all ages, but don't start thinking that this is all gooey, slushy nonsense. There's some quite hard-hitting topics covered, even by today's standards and of course, with our minds on our current troops in Iraq/Afghanistan, equally relevant.\n\nMulti-stranded, which each of the three G.I.'s immediate and extended families and friends being examined, it's about them coping, with varying degrees of success, with home life and getting jobs, now that the War is ended. It's the little observations and stories around them that are so fascinating, as the Heroes of yesterday are now anything but when it comes finding new purpose in a changed world.\n\nThe cast is exemplary, not necessarily the biggest stars of the day but the most believable and natural for their roles. Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy and Fredric Marsh are the ones most easily recognisable and their appearances convey a sort of reassuring familiarity and normality. They're all excellent, of course.\n\nThough long, at nearly 3 hours, William Wyler's easy going but assured and tight direction keeps things flowing nicely and it never drags. This, my second viewing, is an enjoyable one as the first and if anything I'm more at ease with it.\n\nThough obviously not as exciting or dramatic as other 'normal' war films, it's a tragedy that it's not more well known. I've never seen it to ever have been on TV, or to my recollection, even Sky Movies, for that matter. Any movie that won 7 Oscars and is currently no. 180 in the top 250 IMDb's films of all time, voted by its voters (us, the public) is hardly one of minority interest.\n\nA friend I lent my DVD to watched it with his family and normally they only go for current films, or ones they know, but they not only enjoyed it, but felt enormously moved by it, too.\n\nIf you haven't seen The Best Years... yet, make a mental note to do so. Your life won't change by doing so, but it really is worth the 3 hours of it that it will take. You certainly can't say the same about every film out there...."

At first the new lives of the soldiers seem to be facing small adjustments, such as their children's interest in \"atomic energy\" and \"scientific efficiency\". But soon we find that jobs are hard to find, and the wives and girlfriends sometimes met new people while the battles were fought.\n\nAlthough a serious topic, the film has the right balance of entertainment and drama. It never gets outright depressing, and things like depression and suicide are overlooked. But it still remains a valuable lesson: as bad as dying in the war is, sometimes the transition back to normalcy can be just as damaging.\n\nAlthough not one of the better known movies today (2014), \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" won seven Academy Awards in 1946, including Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actor (Fredric March), Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell), Best Film Editing (Daniel Mandell), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robert Sherwood), and Best Original Score (Hugo Friedhofer). It still sits on the IMDb Top 250, just as it should."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post World War II era, the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on V-E or V-J day of 1945. The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.\n\nAnd while we don't often learn from history, we can be thankful that for once the United States of America did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous World War. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. So many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell who you see here.\n\nAll three of those actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the USA could identify with. They all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them, Boone City, Iowa.\n\nWar is a great leveler of class and distinction. Bank employee March, soda jerk Andrews, and high school football star Russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken.\n\nMarch is the oldest, a man with two children and Hollywood's perfect wife Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes, getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him, tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms.\n\nI also love his scene where another returning veteran, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. Watch March's expressions as he listens to the man's pitch for money. You can feel him read the man's soul. It's what got him his Second Best Actor Oscar for this film.\n\nHarold Russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the Pacific. He got a special recognition Oscar for his performance. Because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category which he also won in. His performance, especially his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that could be described as acting.\n\nDana Andrews is the only officer of the three, a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Of the group of them, maybe he should have stayed in. He also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he's considerably less in her eyes as a civilian.\n\nWhile Mayo is fooling around with Steve Cochran, Andrews has the great good fortune to have March's daughter Teresa Wright take an interest in him. They're the main story of the film, Andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran's problems were solved with GI Bill.\n\nMyrna Loy gets little recognition for The Best Years of Our Lives. My guess is that it's because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at MGM. Still as wife to March and mother to Wright she really is the glue that holds that family together.\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives won for Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn, Best Director for William Wyler and a few others besides the two acting Oscars it got. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. It's almost three hours in length, but never once will your interest wane.\n\nThe best tribute this film received came from Frank Capra who had a film of his own in the Oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories. In his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the Oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it.\n\nBy the way, the film Capra had hopes for was It's A Wonderful Life. The Beat Years of Our Lives can't get better praise than that."

I think in many ways \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the US in the mid-1940s after WWII. I believe \"Coming Home\" and \"The Deer Hunter\", both released in 1978, were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\".\n\nWhat really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.\n\nThis movie still packs a wallop and I'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. *****\n\nI'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI. Also, though it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, It's a Wonderful Life, arguably, The Best Years of Our Lives' Oscar wins, including Best Picture, were very well-deserved.\n\nI've just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful, beautifully acted and well-crafted motion picture."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)\n\nThe whole point of this film when it was released still makes perfect sense today, though I'm sure it doesn't have the same impact it did in those first years after World War II ended. Returning servicemen, with all kinds of backgrounds before and during the war, hit a wall coming home: wives who no longer loved them, jobs that had dried up, a culture that was foreign to them and that found them, these men, to be foreign themselves.\n\nIt wasn't a crisis to take lightly. These were the guys who were drafted to fight the enemy, and in going overseas they lost some of the best years of their lives, if not their lives. The country knew its debt in the abstract, but it also knew it in sons and husbands who really did come home and who had to face it all. This movie was both a reckoning for the sake of national healing and a brilliant drama that would be beautifully pertinent and therefore successful. And what a success, then and now.\n\nThe consummate Hollywood director William Wyler shows in this fast, long movie just what a master he is at working the medium. With Gregg Toland at the camera, Wyler makes a highly fluid movie, visual and dramatic and weirdly highly efficient. With the three main plots interweaving and depending on each other, the drama (and melodrama) build but never beyond plausibility. Wyler knew his audience wouldn't put up with pandering or cheap mistakes. Casting Harold Russell as Homer, knowing the audience would hear about how Russell really was a soldier who lost both hands in the war, was a huge step toward creating both empathy and credibility. It even practices a key theme in the move--to go beyond your bounds to make a difference, to give these guys a break and help them assimilate.\n\nIt's interesting how singular this movie is, trying to show the truth in these kinds of situations. The other post-war films about army and navy men fall into two large and dominating categories--war films and film noir. And it is film noir that comes closest to getting at the problem of the G.I. not reintegrating well, making it a whole style, brooding and spilling over with violence. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" has a highly controlled and even contrived plot structure, but it aims to be honest and representative.\n\nThat it's remarkable formally--the way it is shot and edited and acted, top to bottom--is not surprise, given the heights that Hollywood had reached by then, and given that Wyler is easily the slickest of them all, in the best sense. That the movie makes such beautiful sense and really works as a story, a moving and heartwarming story without undue sappiness, is a whole other kind of achievement. A terrific, rich, full-blooded, uncompromised movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the important movies.\n\nIt was when it was first released in 1946, addressing as it did the issue of veterans returning from WW2, and the affect it had on them and their families. It focused on three men, all psychologically scarred, and one who has lost both arms. They return to a small city in the U.S., but the themes of the film were universal.\n\nThat was 70 years ago, and over the years, the movie has tended to move into the background - there have been more wars and more veterans returning with their own issues.\n\nHowever, I think the importance of this movie can't be underestimated now that the WW2 generation is fading away.\n\nWW2 was well covered; we have millions of feet of newsreel film as well as towering stacks of history books. However, movies from the era do something quite unique; they get inside the emotions and the feelings - they represent the mindset of the time. Audiences identified with the issues through the stars in a way that was very personal. Hollywood did this job best - it was entertainment, but it was also a commitment to a generation.\n\nAt the end of the war and into the 50's, Hollywood addressed the aftermath - \"Till the End of Time\", \"The Men\", \"My Foolish Heart\", \"The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit\" and others, but \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" towers above them all.\n\nThe film could never really be remade. It was created by people who had experienced the war either in combat or on the home front. Many behind the camera had served including director William Wyler who had flown dangerous missions making documentaries about the U.S. Air Force; he was left nearly deaf from the experience.\n\nThe film tackled tough issues and attitudes. Sergeant Al Stephenson (Frederick March) returns from the Philippines, but he hasn't seen his kids for years and he seems out of step with them. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns to an unfaithful wife and an uncertain future, he was good at war but what now? Real-life amputee Harold Russell plays Homer Parrish. He has much to overcome, but his girlfriend remains loyal, and he emerges as possibly the best adjusted of them all; he accepts what he can't change, and just gets on with it.\n\nThe film has a powerful score by Hugo Friedhofer. Friedhofer was not as famous as Newman, Korngold or Steiner but he was as good. He surpassed himself here; his music helped express the unspoken thoughts of the actors - there are sections of this score that bring a lump to the throat.\n\nThis was my parent's generation; my father was in the Australian army and fought in the war. And although this movie was about Americans, the story resonated far wider.\n\nOf course you could argue that some issues were not tackled - and that also gives an insight into an era, but with that said, this film is a window on the ideas and forces that were shaping society at a critical time in modern history.\n\nSeen that way, it's a movie that may never lose its relevance."

        "review_detailed_main": "TBYOOL is a courageous, valiant and unostentatious attempt at presenting the aftermath of the Second World War from the viewpoint of three war veterans \u2013 an bombardier general, a Naval crew member and an infantry platoon sergeant as they re-acclimatize with their old surroundings that they were deprived of during the War period. The three men's lives interconnect after they ride on the same plane back home; the rewarded bombardier named Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), who received almost four times the income that he used to as a soda jerk before the war, returns to his ordinary life and toils to make a respectable living, while Homer Parish (Harold Russell), an ex-footballer loses his hands and has to rely on mechanical hook prostheses; his defect makes him embarrassed and conscious about how his family and friends would perceive him. He also worries that his childhood fianc\u00e9 would reject him because of his condition. Al Stevenson (Fredric Marsh), a banker in his late 40s deployed as an infantry platoon officer returns to his family, but finds difficulty in retaining his old self to connect with those around him. His wife Milly (Myrna Loy) seems bemused by his changed behavior, and his strange craving for alcohol.\n\nThe three men, coming from different backgrounds, develop a closeness that spreads to their families and forms new relationships. Fred Derry, who had just spent some days with his newlywed Marie (Virginia Mayo), begins to realize her changed attitude towards him and position. The moment he enters, she comments about not being dressed appropriately for the occasion, and then admires the epaulets on his chest. She quits her job at the nightclub and now completely depends on her husband for their living without understanding that her husband can't fetch the income he used to while at war. During one of their exchanges, she comments rather offhandedly about how her husband had bad dreams about war at night. \"Forget about it!\" she says casually, while continuing to act as a spendthrift. Fred receives more empathy from Al Stephenson's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright), and they eventually become close. Al Stephenson rekindles the paused relations with his wife and children by taking them to various entertainments. At bank, he becomes humane towards his clients, and judges them intuitively. Homer becomes reclusive and distraught, but is more open when he meets his two chums.\n\nWhen these men return from war, they abandon their new family \u2013 their fellow soldiers. Just imagine the breadth of anticipation in these people \u2013 leaving their families for war, and returning to their families by leaving another family during war. There is a chill, a sense of fervor when this happens - when you leave your families for a short holiday, you start thinking of them and getting homesick. These people would've had the sensations for a while, and then they would have to form new relations with the ones around them now. This atmosphere is lusciously felt among the three actors as they take their flight back home. Their journey is very well written and acted, especially by Russell. When they land, they go home one by one and the reactions from the family are deeply touching, especially when the Homer's mother lets out a stifling cry; I was deeply moved.\n\nI have to say the direction here is very different and modern compared to other films of the same period \u2013 there is not a moment of showiness and everything remains grounded to reality. There is an abundance of casual talk and the flow of the dialogs and scenes is never turbulent. You can hear a very dulcet music played during the scenes (which I did not favor though) and the only truly tense moment is at Butch's place later in the film. Now, I shall actually tell how I felt about the movie or rather how I perceive the movie's popularity:\n\nTBYOOL was made in 1946, a crucial moment in world history. The growth of post-modernism during the period gave rise to films depicting war moments and the aftermath of it. Therefore, I feel that this movie is culturally and historically relevant in the sense that America needed such a film to be made at that time. It was reflective of the political, commercial and human conditions in those times \u2013 look at Dana's face when his character enters the supermarket only to find it taken over by some other company. Observe how the camera never gets too close to the actors \u2013 it wants to document life through film and it succeeded in that way. William Wyler himself stated that Mrs. Miniver depicted war in a subdued way and after his own war experience; he made this film which never over-sentimentalizes. At times we feel these weren't actors and were real people being documented; only the romantic angle gives it a movie-like feeling. For me, an Indian teenager, it was somehow difficult to truly love the film as it was made for an age that I haven't witnessed \u2013 Mrs. Miniver, which had more dramatic elements, was more liked by me because I expected drama. Here I got the unexpected \u2013 an effort to show truth.\n\nThe ensemble did a fine job of carrying the story. I think William Wyler wanted to highlight the importance of the story more than the performances of the actors \u2013 which though imperfect was honest. It could have been better acted with a better cast, but that may rob the credit of the story. Hence, I won't grumble much about the stiltedness in the performances at times. But I do bring attention to the mysterious disappearance of Al's son, who left to school forever perhaps!\n\nTBYOOL would've made a great and long mini-series had it been released now. The passing of time in the plot requires some more real-time to connect both with the story and the characters. But bravo to it's groundbreaking attempt at mirroring lives!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's easy to see why this film was the best picture winner of 1946. It is meaningful, epic, and heartwarming. The Best Years of Our Lives tells the moving story of three World War II veterans who return home from the war and realize that life has drastically changed since they left. They are forced to cope with the new lifestyle that they have been so far from, and resituate themselves in unfamiliar territory. The film paints a striking picture of post-war life for veterans. It is critical but remains patriotic and triumphant towards the issues it presents. I wouldn't call this a dark film, but it's no picnic either. It's a human film that brings to light the realism of the situation as best it can.\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives starts strong and then sort of goes downhill for me. It begins with tearful reunions as the three main characters return to their families who haven't seen them in so long. Changes in their lives are immediately noticed and addressed and one theme of post-war change is introduced after another. The beginning of the film does a fantastic job addressing these subtle things without outright saying them. There is a lot of room for interpretation in the beginning of the film that sets the stage for a deeply powerful film. The whole first hour of this three hour film wonderfully set up an intriguing set of ideals the film would address. It was all done with a plentiful helping of eloquence that struck me as very unique for a film from its time.\n\nBut as the film went on it morphed more and more into just a typical romance. The post-war elements still lingered and were still borough up from to time to time, but the overall focus of the film really started to switch to romances between the characters. I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this nearly as much and so the film ultimately grew dull and boring in my eyes. The story presented was well thought out and well executed, but didn't go the direction I had hoped it would. I was disappointed to see some great elements raised in the first half of the film all but go down the drain in the second half when The Best Years of Our Lives transforms itself into a tale of romance that we've all seen too many times.\n\nOverall I wasn't crushed by the films change of pace and I can really say that I liked the film. It is very well made and deserved its best picture Oscar. It isn't exactly my cup of tea so I didn't enjoy it as much as someone who loves old romance films would. I can respect the film for its integrity and talent, but it's not something I would sit through again."

There is a general depressing tone about the film, which is arguably the point, but adds to the challenges of it holding my attention.\n\nHowever, I really appreciated the subject matter - showing the struggles of returning veterans and heroes who have difficulty re-integrating back into civilian life. It's a sobering picture of post-war results. The film prompts the audience to consider the whether we justly treat our own veterans today. Each character's struggles are introduced masterfully and each character is treated with decency by the director.\n\nOverall, the film probably just wasn't for me; but I'm glad I saw it."

I would recommend this excellent film to anyone who loves movies."

All three led opposite lives during the war (Executive Banker became an army corporal, a soda jerk became an Air Force Captain and the High School Football hero loses both his arms in battle)and now each must reconstruct his life and connect with a new reality. The homes they return to, with grown children and independent, working women along with a depressed economy, only add to the strife. It's the scenes just off camera and the unspoken dialog which resonates the most loudly, however. The awkward intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking.\n\nDana Andrews is riveting as the handsome, decorated Captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform.\n\nThe film is filled with honest characters and each is portrayed by a gifted actor.\n\nThis film, however, took on a whole other level after seeing, \"Saving Private Ryan.\" The reality and magnitude of what these men lived through for love and country......and obviously it didn't end on the battlefield.\n\nThis is an essential for any collection."

        "review_title": "Some of this film's greatest moments were scenes without a spoken word!",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are several thoughtful reviews of this movie here already - most all of which I concur with.\n\nI'll try to add a couple of unique comments about this most wonderful of films.\n\nIt occurred to me that some of this films greatest and most touching moments are told without dialogue:\n\nThe scene so many readers here have already mentioned - when Fred visits the boneyard for all those bombers waiting for the scrap heap. Through the camera work and Mr. Andrews' acting, we too are transported back to his harrowing missions aboard one of these planes. The urgency, the fear, the terror, the danger are all palpable at once as though we're in the cockpit too, flying over Europe against great enemy resistance, even though it's a sunny day somewhere in America in a lot for surplus aircraft. When I watched that scene, I felt like I really knew what tremendous ordeals he had endured. I felt for Fred now that this plane, that had been so decisively important, just as he himself had been so important, risking his life in service to his country as part of the plane's crew suddenly no longer served any useful purpose.\n\nThe scene where Homer is just about to go to his girlfriend's, Wilma's, house as planned - but he stops and he watches her through the window as she works in the kitchen, and plainly, we see that she is dear to him. But instead of going in to see her, with great struggle he changes his mind and he goes home and to his room. What a sweet room it is! It's the room he left - just out of high school - to join the navy. It's a high school student's room, a boy's room in his parent's house, with his trophies and pennants on the wall. He looks around at his boyhood triumphs and - we see through the camera - he stops and looks at his posed portrait in his football uniform, his right arm cocked back holding the football, his left arm pointing towards the imaginary receiver his head up, proud, and his gaze confident and purposeful. And then he looks at an action shot of himself dribbling the basketball past defenders. I can't begin to assess what Homer could be feeling at that moment - feelings of loss? of uselessness? Is he thinking that he'll be forever a boy - dependent on his parents and that he'll never be able to be his own man? That sequence - all without dialogue - speaks volumes!\n\nThe kicker for me though, is the reminder that this is not merely a character in a story that has moved me, but this is also a real person who lost both his hands in service to his country. Those photographs of him holding the football and dribbling the basketball sure look to me like they are real pictures of the real person, Mr. Harold Russell, who plays Homer. What kind of courage did he have to look those things in the face for millions of viewers to witness? And how hard was it for Mr. Russell the person to make light of his character's and his own real life disability by playing Chopsticks on the piano with his \"hooks\" for everyone's amusement?\n\nThose two scenes stick in my mind as the most powerful to me - but there are so many more in this movie. It's worth noting that they were so effective without any dialogue at all. An actor shares a soul stirring revelation and it is carefully captured and revealed for us with sensitive and skillful film making.\n\nThis is one of those movies that would go on a very short list of all time favorites. It's not perfect - when I can detach myself emotionally from the people in this story I can say that it could possibly be just a little heavy handed with it's message, but to watch this movie with all it's masterful performances from so many in the cast all assembled so lovingly and with great such great care by a great director - I have to think that it is very near perfect.\n\nI read here on IMDB under Harold Russell's (plays Homer) bio that he sold his Oscar in order to pay for surgery for his wife!! He is still living, retired on Cape Cod. Someone, somehow should get his Oscar back to him. It seems so wrong!! He paid very dearly with flesh and blood and bone and then had to, while on display, stare his loss in the face for the benefit of the movie going public. Someone should return his Oscar to him - the Academy? Steven Spielberg? Tom Hanks? William Wyler's heirs? I don't know who, but someone should really do that for him. It seems like a small price to pay for what he gave."

One has lost his hands (Harold Russell, real-life veteran, putting in a touching performance) and struggles to cope with this and with his relationship with his girlfriend (Cathy O'Donnell). The other was a soda jerk but has flown bomber planes throughout the conflict (Dana Andrews, in one of his best roles) and is now heading back to his pin-up wife (Virginia Mayo, a small role but an interesting one).\n\nWe follow them on their respective journeys, often meeting up in Butch's bar (run by Hoagy Carmichael, who gets the chance to play piano, etc.) and often finding their paths cross. The film comes in at around 3 hours, but it is time well spent. 'The Best Years' is not only perceptive and clever, with some great scenes, but also is innovative in some of its cinematography, thanks to the great Gregg Toland, master of the deep focus."

By contrast, this movie shows returning man going about his business, and each of the returning characters make the kind of small mistakes that make them more human, more approachable. More than in any other movie I felt I was meeting new friends rather than following a story. Yet the stories themselves are good. This movie is in my top 5. I found it similar to Its a Wonderful Life, which I love too, but less obvious and less overly dramatic. Other good things about the film -- you can learn about the 1940s dress, manner of speaking, sense of humor; the movie has more thoughtful dialogue than two average current movies; the cinematography is excellent, with especially thoughtful character positioning in group scenes; there's a cameo by Hoagy Carmichael."

        "review_detailed_main": "It will not be difficult for me to describe my feelings and thoughts about this film. It is simply the best I have ever seen. Fredric March(the most overlooked of great actors) gives the greatest performance by a leading man ever, as the returning sergeant who was previously a banker. In real life, March was indeed a banker for a short while. Maybe that is part of the reason his performance is so elegant. This movie reaches so many areas of human behavior, by exploring the families reactions to the returning veterans and the later relationships between the men themselves, that it's apparent complexity is in reality the simplicity of the continued struggle for survival. Of course the rest of the cast is wonderful. Including the colorful Hoagy Carmichal as Butch, the local tavern owner, who also happens to play piano. Here's an interesting twist. In one scene Homer (the disabled vet) asks Butch if he remembers how to play \" Up A Lazy River\". After nodding, Butch starts to play the song and while he plays he questions Homer about why he's not at home with his family. Now in 1946, Homer's musical request must have been humorous to the viewing audience because Hoagy Carmichael wrote that song, and the audience must have known it. Carmichael was at the time a big musical star and wrote many famous songs, including \"Stardust\" and \"Georgia On My Mind\" (which was later recorded by Ray Charles) among many others. I have seen this movie many times and only came to the aforementioned conclusion during my last viewing about two months ago. That also brings me to a very important part of this film: the music. It is simply wonderful. I was under the impression (until I recently viewed it) that the music was written by Aaron Copland. Now please exuse me for being a bit tutorial, but Aaron Copland for those of you who are not familiar with the name is considered the first great American Symphonic Composer. Leornard Bernstein, the composer of West Side Story, studied with Mr.Copland. The music for the film was composed by Hugo Friedhoffer, a familiar name in many movie credits of the era. What's interesting here is that the similarity between Mr. Friedhoffer's score and Copland is deliberate. Now whether they couldn't get Copland to write the music and told Friedhoffer to make it sound that way on purpose or whether Freidhoffer did it on his own I know not. Either way the unique sound is typically (by now) and primarily American and this is a story about America. It is what we would now call \"Americana\" This movie is full of emotion. There is great tragedy, humor in abundance, moving music, disappointment, longing for love, peace and security, and even confrontation and violence. It is human in every way. It is the human story. It is wonderful and it is the best, (should I ? oh! why not) \"movie of our lives\"."

        "review_title": "Among Best Films Of Our Lives",
        "review_detailed_main": "Not seldom have we seen veterans returning from wars in movies and certain assumptions are likely, but THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES occurs to be an exceptionally memorable treatment of the theme. Bosley Crowther in New York Times, soon after the premiere of William Wyler's gripping work, pointed out accurately that the film \"visions the overflowing humors and the curious pathos of such returns, and it honestly and sensitively images the terrible loneliness of the man who has been hurt.\"\n\nOne of the major strengths of this film, therefore, does not lie in entertainment (though it does not lack it whatsoever) or any sort of heroic deeds worn in glorified patriotism (something that many movies of the time did not resist), but in the very empathy it employs to the theme and the characters. William Wyler speaks to the generation with clarity and modesty derived from his very experience with the men of Air Forces. Roger Ebert develops the thought labeling the central theme as \"sobering at the problems veterans faced.\" He adds that \"Wyler doesn't pump in superfluous drama\" but actually IS with his characters and with/for his audiences. As a result, the story does not resort to the specific time of history but concludes in a rather universal, timeless insight into psychological and moral aspects of those troublesome torments and alienation therein endured. Ebert explains the fact why the movie so wonderfully passed a test of time with three adjectives applied to it: \"lean, direct, honest.\" Let me highlight those features from the standpoint of the three veterans herein depicted.\n\nThe main cast do not only come from various backgrounds, do not only portray different personalities with common experience yet diverse backgrounds but truly surprise us at multiple levels. All of them truly deservedly credit.\n\nFREDRIC MARCH, a very famous actor at the time, does a splendid job as sergeant Al Stephenson coming back home to his wife Milly (played with bravura and charm by Myrna Loy) and two kids, a daughter Peggy (played with subtlety by Teresa Wright) and a son Rob (Michael Hall). He is 'lean, direct and honest' in both merry-go-round scenes and serious moments but most captivating at the very adjustment to the family after the years of absence. The terrific ability to balance the hilarious with the serious is something that makes March's performance deserve particular attention. Although he has come back from war, much is at war within him...\n\nDANA ANDREWS as a former bombardier Fred Derry is a totally different character to analyze and perceive in the very context of pre-war vs. post-war reality - something many viewers of the time could identify with and most viewers of our time can fully understand. His destiny is shaped in direction towards Al's family (he is in love with Peggy) and yet, distorted by the haunting past and wrong choices. Here, who calls our attention is his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), a conceited, vain woman occupied with what one looks like rather than bothering to consider what one feels. Andrews is given much freedom on the screen to develop the character on a great scale for the time. He does well. But the most intriguing and perhaps the most identifiable character among them is...\n\nHAROLD RUSSELL as Homer Parrish, a sailor most hurt by the war. His artificial hands, steel hooks have become almost a symbol of the movie's most powerful anti-war aspect, and, at the same time, the reason why the story may be called \"food for quiet and humanizing thought\" (Crowther). His character moves us most and leaves us almost reflective because it embodies honesty. Homer Parrish is a living statement that evokes the indifference and arrogance of war. He is in love with Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) but he has to confront the reality the war experience has given to him. He is no longer the way he dreamed to be. Yet, the awareness of being loved helps him go on. Consider the bedroom scene with Wilma and the genuine tears of joy at having heard she loves him. Deservedly Mr Russell got the Oscar for the role and there is no question about one thing: such a screen achievement may be considered one among the very best roles of one's life. In this character lies quiet, subtle, captivating heroism.\n\nAmong the female characters, great performances are delivered by Myrna Loy as Al's wife whose acting Crowther labels as \"charmingly reticent\" and Teresa Wright as Peggy who highlights trustworthy enthusiasm and youthfullness in difficult times. Virginia Mayo's \"brassy and brutal\" (Crowther) depiction also bears watching.\n\nIn all this achievement, kudos to cinematographer Gregg Toland who employs high contrast lighting with terrific visual resonance added to the the whole story and builds the scenes upon exceptional clarity. Along with the obvious contribution of the director William Wyler, no less appreciation should go to the screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood for the perfectly framed plot(s).\n\nTHE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES may undeniably be considered as one among the best films of our lives, an intense emotional link between the characters on screen and viewers where genuine feelings conquer heroic victories."

His is probably the best performance of his career and Wright is wonderful, matching her achievement in Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt. If you have read most of the reviews associated with this film you can understand why it is not necessary to look at each individual and their performance so i wont. An exceptional motion picture with the remarkable cast.\n\nThe best movie ever? Yeah I know. There are probably 10 or so films you could put that label on.

They left to protect the country and the people they love, but have returned as different men to a country and loved ones who are different as well. As they remade themselves into the soldiers their country needed them to be, they must now find the strength to remake themselves back into the citizens that are needed now. It is about the sometimes extreme courage needed to face every new day, and the heroism needed to do the right thing under quite ordinary circumstances. It is also very much about kindness, acceptance, and the way that we adapt to each other, and try to adapt to the needs of those we love. It shows the ways we sometimes fail each other, imperfect beings that we are, but keep trying. War is hell, and you don't immediately exit hell, just because an armistice has been signed,and you get sent home."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Best Years of Our Life is often compared to It's a Wonderful Life. They never should be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is hard to know what value individual life may have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with.) Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.\n\nI have been a life long pacifist. I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that position tested. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience, moving around on her decks. She had seen a great deal of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.\n\nI cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the Lexington.\n\nEach of the three veterans paid their dues. And they paid mine as well.\n\nNo one of them got off any easier than any other. The Navy, Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.\n\nThe moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.\n\nThe other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife \u0096 standard fair for 30's/40's films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.\n\nAl is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.\n\nAll of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.\n\nI gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. We ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think The Best Years of Our Lives is rightly justified as being on AFI's 100 Best Films list. However, It is a long and somewhat boring movie, but it's one of the first films to really show soldiers coming home back to, well, their regular lives again(The Best Years of Our Lives is the pioneer in that category, which is a very valid and significant topic in history). Going back to the same job, to the family you love, dealing with the same problems and/or new problems as is the case in Homer's situation. Life goes on and stands still for no one. The acting is fantastic in this movie, and it's also very significant in the fact that it is the very first film to ever use a disabled actor in a leading role, that actor being Harold Russell.\n\nOriginally I thought Russell's performance was perfect except for the fact that he seemed very disconnected to the girl he came back to, and what I mean by this is, it didn't seem as though Russell was connecting the emotion to the scene with her but then I realized that his disconnection was perfect in the scenes with the girl he came back to(played by Cathy O'Donnell). The confusion of what he's feeling is the true genius of his acting with O'Donnell in those scenes, whether he meant to or not, it was great acting and Russell won the academy award that year for best supporting actor.\n\nThis is a movie that makes you think and that will effect you more(that you will probably realize you like more) as it digests more in your system over a few days or a few months or even a few years. Every one of us can relate in some way to the 3 main characters in The Best Years of Our Lives and I, myself personally, have had a girlfriend just like Dana Andrew's character had in the movie, I mean delineated to the core, so I felt his pain in a lot of ways.\n\nAlso, I really enjoy the real world feeling this movie generates. It's a real solid script as There are no Clich\u00e9 speeches given here. Things are dealt with in a real manner, a true to life manner and I respect that about this film.\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives is a very significant movie, and should be seen, at least once, by anyone who considers themselves to be a film buff or film historian so that they can truly appreciate the pioneer movie of this kind of material."

His wife wants a better, glamorous life, probably cheats on him and he finds solace with March's daughter who seems to understand him more. Here was an interesting triangle that gets lost.\n\nThe film is uneven and too long where the soap like drama just loses its bubble. I cannot fathom how Frederic March won the Best Actor Oscar, although non actor Harold Russell gives a genuine naturalistic performance of someone trying to make it through with his injuries and who only feels comfortable with his old soldier buddies."

This movie is a time capsule of what is was like in the 1940's. A must see movie for any true movie fan. Some critics have said this movie has aged. I disagree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us. This is just a great movie - one that can be watched over and over again."

Consider the rampant PTSD and all the other factors that affect the lives of these young men and women. Some are maimed and some are psychologically damaged as they try to resume their lives. This film brings a portrait of three men who have left the same war, World War II, with various handicaps. One has lost his hands in an accident, one has become bitter and dissatisfied with the treatment of his fellow military comrade, and the third goes back to his wife, who has no interest in him anymore, who is only interested in a meal ticket. We get to see how war has changed these people. The handicapped man is the most obvious, as he longs for normalcy, yet watches as his family and friends drop into a depressed state, utterly aware of his limitations. They don't mean to, but they take away his humanity. He falls into the pits of depression, almost driving away the one who loves him most. The other two wrestle with their own demons. This is beautifully presented in a subtle way, without being maudlin. Of course, Hollywood requires a sappy ending. Still, the rest of the movie, including the great Hoagie Carmichael as a piano playing bar owner, stands on its own merit. I hadn't seen this movie in nearly forty years and it was a delight."

It touches on the difficulties of returning veterans, admirably well for the era, but rather lightly when compared to the approach later movies would take. There is even a love story. Still, it does touch on a variety of veterans' problems, i.e. returning home without limbs, the change in status from a glamorous officer in the air corps to soda jerk, alcoholism, even touches on PTSD decades before it was officially recognized as an illness.\n\nThe most powerful scene in the film for me was when the former bombardier walks among all the dismantled airplanes destined to be scrapped. All these mighty machines of war, now no longer of use and scrapped as junk\u2014what of those mighty men of war? Are they to be scrapped?"

I am moved whenever respect is shown and appreciation is given; when there is an understanding of sacrifice and of honor. (The only similar scene which comes to mind now is that great moment from To Kill a Mockingbird when Atticus Finch leaves the courtroom after having failed to win Tom Robinson's freedom, when all of the black folks in the balcony (plus his own kids) stand to show him respect.)\n\n\n\n\nSo these two scenes meant a great deal to me when I first saw them and they still do.\n\nWhat a wonderful film!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Title - The Best Years of Our Lives\n\nDate Released (UK) - 5 March 1947\n\nAverage Rating at Time of Review - 8.1\n\nPosition in IMDB's Top 250 at Time of Review - #249\n\nDirected By - William Wyler\n\nStarring - Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews & Fredric Marsh\n\nPlot - Three World War II veterans return home to small-town America to discover that they and their families have been irreparably changed.\n\nTo be honest, I'd never heard of this film before it came time to watch it. That fact along with the three-hour runtime of the film made me a little apprehensive. A film needs to be pretty great to make me want to pay attention for such a length and given that I'd never heard of it, my expectations weren't very high going in. What I did think was that it seemed like a brave venture; coming out just a short while after the Second World War this film looks at how war can negatively impact a soldiers state of mind. Not to mention it was surrounded by war movies filled with adventure and heroics.\n\nWatching the film, I realised that it wasn't the \"pretty great\" I needed to make me want to stick around, however it was enjoyable. Most importantly, it never felt like a slog - in fact I found myself quite surprised when the credits rolled. The fact that it never felt three hours long is a point in its favour. Was it a brave film? In theory, yes. Based off of IMDB's plot description, yes. In actuality, no. Whilst the film touched upon many very real issues that were (and still are) faced by soldiers returning home, I felt that they were sidelined pretty quickly in favour of the romance plot-line, in which two of veterans played critical roles. However the third veteran, the one with the most to say on post-war struggles given that he was an amputee, isn't important to the romantic sub-plot and has significantly less screen-time than the other two. Of course, those two still face their own post-war issues, however they seem to forget them pretty quickly.\n\nPROS:\n\n-The Acting: The acting in this film was by far the best thing about. Everyone seemed to fit perfectly into their roles and there was no performance I felt was under-delivered. When any of the three main gentleman are on screen together the acting really sticks out and those were some of the most enjoyable moments in the film.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n\n\nThis film could easily have been an hour shorter and due to the lack of a strong plot, it gets a lower rating than it perhaps could have. For every one thing I enjoyed about the film, there were 2 scenes that were completely inconsequential to the overall narrative. On top of that, the most compelling character in the film is the one with the least story and the film never really delivered on demonstrating issues faced by soldiers coming home. What they did show, however, was important.\n\nThat is what this film is and what this film was - important, especially during its time. There would have been many people going through a lot of the stuff that the three soldiers went through and this film showed to them that they weren't alone. Seeing even the most downtrodden characters lives improve throughout the film also allowed them to hope, when some of them may not have had the will for it."

They rekindle old romances, lose girlfriends, handle prejudice attitudes & snotty remarks from the public. One man deals with his feelings of inadequacy by drinking too much.

        "review_detailed_main": "When Al Stephenson asks his children \"You've changed, what happened?\", \"just four years of normal growth\" says his daughter Peggy, kisses and joy ensue while this line is cooking in our head. Yes, one simple absence is liable to create shifts of misunderstanding even with your beloved ones. I have always said that besides love and respect, understanding was the underrated cement of relationships, \"The Best years of Our Lives\" explore that issue through the intertwined post-war lives of three WW2 veterans.\n\nFredric March is Al, a forty-something banker who comes back unwounded but fails to recognize his home, Peggy (Teresa Wright) grew up and gained such maturity she became a mother's substitute and his son has long abandoned the war's patriotic scope for more sensitive questions about the use of the Nuclear force. The housewife (Myrna Loy) is overwhelmed by Al's come-back but you can feel the tension, when the heat is over, Al feels entrapped and needs to celebrate his comeback anywhere but out of the house.\n\nThat \"Going for a drink\" excuse was subtly foreshadowed by the similar reluctance of Homer Parrish to meet his folks. Homer is perhaps the heart of the story, a sailor who lost his hands in duty but took it all in stride, minimizing the loss and being thanking the Navy for having taught him the use of his hooks. We're impressed by his ability to light a match and sign his name but as Al points out, they never taught him to take his fianc\u00e9e in his arms and stroke her hair, though a better line could have been \"they didn't teach the family to handle them\".\n\nHomer's no fool, he notices her mother's sobbing gasp at the sight of the hooks and knows he's going to handle awkward guilt-driven demonstrations of love. As a result, he doesn't even talk about the marriage with his fianc\u00e9e (Cathy O'Donnell) fearing she couldn't handle it, or maybe wishing she wouldn't. The irony of Homer, played with genuine intensity by Harold Russell, is that he doesn't want to be seen as a freak but is reminded of his handicap because he looks in people's eyes like in a mirror, or does he see his own reflection?\n\nAnd then there's Fred, Dana Andrews, he comes from a poorer neighborhood and his wife (Virginia Mayo) seemed to have left the house. She's obviously a \"tramp\" and soon the pride and exaltation of having a dashing husband in his uniform leads to the disillusion of unemployment. Once a respected and brave captain, Fred becomes a soda jerk, a loser in the eyes of society and his wife, for what it's worth. Fred finds the needed comfort in Peggy, she can see that he's unhappy in marriage, likewise in society.\n\nNow that the most prevalent war veteran figure is the Vietnam vet who saw his best friend being blown to pieces in Nam, here's 1946 Best Picture, directed by ace director William Wyler, and reminding us that post-war isn't just all about PTSD, shell shock and dark memories, there are physical and emotional scars, but perhaps the toughest part of the job is to try to adjust yourself to a world that changed, before you realize you're the one who changed. \"Mudbound\" handled that issue in 2017, and quite well.\n\n\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" centers on these three men's lives and their families in the generic town of Boone City. Each man represents a side effect of the war. Although it would be tempting to treat their arcs separately, I like the way the three of them tie the plot together and rather than speaking different statements about a subject, make a positive message converging toward its heart-warming conclusion, after almost three hours of a journey into the everyday lives of normal citizens.\n\nAnd this is what impressed me the most in Wyler's tone, he doesn't go for any sensational effect, or overuse of pathos, there's no forced drama or twists, the film is long because it has a certain desire to build solid and realistic bonds. In any other movie, the romance between Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews would look phony and contrived but the first day is as long as the wedding in \"The Godfather\", you feel the realness of every interaction, and both Andrews or Wright seem to succumb to a relationship they wanted to resist first.\n\nThe performances are so good I couldn't believe only March (who was splendid) and Russell were nominated, they won though, and Russell even won a second Oscar for his inspiration for WW veterans. But if you consider the whole cast, Myrna Low, Dana Andrews and Teresa Wright deserved nominations as well, but I guess they weren't because sometimes, the talent of an actor is enhanced by the directing, and the film owes a lot to William Wyler. It can ever be regarded as a school case of masterful directing.\n\nIndeed, what we take for great acting is sometimes a wonderful attention to details and characters behaving independently. In the Parrish' reunion scene, check how the father and then the mother has their first glimpses on Homer's hooks and try to ignore it. Another masterstroke is the phone booth scene, consisting on Homer playing piano with his Uncle (Hoagy Carmichael), Harry listening to them and Fred making a crucial phone call at that moment. Three actions compacted in one scene, meanwhile, many long moments dedicated to seemingly mundane trivialities, eating breakfast, dancing, drinking, working at the office.\n\nWyler knows what deserves several minutes and what can be handled in one and each character is given enough time and substance. And you know why? Because the story is all about people trying to reinvent themselves, for that, we need to know a little about their background, about what they are, and what they want to be, the film looks simple, but it's far more complex, intellectually engaging. Not to mention 100% relevant today."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I review the movie proper, I have to first acknowledge two players that were in both this and fellow 1946 Best Picture Oscar nominee It's a Wonderful Life (my all-time favorite): Charles Halton who was Mr. Carter, the bank examiner in IAWL was a banker named Prew here, and Harry Cheshire who was Dr. Campbell there is a Minister at Wedding here. Okay, this is just only my second time watching this film and both times it was during Veterans' Day. So it's a very touching story of three former military men coming home to a much changed world that they have to adjust to. Fredric March is an Army sergeant who takes back his bank job, Dana Andrews was a bombadier pilot who reluctantly goes back to his drugstore job, and Harold Russell is a sailor who has to live with his hooks for hands. Russell was actually a nonactor who got picked because director William Wyler saw him in an Army short called Diary of a Sergeant where Harold silently performed his way with how he functioned with his hooks. He's actually good bringing his emotions to his characterization as when he confronts someone he disagrees with or has to show and tell his high school sweetheart about his condition. So much so that he ended up getting two Oscars: a special one \"for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance\" and Best Supporting Actor. In fact, everyone is excellent in their roles. I especially liked Cathy O'Donnell as Homer's (Russell's role) girlfriend and Teresa Wright as March's grown daughter who takes a shine to Andrews. In fact, while I still consider It's a Wonderful Life my favorite movie, I'm now very glad the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave this one the BP award! And now that I watched both Diary of a Sergeant and this, I'll review the rest of Harold Russell's acting performances for the next few days..."

Because it is lean and thorough in revealing the numerous layers of personality to our three key characters, piece by piece, which makes them so real in a paced and timely way that sets up scenes to punctuate and surprise as it allows us to fully appreciate the depth of their individual struggles that must be overcome. IT is a great example of character development; portrayal within the given story context; and resolution delivered in a surprisingly believable way. It does this without any violence (except one scene of a man being duly punched); without any overt sex, and without any profanity. Merely the use of human interaction to all the key emotions of personal suffering, tragedy, fear of the unknown, pride, dignity, love and hope, as well as empathy and sympathy framed in the simplest but most memorable locations that harvest such believable dialogue which pulls us along with each of their lives until all three resolutions come together."

I can never forget how Homer arrives home, and how he is greeted, so bravely and so American in spirit. Even thinking about it makes my eyes water.\n\nThis is a film about bravery, about how to deal with tragedy smartly and with courage. It has humor, it has love, and as I said all the clich\u00e9s that go with it. And it is timeless, for no matter what war or period of time, people will react the same, wanting to help but not knowing how, wanting to give but not knowing what to give.\n\nA masterpiece of direction and cinema, it should be seen by young and old as a lesson both in great filmmaking and about life."

Was there ever a finer group of old Hollywood talent put to better use? Goldwyn and Wyler's best. Savor performances of Andrews (also terrific in combat film A Walk in the Sun), Wright, March, Loy and others. It is no spoiler to say the sight of Andrews character sitting in de-activated bomber is haunting. And we know from the first scene and movie history that Harold Russell essentially played himself -- a double hand amputee."

Harold Russell won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his work (the real-life veteran lost both hands in combat), and his journey, though rendered a bit stilted by his inexperience as a movie performer, is indeed very memorable. Other Oscar wins included William Wyler as Best Director; keen-eyed Fredric March as Best Actor (although Dana Andrews here is just as solid); a second, special Oscar for Russell for his inspiration to the country; and, predictably, as Best Picture of the year. The Academy never could resist films about love and life on the homefront for our returning servicemen. *** from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Best Years of our life is a powerful drama about a certain era that is executed exceptionally.\n\nThe film follows the struggles of three men returning from the Second World War. The first Al has it the easiest, as he returns to a loving family and a high level job at a bank. The second Fred runs into more difficulties. With no skills or experience he is forced to return to his job at a drugstore;to make matters worse his flighty,and shallow wife starts to reveal her true self. Finally, there's Homer a young,good natured sailor who lost both hands in the war. Physically his dilemma seems the worse but in many ways he is better off than Fred. Unlike Fred he receives a steady paycheck from the government and he has strong family support with a girlfriend who actually loves him unlike Fred's wife. Nonetheless, the film isn't about which man has the worst problems but rather how each one deals with his own.\n\nWilliam Wyler is no stranger to the struggles of the protagonists as he himself served in the war. Perhaps for this reason he is able to do such a stellar and Oscar winning job. Dana Andrews,Fredric March,Harold Russell, and Teresa Wright all give incredible performances;Fredic March and Harold Russell each on an Oscar for their performance(more like 2 in Russell's case). Equally noteworthy is Robert Sherwood and his top shelf dialogue and Gregg Tolland-the man who brought Welles' imagination to the screen in Citizen Kane.(Tolland isn't the only Kaney with Ray Collins in a brief role) However,one minor flaw in the film is the dated and melodramatic score which does take some of the drama from some scenes.\n\nThe Best Years Of Our Lives won 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, and upon release was the second highest grossing film behind Gone With The Wind. Though the film is a little melodramatic at times it is also moving,entertaining and superb."

Her role could have easily been written out as she has precious few motherly or wifely duties, other than to take away intoxicating drinks from her lush husband.\n\nFrederic March as Al Stephenson is wooden as a drunk and not an authority figure for his family at all. In only one scene does he prove that he isn't a wimp and that occurs when he tells his daughter to mind her own business and get out of Fred Derry's love life.\n\nTeresa Wright as Peggy, the Stephenson's daughter, is talented and polished in all of her scenes, and is one of the few reasons for watching the movie at all though her scene at the end is contrived.\n\nDana Andrews as Fred Derry appears to want to run away from reality in every scene he is in. One can understand why his wife played by Virginia Mayo has so many affairs.\n\nHarold Russell is THE reason for watching this movie and deserves the two Oscars he won for playing the role of Homer Parrish, who lost his hands in the war and uses prosthetic 'hooks' remarkably well.\n\nWhen you watch this movie and think about it, the title could have been \"The Worst Years of Our Lives\" and nobody would have known the difference."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is a movie from 1946 directed by William Wyler, one of the greatest directors of the classic Hollywood. The film, which takes place in a little town of the USA, is a drama about the problems that several veterans of the Second World War have to overcome when they come back home.\n\nThe three main characters (Al, Fred and Homer) meet by chance in the plane that is going to take them back home after the war. They live in the same town but they'd never met before. During the journey they share their experiences and they become friends immediately. The rest of the movie we are going to witness how difficult is going to be for all of them to come back to their lives due to the physical and psychological scars that the war has caused to them.\n\nNever before have I seen in my entire life such a touching and moving film like this! Everything in it fits perfectly. It's incredibly entertaining and at the same time is absolutely thought-provoking because the characters seen on the screen and the situations they cope with are universal and timeless, thus anyone can feel identified with them. Nevertheless, many would argue that the length of the movie (almost three hours) may be a drawback but I don't agree. In fact, the producers (as usual) organized a test screening before the official premiere, to check what the audience didn't like about the film, but the people considered the plot so haunting and gripping that the producers eventually decided not to modify a single scene of the movie, which is not very frequent.\n\nWidely praised by critics and awarded with 8 well-deserved Oscars (including best motion picture), this masterpiece soon became a huge box office success that still remains (adjusting the ticket price to inflation) as one of the most top-grossing movies of all time. I never get tired of watching it and every time I do it I can't help thinking: \"it's a real shame they don't make movies like this anymore!\".\n\n\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is definitely my favorite movie of all time, by far (alongside \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\")."

This superb drama is expertly directed by Wyler and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer Toland. Despite its near three-hour length, it does not drag for a minute. The script by Sherwood features very human characters and great dialog. Andrews has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Also good are Wright as a love-sick young woman, Mayo as Andrews' trampy wife, and real-life veteran Russell as a man who lost both his hands. However, top honors go to March and Loy as a long-married couple facing challenges while getting reacquainted with each other."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a great movie with outstanding performances by the entire cast, especially Dana Andrew's and Harold Russell's. Although released just after World War Two the movie has survived the test of time, principally because of the the nature of the story which deals with issues that are timeless in their relevancy. This movie is proof that \"they don't make 'em like that anymore.\" It is hard to imagine Hollywood being able to recreate this movie today. The audience would be able to relate to the story - who couldn't?. But who'd play the roles? Could any actor today play Fred Derry without it becoming a laughable caricature of the returning war vet? Could any actor today play an Al Stephenson without coming off as being a bloated middle-aged phony? The trouble with Hollywood today is that when it tries to make a movie about a serious subject, especially one based on actual events, it usually becomes a confused jumble of special effects interspersed with inane dialogue which veers away from the actual historical event which is shunted to the background. There are exceptions. \"Forrest Gump\" with Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese deals in part with the subject of returning war vets, but that is not the main theme of the movie. \"Saving Private Ryan\" with Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel and Tom Sizemore must get high marks for its excellent portrayals of soldiers in combat, but this movie deals with soldiers who are still fighting, not the postwar aftermath. \"Dear Hunter\" with Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken, \"Born on the Fourth of July\" with Tom Cruise and \"Coming Home\" with Jon Voight and Jane Fonda, are about postwar adjustment issues and all three are very good, very powerful movies. But even these movies have certain melodramatic features that make them rather stagy, with more focus on interpersonal dysfunctionality than on the actual events that may have contributed to the problematic behavior. The closest that Hollywood comes to approaching Best Years in terms of artistic style and thematic content is \"The Men\" with Marlon Brando, made in 1950. Filmed in a film-noir style, Best Years is far more subdued, far more intense, far more sophisticated, far less hysterical and therefore far more compelling than the other aforementioned movies. Anyway, go watch the movie.\n\nOne other item. This movie is proof that Dana Andrews was one of the greatest actors ever in the history Hollywood. The entire movie centers around his performance as Fred Derry, a character which Mr. Andrews brings to life and which has become a symbol for all soldiers who return home."

While It's a Wonderful Life is my personal favourite movie of the year 1946, The Best Years of Our Loves is an amazing,timeless movie and a more than worthy Best Picture.\n\nFirst of all, the film looks exquisite. The costumes, lighting and settings are beautiful and don't date the film in any way, and not only are the shots in The Best Years of Our Lives adeptly composed but they enhance the mood to very moving effect.\n\nI love the score too, it is very poignant-sounding and stays true to all the other film scores of that time, however it doesn't feel too overly romantic or mushy. The script is thoughtfully written, the story is always well paced, engaging and never fails to touch me, the characters are well defined and William Wyler's direction is immaculate.\n\nThe acting is superb. Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright are lovely actresses and manage to do a lot with their roles, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell are wonderful and I don't think I have ever seen Dana Andrews this good. Fredric March also gives one of the best performances of his career.\n\nIn conclusion, amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"How many times have I said I hated you and believed it in my heart? How many times have you said you were sick and tired of me, and that we were all washed up? How many times have we had to fall in love all over again?\"\n\nOne of the many reasons to love The Best Years of Our Lives is because there are so many different characters, ensuring that everyone in the audience can identify with someone. This is a story that touches you, no matter how old you are. It may be the most beloved movie celebrating our veterans, but it isn't necessarily a \"coming home\" movie. This is a movie that shows how different people cope with the same problem: What do you do when the best years of your life are behind you?\n\nAnother of the many reasons to love this movie is Hugo Friedhofer's Academy-Award winning score. This is one of the few movies ever made where each character has his or her own theme. His music evokes so many emotions from his listeners, the perfect mixture of nostalgia, tragedy, hope, love, resignation, patriotism, and perseverance. One of the many times you watch the film-because I'm sure you'll buy a copy and watch it all the time-try and imagine how terribly Max Steiner or Franz Waxman would have ruined the tender scenes.\n\nThree veterans, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell, return to the same hometown at the end of WWII. They're extremely different, and had they not been travelling companions on the way back, they probably wouldn't have even met. As it is, they make a fast friendship, and it changes the course of their lives. Freddie returns home to two grown children and must readjust to life at home with his wife and work at the bank. Dana left for the war a hotshot soda jerk, and he married just before shipping out. When he comes home, he's in for two rude awakenings: he's not qualified for civilian work, and his wife wants everything to be fun and carefree as it was before. Harold has to make the greatest adjustment of all: he lost his hands. His character, Homer, was different in the original novel; director William Wyler rewrote the character to have lost his hands because he'd met veteran Harold Russell and wanted him to act in the movie. There are no special effects in this film; the hooks you see are really Harold's hooks. It's no wonder he won Best Supporting Actor in 1946 and also took home a second Oscar for inspiring our veterans!\n\nIt's impossible to choose a favorite of the three veterans' stories, because they're all relatable, cleverly written, and realistically acted. Even the smallest roles are acted beautifully. For example. Dana Andrew's father and stepmother, Roman Bonen and Gladys George, are only onscreen for about five minutes, but their scene is one of the most touching for parents in the audience to watch. Fredric March won his second Oscar for this movie, and he gives yet another incredible performance. As his character frequently uses alcohol to help him adjust to his new life, his levels of intoxication are flawlessly realistic. Myrna Loy, Freddie's wife, is one of the most underrated classic actresses, and she gives the perfect portrayal of \"the wife\". Donna Reed and June Allyson were often cited as ideal wives during that time period, but they've got nothing on Myrna Loy. Not even nominated by the Academy, the Hot Toasty Rags awarded Myrna for supporting her husband and daughter in their own crises.\n\nDana Andrews was best known for his cool, fedora noir roles, but when he was given parts that showed off his dramatic talents, he absolutely shone. Even though he received third billing in this movie, his character was the lead (as well as in the original novel), he was given many choice scenes to show other veterans they were not alone in their disappointments, regrets, and recurrent nightmares from the battlefield.\n\nI read once that the Stanislavski method taught actors to speak softly and think loudly. I don't know if Dana studied that method, but his expressions steal the show in The Best Years of Our Lives. In one of my favorite scenes, he gets told to stay away from Teresa Wright. He doesn't say a word, but the camera lets his face say an entire monologue. You can tell every single thought he has, as if there are subtitles below his chin. Once again, not even nominated, the Rags put him in the correct category and were proud to nominate him for Best Actor.\n\nAs usual, William Wyler's impeccable directions adds to the dramatic essence of the film. He knows how to get to the core of the scene and never uses the camera to distract the audience. Equal to his talent is that of screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood. He took one of the most depressing, morbid novellas The Bishop's Wife and turned it into a delightful Christmas classic, and he adapted the novel Glory for Me, written entirely in verse, into a three hour masterpiece. I've read Glory for Me, and it's incredibly moving in its own right, but the talent it took to turn it into a screenplay is mindblowing.\n\nThis is not only a wonderful tribute to our veterans, but it shows the serious adjustments they make when they come home, without ever becoming overly dramatic. This is not only one of the best old movies ever made, but it's one of the greatest films of all time. If you've never seen it, or you've only seen the remake The Lucky Ones, buy a copy, along with a box of Kleenex. You'll feel a clutch in your heart when Cathy O'Donnell makes her entrance as the literal girl next door. Freddie and Myrna will seem like they're your own parents. You'll hope Dana will leave his frivolous wife, Virginia Mayo for the substantial Teresa - but I always hope he leaves both of them and asks me out instead. No matter how many times you watch it (my parents are past their thirtieth viewing), there are still new things to notice and appreciate."

        "review_detailed_main": "One day, film producer Samuel Goldwyn happened to flip through a copy of \"Time\" Magazine. The year was 1946, and there was an article about some American soldiers returning home after participating in World War II. As one of his own sons had just returned from fighting in Europe, Goldwyn had an idea. He thought a movie showing how these men readjust back home would be interesting. Unfortunately, no studios in Hollywood seemed to share Goldwyn's opinion.\n\nHowever, Samuel Goldwyn hadn't reached the top of his game by being apprehensive. So, he bought the film rights to the article and hired William Wyler to direct \"The Best Years of Our Live\". A logical choice given that Wyler had long been considered one of the most bankable moviemakers in Tinseltown. The director also had personal experiences from the war. He had flown in Boing B-17s during multiple combat missions over Germany. (Although not as a bombardier. Wyler had shot footage for US-Air Force documentary films).\n\nFor the cast, Goldwyn went to his supply of contract players: Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo and Teresa Wright. Then he hired Fredric March and Myrna Loy. But with the first day of shooting coming up, Wyler was getting nervous, insisting that the script wasn't ready. Goldwyn had to remind him that the actors, now drawing full salaries, were ready to go. \"And you'll pay the difference,\" he warned his director. Wyler relented. The movie was completed five days early and under budget.\n\nSamuel Goldwyn and William Wyler both worried about the length of the film (running time 172 minutes). They hoped that the audience at the sneak previews would indicate where cuts could be made. At every single screening, however, people sat in rapt attention for the entire picture. They even burst out in applause at the end. So, the movie remained uncut. Later, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" was nominated for eight Academy Awards. It won seven, including Best Picture."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of my very favorite WWII films. It's both optimistic and pessimistic at the same time with it's look at the past, present, and future. The character of Homer is my favorite. Harold Russell was no real actor. He had no acting experience until his hands were burned off in combat and then he used that disability to help other service men and accident victims. I think the scene that gets me most is when he's in his room alone and it's night and he's looking at all the photos on the wall of his high school career as an athlete. He was prominent in football and basketball and he was what most people consider 'whole' and now he has only hooks for hands and has to live the rest of his life that way. But although he's the character that would probably be the most likely to feel sorry for himself, he's the one that is probably the most grounded in reality. Dana Andrews' struggle to come to grips with who he was and who he is now is excellent as well. All in all this movie is Americana at it's best with the worst scenarios I suppose you could say. The music is wonderful, bittersweet and thoughtful. The casting is pretty well perfect, and it's just a darned good movie to watch for everyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the Netflix series \"Five Came Back,\" top Hollywood directors examine the effects World War II had five of the top directors of the time. William Wyler, who directed this film, is one of them.\n\nNo less an iconic director than Stephen Spielberg analyzes Wyler's career, his work during WWII, and this film in particular, which snagged seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and Best Supporting Actor for Harold Russell, who lost both hands in a training accident during the war.\n\nThe plot, which covers three servicemen returning home to their lives and families, is a familiar one, but Wyler insists on showing the American public that not every returning veteran slides right back into peacetime civilian life. The children have grown up, the wife isn't interested in her husband unless he's the romantic Flyboy, and the sailor without hands ponders on whether his girl will still love him and want to be with him in his changed condition.\n\nSpielberg said he watches this movie at least once a year, and always tries to see it with someone who hasn't seen it before, because it has such an impact on newbies. He particularly likes (and I agree with him) the scene where former bombardier Dana Andrews is in the field with the junked airplanes and comes up on a B-17, which is the plane he served on. The cinematography is beyond fantastic, and the score meets the challenge with equal effectiveness.\n\nEvery performance is spot-on, and the screenplay is tight and effective.\n\nI mean, if Spielberg considers this one of the finest American movies ever made, how can you argue? It's as compelling and effective now as it was in 1946. If you get the opportunity, see this film. It's worth your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most discussions of 1940's films will be tripping over themselves to again praise the overrated \"Casablanca\" and \"Citizen Kane\"; William Wyler's \"Best Years of Our Lives\" easily eclipses both of these and is easily one of the five best films of the decade.\n\nThe fact that the audience will not likely notice the film's tremendous running time is a tribute to how engaging the story is; when you finish watching \"Gone With the Wind\", you KNOW you've been watching it forever, there is no such feeling with BYOL.\n\nMyrna Loy, Dana Andrews, and even Fredric March (whom I'm not usually a great fan of) turn in the performances of their careers. Virginia Mayo's performance of a thoroughly unlikable character is also noteworthy. The weakest of the cast are Cathy O'Donnell as Wilma and much worse, Michael Hall as the wooden Rob, but they are easily compensated for by the rest of the players. The story is told beautifully, never over the top or too melodramatic, just very real. Harold Russell's portrayal of a handicapped veteran is quite unusual material for a film of this era, and is done so adeptly that one feels empathy, but never pity, and finally genuine relief when we see that his character will ultimately pass through the torturous adjustment and again enjoy a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nOther reviews have outlined the story already, I'll just say this is a film that will not disappoint. You will feel you have been transported back to post-war middle America and are realizing things about it that never occurred to you before. This film will make you laugh, tempt you to cry, and above all, give you cause to think. This is what film-making should be like. 9 stars of out 10, only because nothing is perfect."

I was pleasantly surprised to find, despite a few typical(and even welcome) dated moments of melodrama and references(\"domestic science\", anyone?), that this is a touching and incredibly well-written modern tale, full of very real humor and life.

        "review_detailed_main": "A really interesting and remarkable film, all the more so for being made in almost the immediate aftermath of the Allied victory of the Second World War when you'd expect Hollywood to produce celebratory even triumphal movies. Instead the viewer is presented with the intertwining stories of three battle-scarred veterans, ex-banker Fredric March, who tries to blot out his memories of the war from a bottle, shop assistant Dana Andrews, sufferer from PTSD, who low-status civvy-street return to the same lowly, indeed lower status job doesn't satisfy the ambitions of his floozy wife Virginia Mayo and young Harold Russell, a real-life vet and first time actor whose hands got blown off in a bomb explosion. Complications arise in particular when Andrews reciprocates March's daughter's attraction to him.\n\nThe film trails its future intentions in its opening scene when Andrews returning pilot is unable to pay the fare of a regular flight back home, his place on the plane taken by the next in line, a rich middle aged businessman who can afford the cost of extra luggage which he gets carried around for him a black attendant.\n\nThe way that nations treat their returning fighting forces still makes the news today, but back then was seen to be particularly patronising, unsympathetic and miserly. All three men struggle to adjust to everyday life and come up variously against snobbery, condescension and ignorance, but with all of them too, their wartime experiences have scarred them crippling them emotionally and making it hard for them to fit back into society after five years away.\n\nFor me however, I just could have done without the romance that springs up between Andrews and Wright, which, sensitively written and played as it was, seemed to belong to a different, melodramatic if still modern movie with its outlook on divorce. Similarly, the happy ending that all three men get seemed a little too much to be playing to the gallery, because I'm pretty sure that it wasn't the case for many a returning vet at the time.\n\nThe acting by all is sensitively and intuitively played, not forgetting the fine work by the women too, Mayo, Wright, Myrna Loy as March's worldly-wise wife and Cathy O'Donnell as Russell's loyal fianc\u00e9e while director Wyler, ably assisted by master cameraman Gregg Toland is a masterclass in understatement. It would have been easy for Wyler to milk certain scenes and lapse into sentimentality but he never does so.\n\nA box office smash on release and much garlanded with Oscars, it's an excellent, engrossing and perceptive study of how the war affected the lives of both active participants and their families back home."

Knowing the period, I knew it would be quite long and drawn out.\n\nThe movie starts of well. It goes through the initial moments clearly and sets up a good story. The middle is at times dull, and yet cheerful to me, as the viewer. The end had numerous annoyances, and did not appeal to me. The need to have a happy ending for such a serious topic seems to be where pre-vietnam movies lacked. The few topics addressed include: being treated badly, being misused, family/relationship troubles. These all exist today, and are serious issues.\n\nWith the love of violence and mass murder of the culture, it makes sense that such a movie was/could have been very popular. The ease of transition for some of them does make the film quite disappointing on further thought. All in all, the times were different, though the problems are still primary when we think about returning soldiers/terrorists from these countries.\n\nWorth a watch, especially for those that like strong performances. The acting is superb. The story is the letdown, not the amazing work of the actors."

All that Vito Corleone, the various Woody Allens, Kane, Scarlet O'Hara and so many others share is this vital exuberance so painfully missing from anyone in this film. Movie characters may be virtuous and good but they should never be nice and this movie drowns in its niceness, in all its stolid virtues."

It tells of an aspect of the WWII era that is very seldom mentioned in any Hollywood film of that time period-that is how the returning veterans readjusted to the peacetime situation.\n\nThe three main characters are not wartime buddies. They meet on their way home to the same small town. Each has a unique, but realistic situation. Fredrick March, as usual, is outstanding in his role as a typical suburban dad. The other actors give excellent performances as well.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, the issue of disability is also brought up in this movie-another rarity for an old movie. (Heck, a rarity even for a modern one!) This calls to mind the true costs of war, which are brought up both in their physical and psychological aspects. But, this is NOT an anti-war film. It is a realistic portrayal of the proud members of America's \"greatest generation.\" All in all, I highly recommend this movie, particularly for younger people how may benefit from an appreciation of what the older generation did for us all. With some sense of guilt I only rated this movie with an 8, only because some people, hoping for an action packed wartime drama, might be disappointed."

The casting and acting is pitch perfect and amateur actor Harold Russell received two Oscars for one performance. All the primary bourgeois values (money, family, patriotism) are well defended. Suspense is maintained as we hope for a happy future for the likeable characters. Wyler's staging, aided by the great DP Gregg Toland (\"Citizen Kane\" (1941) is extraordinary: Russell picking up the flag lapel pin off the floor, Dana Andrews calling Teresa Wright in the saloon as Russell and Hoagy Carmichael play the piano in the foreground, Roman Bohnen reading the citation to Gladys George, Andrews visiting the cockpit of the derelict plane, and the wedding are only a few of the unforgettable moments. The staging of these and other scenes, accompanied by Hugo Friedhofer's haunting score places this show in the front rank of great war films, along with the more depressing, but more truthful, \"anti-war\" pictures."

I cannot select one or two actors that standout as every single performance was a standout. If I had to choose just one performance though it would be the sultry and two timing performance of Virginia Mayo.\n\nI don't give many films a perfect 10 out of 10 IMDb rating but The Best Years of Our Lives is most deserving of this rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love this movie. In a time when movies were heavy on propaganda and looked at life, especially WWII, with rose-colored glasses, this movie adds surprising and refreshing balance.\n\nIt starts off with 3 veterans. One is a middle-aged business and family man trying to find his place in his old life again, the second is a man with PTSD returning to the young wife he married on a whim and hardly even knows, and the last is a young man returning to his family and childhood sweetheart with a cheery attitude, but a life-altering disability.\n\nIt's still a bit rosy-eyed, but the subjects it covers are not; disability, PTSD (whether they call it that or not), alienation from your spouse/significant other, alienation from yourself, and the heavy cost of war. And that's just scratching the surface.\n\nThere's a lot I don't want to give away, but I will say this; this movie went to many unexpected places, and it did so with grace and maturity. This is a joyful movie, but it's also sad and bitter and shows some of the harsh realities of what life can throw at us.\n\nEverything about the movie is phenomenal. My only critique is that a few scenes do drag on a bit, but it's still worth it. My favorite part about it is the actress Theresa Wright, who gets a lot of screen time in this movie. Her emotions aren't often stated, but the viewer can read her face like a book during any scene she is in.\n\nI wish this movie were better known. It is as relevant today as it was in 1948 (please note, this reviewer is under 25). I know I will never forget it."

What is very unusual, and what makes the film truly great, is the vision of the future that each of the main characters has. The world, following WWII, has changed them and notwithstanding physical and emotional traumas, it has changed them for the better. They are men united by service to a great cause, a just cause and the right cause. Having given so much of themselves they wish to see a better world on their return after victory.\n\nParticularly at this time in 2004 that message resonates loud and clear to me. Another just war is taking place and the US and UK are again present, together, in the service of freedom and democracy. Let us hope that when victory is achieved that the world will also be changed for the better.\n\nFor me, Fredric March's portrayal of \"Sarge\" is so right that it should be considered among the great movie portrayals of all time!\n\nAll in all a marvellous film, that deserves to be seen again and again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" for the very first time this morning prepared to loathe every minute of its almost three hour running time. Why ? I have an aversion to \"prestige films\". Movies that are made it seems just to win Oscars (\"Gandhi\", \"Titanic\"). I know that my prejudice is unreasonable and I risk missing some very good movies because of it but what can I do-I like quirky flicks, also ran's and B-movies the hell with the Miss America's I want the bearded lady in the side show. I was a bit disappointed I kinda liked this movie. I liked Myrna Loy and Dana Andrews, both great screen actors. I love Teresa Wright-she can do no wrong in my book. Fredric March was the weakest of the leads despite winning the Oscar for best actor (too much fat on this ham) but Virginia Mayo's performance holds up (and talk about va-voom! What a knock out. I wish they had gone with an actor for the role of the disabled vet. Harold Russell was admirable to tackle the part but his inexperience as a performer was off putting (think Sofia Coppola in \"The Godfather 3\"). Thank god we have William Wyler helming the picture-he is a great director and keeps this cumbersome vehicle humming along. Best scene: March's homecoming when Loy realizes it is her husband who has rang the doorbell. Almost wordlessly executed it is an exquisite piece of filmmaking. Too bad there are not enough of them to make this a great movie-only a pretty good one"

On top of that the movie is like 3 and half hours long and you will be keeping your finger on the fast forward hoping that this crap gets finished as soon as possible that is of course if you haven't turned it off by then and it has no good actors that you have ever heard of in it. i promise you that you will not know the definition of boring until you watch this film. The actors are all lame in playing the part and the fat guy looked like he was just sleep walking his way through the part. How can people love this film unless they are an old hunchback man with grey hair. when i put on this movie i was expecting it to be about 1 and half hours and i looked on my DVD timer and saw it had about 2 and half hours left! If you watch this film and need to go to the toilet don't worry about missing anything important. you won't."

One cannot praise the ensemble cast enough, and kudos to sexy Virignia Mayo, and two standouts: Teresa Wright and Harold Russell. I am a Veteran myself but of a later war but found the similarities of the treatment given returning WWII Veterans and those of Vietnam and Desert Storm very powerful. Great black and white photography and a beautiful musical score add to the picture. Starting with its evocative title The Best Years of Our Lives is one of the finest films I have ever seen. March, Wright and Russell won Oscars, as well as Mr. Goldwyn, Mr Wyler and the Picture. Deservedly so! Ms. Loy top billed has a small but very pivotal role and is magnificent.\n\nA Great Movie\n\nPS The Reunion scene between March and Ms.Loy is one of the finest scenes in any movie ever!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's undeniable an exceptionally well made film but it's also undeniably a film of its time. It's a story that needed telling but with a three hour run time, it does drag a little.\n\nThe mundanity and indeed slow pace does give this picture an incredibly authentic feel. You, yourself find that you have been transported to 1946 America with all its difficulties but also all its hopes. That feeling of actually being there is enhanced by Gregg Toland's fabulous deep-focus photography. His cinematography certainly makes this feel like something special.\n\nBeing so relevant to the lives of everyone in 1946, it's obvious why this had to be so sensitively handled but today it does feel slow and overly sentimental. Nevertheless the uncertainty and optimism of that time is perfectly captured but the lack of edginess doesn't give this picture any real punch.\n\nHEROES FOR SALE dealt with similar issues thirteen years earlier (different war of course) but 'one take Wellman' managed to convey so much more drama and outrage in his film in just over an hour making that one massively more engaging. BEST YEARS tries a little too hard to burrow into your emotions. Its structured and formulaic approach channels your perceptions, not allowing you to discover the subtext for yourself. But that's not such a bad thing, following William Wyler's set path, even at such a glacial pace is still an emotional journey worth taking."

        "review_title": "A supremely likable drama, yet worthy of deeper reflection...",
        "review_detailed_main": "I love this film. Hollywood has rarely achieved more compelling - and likable - human drama. This is a glossy and romanticized slice of Americana, yet it tells a powerfully real story. It's got great screen stars - most notably Fredric March - doing some of the best work of their careers. And it has absolutely impeccable direction by William Wyler - so polished that you have to work hard to pull back and actually notice the sophisticated techniques at work.\n\nThe film's only limitation is one it can't avoid: it's of its time and place. This is a 1946 Hollywood film about the aftermath of global conflict that had only just ended. It's a work that tackles a deeply political topic, from within the period it tries to capture. This inherent difficulty comes through in one subtle way and in one overt scene.\n\nThe subtle slant comes from what we don't see. For example, we aren't shown the many soldiers who were far worse off than our three protagonists. Homer Parrish does mention that his own shocking disability is actually one of the milder ones he's seen. The film passes this off as casual heroism on his part, when it's in fact all the lip service that's given those who paid a much higher price than this film's relatively lucky trio. All three of whom swiftly find supremely happy endings - surely, not a statistically realistic outcome. This can be thought of as subliminal propaganda, no doubt, but it's mostly just artistic license - a way of sugar-coating some hard truths for the benefit of a war-weary public.\n\nThe one overt bit of actual propaganda comes in the scene in which Homer gets in a fight with a guy at the lunch counter, who dares to question the political rationale behind the war. If you listen carefully, this man actually says nothing derogatory regarding the troops. Although his manner is made deliberately obnoxious, what he says repeatedly is simply: \"get the facts, learn for yourself.\" An admonition that should never be controversial, in a free society. Yet when Homer snatches away the man's flag lapel pin, the message seems to be that some topics are simply too important to be examined rationally, because, well... patriotism. Once you've spent enough lives, it's no longer acceptable to question whether the tactics were wise or the cause just.\n\nWe can only hope that this point of view may look a lot more dangerous now, than it must have in 1946. But, to its credit, the film can also be read another way. It does at least hint that the two servicemen are in fact over-reacting. That they probably should question the official narrative, but that their memories are still too painful. Is the scene helping create an attitude of denial... or consciously reflecting upon one that inevitably did exist? I suspect the subtlety is deliberate. Which is the most we could hope for in a mainstream film originating in this time and place.\n\nObviously, any film must be viewed in the context of history. The Best Years of Our Lives must have been a revelation in 1946. A landmark, in going as far as it did in recognizing that the human cost of a war extends far beyond the conflict itself, even for the 'victors.' But today it remains above all a brilliant bit of human drama, a supremely skillful telling of three intertwining stories about characters that are at once noble, likable and credible. It's a film that takes real effort to analyze, simply because it's so overwhelmingly enjoyable."

An airman finds that whirlwind airbase romances do not necessarily hold up to peacetime challenges. An army sergeant returns to an even better job than he left, but has more complicated battles to fight.\n\nSeven Oscars were well deserved. A subtly solid cast, including Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Hoagy Carmichael and my new favorite actress, Teresa Wright. William Wyler and Gregg Toland save their tricks for the key scenes.\n\n10 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nothing to add, really, to the encomia of praise contained below. I had missed catching this iconic flick several times on TCM and finally caught up with it. I had feared it might be somewhat of a soap opera, but it is an exemplar of the type of film that is able to make the viewer care very deeply about the characters portrayed. The bond that is clearly shown between the three central characters - men who had not previously known each other, either at home or during the war - shows us what a powerful bonding experience fighting for one's country is. They clearly \"know\" each other in a way that transcends geography and class. In a certain way this movie tells us more about WWII than many of the overtly action flicks.\n\nAnother thing that this great movie brings home is the sad difference between moviemaking then and now. What we have here is clearly a powerful story about a shared national experience, with great relevance to people's lives and a strong social commentary, done up as a work of cinematic art, and Sam Goldwyn, William Wyler and all involved knew it. Compare this with the crass way that today's Hollywood churns out the dreck it calls \"product\", with its eyes on nothing else than the bottom line.\n\nTo me the culmination of the movie is when Fred, waiting for his departing plane, climbs into one of the derelict bombers on the field. The sound track and the visuals give us closeups of the engines, and we hear the sound of them starting, taking the viewer into Fred's reverie of his wartime memories, rudely broken when a field attendant asks him what he's doing. It's one of the most miraculous moments in cinema.\n\nA note: those not familiar with the story of Harold Russell, the amputee who played Homer Parrish and went on to found AMVETS, would do well to look it up. His is a fascinating story. (And IMDB is just the place to look it up!)"

Teresa Wright, Cathy Cathy O'Donnell Myrna Loy, Virginia Mayo, were at the top of their game with their performances. On the opposite male side, you had the usual excellent portrayals by Fredrick March, Dana Andrews, of the characters they were portraying.

Words fail to describe the sheer number of complimentary accolades I have for his film classic. First, the direction... who can top William Wyler, one of the greatest directors in American film? And it's impossible not to mention the stellar casting of his amazing film... from Frederick March in one of the best roles of his later years, to the legendary Myrna Loy as the long-suffering wife and mother\u2014the perfect counterpoint to a superb March. In my opinion, this was also the finest film performance of Dana Andrews' career. Then there was the inimitable Hoagy Carmichael as the saloon piano player, and another bit of inspired filmmaking in the casting of a virtual unknown and actual double-amputee, Harold Russell, who went on to win the Oscar for his first and only big screen role. Even the superb soundtrack by Hugo Friedhofer was in a word, memorable. Seen through the eyes and personal experiences of all those returning from the last \"Great War, this film successfully combines the best of drama, love stories, and events, capturing their hearts and souls with loving care. Since the decades since it was made, this stunning and moving film remains a shining testament to both the servicemen whose sacrifices contributed to our living history, and the very best Hollywood has to offer."

First, look at the talent, Wyler as director, a Robert Sherwood script, Myrna Loy and Fredric March as leads? Right there you have the 'A' team. The results should not be surprising.\n\nThe script is just right. Without illusions but without cynicism. It shows hard truths and true love. It is tight and well paced.\n\nThe directing is outstanding. The pace and tension of the scenes are spot on. And many of the shots were superb, Wyler getting the camera angle just right, focusing in the key element yet keeping the rest of the scene in play. His control of the lighting is equally good yet so subtle is his command you are hardly aware of it.\n\nThe acting is first rate. Like any great movie, all characters gave strong performances, although Myrna Loy and Frederic March were superb. Altogether, even in the smaller characters like Fred Derry's parents or 'Spikey', were perfectly cast. Even Hoagy Carmichael, a professional musician, gave a strong, believable performance.\n\nThis is a very fine picture that remains fresh, meaningful and undated to this day. The sensitivity and deftness with which Homer Parrish's lost limbs are handled is itself a great achievement in both art and humanity. It was a good balance of not only the acceptance of his loss by others, but also the acceptance of himself. And his final belief that others saw and accepted him as he was and not what he had lost.\n\nSee this film. You won't be disappointed. Only the most callous and hardened heart would fail to appreciate it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Best Years Of Our Lives (1946) -\n\nThis was a very slow going film and in many ways it did seem a little bit forced.\n\nPersonally I could appreciate Homer's (Harold Russell) story more easily, as it had that extra layer of depth and heart to it, although it was easy to see the message that the film was trying to send about the adjustments a returning soldier would have had to make and those that their families would have had to make too, which was represented in the storylines of Al Stephenson (Fredric March) and Fred Derry (Dana Andrews).\n\nI have frequently had to manage different groups of friends as I've moved through my life and career, with many falling along the wayside, so I could understand the difficulties of integrating old friends from home with the new ones that understood the experience that only the 3 lead fellas had gone through. Although I could never know the horror that these soldiers must have faced of course.\n\nBut it seemed a bit like metaphorically talking to old friends about one job in a garage, while my new office based friends were oblivious to what was so funny about old Mr Magoo's rattling sound in the trunk, that turned out to be his old false teeth. One group would always feel left out.\n\nAs for the cast, they all did well and Dana Andrews in particular was quite nice to look at.\n\nHowever, I did have to wonder if Harold Russell would have received his Oscar's if he hadn't been the only one playing an otherwise abled character in film at that time. Don't get me wrong, he played the part carefully and appropriately and I respect his abilities to live his life regardless, he was far more mobile and with a far more positive attitude than my own, but I didn't see an outstanding performance from him, that I would expect the little gold man to be given out for.\n\nOther than that I found it difficult to believe Rob Stephenson (Michael Hall) was of school age, because he was quite a big lad, even at 19, but it didn't effect the main plot too much, except that I did have to question where he disappeared to in all the affairs that followed.\n\nIn general it was a good film, but the sheer length of it was tiring, especially as it didn't really say much more than it's message about the trials of returning home, which had been well established from the offset.\n\nThey did try to incorporate some ups and downs and emotional moments, but there was nothing to really excite the story. As such it was JUST a good film.\n\n482.76/1000."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is a drama about three American servicemen, from the same small town, who are trying to adjust to their new lives back in the states after World War II. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews),a decorated young airman, Al Stephenson (Frederic March), an older man serving as a sergeant, and a sailor, Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), who is retuning with the loss of his hands and must use metal hooks. The war has affected each of them in their own way. Al Stephenson, who is coming home to a cushy job at a bank and a very nice family, has a problem with alcohol. Fred Derry comes home suffering from nightmares. He discovers his wife has been cheating on him and is more of a party girl than anything else. Homer has the worst physical transformation of them all. Mentally, he comes home not being able to stand his family feeling sorry for him and then tries to drive his fianc\u00e9 away when she tries to care for him. All and all this is a serious look of what really happens to soldiers when they return home from war. The performances of these men were superb demonstrating openly the mental and physical realities that go along with the horrors of war. Each performance is subtle and genuine. Al's wife, Millie (Myrna Loy) does an excellent job portraying the supportive wife, helping Al assimilate to his old life. Marie Derry (Virginia May) is looking sharp playing the mouthy, cheating wife of Fred Derry. Teresa Wright deserves a nod too; playing Peggy Stephenson, Al's daughter who falls in love with Fred. This film has amazing cinematography. With the use of deep-focus photography, the meaning of each scene reveals itself to the viewer, instead of just being shown close-up after close-up. For example, the wedding scene between Homer and his fianc\u00e9, the director, Wyler, focuses on the entire room, but as Homer and his girl are getting married, we can also see Fred and Al's daughter, Peggy, professing their love to each other. This film runs a little long, approximately three hours, but is certainly a must see. The story is strong and the performances are outstanding. The director, William Wilder, utilizes his years of experience and talent to bring to the screen the most accurate depictions of the combat veterans he came in contact with during his years of service during World War II."

        "review_detailed_main": "Has anyone ever wondered what are the best years of our lives and when do they happen? I think that your best years (or to be more exact, the best time) of your life is right here and right now because we don't get to analyze its goodness until much later. We all just live our lives the way we do and hope for better things to happen more often than worse ones. It surely doesn't sound like the best time but it's all there is and we should be grateful for it and consider it best or at least second best after some terrific event that happened to us up to this point.\n\n\"The best years of our lives\" won 7 Oscars including the best motion picture, the best director for William Wyler, the best actor for Fredric March and the best supporting actor for Harold Russell who made his film debut. But number of Oscars doesn't speak much about the movie - people do. And let me tell you this movie is an absolute wonder of the motion picture world; it lasts almost three hours but doesn't feel even the slightest bit long - the narrative goes on smoothly and we get to see the growing of every main character.\n\nThe movie tells a story of three WWII soldiers who come back to the real world after the war and face the difficulties of adjustment. Lazy description but I couldn't have done it better with other words. The topic isn't outdated one bit; nowadays the soldiers face the same problem all the time, only today they're bound to wanting to get more help from the outside than back in the days when tough men were used to deal with everything all by themselves.\n\nThe only regret I have about this movie is that Fredric March won an Oscar for it over James Stewart's wonderful performance that year but it is well-deserved anyhow. All three of the main male characters showed their greatest play and this movie will brighten the best years of our lives for sure."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is incredible to believe that tens of millions of 18-35 year old men(single and even many family men) left their home to travel thousand of miles away for many years to fight a war that affected the Continental USA not at all and Europe, Asia, and Africa far more. They gave up jobs(not that it was a booming time), girls, and family to fight and in 400,000 cases die, without complaint and in many cases never living to see what we consider normal life passages. Frederic March looks a little too old to have fought, but his presence and family provides a window into the business and romantic world of the post World War II era. Dana Andrews is a little old but still fantastic as the guy who gets kicked in the teeth but in the end prevails. Harold Russell is as natural as a new snowfall- most people at that time talked in a simple monosyllabic manner. Teresa Wright is magnificent, and I agree with Larry King that the ending kiss is the most romantic ever; probably a function of the time. Everyone else plays their role to a T; Andrew's father and (I guess) stepmother smoking like chimneys while sitting in a shabby apartment reading the citation from General Jimmy Dolittle with their voice cracking is incredible(I imagine that would be like getting a letter from Tom Brady or Simon Cowell now). And don't forget about the airplane graveyard sequence Corny, yes but maybe it was a corny time. If you have a chance please watch this- it is 3 hours well spent. It is hard to believe that EVERYBODY from this movie is dead now."

I was a child during that time and can recall my dad returning from the war and how happy we all were to have him home. But I was too young to realize the deep emotional impact that my dad and mom went through to reconnect. Regarding the movie there was only I thing that appeared out of place. It had to do with Fred's army uniform. There were 5 hash marks on the sleeve of Fred's army jacket. If, as many who saw the movie theorize that Fred was in his mid to late twenties and each hash mark stands for 5 years of service, then that would have made Fred at least 40 yrs. old if not older. And as old as Al. Did anyone else catch this?"

This is not a film about one story but 5 different stories that even upon watching the first 10 to fifteen minutes into the film can be made into a film in itself. If I were to be asked what is to be one of my all time favorite films would be, this film would definitely be on the top of my list. Upon seeing this film for the first time I could not believe the many issues this film deals with such as acceptance, antisemitism, the human psyche, alcoholism and job security all that are still relevant in times such as today. I was always curious why this film did so well at the Oscars, but after seeing this film, I now understand why this film must win. I have no idea after reading some reviews from respected film critics are calling this film a well made SOAP OPERA when to me it's more of a social commentary about our government, and the issues war veterans must face upon coming back home, from a war that can ruin any normal human being."

They were so energetic in their pursuit of both accomplishment and FUN that they became caricatures to many of my contemporaries, and stimulated much of the cross-generational conflict of the 60's and 70's.

        "review_title": "War Veterans Return Home",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is an introspective movie about three veterans adjusting to civilian life after World War II. The film, directed by William Wyler and released in 1946 strikes a significant chord even today. The story follows Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) an Army Air Force Captain, Homer Parrish (Harold Russel) a Navy man who lost his hands in the war, and Al Stephenson (Frederic March) an infantry platoon Sergeant. They meet on their way home to Boone City and each one experiences excitement and apprehension in resuming the life they had before the war. The three veterans have their own personal story. Fred Derry before leaving for the war, impulsively married a showgirl (Virginia Mayo) who turns out is only interested in money and having a good time. Harold and his longtime girlfriend Wilma had plans to marry, but fears she won't accept him with his physical disability, and Al Stephenson returns to his banker's job and a family who has grown up while he's been away. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is beautifully and poignantly shot by Academy award cinematographer Gregg Toland, famous for films like \"Citizen Cane\" and \"Grapes of Wrath.\" Toland provides in depth wide shots incorporating busy real life activity as depicted in the department store scene where Derry reluctantly returns to work. The scene with Derry in the background of the piano bar as he makes a painful phone call while Homer plays piano (with his hooks) alongside Uncle Buck (Hoagy Carmichael) is compelling. Various film scenes cleverly shot such as the view of the aircraft graveyard gives a sense of irony and tell a deeper story. A strong performance by Theresa Wright as Stephenson's daughter who is in love with Fred Derry, adds to the conflict. Myrna Loy and Cathy O'Donnell round out an excellent cast. The biggest surprise for me was the performance of real life disabled veteran Harold Russell. He gives a sensitive and straightforward performance as \"Homer\" that earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" won 8 academy awards including Best Score and Best Picture."

I think this is why Wyler's stock has gone down over the year. But that is not the case here as it is very clear that a man returning home from WWII was the driving force behind this film. (Wyler served in a filmmaking unit). The film feels very authentic and in the details it rings true.\n\nI like how screenplay did its best to represent as many types of veterans as possible. You get a pilot, infantry, and a sailor. You have struggles around PTSD, physical disability and changes in mores. You have various statuses around relationships. Far to often films like this try to reduce collective experience down to a single narrative but here the very good screenplay resist that urge.\n\nFinally, the film is of course wonderfully acted. For my money Harold Russell gives the most engrossing performance of the film. It is not the most polished performance but it doesn't have to be. It is a raw true performance.\n\nIt all adds up to a very good film indeed."

William Wyler and Robert Sherwood manage to interweave the inter-connected tales poignantly, illustrating the frustrations, bordering on despair, not only of the three men - in completely different ways; but also of their respective partners who must also adjust to their return, and to their new circumstances once the war is has been won. There are some strong performances from their ladies too - Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright, less so the always rather wooden Virginia Mayo and by the end you do have some, slight, semblance of an idea of just how tough it was for these men to lose the security and discipline of their army lives and to cope with a life that has, in many cases, just moved on without them."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though this film has aged slightly it remains my all time favourite. A terrific script, great direction and excellent performances by the principals make it captivating viewing. I agree with the Dana Andrews line that the Teresa Wright character should have been \"put into mass production\". If anything, though, this confirms that the principal characters are too little flawed and that the whole thing is a little preachy. The views embodied in the script, that war is terrible and that sacrifices are needed from all in the recovery process, would have been prevalent in the 1940s. They still stike a chord with me but they do age the film. Still the best ever in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is perhaps the best movie about WW II. Many movies and popular treatments of the immediate post-war period overlook the tremendous uncertainty that faced returning servicemen and their families. It was believed by many that a recession or depression would follow the war, leaving veterans with no jobs, and divorce rates went way up as wartime couples (much like in this movie) found the going tough during peacetime. Not until after this movie was made did it become clear that the economy would do well and that the GIs, supported in large part by the GI Bill, would come to prosper and spark the remarkable postwar expansion of the economy. This film's strength is the frank way in which people's apprehensions affected their personal lives."

It contains several of the most memorable moments in film history, first rate performances by virtually the whole cast, one of the great scores in movie history, and a story that perfectly reflects the post war years. The atmosphere is achingly real, of the hope and emptiness and uncertainties, of the difference in generations and experiences, and of the changes in the United States. The Best Years of Our Lives presents the Post War Era and its personages so intimately that you feel something for every one of the characters. This is, obviously, one of my favorites and I recommend it as highly as any movie ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just discharged from their service, three WW2 veterans share a transport home, then stop for beers before rejoining families, all facing challenges in re-adjusting to civilian life: Al Stephenson is a banker who passed on officer training but won't pass up a happy hour, Fred Derry is a decorated flyer experiencing night sweats, his major league wife looking for a different pitch, and Homer Parrish is physically disabled, losing both arms in naval action and now fears that he will lose his fianc\u00e9e next.\n\nFilmed at the direction of twelve time Academy nominee William Wyler (3), he is joined by all star talent in FDR wordsmith, the literal (6'8) and literary giant (Pulitzers), Robert Sherwood and noted lensman Gregg Toland (Grapes). An early crest in the realism wave, portraying post-war problems divorce, drink and disability, then winner of nine Oscars (BP), Years has been called the finest movie ever made. That would be generous for it is long in the drama (172m) and over sells it, all of it.\n\nWhat makes it memorable, if not deserving of all its hardware, are the actors: Fredric March is Al who might've had a commission but chose to take a greater share of the risk as a sergeant in combat, the same way he approves loans. One of America's greatest performers on screen & stage (UW's Board of Regents are a timid, simple lot), March really makes the movie, inspiring as the protective parent whose Cornbelt speech probably won him the Oscar (\"collateral\"), sarge typically tight and nearly trip-wires but does an about face, finding balance between people & profit to the relief of his employer (Collins) & worried wife (Loy); Dana Andrews plays Fred the war hero who leaves his medals at home where they belong (no vanity), wisely conceding to Al's demand (no Peggy) but thinks time stood still stateside (\"Stinky\") and forgets what he what he fought for (free speech), throwing a political punch at a holdover isolationist (Teal); and first-timer Harold Russell as disabled sailor Homer, lacking the skill we'd come to expect from 40s Hollywood, yet, beams with authenticity and \"courage.\"\n\nMissing in action are the homefront stories. Myrna Loy plays Milly Stephenson, mom surely having faced her own battles augmenting a sergeant's pay, raising two teens and, being a looker, engaging relationships, plutonic or otherwise. Virginia Mayo is Marie, Fred's frustrated wife, scripted ungrateful & unfaithful yet, with no kids and years apart, her lack of domesticity is defensible, her needs obvious, some satisfied by Cochran (Cliff), their coupling having had the potential for sequal (The Wild Years). And then there's Cathy O'Donnell as Homer's devoted friend, Wilma. Committing to a disabled vet is a personal and, at times, difficult decision. Makers having scripted that mental state would've spoken to those who struggle for the right answer.\n\nCo-stars piano man Hoagy Carmichael, Ray Collins runs the bank, Gladys George and Roman Bohnen are Fred's parents who discover his citations for valor (DFC) (FD: \"Those things came in K-rations\") in what proves for this critic the film's most moving scene, the omni-present Ray Teal (Bonanza) (UCLA) deserving a medal for bravery playing mouthy Mollett and Teresa Wright is pretty Peggy, much admired (\"They might put you into mass production\") and disputed (Sgt Dad v. Cpt Married) who, along with Derry, give us the V-L Day (Victory in Love) we'd hoped for to close it all out.\n\nOur Lives opens a small window into the big issues faced by veterans coming home, a portal draped in heavy melodrama, better viewed by those who've an affinity with the highlighted characters (3/4). For a film better depicting the havoc war can wreak on marriage, one delving deeper on detailed, revealing dialogue (\"the best years of your life\"), see MGM London Korda's wonderful war romance, Perfect Strangers (45) (Vacation from Marriage) starring Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr (3.5/4)."

        "review_detailed_main": "World War Two is over and three men meet on a plane on their way back home in the good old US of A. They're each from the same town, but otherwise they couldn't be more different in their war careers, origins, current occupations and future prospects. This movie is their story as their lives intermix and they all have to learn how to deal with normal life after the ravages of war.\n\nThe filming for this movie began only seven months after the war and the movie actually contains an actual war veteran as one of its main characters. Harold Russell lost both of his hands in a training accident during the last years of the war, and likewise his character, Homer Parrish, has to deal with the loss. Truth be told, it took me a while to realize they had actually gotten an amputee for the role. I kept praising the special effects, especially for such an old movie...\n\nDetails like that certainly give the film an authentic vibe, but then again, not a lot of time had passed since the war, and the long-term horrors and symptoms these men would have to fave had yet to surface. As such it's a bit of an idyllic version of what would happen, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't pleasant to watch.\n\nEspecially because the film is written and acted so well. I liked all of these characters, with special mention going to Peggy Stephenson (Teresa Wright). I liked how they could, despite their engulfing differences, look each other in the eye, find something that echoes and treat each other as equals. That's an important message, which we quite often forget.\n\nWhat more to say? It's a pleasant movie to watch, especially if you're looking for a drama after which you won't feel the weight of the world on your shoulders."

Everyone in the theater in 1946 - veterans, their families and sweethearts - saw themselves on the screen, and they saw their stories told with taste and respect. The movie may end with a wedding, but does not insult our intelligence by suggesting this guarantees a happy ending. Indeed, as one character suggests, real troubles may be just beginning. But the final mood is one of determined optimism.\n\nIn a scene that must have stunned audiences then, Homer Parrish, played by true double arm amputee Harold Russell, calmly explains to his girlfriend the way his artificial arms are removed each night. Her response - and his subsequent reaction - are as emotionally rich as anything on film.\n\nWonderful performances all around, direction that manages to be both innovative and restrained, and a moving and tasteful score complete the package.\n\nA great, great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "For a film released in 1946, this movie does not turn away from the harsh truths of returning servicemen to the USA. Whereas my generation always thought WWII veterans received heroes welcomes, with prosperity for all, the reality was in some cases quite different. Some had PTSD, but many others had physical wounds that would make their transitions, that much more difficult. Such is the story of three vets, all from the same town who happen to share a flight home. They become fast friends, and begin the journey back into their former lives. But can they succeed?\n\nThe cast of veterans, Led by Dana Andrews, as Fred Derry, an Army Air Force Captain, Fredric March as Al Stephenson, an Army Sgt., and Harold Russel as Homer Parrish, a seaman who has been grievously injured, losing both his hands in the war. The three actors have great chemistry, and you really believe that they are service buddies. Each has a different path to walk, and each a different background. But what keeps this movie on \"Great Movies\" lists, is that it does not shy away from the ugly side of returning home to a country that has changed forever in the 4 years of warfare.\n\nFailed marriages, alcohol abuse, learning to cope with physical ailments are some of the things that these men must face. It is all handled very solidly, by director William Wyler. Maybe the best part of the movie, is real life veteran Harold Russel, who did lose his hands in a training exercise. He is so at ease, and so natural, you can't help but root for him.\n\nHighly Recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES (RKO Radio, 1946), directed by William Wyler, ranks one of the most important motion pictures ever produced. While this could have been made by another major studio as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer or under production by David O. Selznick, it is Samuel Goldwyn, independent producer of some of the greatest movies ever made, who turns out something quite special as well as timely. After some years of countless war movies usually set during World War II (1941-1945), now the war over and now time for a change, the change being soldiers returning home to find things not only having changed, but now venturing into a different world of adjustment. As much as this has happened to many war veterans returning home ranging from the Civil War to World War I, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES visualizes the lives of those after World War II with a fine mixture of screen veterans to newcomers making their performances as real as the characters portrayed.\n\nThe story follows three war veterans meeting for the first time while hitching an airplane ride home to Boone City: Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), an Air Force captain and former soda jerk; Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), a young seaman who had lost both his hands in action now wearing articulated hooks in their place; and Al Stephenson (Fredric March), a middle-aged infantry sergeant and former bank executive with a fondness of liquor. Upon arriving home, each life is told involving their adjustments: Al is greeted by his wife, Milly (Myrna Loy), but finds his children, Peggy (Teresa Wright) and Rob (Michael Hall) have not only matured in his absence, but all have become strangers to him; Fred returns to his father (Roman Bohnen) and stepmother (Gladys George) in a run-down home near the railroad tracks, discovering his wife, Marie (Virginia Mayo), has moved away for a night club job. Striving for a better job, he finds Marie has fallen out of love for him; while Homer returns to his parents (Walter Baldwin and Minna Gombell) and kid sister, Luella (Marlene Aames) with the uncertainty that his girlfriend, Wilma (Cathy O'Connell) will accept him for his disability and not out of pity. Co-starring Hoagy Carmichael (Butch Engle, bar owner and Homer's uncle); Ray Collins, Steve Cochran, Don Beddoe and Charles Halton, among others.\n\nRegardless of Myrna Loy heading the cast, she's not the central character. Playing the perfect wife, her facial expressions for certain scenes, as with Gladys George for a letter reading scene with Roman Bohmen, says volumes without the use of dialogue. As much as the three veterans meet in the beginning of the story, their immediate friendship plays as if they either grew up together or formed a bonding friendship while in boot camp. For a movie that clocks nearly three hours, no doubt there were additional scenes that had to be edited for the sake of holding interest for its extensive length. Though there could have been a sequel to whatever became of the characters after its conclusion, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES still hold up on its own with no sequel necessary. Even with an abridged made-for-television remake retitled RETURNING HOME (1975) updating the story to Vietnam war veterans, this 1946 release has become the one and only for repeated viewings.\n\nAcademy Awards wins have gone to Best Picture; Fredric March (Best Actor); and Harold Russell, an amputee with no acting experience (Best Supporting Actor and Honorary Oscar), Best Director (William Wyler), among others. Sadly, Dana Andrews, who had as many crucial scenes as March or Russell, didn't get a nomination. The success for this leisurely paced drama shows how viewers can relate to some of its characters depicted, along with many memorable moments to intricate to mention.\n\nDistributed on home video and DVD format, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES has enjoyed frequent cable television revivals on Turner Network Television (1990); American Movie Classics (1991-1998) and Turner Classic Movies (since 2003).

Fred returns to his working class parents to find his wife Marie had moved out to work at a nightclub. The three men run into each other in a bar. Peggy falls for the married Fred.\n\nHomer is heart breaking in the very traditional melodramatic way. Al is fascinating in that he has everything and yet he still reconnect. It is well acted with a timely subject matter at the time. It reminds me of the various PTSD movies arising in more modern times. In fact, Fred is suffering from PTSD. I'm sure these characters really hit home for the returning GIs and their families."

It was nominated in eight categories at the Academy Awards and almost swept by winning seven, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Scoring.

This movie can also be remembered as the one that beat out another endearing film, It's A Wonderful Life which was nominated for five awards and won none. A great ensemble cast with Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Theresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Hoagy Carmichael, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell. This movie runs a little long at almost three hours but it's well worth the time. I'm sure I've seen this close to a dozen times on TV and would love to see it on the big screen sometime.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is a heartfelt and deep drama directed by William Wyler, which has deservedly become one of the most significant films in the history of Hollywood. The film tells about the lives of three World War II veterans returning home and trying to re-integrate into society. The film turned out to be so convincing and touching that it won seven Academy Awards at once, including the award for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor (both male awards).\n\nOne of the main advantages of the painting is its ability to convey the complex emotional experiences of the characters sincerely and without embellishment. The focus is on three characters: former bombardier Fred Derry, sailor Homer Parrish and banker Al Stevenson. Each of them faces their own difficulties, whether it's finding a job, physical injury, or trying to rebuild a broken relationship. Director William Wyler and screenwriter Robert Sherwood masterfully create multi-layered and realistic images, making you feel involved in their destinies.\n\nThe acting in the film is on top. Fredrik March, who won the Oscar for Best Actor, brilliantly embodied the image of Al Stevenson, showing his internal conflicts and struggle to return to normal life. Dana Andrews, who plays Fred Derry, also impresses with her sincerity and emotional strength. However, Harold Russell, who played the role of Homer Parrish, deserves special mention. Being a war veteran himself, he perfectly conveyed the difficulties and internal contradictions faced by a person who has lost limbs. Russell became the first and only actor to receive two Oscars for one role - for Best Supporting Actor and a special award for inspiration and contribution to the film.\n\nThe visual range and technical performance are also not ignored. The work of cinematographer Gregg Toland creates an atmosphere of realism and depth, focusing on details and emotional moments. Hugo Friedhofer's musical accompaniment complements the picture, intensifying the dramatic tension and creating an emotional background that helps to feel what is happening more deeply.\n\nOne of the key themes of the film is the difficulty of adapting to peaceful life after the war. This topic seems to be relevant at all times. After all, war is a terrible thing that breaks people not only physically, but also morally, forever changing a person. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" explores with great sensitivity the social and personal problems faced by veterans. The painting also raises important questions about overcoming trauma and integrating into society, showing that the path to recovery can be long and difficult, but possible thanks to the support of family and friends.\n\nThe film earned its seven Oscars not only for excellent directing and acting, but also for a powerful script that touches on universal and eternal themes. The painting became a real mirror of time, reflecting the post-war moods and problems of American society, and remains relevant to this day.\n\nI liked the movie. For me, this is not a masterpiece, but a vivid and significant picture that is relevant today. The scattering of top-level awards confirms that the painting is an important milestone of its time.\n\n\"The Best years of our Lives\" is an emotional and vivid drama that leaves a deep mark on the soul. Despite the fact that the film was released in 1946, its themes and images remain relevant to this day, because people returning from the war have existed for as long as these wars have been going on. This painting deserves to be viewed not only as a historical document, but also as a powerful work of art that reminds us of the value of peace and human resilience.\n\n7 out of 10."

All the players are magnificent in their perspective roles and there was no miscasting in this picture. It beat out It's a Wonderful Life and Frank Kapra for best picture/director of 1946.

The pleasure of seeing your loved one, brother, son or best friend come home.\n\nBut not living a while because like I experienced watching this film it was very early on I said out loud \"it's like they are seeing and talking to ghost\" The trauma of soldiers and trauma it sets on others.\n\nThe love, the pain. The incredible length those Soliders grafted in their many lines of duty, They don't make them like this anymore is a quote for both the quality of the film and by god the quality of man that fought in those wars.\n\nTruly incredible."

I have seen it twice since then and have cried every time. I read one comment where somebody said that the war doesn't end on the battlefield and that is so true. For millions of veterans the haunting memories experienced during any war remains with them until they die. I have my own nightmares and flashbacks but feel sorry for those that are worse than myself. This movie needs to be remade with the same realness of the 1946 movie. Updating it to the Iraq war just might bring to light the problems that veterans face trying to readjust to the \"Real World\" after what they have done and seen. Everybody has to see this movie in order to understand what is being said, and you really need to see it more than once to really understand everything that happened."

        "review_detailed_main": "It definitely belongs in the category of exceptional films. It may seem like a simple film at first glance because of the story as we follow three soldiers returning home, to their city, after World War II and how they fit into the new / old situation, but the film is so layered and deep. It lasts a full three hours, but the film is not at all boring or slow because every scene is important, every shot has its own meaning and tells us something. It only took five minutes for the film to buy me, and after fifteen minutes I was already completely inside the store. The film didn't age at all even though it came out 75 years ago, except perhaps for some obvious things like the paycheck at the time. Although we follow three soldiers who have a lot in common (they return from the war to their home, to the same town), each of them comes from their own special situation and also returns to their unique situation. Each of them is an individual, a unique person and lives in their own, unique situation and family. Their lives have changed irreversibly and we are following this through this film. We can clearly understand everyone's situation because the director did a great job, and the camera is also great because of a few memorable scenes. There is no unimportant shot in this film, I think that achievement is very rare in the world of film. Finally, I would like to mention that this film won a total of 7 Oscars including important for the film, director, lead actor, supporting actor and screenplay. However, there is another interesting thing. Harold Russell received an honorary for supporting role in this film for inspiring all war invalids in America because he was a true war invalid, but he also won that \"ordinary\" Oscar for supporting actor making him the only actor in history to win two Oscars for the same role."

        "review_detailed_main": "I first saw THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES on some AFRTS TV station in Japan years ago on active duty and was amazed. I've seen it several times since and several scenes stick with me: Harold Russell's hooks peering through his pea coat, the humiliation of Dana Andrews' character returning to his old job at the soda fountain after being a decorated bombardier, the frustration felt by the retread sergeant/banker's inability to assist returning vets--- and especially the gut wrenching scenes of Russell's adjustment to his prosthetic arms shown without even a twinge of self-pity. This is absolutely masterful film-making and if Bill Wyler had never directed another film this alone would rank him at the very top of his craft. It stands the test of time as a testimonial to our ability to adjust and accept any burden life throws at us as a country, our spirit is effectively summed up by Andrews' last line in the movie, \"I can learn.\" I understand this was originally made under the independent Liberty Pictures banner (as was Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which still sports the logo) but was absorbed under United Artists due to the financial implosion of the fledgling company. THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES belongs near the top 10 of AFI's all time greats... a timeless classic that deserves to be seen again and again. This is an example of art in American cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "This outstanding 1946 film looks at WWII from a different perspective. It examines the plight of soldiers returning after the war. It follows three servicemen who meet on a flight back to their hometown. The story is well crafted, depicting men from very different backgrounds, each from a different branch of the service and each with a different challenge to face.\n\nFred (Dana Andrews) was a bombardier, a dashing captain in the Air Corp. He is coming home to a beautiful wife (Virginia Mayo) and no job prospects. His wife loves to party but his job as a soda jerk can't keep pace with her penchant for spending. Al (Frederic March), a former banker, was a sergeant in the infantry with a wife of 20 years (Myrna Loy) and two grown children. He comes home to a distant wife and a troubled marriage. He is a banker with a heart, which evokes derisive scrutiny from his boss and the other bankers. Homer (Harold Russell) was a sailor who lost his hands in a fire onboard ship. He is returning to his parents and his long time girlfriend Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) feeling certain that she will never be able to love him with his disability.\n\nWilliam Wyler (Wuthering Heights, Roman Holiday, Ben-Hur) is one of the most renowned directors in filmmaking history, having won four Oscars in twelve nominations. His direction here is superb. This is a compelling character study with nuance, sensitivity and insight. The scenes of the uneasy moments of reunion were stirring, especially in the case of Homer, who was tormented and insecure about how he would be accepted without his hands. Wyler takes us right into the most intimate thoughts and feelings of these families as they attempt to deal with challenges for which they are not totally prepared. The scene where Wilma sees Homer without his prosthetics for the first time is one of the most touching and poignant ever filmed.\n\nThis is a candid look at the issues of the day. The film addresses the burgeoning Communist threat and the sense of betrayal at the actions of our former Soviet allies after the war. It refers frequently to the nuclear threat and the fear of mass destruction. Most importantly, it shows how difficult it was for servicemen to adapt to a world that had become accustomed to getting along without them.\n\nThe acting was outstanding across the board. Frederic March was excellent as the banker trying to hold together a troubled marriage. He gave a towering performance and won an Oscar for best actor. Andrews, who wasn't nominated (and should have been), also gave a fabulous performance as the glamorous flyboy who comes home to discover he has no skills and can't get a job. Harold Russell won a best supporting Oscar for his portrayal of the sailor trying to regain his self-respect after the loss of his hands. Russell actually lost his hands in the service in an explosives accident during a training excercise. He is amazingly dexterous using his prosthetics. His portrayal of Homer had such affability, depth and sensitivity that it is difficult to believe this was his acting debut.\n\nThis film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture, Best Actor for March, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Russell. It is ranked number 37 on AFI's top 100 of the century. I rated it a 10/10. For anyone who enjoys a powerful and emotional character study, this classic is a must-see."

The perfect example is the scene where Milly is clearing the dinner table when the doorbell rings. Suddenly she knows it's her husband, Al. The tenderness of the scene will reduce you to tears.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Motion Picture Academy honored the World War II era with Best Picture honors for films that explored unique perspectives of the war each year from 1942 through 1946 (with the exception of 1945). In 1942, it was \"Mrs. Miniver\", about a family surviving on the home front. In 1943, \"Casablanca\" dealt with the seedy underbelly of the black market, and how it was used to transport people persecuted by Nazi Germany to the United States. In 1944's \"Going My Way\", it was more indirect; a young man seemingly goes half-cocked, marries a singer, then leaves for duty. And finally, we have \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", a tribute to veterans and what became of their lives once their tours of duty were finished.\n\nDana Andrews stars as Fred Derry, a captain in the U.S. Army Air Corps who is returning to his hometown of Boone City. On his way, he meets a sailor named Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) and an infantry sergeant named Al Stephenson (Fredric March). Each man has a different perspective of their home town, as well as unique experiences from the war, even though all three served in the Pacific Theatre. And all three men bear their own scars of the war.\n\nThough, like most films from Hollywood's so-called \"golden age\", this movie does have a \"Hollywood ending\", it isn't contrived here. The script by Robert Sherwood works well, and the performances by all the cast not only express the torment of men trying to fit back into their old lives, but also of their families and how they coped (or didn't cope) with them.\n\nThis movie is among William Wyler's best, and it would be the second of three Best Picture winners that he helmed in his career (\"Mrs. Miniver\" and \"Ben-Hur\" were the other two). It stands as a testament of among the best films Hollywood has to offer. As I have said already, the entire cast worked well together in this movie, one of the best examples of ensemble casting I have ever seen. But I give a special salute to Harold Russell, who plays the disabled sailor who just wants to be alone. Russell never considered himself a professional actor, and he had very few dramatic roles (mostly after 1980), yet the Academy deservedly bestowed him with not one, but two Oscar statuettes for his portrayal of Homer Parrish. I will not mince words here: Russell's performance is quite moving.\n\n\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is a film of rare breed. I say this because not many films explored the lives of military personnel after their experiences in war. There have been a few more recent examples, like \"Coming Home\" and, in a lesser sense, \"Courage Under Fire\", but this was among the first. It is a moving example of film-making at its best."

He finds himself in love with the family man's daughter.\n\nThese three men must come to terms with the life their living in now. Or the war will become \"The Best Years of Our Lives.\"\n\nHarold Russell plays the man who's lost his arms. He performs this role perfectly. He makes all of us feel sorry for him and frustrated at the same time. Fredric March plays the family man who brings the movie up so we have some happiness in this time. He does this very well, and has great chemistry with Myrna Loy, who plays his wife. And Dana Andrews plays the man who's falling in love with Teresa Wright. Both of them do a great job with showing their love on screen.\n\nThe film won seven oscars including Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Screenplay, Editing, and Score.

        "review_title": "Captivating...",
        "review_detailed_main": "The best years of our lives represents the culmination of many years of efforts by Sam Goldwyn to produce an Oscar winning film, and it succeeds oh so spectacularly. The Best Years Of Our lives represents a symphony of successes in each aspect of film, whether acting , cinematography, or writing, to cohere and create an outstanding masterpiece which will remain timeless.\n\nThe movie runs for three hours but if feels nothing like that- it moves along at a steady pace, offering heartwarming entertainment at every turn, never once failing to completely captivate the audience. The first hour breezes by where the three servicemen meet and get merry in a bar. A spark develops between Peggy and Fred, but alas he has to go home to his wife. In the second and third hour of the film things get more serious but still remains very entertaining. We watch the servicemen struggle with adjusting to civilian life. Fred is trapped with a wife who belittles him for not being able to find a good job. He also struggles with his affections for Peggy. Homer has trouble with other peoples perceptions to his disability. Even Al, the comparatively luckier one, struggles with adapting to his children who has grown without him, and his old job which he does not remember too well.\n\nThe Best Years of our lives is able to hold an audiences attention for three hours because of its superlative writing. The screenplay, in typical Wyler fashion, is littered with enjoyable witticisms, especially between Fred and Peggy. The writing for the first one hour or so, the breeziest part of the film, is also suitably endearing. The screenplay however, ultimately distinguishes itself for its sincerity, warmth, and thoughtfulness. The struggles of the three servicemen are honestly portrayed, while not sacrificing entertainment value. The film never dwells too long on its issues, always returning to the camaraderie and kinship between the three servicemen. A memorable scene has Fred punching out a customer after he gets into a scuffle with Homer. Wyler understands that it is scenes which demonstrate warmth that helps keeps audiences engaged, rather than overly dramatic and serious meditations on trauma and problems. However, this is where my complaint comes in. At least some of the screenplay may seem overly melodramatic, with professions of I will always love you that seem banal though I am glad to say this is the norm rather than the exception.\n\nThe ensemble cast is also exquisite in this film. Frederic March is especially convincing as a very likeable, witty man in a loving relationship. Harold Russel also has great dramatic scenes where he bursts into lamentations of his disability and how others see him. But I think Dana Andrews' performance is best as the very interestingly written Captain Fred. The Air Force had lead him to believe he was an officer and a gentlemen, but he found out in civilian life that he really has no relevant skills. He is also in love with someone who is not his wife. Fred is an interesting character written with incredible depth, and portrayed beautifully by Andrews. Andrews plays his character with the charm of someone like Cary Grant, only infused with a certain helplessness. Teresa Wright is also excellent as his lover- a young woman who may at times be idealistic, but is ultimately kind, understanding, and mature.\n\nThe cinematography also deserves praise. It was shot in deep focus to preserve clarity of the far background of most frames. This innovative technique is effective in grabbing the audiences attention- rather than having to focus on one object, we now have lots of detail in the background to examine, holding our interest further. Consider the interesting final scene, where, through deep focus, the camera captures the three couples. The bride and groom are in the foreground, and so is Fred, looking longingly at Peggy in the background, who is across the room with her parents. This is bravura filmmaking from Wyler and his cinematographer- the idealism of young love in the foreground, the strong bonds of old love in the background, and distance separating the two parties in a forbidden love.\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives is an uncommon film for many reasons. It's a 3 hour film which feels like something two third it's length. It's an immensely engaging and engrossing watch. But most of all, the film is tender, intimate, honest, and warm. The Best Years of Our Lives succeeds because it is not made to appeal to some faraway, cold film critic, but to the tender heart present in every movie watcher. It connects and moves audiences with its intimate, tender humanism. Watching the film, I couldn't help rooting for every single one of the characters, even though I write this review 8 decades after they existed. Masterpiece!"

My expectations were decidedly modest, without any big name stars except Myrna Loy (and William Wyler directing, of course). Noting the year of release (1946), and the subject matter, (veterans returning from WWII), I was half-expecting a dated classic, which would stand up as a piece of historical interest, but not really place high on the enjoyable scale. I'm pleased to say that I was way off base. This turned out to be a film chock-full of outstanding performances, wrapped around a script which took its time unfolding. It followed three veterans returning from the war with relative degrees of success. Each had his own set of problems to deal with while readjusting, and each dealt with success and failure in their own ways. I found myself actively rooting for each character to come through, even though I typically am hesitant to embrace Hollywood style happy endings. Scores a 9 / 10. See it with less trepidation and more enthusiasm than I did."

        "review_detailed_main": "The main triumph of this film which makes it quite exceptional and unique of its kind is the performance of Harold Russell as Homer Parrish, who has lost both his hands in the war, which invalidity he shares with Harold Russell. It's a story and film about war veterans and without doubt the best of its kind for its humanity and extremely sustained restraint all the way in the exposure of very sensitive and personal affairs and feelings of the most delicate kind. All the actors are outstanding in their characterizations, Fredric March as the sergeant and former banker who can't quite control himself or his bottle, Harold Russell in the performance of his life, (the pajama scene must melt all hearts,) the only time ever an actor received two Oscars for the same part and well deserved, Dana Andrews as the noble war hero who is humiliated by his wife (Virginia Mayo perfectly abominable) but has the very good luck of finding the irresistible Teresa Wright instead and at her most charming, who is so much the better, and Myrna Loy finally as the sage and stable mother. The music is perfectly fit to illustrate the moods and the tensions, with Hoagy Carmichael crowning it, while the mastership of the direction of William Wyler in his slow and careful but very well thought out and intentional direction to bring out all the best and the truth of the story from his actors probably takes the prize. The film has a number of unforgettable scenes of singular eloquence, but I think my favorite would be Dana Andrews' revisit of his old pilot job in the junkyard, one of William Wyler's most impressive scenes, and there is an important forewarning of it in the beginning. This is a veteran film for all times which is inexhaustible in its humanity and which all people of all generations have something to learn from to improve themselves with. Finally I have never seen so many reviews for a film here, but a film like this just can't have a review too many."

Best Years dealt with several of the most important issues of its day in an accurate, realistic and uplifting manner. When you add everything all together, the story,the acting, the timing, and this movies impact when it came out it is hard to come up with a better movie in all regards.\n\nHow good was Best Years of Our Lives? Look at some of its competition for the Oscar in 1946. Two other great movies from that year are 'It's A Wonderful Life' and 'The Razors Edge'. 'The Yearling' was yet another top notch nominated film of that year. For all the competition, the fact that Best Years won the Oscar was not a surprise. Another fine film not nominated for best picture that year was \"Notorious\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the period immediately after the close of the Second World War, motion pictures that dealt directly with combat situations did not tend to do very well, especially with the veterans themselves. The subject matter was still too painful to face up to, not to mention the fact that any inaccuracies or falseness in tone would be grossly disrespectful. Even when dealing with post-war issues there was still a lot that could be got wrong in terms of credibility, respectfulness and relevance. With the Best Years of Our Lives they just went and got everything right.\n\nSo how do you do go about casting three homecoming war vets at a time when virtually all your audience either was a recently returned vet or was related to one? Do you bring in dedicated professionals who pour everything into a role to totally become their characters? Or do you get familiar character players whom audiences will know and trust, and perhaps see a bit of themselves in? What we actually have is Fredric March, a well-meaning ham who hit his peak in the early years of the talkies, Dana Andrews, a leading man from a handful of genre-movies, but not what you'd call an impressive dramatic actor, and Harold Russell, a genuine disabled veteran with no previous acting experience. But all three turn in perfect performances, from Russell's wordless agonising and pent-up frustration to March's believable and endearing drunk act, and too many other highlights to mention.\n\nWhy do these three very different performers all work equally well in this picture? Well, firstly they are all intelligent men, able to draw upon their experiences as well as to realise the seriousness of the subject matter. Secondly, these guys have been filmed in such as way as to show off their performances to the best and to make them fit into the story. This is the sort of thing director William Wyler was very good at, and I'm going to ramble on about it at length because it is fascinating but goes unnoticed by most viewers.\n\nNow, film convention says that if two characters are talking to one another, you either have the camera to one side, showing them both in profile, or you cut back and forth between them in opposing camera angles. In the opening scene there are a couple of shots where one of the protagonists is talking to someone behind a desk, but Wyler doesn't use either of the angles just mentioned. He just keeps the camera behind the desk, so regardless of which is talking we only see the face of the main character. This way we get to witness both the speech and the reaction of the protagonist, and we aren't distracted by having the face of someone who is little more than an extra brought to our attention. A more elaborate version of this comes when we briefly meet the character Woody Merrill (Victor Cutler), Theresa Wright's replacement date when she is trying to get Dana Andrews out of her head. While it would be difficult and look a bit odd to only show us the back of his head, Wyler is careful to make sure he is never too close to the camera, and that we always see him in profile, never square on. This stops us paying too much attention to him or seeing his emotions. It gives us no chance to sympathise or identify with him, and allows us to believe in the romance between Andrews and Wright.\n\nSo this is how Wyler stops us getting distracted by the less important players \u2013 but how does he focus us on the more important ones? Again by breaking with cinematic convention. For example, moments such as kisses and embraces are \"supposed\" to be shown in extreme close-up, but Wyler often shows these in long shot. This is because he knows sometimes it is more powerful to show peoples' body language than their facial expressions. Of course, Wyler does use close-ups, as well cutting between opposing angles when two characters are talking, but he uses these sparingly and only when absolutely needed. Whenever he is not using one of these techniques, he generally keeps the camera in one position without cuts, allowing the action to play out naturally. Thus when he does move in to one of these more dramatic angles, it has greater impact, and you really take notice and feel that something is going on.\n\nAnd that is more or less all there is to it. For a picture that is nigh on three hours long, there aren't very many characters and the action only really takes place over a few weeks. And yet it is never boring. In a way it's a bit like another wonderful feature from the same year, It's a Wonderful Life, in that it paints a picture of a world that is so believable and recognizable, and yet seems strangely idyllic, and more like we wish our world could be. I for one wish my world included a bar where I could chat about my problems to Hoagy Carmichael while he played piano. You see, it's a picture that spoke directly to audiences of its time, and can still speak directly to audiences of today."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946) is a one amazing single motion picture. I just saw it for the first time now at the end of 2016, 70 years from its original release and i can safely say - this is an absolutely must see movie for everyone.\n\nI loved everything in this picture. Writing, of course, comes in the first place. It is a superb one, highly involving, sometimes painfully true and always plausible. Magnificent acting by 4 central actors. Yes, i do believe that there are 4 magnificent performances, first of all of 3 lead men - Fredric March (Al), Dana Andrews (Fred), Harold Russell (Homer) and a terrific performance by Teresa Wright as Peggy who i think was under rated for this performance - i can't remember when i have saw more natural, charming and all the way great performance by a lady from a movies before 1946 - i won't believe that anybody didn't had a bit crush on this charming young lady. And of course directing was amazing, as well as the story itself which is sometimes hard to watch, sometimes hard to not laugh and always amazingly told and inspiring.\n\nOverall, all in all \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is great, great movie. At running time almost 3 hours i was captivated from start till the very last frame. The movie ended perfectly, i can not recommend this movie any higher to anyone who hasn't witness it yet - do your self a favor and watch it - this is a unforgettable motion picture. Great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals, and unconditional surrender from the enemies which required tons and tons of radiation, this was the summon substance of the United States victory in World War II!! The celebration on Times Square as well as everywhere else in the United States suggests a national zenith!!! America is on top right!! one thing, one agonizing and painstakingly perverse thing..The period of adjustment!!..The actual celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished..Now everyone needs to get on with their lives...only one problem though...they have to get new lives...the old lives are gone forever...Polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water!! Everyone of the characters in the movie is paraded by primal doubts, and unable to masquerade a pretense about how nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true!!! Once sergeants, and generals, and their wives, and daughters, and sons and virtually all other Americans touched by World War II, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and recriminations of World War II and what it really accomplished as well as negated, nobody was the same!! For now, social and moral issues had a self serving interest...Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start over!! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married to Virginia Mayo in the first place!!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish!! Las but not least, the character, Homer, is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope!!\n\nThe reason this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending was attained the hard way, once everybody recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world overall, tragedy from WWII was recognized, and things that were emotionally torn asunder were taken in stride, and dealt with accordingly!! Frederick March and Myrna Loy need to go back to chapter one in their marriage, Homer has apprised his new bride as to what it takes to be married to him (i.e. half the times, she will feel like a nurse) and Thresa Wright's involvement with Dana Andrews means that her entrance into adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriage...This is tantamount to learning how to drive a car to get your driver's license at the Indianapolis 500...The characters in the movie are the typical post WWII Americans in that they are stalemated by the rude awakening of coercive changes to their lives...Happiness no longer is afforded the luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetic...it is now about formidable conditions, and good winning out over evil by way of the less ugly choice!!...World War II did not just happen!! It will henceforth dominate the social patterns of American living!!!\n\nThe aggregate catastrophe of World War II has mirrored most Americans' feelings of personal human inadequacy as well!!I loved this film and so did AFI, probably for the reason that it brought out issues that were at one time unjustifiably taboo!!..Bottom line, see this movie!! Nightmares about combat, dilemmas about marital unhappiness and/or readjustment, coping with your life when stricken-ed by a disability and just basically acting human are portrayed constantly in movies and television today, HOWEVER!! this is 1946!! Very new to Americans then....REMEMBER THAT!! Director William Wyler has illustrated how Americans feel about the aftermath of WWII in the days when the movie industry has left him with one hand tied behind his back!!! Take that into account and you will probably realize just how sensational this movie really was!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The \"Best Years of Our Lives\" is without doubt the finest film ever made. The acting of all the cast members is just incredible. I cannot imagine a remake of the film being made these days(or probably anytime else for that matter)simply because the talent does not exist to remotely approach the brilliance of the original. I have viewed countless films which are excellent, both domestic and international, but none had the absolutely sheer emotional impact as this film held for me. I found Harold Russell's role as Homer especially stunning. A man who has lost both hands in the war, yet exhibits the exhuberance for life few of us could ever hope to emulate under similar circumstances was unbelievable. Yet even as Homer struggles through with his disability with a cheerful demeanor, his profound insecurity regarding his relationship with his girlfiend Wilma and the scene where he relates to her how difficult a simple task such as butttoning his pajama top and her lovingly, tender response that leaves him, as well as the viewer in tears . An absolutely, incredible film which you will never forget."

        "review_detailed_main": "A unique and compelling drama. Unique in that it deals with soldiers returning home from World War 2, and their struggles as they try to fit back into civilian life. Some are physically scarred, and some mentally. Little was known about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder at the time, so the fact that this topic is dealt with so sensitively is quite incredible for the time.\n\nThis, plus the adjustments they have to make and the fact that their world has changed while they have been away make make for interesting viewing.\n\nCompelling too in that it as much a human / relationship drama as an effects-of-war drama. Very emotional, as the servicemen piece their lives back together and try to reestablish / establish relationships, get jobs, etc.\n\nSuperb directing and camera work by William Wyler. Also a great deal of sensitivity in telling the story. Wyler was involved in the Allied war effort through making documentaries, like the original documentary on the Memphis Belle, so was well aware of what went in to winning the war.\n\nPerformances are astounding. Dana Andrews is suitably debonair as Fred Derry. Fredric March is a surprise package. His character seems to that of a dull banker but as the movie goes on and on his character becomes funnier and funnier, climaxing in the hilarious dinner speech. March seemed to revel in this side of the role and is great in it.\n\nStandout performance, however, goes to Harold Russell as Homer Parish. Russell was not an actor, and was a genuine amputee, playing the role of an amputee. Incredible performance from him, for which he received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, which showed just how much some soldiers sacrificed in the war, and how they carried on without bitterness.\n\nSuperb female cast too. Teresa Wright is beautiful and wonderful as Peggy. Virginia Mayo is stunningly beautiful as Marie. Myrna Loy provides the gravitas as Milly Stephenson.\n\nA wonderful, emotional, sometimes funny, always compelling movie."

A lot more. Too bad they never made a sequel, but then again, why? The film itself is simply P-E-R-F-E-C-T! The cast is wonderful, the music score is stirring and the pictures and screenplay are flawless. I'm sure that most of the other 130 plus reviews say just about the same thing, but I just couldn't help writing a review of my own. The movie is THAT inspiring. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is probably the finest example of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. Taken individually, any single scene on it's own would be dreadfully boring. Taken together, they're more than magnificent. From the moment you're introduced to a character, you bond with and care about them. You gain this incredible feeling for their welfare, as if they were actually living, breathing people. I hope that there will always be room for film's like \"The Best Years of Our Lives\". As I said, once it's over you wish there was more to come. It leaves you with a tremendously warm feeling inside. If you've never seen it and are actually reading this to help make up your mind, GO SEE IT NOW! It will be The Best Three Hours of Your Life ever spent watching a movie."

It is as relevant today as it was in 1946; our veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan face the same problems as Dana Andrews, Fredrick March, and Harold Russell did after WWII. The plot is wonderful, the pace of the film - although almost three hours long - is great, and the acting is brilliant. Fredrick March and Harold Russell both won Oscars for the film, but Dana Andrews is really the star and gives his usual understated performance, as opposed to March, who almost always overacts.\n\nAnd my two favorite scenes are the ones already mentioned: Fred Derring (Dana Andrews)' father reviewing his son's war record, which almost drives him to tears, and the climatic scene where Andrews is in the cockpit of the airplane which is being junked to build pre-fab homes as he relives his experiences during the war.\n\nTruly a masterpiece on every level!"

Who would ever guess that the title emanates from the likes of the character of Virginia Mayo, scolding her husband (a marvelous Dana Andrews.) She had the nerve to tell him that she wasted the best years of her life while waiting for his return. Actually, she didn't wait, she had Steve Cochran,in a very brief part, to wait the war out.\n\nWho can forget that scene when Frederic March returns home and is greeted by his family. Myrna Loy didn't have to say anything. The way she stood there was forever memorable.\n\nWhat did Dana Andrews have to do to win an Oscar? He was so good here as a returning GI but was denied a nomination. March was adequate and was rewarded with a best actor Oscar. I don't know why in a year, when Jimmy Stewart was up for It's A Wonderful Life, did March deserve the accolade.\n\nThe movie was timely as the war had just ended. Other poignant scenes dealt with Harold Russell, who had lost his limbs during the war, dealing with his handicap.\n\nUnlike her undeserved Oscar for Mrs. Miniver, Teresa Wright, who died this year, was effective as March's daughter."

It seems to be in the top 100 of most lists I see. There's still such an attraction of seeing how returning veterans can get back to their normal lives, if possible. Other movies have tried, but none succeed like this one. The 2 hrs and 50 min really give them the chance to develop the characters. I probably found Fredric March's acting to be the most realistic, but that could be spread around especially since Homer wasn't a real actor. You had to feel for Dana Andrews who wanted something better out of life than his old job and just couldn't get it, while being berated by his wife as a loser."

But these other films were heavy-handed, steeped highly in melodrama, and they seem laughable today, despite their good intentions. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is different. It's a highly sensitive and understated look at what happened to men when they returned from WWII and tried to acclimate themselves back into the world they left. And remember that this came out not ten years after the end of the war, when historical perspective could safely remove the sting. This came out one year after the war's end! How often does a film, especially from back then, directly address a social concern while it's actually happening.\n\nThis movie follows three men and their stories. We see Fredric March return to the bank at which he formerly held an executive position, forced to take a menial, secretarial job well below his skills. The pettiness of the civilian world is brought home to him when he gets into an argument with a supervisor over office supplies. We see Dana Andrews return to a wife that he doesn't know anymore, and who doesn't know him. Other war stories show men and their loves pining for one another while they're separated, faithfully awaiting the time when they can be together again. They don't mention that perhaps the strain on the relationship can cause people to fall out of love. And in the film's most uncomfortable storyline, we see a man who has lost both arms trying to deal with being handicapped in a society in which people with handicaps are viewed as second-class citizens. Much has been made of the fact that Harold Russell (who won both a special Oscar and the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role) was not a professional actor, and was handicapped in real life. It's really amazing to think how brave this movie was in speaking frankly about one topic after another that until that time had remained unspeakable.\n\nThis movie definitely deserves a second look from me, and a first look from anyone who hasn't seen yet seen it at all.\n\nGrade: A+"

Sure it's still a \"Hollywood\" version of reality, but far more than most films (even today) this one is willing to deal sort of honestly with post-war conditions. Things aren't hunky-dory just because the war is over, heroes aren't perfect and don't become so. Adults clearly want to have sex and do. And even the bad guys (or girls) aren't completely demonized.\n\nIt's pictures like this one that remind me why I'm going back to look at the great films of the past.

        "review_detailed_main": "Everything about this film was first-rate; from the acting to the production values. Myrna Loy and Dana Andrews are exceptional. Harold Russell is outstanding as Homer, while Frederic March and the rest of the cast are top-notch. I particularly like the store sequence and what follows.\n\nWar affects different men in different ways. This film shows that in spades. Most have their lives interrupted; some become permanently damaged physically by war, while others become damaged psychologically. However, the majority get through the war and just go on with their lives, as my grandfather did in WW1, my father in WW 2 and as I did after Vietnam. There are very few other options; you must just go on with life. The film captures this problem, as well as several other issues. Don't miss it."

        "review_detailed_main": "From William Wyler comes a true American classic motion picture. The tale of three G.I.'s returning to their hometown after serving in WWII. Each must adapt to their new lives which have been forever altered by their war time experience. The film is now over fifty years old but its story and message is just as new as when this film came out. Two of the three G.I.'s future seems somewhat secure. Frederic March as Al Stephenson an Army Sergeant returns to his family although a little changed due to the natural process of maturing regarding his children. He returns to his job in a bank and even though he is hitting the booze a little the viewer gets the feeling that he will settle down in time and because of his war experience will be a better man for it. Harold Russell himself a wounded veteran portrays Homer Parrish a Navy veteran who lost both hands during a sea battle. He will be provided for financially by a disability pension and even though his life will never be what it was before losing both hands the viewer also gets the feeling that he will make out in time. Then there is the Dana Andrews character Army Air Force Captain Fred Derry the only officer of the three. He was nothing more than an attendant at the local drug store soda fountain before his country called. He now returns to his hometown an Officer and a Gentleman and decorated war hero. Sadly that's about all he has going for him. This was the one character as I watched this film and thought `Now this guy would have been better off to have stayed in the service' Of course he probably for the purpose of the story had been forced out due to man power cutting.\n\nI found his plight the most interesting. He looks full of confidence and intelligence in his dress uniform but when he steps out of it and dons civilian attire he resembles nothing more than a down on his luck schmuck. Perhaps no other actor during the time this film was made could have pulled that off except Dana Andrews. He gives every indication that he will be come one of many WWII veterans who returned to their hometowns and found life boring and mundane compared to the 100% life living experience of being in the military during time of war. Eventually many would wind up hanging out at the local American Legion or VFW posts knocking back the booze and reliving perhaps for many literally the best years of their lives.\n\nThe triple story line is handled very well with their paths crossing during the course of the film. Romance, marital woes even a brief questioning of America's involvement in WWII are also included in the picture. A story such as this would never have been told on the silver screen before or even during the war but it showed that films were changing in both content and depiction."

It is surprisingly modern for its time in the way it depicts the moral and emotional hangover that always follows war, while at the same time being very compassionate toward its main characters and really celebrating what's most beautiful and idealistic about Americans. If you can get past some rather corny acting by the younger females (Myrna Loy is, as always, outstanding as the older guy's wife), and if you'll have some patience with its sort of low-key approach to post-traumatic stress disorder, you'll find a real and thoughtful movie treasure that stays with you a long time after the movie's over."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the biggest all round Hollywood hits of the pre-1950's era, William Wyler's multi-Oscar winning critical darling and box office sensation The Best Years of Our Lives is one of those rare black and white vintage dramas that has managed to stand up to the test and scrutiny of time to remain an effective and compassionate examination of the after effects that war has on those that partake in it as they try and adjust back to a normal life.\n\nDealing with issues of both the physical and mental effects serviceman and those close to them suffered in the aftermath of World War 2, Wyler was inspired to make his epic drama after reading about and hearing about what was happening to soldiers across the world outside of the battlefields and striking while the iron was hot Wyler managed to get his grand opus out into the public while the embers of the war still burned around the globe.\n\nUtilising a talented if not exactly name brand cast, a cast that included the Oscar winning turns of Fredric March as returned family man Al Stephenson and real life war veteran Harold Russell as the permanently maimed Homer Parish, Wyler explores a multi-pronged narrative in Best as the lives of three returning American serviceman to their fictional Mid-western American town of Boone City come together with all men facing various difficulties in their return to their families, their loved ones, work and everyday society.\n\nDealing with themes and issues that are still prevalent throughout modern day society, Best has that rare timeless feel too much of proceedings and while there are some romantic sub-plots and story arcs that veer towards melodrama at times (a regular occurrence for films of this time and place), there's not many moments that don't hit home here emotionally with Wyler, his cast and behind the scenes crew all working together to ensure that Best is an all round package that provides entertainment, food for thought and artistry that is rarely seen combining in such a notable fashion.\n\nGoing on to direct such classics as Ben-Hur, Roman Holiday and The Big Country, it's arguable that Best could be considered Wyler's crowning achievement, a rare type of war drama that steers clear of the front line but brings home the horrors of the war all the same, Best is one of the most fully formed examples of classic Hollywood film-making that has lost little power over the years that have followed in its wake.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nA touching, engaging and most importantly human war drama, The Best Years of Our Lives is a genuine Hollywood masterpiece that powerfully examines the effects of war that linger long after the laying down of arms.\n\n5 aeroplane graveyards out of 5\n\nJordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Born of William Wyler's desire to help tell the stories of the men he served with when he filmed from a bombardier during WWII, The Best Years of Our Lives is a tender, heartfelt, and honestly quite beautiful look at combat servicemen readjusting to civilian life. Telling the story of three men coming back to their small midwestern city, one of whom is played by a non-professional actor, William Wyler showed his extreme cinematic acumen in every frame, using his command of framing to effectively tell the emotional tales. This is one of the best movies that the Academy decided to award Best Picture.\n\nFred Derry (Dana Andrews), Al Stephenson (Fredric March), and Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) fly home from the war in the same military aircraft. They'd never met before that flight, and they bond over their shared combat experiences and hometown. The most obvious wound they've come back with is Homer's hands that were lost while serving on a naval vessel and have been replaced by hooks, which he has become very adept at using and also obviously very self-conscious about. They return home to their families. Fred has his club singing wife Marie (Virginia Mayo) whom he can't find the first night. Al has his wife Milly (Myrna Loy) and children, most notably Peggy (Teresa Wright). Homer has his parents and the girl next door, his girl Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).\n\nThe film is the story of how the three men learn to readjust to the lives they knew. For Fred, that's a hard adjustment in several ways. He was a soda jerk before the war where he became a captain and bombed cities. His wife married him because of his uniform, and there's early and obvious tension between them as he wants to adjust, isn't entirely opposed to a more modest lifestyle, but she very much is. She had lived well on his salary while he was flying combat missions, and the idea of having to eat in instead of out angers her. Things get complicated on the first night when Fred meets Peggy, the bright, innocent, and pretty daughter of the man he just met, and through the drunken fog there emerges a connection, especially when Fred spends the night, has a nightmare intimately tied to his combat experiences, and Peggy calms him down.\n\nI must say that I'm really surprised that this film passed the Hays Board. There's blatant drunkenness, especially with Al who is probably just a straight up alcoholic (an interesting contrast to The Lost Weekend from the year before), and there's a lot of heavily implied infidelity. I mean, there's the dialogue between Rhett and Scarlett in Gone with the Wind that's kind of unmistakably sexual in nature, but masked, and then there's the heavy implications that Fred and Al cheated on their wives in the war (Marie directly accuses Fred of it at one point) while Marie cheated on Fred while he was away.\n\nAl's issues stem from his going back to the bank he had worked at before the war. He's given the small loans department, in particular around the GI Bill's efforts to get loans to veterans. He has to balance his fiduciary duty with his desire to help build up the men whom he served with, even if they hold no collateral. This comes in the form of a conflict with his boss when he approves a six-thousand dollar loan to a former serviceman who wishes to start a farm but has no security to balance out the risk. But, Al saw in the man the kind he could rely on, and that was good enough for him even if it wasn't good enough for his boss and Al had to fight for it.\n\nThe surprising emotional core of the film is Homer. Pushed to the side for long stretches as the drama around Fred, Peggy, and Al (once he finds out about the affection between the two younger people), Wyler perfectly uses the non-professional actor, Harold Russell. Homer isn't called to many large moments, though the scene where he pushes his hooks through some windows at a few gawking kids counts (though that's accomplished more with the violence of the action rather than his performance). However, the performance he delivers is a quiet, wounded one. In the face of love from his family and girl, he can only recoil. The only people he's comfortable around are his fellow servicemen and his uncle, Butch (Hoagy Carmichael) who teaches him a routine on the piano of his bar. He has the best scene in the film when he finally breaks down and reveals his truly vulnerable physical state to Wilma, showing how he can remove his hooks but can't get them back on. Wilma still accepting him afterwards is one of the most affecting things in the film, and Russell plays the moment small. It's not a grand moment of ACTING. It's a small moment of emotional truth, and that was surely done at the behest of Wyler, knowing exactly how to use him.\n\nThe largest plot thread is the nascent romance between Fred and Peggy, and it's where the most interpersonal drama is. Another mark in William Wyler's favor is how he managed a good performance out of noted plank of wood Dana Andrews. It's not the best performance in the film or anything, but it's solidly good as he navigates his unloving wife, his burgeoning love for another young woman, while also trying to figure out how he's going to manage to make a living in the world he's returned to. There's an obvious degradation when he has to return to his old job as a soda jerk, his former assistant now his boss, a guy who never went to war himself. The rupture between Fred and Marie is harshly blunt as the opposition between what Fred can deliver and what Marie wants comes into stark contrast and cannot be denied.\n\nAt 170-minutes, the film is a long one, but it never feels it, which is kind of amazing when you consider the type of film it is. It's a character-based drama without much of a plot. So, it's not a series of fast paced events, quick cut to give it energy. Wyler films in a lot of long takes, and we intercut between three stories of men going through similar journeys. And this is a fantastic example of how Wyler uses his preternatural ability to fill a frame expertly and effectively. The standout example is the scene in Butch's where Al tells Fred to stay away from Peggy. Fred disappears into the background to use the phone near the entrance while Homer plays on the piano with Butch and Al listens, but Fred is always in the corner of the frame using deep focus. There are many more examples of Wyler's ability to fill a frame, keeping characters precisely but naturally positioned so that they stay in focus and in shot while allowing different dynamics to play out. Crowd shots, in particular, are really well handled with it never difficult to identify the key characters within the crowds, done with subtle lighting and positioning that slightly highlights the characters we should be focusing on while tending towards turning all other characters' faces away from the camera as the key characters' faces tend to be faced towards the camera. That requires real precision, and it's a great example of how Wyler was able to make such sophisticated visual experiences.\n\nThe quiet emotions of men rediscovering really their humanity after a time of war, returning to a place that hadn't seen the ravages of conflict and the people who might not be able to understand but want to help despite that gap, is what really makes The Best Years of Our Lives fly. Finding consistently strong performances from veteran actors like Fredric March and Myrna Loy to less experienced ones like Teresa Wright and, in particular, Harold Russell, William Wyler expertly crafted a restrained but emotionally rewarding tale of adjustment and assimilation back into the civilian world. It's not easy, and not everyone can do it well, but these are still men, wounded men, who must find a way.\n\nIt really is a great film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was one of the first films to explore what happened to those soldiers after the war, mainly because it was made the year after WWII was over. Plus it is one of the best of those films. Here we first meet three soldiers returning home, to the same hometown actually, and there their mutual history begins and ends. But even that trip back forms a kind of camaraderie where they want to keep in touch. There is banker Al Stephenson (Fredric March), a middle aged officer, sailor Homer Parrish (Harold Russell, a real amputee) who was the all American boy who excelled at sports and is engaged to the girl next door but now is missing both hands, and Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, a pilot who was just working in a drugstore before the war made him a temporary hero. This role for sure allowed Andrews to turn his stoic tight lipped image on its ear to a degree, as he was allowed to show the emotional wounds that can lie beneath the surface of a \"war hero\" returning home.\n\nTheir stories all intertwine, especially the story of Fred and Al. The thing that they have in common? Al's daughter, Peggy (Theresa Wright), who falls for Fred. The problem is Fred is married. A bigger problem is Fred was married during the war when he was a pilot with all of the glamour that comes with it to Marie (Virginia Mayo), who doesn't really know Fred at all, and for sure doesn't know him as the pre-war soda jerk who doesn't make enough post-War for her to enjoy the nightlife that she loves so much. As Marie holds Fred more and more in open contempt, Fred finds him turning more to Peggy.\n\nMeanwhile, Homer is trying to face facts. He cannot survive without the help of others. He cannot even get dressed and undressed without somebody's help. How can he marry the girl next door or anybody else without being a terrible burden? It doesn't help that the girl next door doesn't care about any of this, but Homer thinks she'll care later.\n\nMarch's character is probably the most fortunate and the least explained of the three returning soldiers. He was a banker when he left, and he goes back to that job, however, this time he is evaluating the loans of returning soldiers as the bank thinks he has their perspective given his time at war himself. Al seems to have a drinking problem which his wife (Myrna Loy) tries to hide, and it is never really said where that drinking is coming from, or if it was there before the war. When Al and his wife see each other, for the first time in years, you can see they don't know quite how to act around one another. Loy and March do a great job - without any dialogue - of acting like they feel like honeymooners, which they probably both feel is ridiculous since they have been married for twenty years and have a grown daughter.\n\nThere is one scene that I found as quite a surprise, seeing I was born 13 years after the war. A guy at a drugstore diner counter basically says the war was all trumped up for corporate profits, and that it's a shame a guy like Homer paid the price. His remark is met by a punch by Fred. Although that attitude was more common during and after WWI, apparently it was held by a few people in regards to WWII in spite of the overwhelming evidence that our nation was at stake.\n\nI'd highly recommend this one. Even though some of the social attitudes have long passed on, it gives you some things to think about that are relevant to today. A spouse can change their attitude towards the other spouse due to a job loss, you never know if a marriage is really a bad one and on the rocks unless you are in that marriage or if it is over, and people are still judged by \"what have you done for me lately\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Readjusting to civilian life proves challenging for three World War II veterans in this sombre drama from William Wyler. Clocking in at close to three hours, the film has received some criticism about its length, but the ample runtime allows the film to properly flesh out all three protagonists and the camaraderie that develops between them as they meet while sharing a flight back to the same hometown. Fredric March won an Oscar for his portrayal of a banker unable to instantly return to being the shrewd businessman that his colleagues expect of him. Dana Andrews was not Oscar nominated but is equally as effective as a pilot haunted by nightmares of war and vexed by a selfish wife who believes that he could just \"snap out of it\" if he really wanted to. The best performance comes from Harold Russell though, a nonprofessional actor who really did lose his hands during the war. There is a truly heartfelt moment when he smashes a glass window and the film handles his uncertainty over whether his fianc\u00e9e really still loves him very well. At times, the movie edges into melodramatic territory with Hugo Friedhofer's overbearing score no help, but it flows pretty smoothly in general. There also is a lot to like about how Wyler sets the film entirely in the aftermath of the war and yet manages to convey just how much each man is changed by his experiences."

I believe this film, told through the lives of three returning servicemen after World War II, encapsulates the fears and hopes of all such men who returned home to find their lives changed forever.\n\nFor me the defining moments are the scenes where Fred Derry's father reads out the citations that his son has received for the medals won in air operations over Germany,a great honour but useless in peacetime, and where Fred himself is sitting in the nose of the derelict B-17 quite literally at the crossroads in his life, knowing that he cannot return to the glory days and the future appears to hold nothing for him.\n\nMost returnees adapted to new ways, new jobs and in some cases (as in the film) new relationships. Sadly some did not, and their wartime experiences would for them be the Best Years of Their Lives."

Each character is faced with extreme hardships and are forced to face their new realities of life post war. This film is truly bone-chilling and the charters are captivating."

        "review_detailed_main": "With WWII over, movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" was probably the best example. It portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their pre-war lives, but to the overall changing world. Probably the most interesting cast member is non-actor Harold Russell. Having lost his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be, and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else; he went on to win Best Supporting Actor and a special Oscar for the role, making him the only person ever to win two Oscars for the same role. There will probably always be debate over whether this deserved Best Picture more than \"It's a Wonderful Life\", but I certainly think that they did a good job with it. Very well done."

The problems they encounter and the people who chart the course of their return create an incredible, romantically moving story that will strike a nerve with ANYONE. I first caught this movie at age 13, and it has since shared my #1 spot with a few of its fellow \"Best Picture\" winners. Extremely controversial during its time for its brutal honesty in portraying the faults of its heroes, this film never loses its luster. If life could be set to the musical score of this movie, everyone would be in the best years of their life. In any event, if u are a true movie fan, do yourself a favor and watch this exceptional masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "When Robert Osborne introduced \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" on TCM years ago, he started it off by saying that some consider this to be one of the greatest films ever made. I was suspicious, as I had seen the film years earlier and thought it to be a good, not great film, but after that viewing, I now consider it to be a truly great film.\n\nThe film tells the story of four soldiers who return home to Boone City after the end of WWII. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns home to his wife (Myrna Loy) and daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright). Al also has a son, but he disappears almost entirely by the middle of the film. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns home to a wife (Virginia Mayo) who doesn't seem much like the woman he thought he married and alternatively he is drawn romantically to Peggy. Finally there is Homer (Harold Russell) who returns home to his family and girlfriend with the news that due to war injuries he no longer has his hands; instead two hooks are in their place.\n\nThe story follows these three men as they attempt to navigate the, not always smooth, transition from wartime to peacetime life as civilians. As evidenced by this film, not every problem was solved by the GI Bill. Memories (and wounds) of the war still linger. The film is not only a fascinating character study of soldiers but also of their loved ones as well. The way the film weaves the stories of these three distinct men together is a storytelling masterstroke. All of their stories fit together, yet are different (they come from different economic backgrounds, for example) and nothing seems forced.\n\nEvery member of the cast does a wonderful job from the leads to the actors in smaller roles like Virginia Mayo and Gladys George. March's performance is exquisite as he struggles to return to normalcy, especially at his job. Myrna Loy (has there ever been a classier actress?) is great as March's wife. Loy gives a restrained performance but one that radiates beautifully throughout the entire film. Harold Russell won two Oscars for his work here, one was honorary. Is it a great performance? No. But it sure is moving. The producer Sam Goldwyn and director William Wyler deserve credit for casting an actual amputee in the role. This is especially noteworthy when considering how frequently white actors played Asians and Native Americans in those days. When Goldwyn and Wyler could've cast anyone, they instead turned to Russell and the film is much better and more authentic because of that choice. Dana Andrews just might have given the best performance in the entire film. His part is probably the film's most complicated one. His character struggles perhaps the most both in terms of his personal life and in his job. Andrews successfully navigates this course so brilliantly; an honest, subtle, and charming performance.\n\nOverall, this film is nearly perfect with the exception of the overreaching score. In my estimation, it is Wyler's best film as well as the best movie about soldiers returning home, and yes maybe one of the greatest American films of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "America's love letter to servicemen returning from the war, speaking their truths, and hoping to earn them more appreciation, understanding, and patience. From the beginning we feel something is altered these guys (Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell), starting with Russell's dramatic reveal of missing his hands, and continuing on with all of their difficulties readjusting. In some sense they seem to be misfits in a country that they fought for and saved, and even though they are widely shown some level of respect, at times it feels like lip service, and that the country was ready to move on just a little too quickly.\n\nIn ways that are not heavy-handed, the film touches on things that survivors of the war faced, like marital problems, having missed children grow up, alcoholism, night terrors, survivor's guilt, the difficulty of getting a job or a loan, and in one scene, putting up with a loudmouth who questions why they fought in the first place, and didn't just put America First.\n\nThere are several touching moments: a father reading his son's commendation, the one the young man would just as soon throw away. March's sharp speech defending giving loans at risk to soldiers, cleverly pointing out the risks they took doing things like taking a hill during the war (they couldn't say \"no collateral, no hill\"), and that the bank was betting on America's future. Andrews walking out into a graveyard of scrapped war planes, and climbing up into one. And lastly, Harold Russell showing his girlfriend his body and making sure she understood the limits of his situation.\n\nRussell is simply a revelation in this film and deserves special mention out of the strong cast - and I mean that because of his acting. He brings an earnestness and authenticity to the part across a full range - stoicism, dignity, friendly camaraderie, grief, and anger.\n\nThree of the female characters are absolute saints (Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and Cathy O'Donnell), and almost too saccharine sweet in their wholesomeness. When Andrews says to Wright, \"I think they oughtta put you in mass production,\" he's probably got it right. Part of all this was undoubtedly the Production Code, and part of it was meant to impart a lesson in kindness and understanding of soldiers returning with physical or mental damage. They are offset a little by Virginia Mayo, the bad girl who shakes her hips while wrapping a scarf around her behind and soon tires of not living the high life on her husband's small salary. Per the morality of the Code he's expected to stick with her despite loving Wright, because as Myrna Loy's character articulates it to her daughter, in a marriage you go through trials and tribulations and even hating the other person, and are expected to just get through it. Of course all of the badness is assigned to Mayo's character, who conveniently exits the scene to ensure things will play out happily.\n\nWhile the film touches on the darker aspects of returning from war, it's also got that bright, squeaky-clean 1950's American feeling to it, and could certainly have been darker. At the same time, it initiated the conversation on these issues, and it almost certainly helped people heal, and for those things it deserves the credit it's received over the years.\n\nLastly, I liked the foreboding touches that occurred early on, alluding to the horrifying new era mankind had entered. As a high school boy has learned from his physics teacher, \"We've reached a point where the whole human race has either got to find a way to live together, or else...\" The point is later echoed by a piano player in the bar (Hoagy Carmichael), who is advocating patience to Russell's character because he's struggling. He softly says some of the best lines in the movie: \"You know your folks will get used to you, and you'll get used to them, then everything will settle down nicely. Unless we have another war. Then none of us have to worry because we'll all be blown to bits the first day. So cheer up, huh?\""

I was completely bowled over by Cathy O'Connell's eyes. I just could not take my eyes off of her whenever she was on screen. I had to watch the movie again immediately to concentrate on the dialogue of the scenes where she appeared because I had been so completely mesmerized by those marvelous haunting eyes, especially when she looked so lovingly at Homer.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I think of World War II, my mental image is of veterans coming home with post-traumatic stress, with a bad case of the drinks, and with no hands. It's not about glory or feeling good about a hard-fought job well done. Winning the most-important military conflict of the 20th Century be damned. Now we had to deal with the, ugh, return of guys who fought for a just cause. Didn't they know they're supposed to go into some kind of isolation tank until we need them to fight again?\n\nOkay, that was a series of cheap-shots and I dropped all those bombs for a reason. We don't want to deal with the hassle of doing right by the people who've shed blood and brain cells to keep us all safe from tyranny. Many movies have dealt with this topic, although not many of them have done it as well as The Best Years Of Our Lives. The 37th movie on both the 1998 and 2007 Top 100 lists released by the American Film Institute hits hard, but doesn't hit you with a sledgehammer.\n\nThat's thanks to director William Wyler and writer Robert Sherwood (who was once a film critic). They make it clear that Fredric March (the drunk), Dana Andrews (the PTSD guy who has no place back home), and Harold Russell (the guy who actually lost his hands for real) are not necessarily better off back home in the American Midwest than they were during WWII. Teresa Wright and Myrna Loy play March's patient daughter and wife, respectively, who (unfortunately) are more saintly archetypes than they are real characters.\n\nWho's to judge someone for struggling to accept their post-war life on its lousy terms or for turning to the bottle to cope? There aren't easy solutions and The Best Years Of Our Lives (classic Hollywood product that it is) doesn't revel in their pain or just gloss things up for the camera. It suffers from over-length---although the first 30 minutes is positively brilliant---and the women have no depth at all, but the men are handled sensitively and with a keen eye. This is absolutely a fine film, quiet and true.\n\nIf you liked this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the \"Podcasts\" section for our 40-minute Best Years Of Our Lives 'cast...and many others.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film ranks up there as one of my favorites.. I love movies from the 40's, especially when dealing with WWII. This film is about the lives of servicemen upon their return home after the war. For them, surviving the war was just the start. Now they had to survive reintegrating back into society, their family, their jobs (if they still had one).\n\nI think this film brings up so many important issues these men and their families faced. WWII took place before I was born, so I do't have any personal reference on which to draw. So it is eye-opening for me to be able to get the personal perspective of what these brave men and women faced. Granted, the movies aren't exactly telling the whole truth, but it is informative nonetheless. It gives us a snapshot of that time and generation.\n\nThe cast couldn't have been better in their roles. I was drawn into all their stories, not just by their good acting but the superb script writing as well. Dana Andrews' performance stood out most to me - he was so likable and then you hate the fact that he has such a cold, heartless wife. I'm sure this created a lot of conflict in the typical 40's viewer, as it has you rooting for a divorce so that it clears the way for sweet Teresa Wright's character.\n\nI am so grateful for the sacrifices made by the servicemen and women in our country. This film is a reminder of those sacrifices, not only on the battlefield, but at the home front as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "William Wyler's \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is today counted among the best films of all time. At the time of its release it was a smash hit at the box office while later taking home seven Oscars.\n\nThe story concerns a trio of WWII veterans returning to their homes in small-town America after the war. Each finds difficultly in picking up where they left off, both in terms of their place in small-town society and their relationships with their loved ones. It is worth noting that the screenplay resulted in one of the film's Oscar wins.\n\nThe cast is quite good and two of the individuals (Fredric March & Harold Russell) took home Oscars for their performances. Russell's performance is especially noteworthy since he wasn't even a professional actor. In fact, Russell also landed a second, honorary Oscar for 'bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance' in the film. The other male star, Dana Andrews, wasn't recognized with a nomination but I think that he gave a fine performance as well. As for the women (who also weren't recognized with any nominations), Teresa Wright leads the way while Myrna Loy & Virginia Mayo contributed solid performances as well.\n\nWyler's direction is impeccable and deservingly earned him an Oscar. The editing by three-time Oscar winner Daniel Mandell also earned an Oscar while Gregg Toland's cinematography is noted for its use of deep focus. Hugo Friedhofer's Oscar-winning score also deserves mention.\n\nIt's easy to see that the film is finely crafted but all of this would have been for naught if the story wasn't both authentic and touching. While I'm not exactly a huge fan of this brand of romantic drama I have to admit that the film did not leave me unmoved. Naturally, the 63 years that have passed since the film's release have served to date it somewhat but I believe that its status as a classic is well deserved."

Through many moving accounts the audience learns how the War has changed people, while their human spirit went on to triumph.\n\nMy favorite scene is where a young service man, who returned home as a double amputee (after losing both arms up to the elbow) is sure that he would be no good to his sweetheart, who still wants to marry him. His girl simply said that she would help him with the things he wouldn't be able to do, but that they would be fine together. Moved by this true demonstration of love, the man embraces his fianc\u00e9e in tears.\n\nThe scene where a service man asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. When he is initially refused as a \"high risk\", a higher ranking bank official takes over saying \"You fought for our country and kept us safe--that's good enough for me. Your loan is approved!\" \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" won 6 Oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actor who showed us all that life goes on and will continue to be worth living, even with a severe handicap. This film is a joy to watch over and over again. A true classic! Highly recommended!"

It is a classic romantic drama in the true sense of the word, and to say that they don't make them like this anymore would be an understatement. It has a solid cast, that includes; Myrna Loy, Fredrick March, Dana Andrews (one of my favorites), Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Russell.\n\nThe story begins with three returning WWII veterans (March, Andrews, Russell) who meet on the flight back to their hometown, and centers around there difficulty returning back to their former lives. March's character returns to find his children have grown, and he and his wife must get reacquainted with each other all over again. Andrews returns to an unhappy and failing marriage and finds himself no longer in love with his wife. Perhaps the most heartbreaking role in the movie belongs to Harold Russell's character, who returns home from the war with out his hands, made all the more tragic because this paralleled Russells own experience in the war.\n\nThe Best Years of our Lives won nine Oscars in 1947, including; Best Picture, Best Actor (Fredrick March), Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell), and also Directing, Film Editing, Musical Score, Sound Recording, Writing, and a special award to Harold Russell \"for Bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance in The Best Years of Our Lives\", which, indecently was the only time in the Academys history that two awards were given to any actor for the same role. See the movie and you'll see that he deserved it."

        "review_title": "And love wins the war or How American veterans got used to peaceful life",
        "review_detailed_main": "Drama, romance. The film adaptation of the novel by American writer McKinley Cantor \"Glorification of me\". And since the original book source was not published in the country of defeated socialism, therefore I will evaluate the film adaptation as an independent work (especially since the writer was one of the screenwriters of this picture). What can I do, I love movies about the military, and especially old movies about the military, and here it is the old in the full sense of the word (filmed before the 1950s). And I stumbled upon this picture by chance, and even a solid timing (two hours and fifty minutes) he couldn't stop me, because the topic that was raised here turned out to be relevant, especially in Russia. I looked - and was not disappointed, all expectations were met. And here's my brief opinion for you - How American veterans got used to peaceful life. I will note right away that there is not a single minus in the picture, because we do not consider primitive technologies of those years as minuses, so I will focus your attention on the pros of this wonderful and inspiring picture.\n\nSo, here they are: 1. Scenario - the most brutal and bloody war in the history of mankind - the Second World War - has ended. Three American veterans are returning to a provincial town, where they will have to adapt to peaceful life. And if it is easier for two out of three to do this, then the sailor has one moment - he lost both hands in the war, and instead of them he now has prostheses in the form of hooks, which he learned to use. But the script focuses on the story of each of the three veterans, because everyone has their own set of problems that somehow prevent them from getting used to a peaceful sky: severe trauma, nightmares, prolonged absence, an unfaithful wife, job search, and so on. Each of the heroes will have to overcome these difficulties in order to earn their happiness in the end. This path will not be easy, but veteran camaraderie and mutual respect, as well as the love and care of loved ones will help the heroes find happiness. All the characters are spelled out very well, the dialogues do not feel fake, and the extras were real veterans of the Second World War. It's impossible to break away from the story being told, it's not boring, considering that the picture is an ordinary drama mixed with melodrama, where there is almost no dynamics, and the basis is dialogues and acting. And it all turned out great. I especially liked the scene in the pharmacy, where two heroes are trying to touch an American \"hawk\", which was shot down so well. This is already a clear reference to the beginning of the Cold War. I can imagine how the veterans who saw the horrors of that war themselves reacted enthusiastically in the cinemas of that time and knew why Russian, British and they (American) soldiers shed blood. I shake hands with the director and screenwriters for this scene. Well done!\n\n2. The topic raised is the adaptation of veterans to peaceful life. The topic is always burning, because humanity is constantly at war. Not a single day passes without a shot being fired in at least one corner of the globe. But people return from the war crippled, disabled, and even if unharmed, it is very difficult to forget the horrors of war in the soul. The sailor's story only confirms this. When I watched his story, I remembered our Alexey Meresyev, the hero of Boris Polevoy, who was able to find the strength not only not to despair, but also to return to combat aviation and continue his service, and even marry his beloved girl, who was waiting for him from the front, and waited, and together they lived a long and happy life. And today this topic is relevant. And although there are enough paintings on this topic, this one is one of the best, and deservedly so. After all, it not only gives hope, but also inspires, which is very important for cinema.\n\n3. Costumes and scenery - the city where the main events of the picture take place makes exactly the impression you expect - an ordinary American province, where almost all residents know each other, and for more than one generation, where their foundations and traditions have developed. I didn't notice the pavilion filming (well, or the creators did so well that they didn't see them). The uniforms and suits of men look great, and the dresses of women and girls (as well as the girls themselves) are just a sight to behold. And their courage and sensitive hearts help the heroes adapt to peaceful life, and how can they resist when such eyes look at you with a loving look? Although there are \"black sheep\" among the girls who only hurt veterans, and even ordinary residents are annoyed by such personalities.\n\nYes, partly the picture is sugary, but sometimes it resembles a fairy tale (although against the background of the painting \"This wonderful Life\", \"The Best years of our Life\" looks like a super-realistic drama). But this is not a disadvantage. Although I have one quibble - I wanted to see more of the story of a sailor who has hooks instead of hands.\n\nA little about the main characters: 1. Al Stevenson, played by Fredrik March, is a sergeant in the American army, the head of a respectable family, an important figure in a prestigious bank, who, upon returning home, realizes that he missed the upbringing of his son and daughter, and is now trying to catch up. The role of Al was superbly played by Fredrik March. Bravo!\n\n2. Fred Derry, played by Dan Andrews, is an American army captain who worked as a soda dispenser before the war, and now, upon returning home, he is forced to look for a new job in order to feed himself and his young wife, who likes to live \"in a big way\", and also does not like Fred. The actor was great in this role. Bravo!\n\n3. Homer Parrish, played by Harold Russell, is a US Navy sailor who lost his hands in the war, and now has prosthetics in the form of hooks, which he skillfully uses. By the way, Harold is a real participant in that war, and he lost his hands as well, as it is said in the picture itself, so he didn't even have to play. Because of his injury, he does not laugh at making an offer to his girlfriend, because he does not want to spoil her life. A tragic hero, but it is to him that the audience sympathizes the most. Bravo Harold! Bravo!\n\nWell, do not forget the dazzling beauties Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Katie O'Donnell and Myrna Loy, who brightened up the difficult story of three veterans with their actions and acting.\n\nThis picture became a cult for veterans of that war in the USA, and the box office success was on the face (with a budget of two, the picture earned twenty-three and a half lemons), which was deserved!\n\nMy rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film, expertly and passionately directed by William Wyler, is a captivating glimpse of America immediately following World War II when scores of veterans returned home from dangerous and distant battles overseas. The story is centered on three servicemen who had each endured combat, respectively on land, at sea, and in the air, and who find themselves back in their fictitious home town of Boone City, which is patterned after Cincinnati. Having dreamed on the battlefront of reuniting with those they love in the familiar, peaceful environment of civilian life, are they adequately prepared for the transition from one world to another? Each of the men carry their battle scars, both physically and mentally, from the war to the \"peaceful\" existence of Boone City. As the superbly directed, explosive drugstore scene indicates, the sad reality is that post-war Boone City, as a microcosm of America itself, is anything but peaceful.\n\nAside from Wyler's outstanding direction, the screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood is very perceptive and often very touching. As moved as I am by the exchanges between Homer and Wilma during the film, I didn't realize just how powerful their dialogue is until I re-read the words in the \"quotes\" section on this website. I'm not ashamed to say that I bawled like a baby when I read at least some of these genuinely heart-rending words, and that is not a frequent occurrence for me.\n\nI can't praise the cast enough, both the leads and the support, especially the three men who play the vets, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and, last but never least, Harold Russell, a non-professional actor who managed to nail two different Oscars for his very credible portrayal of disabled Homer Parish. I also agree with the one reviewer who states that of the three leading men, the best performance comes from the guy who didn't win an Oscar at all, Dana Andrews, in what may be the best role of his lifetime. That having been said, March's drunken speech before the bank bosses at the Cornbelt Loan and Trust is one of the movie's several \"high\" moments, and initially made me as anxious as his wife, played by Myrna Loy, but all's well that ends well.\n\nThe three leading women, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and Cathy O'Donnell are excellent as well. While this very important role launched O'Donnell's all too brief career (\"They Live By Night\", \"Ben-Hur\"), it was eventually stifled by producer Samuel Goldwyn only because she married the older brother of director Wyler, with whom Goldwyn was feuding, before she tragically succumbed to cancer at the young age of forty six.\n\nVirginia Mayo fought for the role of Marie Derry, the selfish, unlikeable wife of Fred (Andrews), who had not fallen in love with Fred as much as the uniform that he wore. I'm glad that Mayo landed the part because no one could deliver Marie's nasty, sneering lines as well. \"There are drugstores everywhere!\" Ouch! You sure know how to hurt a guy, Marie, especially one who sacrificed so much for your freedom, and you sure love your freedom, sweetheart."

This movie tackles the not-so-glamorous aftermath of war with such finesse, you'll find yourself rooting for every character, even as they fumble through their new civilian lives. It's like watching your awkward relatives at a family reunion, but instead of cringing, you're gripped by their struggles. Harold Russell, an actual war veteran, steals the show and your heart, proving you don't need both hands to grab onto some Oscars.\n\nAs for the drama? Oh, it's there, served up in a deliciously complex, triple-layered cake of love, loss, and the pursuit of happiness-or at least a decent night's sleep without nightmares. The intertwined lives of three veterans and their families unfold with the kind of emotional punches that hit harder than your mom's critiques of your career choices. Myrna Loy and Fredric March bring a marital tension that's as thick as Thanksgiving gravy, simmering with post-war adjustments and the occasional tender moment that reminds you why you're watching this emotional rollercoaster.\n\nBy the end, if your eyes are dry and your heart isn't swelling like a balloon about to pop, you might want to check your pulse. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" isn't just a film; it's an experience, a masterclass in storytelling that teaches us that the real battles often start after the war ends. Four and a, half stars because, let's face it, perfection is overrated, and who doesn't want just a smidge more of Dana Andrews looking dapper in uniform? This is a timeless epic that proves, once again, that old Hollywood could really stick the landing."

Together with \"Mrs Miniver\" (1942) Wyler has made two of those excellent war movies.\n\nIn \"The best years of our lives\" three men try to pick up again their civil lives after the war, only to discover that society puts little value on the experience they have obtained in the army. The film illustrates this with concrete examples. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) can come back by his former employer as the assistent of his former subordinate because his war time experience is \"not relevant\". Al Stepehenson (Fredric March) as a bank employee has to give more weigh to the value of the collateral than to the personality of the applicant when deciding about the request for a loan by a veteran. It is no coincidence that, when walking om a terrain with old jet fighters Fred Derry feels himself just as discarded as these planes.\n\nMost touching however are the experiences of Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), who is very afraid that after losing both his arms in the war the relationship with his girl friend shall solely be based on pity."

        "review_title": "Classic post-war epic.",
        "review_detailed_main": "A huge commercial success of Wyler's film upon its release right after the war and a spectacular critical reception (9 Oscars including Best Picture) are surprisingly conflicting (and somewhat symptomatic of the film's value) when one determines his expectations towards a picture that suggests post-war revisionism encapsulated within the spirit of the Classical Hollywood melodrama. The Best Years of Our Lives is a complex film in a sense that it is intricately honest about its political restraints and yet applies the same careful consideration to both the entertaining dramatic facade and underlying it social context.\n\nRunning time of over 170 minutes turns The Best Years of Our Lives into a 'domestic epic'- film of subtle pleasures and intervening relationships focused on the mundane but extended into the proportions usually reserved for stories of much more grandiose scale. Yet initially balanced perspectives shift dangerously and for lengthy periods of time character of Homer is pushed into the background. Played by an actual disabled veteran, Homer adds a level of harsh realism that is unexpected for a Hollywood film of that period. All three veterans, levelled only briefly by a shared anxiety of returning to their families are constantly challenged by their different economical positioning, but strangely disproportionated by the narrative's momentum.\n\nWyler's film reveals itself to be a melodrama, in most natural way evolving from the struggle for readjustment into a love affair and it thrives on sentimentality. This notion dominates the tone of the whole with a pleasurable alas predictable manner, leading to an ending that seems to be entirely satisfied with its shmalzy quality. Film is simply most comfortable in this familiar territory, once the obstacle of the controversy- Al's contradictory intentions at work, Fred's unemployment and Homer's disability become merely a set up.\n\nAt one point Homer's sacrifice comes under blunt questioning but the villainous gentleman who dares to display his doubt is brutally dispatched- questionable necessity of war dismissed in favour of the future prosperity; an optimism of blindfolded conformity. This suspension of criticism is film's dominant mode.\n\nStaged and executed with precision, film utilizes, infamously, deep focus to achieve a level of undeniable verity. It is hard to dismiss it as only a technical nuisance and although one should be extremely careful to seek Bazinian inclinations of dominance in this particular form, The Best Years of Our Lives is a thoroughly impressive achievement. Depth of every shot provokes a curiosity that is often rewarded through reoccurring use of reflections and significant details that would otherwise require editing, disturbing film's considerate pace.\n\nVerdict: It's a classic that is as enjoyable a movie now as it might have been in 1946 but even more interesting as a story of a significant compromise. One between the urge for reassessment in a mass medium not quite ready for this kind of impact and a story that could support the interest of a broad audience- disillusionment and patriotism. More a mark of its times than perhaps any other Classical Hollywood venture, The Best Years of Our Lives is an example of a film that lost none of its excellence and purely emotional impact even if it intellectually resonates in a rather underwhelming way."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this film as a newbie some 77 years after its release but it still struck a chord that I'm sure it did on it's release back in 1946. The story focuses on three United States World War II veterans returning from active duty to their home city (Boone City) and readjusting to civilian life.\n\nThe three have their own problems to navigate along the way which are focused on, which brings me onto the great deep focus photographic techniques from director William Wyler and his Director of Photography Greg Toland allowing different actions to take place in different areas of the shot simultaneously and in focus.\n\nThe film shows that decorated war veterans face attitudes of resentment and financial difficulties in some scenes quite surprisingly in an ever changing world and it's attitudes which is briefly touched on even in 1946 and still has relevance decades later.\n\nThe film shows problems of PTSD, war physical disability and ends with a romantic marriage scene that is sure to break the emotions of the most hardened viewer.\n\nThe film shows U. S. experiences but I'm sure they were faced around the world and are even to this day which makes the film even more relevant. Indeed other films followed the path of this. I'm thinking of Coming Home (1978).\n\nA deserving winner of several Academy Awards and a cinematic showing that has to be seen by all generations."

        "review_detailed_main": "So many great talents were utilized in \"The Best Years of Out Lives\", the result has to be somewhat miraculous. Think of what its director, William Wyler, faced; in the aftermath of a military victory over statist powers who had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world if battles, he was making a film that argued that the US's leaders were themselves profoundly anti-individual--that they had \"wasted the best years of the lives of those drafted or misled into fighting the war--which since it ignored the rights of individuals had been for nothing except argument over the degree of slavery men were to exist under.\" There are beautiful sets by Julia Heron, Gregg Toland's cinematography and a script by Robert E. Sherwood, author of \"The Road to Rome\" and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas. The ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael into a large-scale but thematic drama. The clever plot line was the experiences of thee \"couples\" after the soldiers (three being spotlighted) tried to return home to a 'victory culture\". Their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight again against what was happening on the homefront poses a strong and sobering counterpoint to the conventional notion being sold that \"all was well with \"America\"\". March and his wife have a terrible time adjusting, and he is drinking; O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell,, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living; and worst of all Andrews' wife throws him over for a guy with dough and he has lost years, causing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job, to consideration on his individual merits, to have even what he had before he had been ripped from his life and thrust into the arena of risk--for nothing, and loss of everything he had ever had. The shattering climax of the film comes when each of the three has to confront the need to do battle again,each for his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to go on fighting--each for his own happiness, which is now being threatened by a curiously anti-self, anti-reality indifferent an un-American United States. Wyler's direction, especially of the scene where Andrews sits in the cockpit of a mothballed B-17, alone and the scene of Russell's wedding is wonderful indeed. This is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms, one women and men can agree on for once. Music by Hugo Friedhofer and costumes by Irene Sharaff add to its luster. One of the best and most unexpected films of all time, in stunning B/W."

This is one of the greatest movies ever made. If you wanted to see only 3 World War II themed movies, I'd recommend 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Best Years' for the American experience, with 'Enemy at the Gates' to get the feeling for the Eastern Front."

However, the film spins into a higher gear with the ride home. A brilliantly handled scene depicting the reluctance to finally come home again.

        "review_detailed_main": "William Wyler was inarguably a supreme Hollywood craftsman who thrived under the studio system from the 1930s to the 1950s, an important example for today's filmmakers to discover and follow. His painstaking methods with actors are cruel and insensitive, though there is something to be said when he has directed 31 different Oscar-nominated performances by 31 different actors, 13 of them having won. What is so important about his film-making style is his subtle language that holds complete bearing over the tone of his films, a technique based on long takes and the dramatic possibilities of deep focus shots.\n\nThis suitably extensive film begins right after WW II, as discharged servicemen played by Dana Andrews, Harold Russell and Frederic March meet while hitching a ride home to a Midwestern city in which they all happen to live. One was a captain and bombardier who still endures from nightmares of combat. Russell had been in the Navy and lost both of his hands with mechanical hook prostheses in their stead. March served as an infantry sergeant fighting in the Pacific.\n\nWyler himself was commissioned a major in the Air Force during World War II and on his return to Hollywood shot The Best Years of Our Lives. Having such fresh and similar experience to his characters, this should have been at least as powerful as The Heiress because of how personally he perceives it, just as he did The Heiress. And while it holds touching passages, this epic hometown drama does not pack the wallop it promises. It is a traditional melodrama about the troubles of servicemen struggling to be relevant to life in postwar America and readjust to the lives to which they return, and as this it is good, not dull or badly made by any means. Despite a flat performance by Russell, one for which you can't blame him, for he never was an actor before but a serviceman himself who trained paratroopers with explosives with an outcome identical to that of his unfortunate character, this film is capably dished up by its especially good performances by Fredric March, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo and Hoagy Carmichael, who can act out dialogue while playing the piano, in addition to clever deep-focus setups."

In particular, Frederick March allows a sensitive script to shine through his portrayal of a successful businessman whose war experiences end up altering his life's priorities. Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Harold Russell, Cathy O'Donnell, Virginia Mayo (in one of her best performances), and Myrna Loy round off a cast clearly dedicated to bringing alive Wyler's concept."

Both films were up for best film , best\n\ndirector, and best actor, all won by \u0091Best Years'. Frederic March ,\n\nand Dana Andrews along with an amateur actor Harold Russell ( a\n\nreal life soldier,who lost both hands in an explosion,) play the\n\nreturning soldiers, finding life is very different , from what they\n\nremember. Myrna Loy is superb as March's wife, who has to keep\n\nthe family together while he has been away.The tear jerking\n\nscene where March and Loy are reunited is magnificent. All three\n\nmen find that they have problems readjusting to post war life, not\n\nleast Russell coming to terms with artificial hands, and his finance\n\n(Cathy O'Donnell ) trying to be too helpful. Sam Goldywn is quoted that he doesn't care if the film makes no\n\nmoney at all, as long as everyone in America sees the film ,so they\n\nwill appreciate what these men went through.

I couldn't help but notice that alcoholism was always lurking in the background, but it was shown as a mildly funny or potentially embarrassing problem, rather than a serious, destructive addiction. I think the movie meant to show it as a serious problem, but that's not how it came across. Still, I enjoyed the film and highly recommend it, so I give it 8 stars."

It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story. There is not a single part in the film which could be left out. The young girl's fixation with her brothers lack of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsiblity was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action. A women who must now adjust to the husband who's life has been away from her for years. The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands. A parents first look and reaction to their son's new deformities. A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank's loan structure. This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed any different. This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will ever see. The casting was perfect.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is a drama movie in which we watch three World War II veterans who are traveling together to their same hometown and they knew each other better. After they arrive there we watch the three lives of these three people that they are really change and now the three men have more things in common than before. Things are getting more complicated when these men are trying to find jobs but they face some different situations than these that they thought.\n\nI really liked this movie because it shows the true face of men who returned back to America from World War II and it also shows us what difficulties they faced. The direction of this movie which made by William Wyler is very good and I believe that it shows many interesting things. About the interpretations I liked the interpretation of Dana Andrews who played as Fred Derry and he was simply outstanding on it. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Fredric March's who played as Al Stephenson, Harold Russell's who played as Homer Parrish and Teresa Wright's who played as Peggy Stephenson. The interpretation of the last one I can compare it with her interpretation in the movie \"Shadow of a Doubt\" which was about the same good.\n\nFinally I have to say that \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is a great movie to watch and has to be considered as a must see movie. This movie combines very well drama and war with romance and this is something that makes this movie so special and good. I strongly recommend it to everyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "Simply put, one of the finest motion pictures ever made. From Sherwood's exceptional screenplay to the marvelous, yet beautifully understated, ensemble acting; from Wyler's\ufeff adroit direction and the superb cinematography of Gregg Toland (employing the deep focus photography he perfected with \"Citizen Kane\"), to the magnificent score by Hugo Friedhofer (amongst the finest ever written for the screen), this picture is a snapshot of our republic that would have moved the Founders to tears. A film deeply imbued with humanity and decency, experiencing it cannot but make one a better human being.\n\nAfter Francis Goldwyn read an article entitled \"The\ufeff Way Home\" in the 7 August, 1944, edition of Time magazine on the travails of servicemen returning to civilian life from the war, she showed it to her husband, producer Samuel Goldwyn; he was also deeply affected and decided to make a picture about the issues raised.\n\nGoldwyn hired writer, newspaperman and former war correspondent MacKinlay Kantor to write an original story, which became the best-selling blank-verse novella \"Glory for Me\" (1945); he would later win a Pulitzer Prize for his Civil War novel\ufeff \"Andersonville.\"\n\nGoldwyn then turned to playwright Robert E. Sherwood\ufeff to turn Kantor's story into a screenplay. Former Director of War Information and speech-writer for FDR (it was he who coined the phrase that became \"the arsenal of democracy\"), Sherwood had already won three of his four Pulitzer Prizes and was himself no stranger to the cinema (he had co-written the screenplay for Hitchcock's first American film, \"Rebecca,\" 1940). The result was titled \"The Best Years of Our Lives.\"\n\nHimself fresh out of the service, William Wyler was an ideal choice for director. Commissioned a major in the U.S. Army Air Corps, Wyler flew actual combat missions while making two classic documentaries, \"The Memphis Belle\" (1943) and \"Thunderbolt\" (1944). His courage while filming under extreme and life-threatening conditions earned him an Air Medal - and promotion to Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nFrom the moment the film's opening credits begin to roll, Hugo Friedhofer's extraordinary music sets the emotional stage for the story about to unfold. Conducted by Franco Collura leading the London S.O., a superb re-recording of the complete Oscar-winning score was made in 1978 and released by Preamble on Lp; the CD was issued in 1988. Preamble is no longer\ufeff extant, but the Australian 'Label X' obtained the rights and reissued a new digital transfer from the original master tapes in the best sound to date."

        "review_title": "Wyler's Honest, Heartbreaking Portrayal of Post-War America!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Vietnam War brought the issue of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) to the forefront of people's minds. In today's combat, PTSD is a topic that is regularly explored. PTSD is nothing new, but its thematic exploration is only recent. However, there happens to be an honest, intelligent film depicting PTSD from before Vietnam...during World War II. That particular film is William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives. The film began production a mere seven months after the war ended and Wyler wanted to bring an honest, authentic feeling to his movie. He even had the principal actors buy their own clothes. At nearly three hours long, you don't feel the time passing. Wyler, the man behind Wuthering Heights and Ben-Hur, immerses his audience into his film with a timely topic, impressive, well-developed characters, and a wonderful film score composed by Hugo Friedhofer. Big-time American producer Samuel Goldwyn came up with this film's idea when reading about veterans returning from abroad and trying to adjust from a Times article. He hired a former war correspondent to write a screenplay which was turned into a novella. Furthermore, Robert Sherwood adapted the current film's screenplay from that novella. Sherwood's script is impressive because its honest with the terms of how hard it is for veterans to readjust themselves to society...brutally honest sometimes. Wyler was hired to direct, as he flew a few missions himself during the war. Authenticity was very important to him. Instead of creating grand sets as accustomed to during this time period, he created lifelike sets. He also went out of his way to hire a non-actor, Harold Russell, to play one of the returning veterans. He happens to be the only actor to win two Academy Awards for the same performance (best supporting actor and an honorary award). He also worked with cinematographer Gregg Toland to come up with rather impressive well-focused shots. This movie depicts the lives of three soldiers returning home from the war to different lives but somehow connected to one another. Al Stephenson (Frederic March) returns to his influential banking position but comes to realize that being loyal to his fellow soldiers may not be a good thing. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) is just your typical, ordinary man that works hard for a living. He realizes how hard it is to find or hold down a job. Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) has both of his hands burned away during combat. He comes home unsure if his family and especially his fianc\u00e9 loves him anymore. With these issues in mind, the three men must try and reacclimate themselves to a harsh society. The performances are excellent all across the board, Harold Russell deserves all the credit because he nails it as someone with no acting experience. He sold the idea of having no hands and trying to live in his \"new normal\" very well. His scenes with his fianc\u00e9 are very heartbreaking. Frederic March does a great job and his scenes where he tries to be loyal by approving loans but receiving blowback from the bank in the process is engrossing and likewise heartbreaking. On the supporting end, Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright are fantastic as Al's respective wife and daughter. And Dana Andrews! He had some excellent scenes, especially in the bomber sequence towards the end. One of the reasons why the film worked because each actor delivered a raw, honest portrayal. No gimmicks or anything. Each performance was natural, and the strong writing and direction only elevated these performances. William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives hit home how horrible war veterans can have it returning home from war whether it be trying to find a job, reuniting with loved ones, etc. After service is completed and the war is over, people seem to forget about these folks-the same folks that defended this country so we Americans can live a life of freedom. Wyler was not afraid to mince words or scenes when trying to push across his themes. It is the same today as it was back in 1945. Readjusting to society while having bouts of PTSD is near impossible without the necessary help and love that is required. This movie is a moving, and hard portrayal about life after war. I definitely give this movie a recommend. My Grade: A"

There are soldiers who started the psychological war in social life because of what they experienced during the war. Supporting and presenting the point of view of the society does not make people sad. By adding love stories, a good story emerges. The fact that he provides information about the American family life and tells it sweetly despite such a subject has made the movie a complete Hollywood classic. william wyler is a director who manages to explain romance very well. It markets emotional situations according to social and moral conditions and realizes its presentation extremely well. the greatest example is the roman holiday. The duration is too long according to the story, there are many scenes that cut the fluency and re-enter. this may bore some spectators. It is unnecessary to wander between the three characters and to give the same amount of space. It was one of the elements that attracted attention when watching the movie. There is no need for such sagging for films that add the return stories of people who have lived under bad conditions and instill happiness. Of course, if there is no creep in the subject. It can be called a classic. If you have reservations about the duration, it is useful to turn to other alternatives."

Perhaps as touching as any scene is when Fred's father reads his son's citations for bravery. The pride leaps through the screen. Or Homer's tears as he realizes Wilma truly loves him, or anyone of a hundred telling moments. Camera work - the best, acting - great, truly a picture as relevant today as it was 54 years ago."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes a great film is made that can't be appreciated by future generations . THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is one of these movies . It was a truly great film when it was released in 1946 , a fact reflected in its massive box office draw and awards . There's two things producer Samuel Goldwyn , director William Wyler and screenwriter Robert E Sherwood are saying with this film :\n\nThe first thing is the sons , brothers , fathers and lovers who went away to fight in the war are not the same men who came back . The young men who fought and survived haven't in fact survived at all . They have more or less the same physical attributes but the war has killed part of them\n\nThe second thing is to tell the men that home no longer exists . The civilian population might have watched the newsreels of the war but they don't owe you anything . Try not to be too bitter about that\n\nThese themes run throughout the film some obvious , some latent . The most blatant example is Harold Russell as Homer whose casting sears itself in to the memory which is an image which the film is correctly remembered for . There's also the scene in the pharmacy with Homer and the \" American patriot \" which sums up the insanity of real politic in the new cold war where a year ago the Soviets were brothers in arms but are now the enemy . An audience growing up post 1945 might have very well forgotten that a long time ago the Soviets were the good guys\n\nYou must watch this empathising with an 1946 audience to get its full benefit and whilst it remains a good there's a couple of elements that stop it remaining a great one . First of all there's an overuse of intrusive melodramatic music that dictates how we should feel when in fact THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES works best with its subtle elements . Secondly it suffers from being a bit too long and its storytelling could have done with at least 30 minutes cut out . That said it's still a very good film showing that the scars of war upon the individual and society never ever go away"

Andrews has to deal with dissatisfied wife Virginia Mayo; March has to adjust to being back with wife Myrna Loy and their two grown children; Russell has had his hands blown off in war (he was played by non-actor Russell who really had lost his hands in the war).\n\nI first saw this back in the 1980s at a revival theatre. I remember being totally bored and fighting to stay awake. I think I was too young to appreciate it. Years later I started watching it casually on TV--and liked it. I was almost never bored and the stories pulled me in. It is exceptionally well directed by William Wyler and virtually the entire cast is flawless. The women in the movie actually give the best performances. Loy, Mayo and Theresa Wright are all just great. Andrews also was very good. March, however, came across as very unsympathetic and Russell was terrible (but he never was an actor).\n\nHowever it's way too long--three hours is a bit much. This movie could easily lose an hour. And this movie was (for its time) relevant and pretty shocking. Today it still is relevant (sadly with the war we have now) but no longer shocking. I found many of the situations contrived and forced and there were some REALLY unbelievable happy endings all around. Still this should be seen for just the acting and directing alone.\n\nA good film but no masterpiece. I give it an 8."

There have been films made on War, some friendly some anti war some were action films some were explosive but i haven't got to see a film on War heroes after they return home. How difficult and somewhat humiliated it could be for War veterans to earn respect and money at the same time after dignified experience in War which is useless in civilian's corporate life. The Best Years Of Our Lives finally breaks the shell of this topic and also creates a warm atmosphere along with heart touching love stories. You know while watching this film i was literally praying that, please God this is going so good please this should end on happy note and guess what it ended so beautifully. Oscar honoured this Classic film but IMDb users should have brought it into Top Rated 250 films, we gotto be ashamed little bit. Well, coming to the film's prospects i don't really see much to be criticized as Acting, Writing, Screenplay, Dialogues, Production and Direction all fields were absolutely fantastic. The film with 170 minutes of runtime won Oscar for Best Editing, do i really need to say more now? William Wyler does marvellous job while crafting this story i mean linking 3 War veterans lifes, troubles and their love Stories is a sign of Intelligent filmmaking. And the way he crafted all the diamonds like Myrna Loy, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo and surprise package Harold Russell in the film truly made all those shine brightly. Now just one compliant i personally felt there should have been one speech at the climax of all 3 heroes sharing their experience from War and how they gave Best Years of Their Lives for the country. This one scene would have made it a Masterpiece. Well, 7 Oscars for this film against films like 'Brief Encounter' and 'Its Wonderful Life' proves that juries had tough time at 1947 Academy Awards. Rating- 8/10*"

In fact, movies of this time have become commonplace for Vietnam. But the original one of these, and the best, is a World War II one. It is long, and complex, combining the stories of three men. But, in the end, despite its large scale story, it provides a personal, intimate look at each of there lives.\n\nFred Derry (Dana Andrews) is a young captain who returns to find that his talents as a bombardier are of no use to him back home, and that his marriage now isn't what it used to be. Al Stephenson (Frederic March) returns to a family and a job, but now has a cynical attitude towards all of it. Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) lost his hands during the war. While his family is ready to accept it, he is not.\n\nThe movie is an incredibly fascinating, heartfelt look at three men and their struggles to return to their normal lives. The characters each have their unique problems, and the audience can sympathize with every one of them, as well as with many of the family member who must also deal with their struggles.\n\nFew movies have been made that are as moving as this one. It never falls to the level of being manipulative or overwrought. It simply tells the stories as they are and lets the viewer fall into it. A superb film, the best of its kind.\n\n**** out of ****"

Anyone who has a heart will have a tugging at theirs for Russell's handless hero, and everyone must root for Andrews' character to divorce his trampy wife and get the girl he deserves. War is hell, and this movie proves that homecomings can be just as treacherous.

Silence plays a major role in the film, whether the characters are silently waiting for some change in their situation or one character's dialogue leaves another flabbergasted, this is a movie that accomplishes much impressively with hollow space.\n\nThe title I still can't puzzle out, but it seems deep. It's referenced in one line when a complaining wife says to her husband that she gave away the best years of her life for nothing. Did the soldiers give the best years of their lives for a war that should have never happened? Did their families in the home front give them? Or are they saying that the best years of their lives are still to come in peacetime and that the war didn't bog down the human spirit after all?\n\nHonourable Mentions: First Blood (1982). A man returns shattered and alone from the Vietnam war, discovering that he not only lost everything that could set him back in the right direction, but that he's left with a ponderous amount of PTSD as well. Then he snaps to explosive results. One of the greatest action movies of all time but also an important anti-war film that manages to lambast the effects of war through the glorification of violence."

I rented it because I saw the stacks of Oscars it received and it's placement on the AFI's list. And I had never heard of the movie until it popped up on my recommendations radar at Netflix.\n\nIt's a surprisingly long film, clocking in at almost three hours, but I have to credit the filmmakers, as it really didn't seem that long as I was watching it. All in all, this film really just has classic Hollywood all over it, complete with classic Hollywood direction, acting, etc. From beginning it end, it's smoothly directed, capably acted and has a developed enough script that I didn't lose patience with it much.\n\nHaving seen plenty of movies from this era, the one shocker to me (and probably to the audiences of the time) was the implication of divorce and marriagebreaking. Outside of that, the story is just a human drama about men returning from the war and the problems some of them encounter in readjusting. It's not a terribly complicated film and spends a lot of time with the three principle characters and following their lives, which intersect at many points. This allows the viewer to get connected.\n\nStill, in the end, I can't love the film and that's really no fault of the film. It's just a specific film made for a specific audience, which I don't fall under. While I understand the drama, it isn't as relevant to me. It's still solid enough throughout that I can recommend it, if you have the nearly three hours necessary to watch it. 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite having heard much about this film over the years, I only recently saw it for the first time on DVD. I expected something good and I wasn't disappointed. Despite being over 50 years old now, this is still an involving film. You won't be bored.\n\nWhen first released, many people identified with 'The Best Years of Our Lives'. Films now rarely if ever speak to a common, shared experience and instead, mass successes like 'Titanic' or 'Lord of the Rings' must rely on fantasy. Maybe that's a good thing. We live in a better world, as anyone watching this film can't help on reflection but realise.\n\nThree last points: I was struck at how much 'The Deer Hunter' owes to this film. It was good to see genuine 1940s style instead of a modern production designer's recreations. And I liked the scene at the end in the drugstore when Homer angrily asks whether the 400 guys on his ship were suckers too."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. Recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers' integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as \"The Deer Hunter.\") I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.\n\nThe tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.\n\nThere are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" which also deserved the Best Picture Award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.\n\nI am going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being \"the perfect wife\" is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.\n\nDana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon March's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, \"I'm going to bust that marriage up!\" The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.\n\nSpeaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. \"I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys.\" Truly great stuff.\n\nThe film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points."

        "review_detailed_main": "The fact that this movie was made only one year after the world war II and it talks about one of its most important issues,which made the value of this movie way more bigger. The main idea talks about three soldiers coming back to their homes after the end of the world war II, and bringing with them a lot of new concepts and fears. The fear of meeting the family, coming back to their old lives, old jobs and to the old THEM. The fear of change either from others or from themselves. \u0650Another idea is to get a serious injury by the war,which will make disabilities after it. But the happy ending of this movie gives what I should call hope. Because anyone at that time with same situation watched this movie, will become stronger and think hopefully about his new life. There are also other themes and ideas in this movie like love and friendship, that made it timeless. The acting was really good especially from Myrna Loy. However, I didn't like Cathy O'Donnell's performance it was really weak and fake. In short this movie is a great one and because of its value it becomes legendary."

Loy plays March's wife, Wright his daughter; Mayo plays Fred's wife, George his stepmother; O'Donnell plays Homer's fianc\u00e9e.

        "review_detailed_main": "Some random thoughts from the 301st reviewer on this site of one of the top 100 American films of all time:\n\n1) Amazing how un preachy and character centered Robert Sherwood's fine screenplay is, huh? I mean, Wyler and Sherwood could easily have gone all Stanley Kramer/Abby Mann on us and made a ponderous \"problem\" pic with lots of worthy, vaguely liberal pronouncements and soapboxy speeches on the Plight Of Returning Vets. But with a couple exceptions...Al Stephenson's concluding remarks in his drunken speech about morality in banking being the most egregious...this is definitely and thankfully a movie about three people, with virtues and flaws, returning from war rather than three symbols of troubled peacetime adjustment.\n\n2) Of the fine cast Dana Andrews seems to get better the more often I see it (at least 20 times). Andrews is one of those under rated thesps who tended toward the \"less is more\" school of acting and thus tended to disappear into the overall pattern of the film, especially when he has to share the space with such giants as Frederic March and Myrna Loy. Maybe this is why the guy shamefully never got an Oscar nomination, let alone an award. Sure shoulda gotten one or the other, though, for his portrayal of Fred Derry, the most pathetic and self destructive of the three vets and the one whose fate is left most up in the air by film's end.\n\n3) While Andrews gets better over time, Teresa Wright's star, for me, diminishes. She's still quite good as the thoughtful, considerate, if smug at times Peggy but her acting, particularly in the scenes with Loy and March, descends into the realms of the too sentimental that the rest of the cast largely avoids.\n\n4) This film has many memorable scenes but there are two brilliant set pieces where the three main stories, Fred, Homer and Al's, come together. One is at the beginning when the three are in the nose of a bomber flying across post WW2 America. Inner conflicts that they are undergoing are set up and ironically intertwined with images of an outwardly calm and prosperous USA. The other is Homer and Wilma's wedding at film's end where the seeming happiness of the newly married couple is juxtaposed with Fred and Peggy's uncertain future and Al and Milly's loving but sometimes difficult union. Both of these riveting sequences serve to remind us that the best films (and novels, for that matter) leave us somewhere between hopeful and uncertain.\n\n5) This film is nearly three hours long and feels half that. Bravo Willie Wyler!\n\n6) My favorite line in the film comes from a very subsidiary character, Woody Merrill, Peggy's date at the nightclub foursome with them and the Derrys. In analyzing the failure of Fred and Marie's marriage Woody opines, \"just one small problem. They don't like each other.\"\n\n7) In the timely reminder that no film's perfect dept: Cathy O'Donnell sucks!"

I get it really, war theme, very emotional for most of the people back then, it represented something that was very fresh and painful and they did it in a good way, excellent indeed, but c'mon - It's a Wonderful life deserves at least 3 Oscars that year. To me nothing can compare to it and it's not worse than this one in any segment. The only reason why they remaind empty handed is the theme of The Best years of our lives."

He palms are sweaty and you can sense the anxiety, this is worse than the worse beach head, he cannot put it off any longer, he is literally, going in. When he reaches the door and what happens when it is opened is just pure magic. The joy on his daughters face, his plea for her not to make a sound, the sudden realisation on the face of his wife, could it be...after all these years, boy , I'm filling up now just thinking about it. What a service this film did for the vets, then and now. War changes people, you cannot be the same person, some change for the better, some for the worse but everyone is changed.

        "review_detailed_main": "Here's a few of the gender themes that I've found thus far: The Best Years of Our Lives\n\n1. The New Woman vs. The Fallen Woman(Peggy and Marie) Peggy comforts Fred when he is scared, cares for the sick, helps out in the war effort, and is kind and domestic. She, like Fred, wants a nice house in the suburbs.\n\nMarie doesn't want the house. She wants to be young, have fun, and she cheats on Fred. She also tries to make him go out to dinner and wants to spend her own money.\n\nOf course, Fred's cheating kiss is seen as excusable,because of her wicked behavior.\n\n2. Independent Women are lustful and sinful(Marie)\n\nExample: Marie has a career as a singer,which allows her to display her sexual side by seducing men with her siren's song. Fred wants her to give up her nightclub career.\n\n3. Domestic women must look respectable(Marie) Example:She doesn't \"look like a wife\" according to Fred's comrades. She's blond, made up, and sexy. She's what men want to f***-not to marry. Fred made a mistake by marrying a \"whore.\"\n\n4. Women must submit their household status to the returning male member(Millie & Al) Example:\"I'm the head of the household again,\" Al says. Too bad Al has been away so long that has no idea what is going on in the house. Plus, he's a still living through the war in his head. Wouldn't it be more logical to have Millie make more of the decisions for awhile?\n\n5. A woman must be a mother and a sexual being(Wilma and Homer's relationship) Example:After helping Homer remove his hooks, Wilma kisses him erotically. Homer admits that without his hands he is, \"As helpless as a baby.\"\n\n6. Infidelity is forgivable if your wife isn't ideal (Fred and Peggy)\n\nEven though Fred is married to Marie,he kisses domestic Peggy. The film makes this excuseable,since Marie is such a wanton woman.\n\n7. Women don't need intellectual connections/respect to fall in love-they just need a chance to nuture(Peggy and Fred)\n\nFred hits on Peggy before he even goes home to see his wife. But Peggy calms Fred after his night terror. She's a new woman ,after all, and she is willing to act like a doormat to comfort the returning GI's. The two of them share a lunch and all of a sudden they're in love. Peggy has had one decent conversation with this fellow. She refers to him as broken and hints to her parents that she could fix him now that his wife has tossed him aside. These are just the gender themes. There are so many other fun things that can be pulled out of this movie(vets will adapt to home life, let's move to the suburbs, let's stand up for soldiers rights, what if there is another depression,etc,etc,etc)."

Screenwriter Sherwood's script avoids the mawkishness of Capra's vehicle. Wyler's lingering closeups capturing the complex withheld emotions, often prolonged \"realtime\" shots that allow the inner processes to surface with extraordinary delicacy. The divide between those returning from war and those who waited back home is central to the unfolding narrative (something that resurfaces in the post-Vietnam movies where the social split was even more severe). Witness for example the depth of sincerity and affection between Butch and Homer, less obvious perhaps than the burgeoning love that binds Fred and Peggy Stephenson. We get a critical sense of the loyalty, principles, and human decency of friendship and human bonding that has long since evaporated. And yet, in all its miraculous 2:50 minutes, despite the ample and excellent cast, only two coloured people appear (neither service personnel or civilians): one brown attendant in the women's restroom (seen barely in profile), and a black waiter at the party: in all, barely 20 seconds. Fortunately, nowadays there are young historians who analyze such racial selectivity back through Hollywood history, and they do well. In the 1940s when this film was made the population was nearly 10 percent black, not counting the millions of migrant Hispanics and Asians and so-called mixed-race of second and third generation. A criminal \"erasure\" of the real population that is never too late to redress."

        "review_detailed_main": "Surely one of the greatest movies ever to come out of Hollywood, The Best Years of Our Lives remains eminently watchable nearly 80 years later and just as moving in the honesty of its human relationships and interactions. Enjoying it yet again recently, I couldn't help but note two points where I begged to differ with the viewpoint of the time... one, Marie is presented as a \"bad guy\" for wanting to keep her job... and two, the pacifist in the drugstore, also presented as a \"bad guy,\" doesn't start the fight with Homer and Fred... In both cases these \"bad guys\" threaten the prevailing sentiment of the time for male privilege (Fred gets to have a job, not Marie) and for loyalty to country and to the military, no matter what... threats intolerable at that time, which linger with us even now. Indeed the overall subject of how returning veterans survive is also very much with us today. The Best Years of Our Lives will remain a classic of prime importance to all of us, for every reason, not just because it is superbly made but also because it makes us look at crucial questions vital to us to this very day, and challenges us: How are we doing?\n\nJust an update: I love this movie, and realize that it's not only one I admire, but also eminently watch-able, over and over. Why? I guess because the characters' emotions and thoughts project as real, authentic -- I always get caught up in what they're living, even if it's acting... Further thoughts on changes in these 80 years... The women in the film are all good guys (Millie, Peggy, Wilma, Hortense...) or bad (Marie -- all by herself in this category...). The men are allowed to be good and bad, they are portrayed more in-depth, more complex... it's still very much a man's world... Sooo, Myrna Loy and Virginia Mayo -- plus Gladys George -- are indeed able to overcome this one-dimension characterization by the sheer spark and presence they have on screen... Not so much Theresa Wright and Cathy O'Donnell (newcomer at the time) -- they appear bland and a little too submissive to be really interesting in their own right. I think the film suffers from not allowing -- or encouraging -- them to rise to the marvelous spark and presence of their romantic partners, played by Dana Andrews and Harold Russell.\n\nMore thoughts: Television keeps bringing this back, and it remains irresistible... Now in 2024, I'm really tempted to imagine improvements that every viewing provokes... 1 - Marie keeps her job, and that helps Fred find even temporary employment as bartender... 2 - Rob doesn't disappear (just because the producer didn't want the cost of renewing the actor's contract...!) -- he helps Homer re-connect with Jackson High where he gets a great job as basketball coach... 3 - Homer and Fred don't physically attack the man in the drugstore (a lamentable, over-the-top violent action) -- they just get into a shouting match with him, which draws the manager who fires Fred on the spot.\n\nFood for thought..."

William Wylder is an awesome director, so I should have know anything he did wouldn't be.\n\nThe movie deals with three men returning from war, and the issues they face. Compared to the hundreds of war films made, this was one that dealt the family/social dramas of what happens after that. IN particular, it looks at small town social fabric, and how it works. The most dramatic, heartending moments are dealing with Homer, a man that has lost both his hands in the war, and is dealing with prosthetics. This storyline was done really well - not how I expected at all, and in fact portrayed by a real war vet. He won an oscar for his performance, and I think it was well deserved.\n\nThere is a scene in the movie where he sits on the bed, with his prosthetics removed - a close of his face reveals him to be sadly and queitly contemplating his existence. His story was the most powerful, but restrained rather than over the top.... the restraint shows how good Wylder really is.\n\nLastly, the movie is also a great window in later 1940s small town life."

With that said I would like to mention some of those marvelous supporting players (although some in bit parts) who also contributed in making this film a classic. Who could forget the reaction of Homer's (Harold Russell) parent's played by Minna Gombell and Walter Baldwin when he arrives home after the war minus his hands as they display such sorrowful affection that is extremely touching. His little sister Luella played so sweetly by Marlene Aames and in an emotional scene when Homer tired of being stared at pushes his artificial limbs through a window for her friends to get a better look at. The eloquence of the fabulous Gladys George and Roman Bohnen living in shanty town although none the less proud of their coming home soldier Fred (Dana Andrews). Then theres Hoagy Carmichael who as Homer's uncle Butch feels the need to take special care of him under the circumstances. Dorothy Ames and Don Beddoe who give loving support to their daughter Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) knowing that her marriage to amputee Homer could present problems. The handsome and surly Steve Cochran an ex-serviceman himself who is palsy with Fred's wife (Virginia Mayo). Michael Hall the son of Al Stephenson (Fredric March) who doesn't appreciate the Japanese war weapons his dad brings home for him. Ray Teal who demonstrates a negative view of what some others think about the war which angers Homer. Bank president Ray Collins who tolerates Al's indifference with his job at the bank. Dean White as Mr. Novak a farmer just out of the Navy and desperate for a loan without any collateral and also actor Howard Chamberlain the smug manager of the drug store where Fred applies for his job back. Along with all the others in the cast these players added the frosting on the cake and contributed in making \"The Best Year's of Our Lives\" a classic film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Brilliant beginning with the tale of 3 soldiers exchanging war stories on their return. The director has taken care of smallest detail of their hopes, dreams and reality. Even the comedy of Al with his Chaplin moustache lightens up their miseries. The smart bloke who questioned war exposed the one-sidedness of the 3 men's naivety. The contrast of Al serving in the bank at thousands vs Fred selling perfume by reading the bottle at $32 a week was hard-hitting. No character was unreasonable and yet they all were. Gambling on depositor's money or gambling on the nation's future- wow, 1940 sounded repeated in the housing bubble crisis of 2008. Americans the optimist gamblers, and the world saviours.\n\nThe heart-rending dialogues and scenes were by the three leading ladies.\n\nThe double-hooked sailor's guilt was so lovingly and honestly dealt with by Wilma's statement, 'I will understand you if you let me. And if its too much for me, I will know, but only if you let me try.' - I could use that line in life!\n\nMy heart goes to Peggy and her mom, who was even more beautiful. I didn't see as much in Fred as Peggy did. Maybe an incident of integrity would have made me love him too. Makes me wonder what kind of mental count i keep on people's virtues.\n\nBut Mrs. Stevenson, she's swell! She stands out as the most giving, tolerant and loving person in this whole drama. She is the one feeling bad that she didn't have enough drinks in the house, when Al comes unannounced.\n\nThe fault is in no one, but our stars that cause such PTSDed veterans."

With this film, it's easy to lose those things, it is such a well-crafted work.\n\nBut it is not only the craft that emerges, nor is it the pinpoint perfect performances, nor is it the touching and poignant score--no none of these dominates ones viewing experience. What does is America itself--America in it's purest form, simple, powerful, at times, cruel and indifferent, but always....us. It is the mirror of our own lives, beliefs, and dreams we once held, perhaps still do, that is held up to us, and we are allowed to see ourselves, not as we are, but as we wished to be. America of hope, families, church, and tradition, where all peoples are held as brothers without the burden of a forced and artificial \"ethic of multiculturalism\"; America of \"give the underdog a break,\" (while not being accused of being a socialist); America of good men wet with the sweat of good work, enjoying the freedom given by so many who paid so unflinchingly the ultimate price; indeed, this film presents us with an America that is the very incarnation and essence of the meaning of \"hope,\" the greatest promise of our forefathers, to which they pledged their lives and sacred honor. And each character is faced with the acceptance of that hope. And it is beautiful.\n\nIf there is ever an award or citation of the \"Most American Film\" it must be this masterpiece. See it as an unabashed American, and hope that America may come back to us in this form.\n\nPS - Feb. 17, 2011 - Just found out that this film did NOT make TIME MAGAZINE'S Top 100 Films list. Do we need any more evidence of the stupidity of the mainstream media? Good Lord. But \"Charade,\" did make it. Please."

I really like this movies plot and how it realistically shows the struggles that a lot of veterans face when they return home after being in the military for so long. As someone who studies history I definitely think that this a topic that can be overlooked at times and is something that is not explored as much as it should be. The unfortunate fact is that lots of veterans deal with the problems that are depicted in this movie and even though this movie was made back in 1946, it still has a message that can resonate with a lot of people today. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes World War ll era in history and wants to learn more about the veterans who returned and actually to veterans as well to see how things may have been back then."

Wyler is, arguably, the greatest director ever. He could always get the most out of an actor. This case is no different. Look at Harold Russell, who plays Homer Parrish. Not an actor, but a WWII veteran amputee, Russell went on to win The Best Supporting Actor Oscar and also a special oscar for instilling pride in our service branches. He really pulled it off as Homer. Frederic March was also superb(Oscar winner, Best Actor) as Al Stevens, who comes back to a wife and two kids that have grown up considerably in the last four years. He doesn't recognize them. He also has indelible philosophical differences with his employers, realizing he has changed as well. The key to the picture has to be Fred Derry, played by Dana Andrews. His life probably touches on most people who watch this movie. These three men who fly back home together because they come from the same hometown. Because of that trip, their lives are intertwined forever. There are also a few emotional scenes that rank with the best ever filmed, in my opinion. Your not watching a movie when you view \"The Best Years of Our Lives.\" You are watching life."

For 1946 or so, the entry The Best Years of Our Lives was an interesting drama.\n\nThree guys all going back to the old hometown to see what's changed and to return to their families.\n\nOne guy was married to a blonde floozy and went off to war, quite decorated, and quite shy about talking about his war experiences. His occasional flash-backs and the crush he has on a buddy's daughter, make for some tension. He was a bomber and highly decorated, yet can't make his marriage work and is relegated to the same job he quit: a soda jerk!\n\nAnother is a Navy man, who lost both hands in a fire on a ship. He has \"hooks\" and is pretty versatile with them. Unfortunately in small town USA, people are not as forgiving and easily shocked. His mom sobs that her son is so crippled. His girlfriend actually doesn't mind, but he's too much feeling sorry for himself to notice. This character was hard for me to like, wallowing in self-pity. He did finally snap out of it, though. \uf04a\n\nFinally we have an older guy who is returning to his wife and kids. The wife is played well by Myrna Loy (of Thin Man fame) and her comedic style pops out once in awhile as she plays a straight part. Her daughter falls in love with the airman with the blonde floozy and swears she will break up the marriage and take him for herself. \"Who are you, God?\" intones her father. A\n\nBottom Line: Interesting story on how each man deals with family and how things have changed since they shipped out. Acclimating to a new life is hard, and going into denial through alcohol or wallowing in self-pity just don't work. One of a kind film.\n\nFeatures: Interviews with two actresses, elderly now, express a lot of what was going on with the set, the director and the actors. Quite entertaining.\n\nDirected by William Wyler Writing Credits Robert E. Sherwood ... (screen play)\n\nMacKinlay Kantor ...

The little cameo in the bank where the guy wants the loan to start his farm....what a perfect scene when he thanks Al so gratefully and sincerely. The scene when Fred comes home and sees his wife has been ''entertaining'' another man. How Fred has to swallow his pride and take the humiliation from the other ex-serviceman who's obviously doing well for himself, while HE is struggling to cope. The scene towards the end when Fred's dad is reading the citations for his medals....at that point you're probably thinking Fred's a bit of a waste of space, despite his war record. But this scene really stamps it in your mind that this guy is a HERO, just a real hero who has his weaknesses. My wife and I once seriously fell out when she had the temerity to describe TBYOOL as ''a Saturday afternoon film''. It is a beautiful, beautiful film which, of its day, was also quite a boundary-pusher in terms of the themes it tackled....adultery, an uncaring population greeting returning war heroes, alcoholism, disability. Everyone needs to watch it. Andrew Rigby"

        "review_detailed_main": "'Best Years...' is a classic post-WW2 drama that focuses on the social issues surrounding American soldiers returning home after being off to war for multiple years. When one thinks of that era, most think about the baby-boomer generation, the affluent futures to come, and the rise of the new American superpower that came out almost intact as Europe and Asia were busy rebuilding for many years to come. However, it wasn't all roses and sunshine for these soldiers. They had to become re-acquainted with the civilized world and get their lives back in order, after spending years off-seas fighting Nazis in Europe and Japs in the Pacific.\n\nThis film concerns three such soldiers, including an Army Sergeant Al (Fredric March), Air Force Officer Fred (Dana Andrews), and a warship sailor Homer (Harold Russell), who return home excited but also afraid of what they will find. The three have interesting circumstances, which I won't detail to avoid spoilers. Al had been away from his wife and kids. Fred had his wife, and Homer had a fianc\u00e9e and family. They return to their families with battle scars, both mental and physical, but with hopes of overcoming with a helping hand from their families, friends, and the public. They soon realize what was a joyous dream come true soon becomes a nightmare for each for different reasons. The stories are compelling and an insightful window into the era. The acting is spectacular and genuine by the entire cast. Director William Wyler is meticulous in his attention to detail, depicting each scene and issue sincerely. Cinematography is done right to reflect the realism. Some issues covered are difficult to tackle, but it's masterfully done. Even after 78 years, 'Best Years...' stands the test of time.\n\nWould I recommend this? A resounding yes. It's a must-watch. The film is under 3 hours long, but you never feel it. I agree with IMDB listing it as one of the top 250 movies of all time. I would put it somewhere inside the top 100. It won 7 Oscars including Best Picture in 1947, and I rarely say this, but it's well-deserved (although I prefer Frank Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\")."

        "review_detailed_main": "William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives is deserved in the category of great films. It has an excellent cast headed by Frederick March & Myrna Loy. It has excellent direction & production. It uses more drama than action though it has just enough action to enhance the drama. This is a movie which you get more out of each time you watch it. How Wyler frames this story is classic.\n\nWhat really makes the film great is a story that pulls in a viewer because of it's subject. The story is how did the returning vets of World War 2 deal with their war experiences, & how did it effect them. It runs multiple story lines through more of an ensemble cast than was prevalent in other films of its time. It does everything right.\n\nLater on the closest the Vietnam generation has to this is the film COMING HOME - but this Wyler film is done much better. You really feel like you know the characters in this film. This film deals with how people from several walks of life were dealing with the after war experience.\n\nAmong the excellent story lines is one vet dealing with the loss of his arms in the war and trying to adjust. There is an officer dealing with having to struggle as employers do not count his war experiences as a marketable job skill for peace time. There is a loan officer at a bank and how he is touched by both of these folks & other returning vets.\n\nThere is the scene which seems remote now, but is still haunting, of a vet walking through the grave yard of military planes built for the war parked on a seemingly endless field, being haunted by the images of the equipment and his own war experiences flooding back into his head as he looks at it. In addition to Wyler's Chariot race in 1959's BEN HUR, this scene is to me just as powerful & memorable in this film for a whole set of other reasons.\n\nIf every film were made as well as this one was, I could never leave the theater."

Wyler is original in this aspect and does it extremely well, thanks to the different points of view that come together within the plot.\n\nThe credibility and realism stand out thanks to the tone and the deep look that is exposed in each aspect of the film, an achievement not by coincidence, since the actors work from a very different emotional approach from one another. The best years of our lives is still an important reference in cinema for its way of incorporating elements of everyday reality and using them as a counterpoint in the plots of each character.\n\n\"The best years of our lives is a magnificent tribute to the plight of millions of people as they rejoined post-war life\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Great classic film. All of the performances by the principals are uniformly believable and consistent, with Fredric March and Dana Andrews rounding out the wartime trio who hook up by chance for a flight home to Boone City, a fictional city set in the Midwest. Young viewers probably won't believe the visibility offered by the nose of a B-15 bomber, just like I couldn't get over it when I saw the real thing at the National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center. There, the cockpit and nose section of the Enola Gay (actually a B-29 bomber) is on display, and seeing it, I earned an even greater appreciation and respect for the combat fliers who went to war for their country. Watching the film today, it's surprising how daring director William Wyler was in executing the story. The first example of course was using Harold Russell in a lead role, but you also have themes that were downright shocking in the 1940's. When Peggy Stephenson (Teresa Wright) declares that she's going to cause the divorce of Fred Derry (Andrews) and his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), you can almost hear the gasps of movie patrons back in the day.\n\n9/10."

        "review_title": "A great pre-war drama about the effects of WW II afterward on its veterans.",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is one rather fine and almost 3 hour long epic running drama, that focuses around 3 WW II veterans from the same town, going back home after the war had ended.\n\nIt's a real interesting and subtly made drama, that isn't ever being melodramatic but always realistic and compelling with its themes and emotions. The movie handles some great subjects, especially for its time. You have to consider that this movie got made really just after the war had ended. Yet it already handles some of the themes war WW II veterans and also lots of later war veterans had to deal with. The world, their families and themselves all changed, with brings along some at times devastating effects but also often some hopeful things. They have to pick up their 'normal' lives again, with a job, their wives and the rest of their families. It shows how the veterans were often being treated and looked upon. This isn't just a movie glorifying the WW II veterans but also one that has the guts to be bold and straight-forward, by showing life how it truly is but never without the respect those deserve who all fought in the second world war.\n\nI guess you still have to be an American though to fully appreciate this movie. You could say that this movie is a real Americana one, filled with pride and hope, for and about a generation, that should make American's feel warm from the inside. Not that the movie is being overly patristic or anything, it's just pride in a good and understandable way, that is still best appreciated by American's themselves.\n\nThe movie is being quite epic, mostly due to its long running time. Director William Wyler used its long running time to slowly set up its characters to build up the right themes and emotions for the movie. It makes \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" effective as a genre movie and perhaps still more accessible and less sappy than some of the other similar dramatic movies made during the same decade.\n\nIt's of course also really a real actors movie. Luckily the movie has some great actors in it, such as Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews. Real WW II veteran and amputee Harold Russell attracted the most attention at the time and even took home two Oscar's for his one role in this movie. He received a special award dedicated to him 'for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance'. He lost both of his hands during the war due to exploding TNT during an exercise and ever since used hooks to get around. It's amazing how well he got around with them and how much he still could manage with it, without the help of others. This is mostly what earned him the Oscar because in all honesty I sincerely doubt that he would had won an Oscar otherwise. It's not like he is bad but he just wasn't a real actor anyway and also only appeared in just a few movies throughout his life.\n\nSimply a great genre movie, that also still applies this present day with all of its themes.\n\n8/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember seeing this movie perhaps a couple of decades ago and marveling that a movie with such honest, realistic characters was made in 1946. I made a point of viewing it again recently to see if my first impression held up.\n\nThe bad news is that the actual plot of BEST YEARS veers a bit into soap opera territory. The story is a little mechanical in its attempts to cover as much of the post-WWII experience as possible (and somehow work Hoagy Carmichael into the mix). The good news is that the characters are so damn good that the semi-hokey plot doesn't matter.\n\nThis is a great American movie, remarkable for its realism and lack of sentimentality. Particularly remarkable was Harold Russell, whose portrayal of double-amputee Homer Parrish was believable and very moving. One of my favorite scenes in this movie is the one where Homer is headed to bed, and needs his father to help take off his prosthetic hands and button his pajama top. There is almost no dialogue, and no dramatic swell of the music, just a quiet, honest, matter-of-fact scene.\n\nSome of the details intrigued me. The Stephensons slept together in a double bed--a big no-no in those Hayes-code days--but you never actually saw Mrs. Stephenson there. Other commenters have mentioned here the themes of divorce and domestic discord that were all-but-unheard of at the time.\n\nI love that Myrna Loy played a great supporting role in this drama as Millie Stephenson, AND had played Nora Charles in THE THIN MAN, among my favorite comedies. Clearly, a versatile talent.\n\nOther films have tried to capture the experience of the returning American veteran, but this is probably still the best."

        "review_detailed_main": "After World War II three military men, Al Stevenson (Fredrich March) Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) and Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), return to their lives in Boone City after stints in Europe. Adjusting to life at home isn't as easy as one would think as Homer has lost his hands, Fred goes from being a Captain to being relegated to being a soda jerk in a drug store, and Al goes back to his bank job where he has to turn down loans for fellow former soldiers. As they try to adjust to their new old lives they learn things may never be the same again.\n\nWilliam Wyler was already a famous filmmaker before going into the military for World War II, having made films such as Wuthering Heights, Jezebel, and Dodsworth. Incorporating his own experiences as a combat filmographer into the film, Wyler made what is arguable his most successful film with The Best Years of Our Lives. After it's release it went on to win 7 Academy Awards beating out It's a Wonderful Life for Best Picture, and Harold Russell won not just one but two Academy Awards (one for Best Supporting Actor, and an honorary award \"For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance\"), the only actor to ever win two Academy Awards for the same performance.\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives is a film that has a lot of pertinence in today's world with so many troops overseas making their way back, and it's still the best film on the subject. Wyler's attention to detail, choosing not to make things over lavish as most films in the 1940's did, and to give it more of a documentary flair help give the film more of a real world feel. And while the subject matter might seem like the film would be a darker affair, there are moments that would still make you genuinely laugh out loud, as well as other lighter more tender moments.\n\nThe acting is superb from all involved. The two actors that truly stand out in my mind watching this are Harold Russell and Al Stevenson. Harold Russell, an actual physically disabled military man, shows great depth in his performance as Homer Parrish dealing with love and the notion that he needs to drive his girl away because she deserves better. Al Stevenson, also does a superb job as a former sergeant who feels guilty for having come home to find himself a good job while also dealing with family issues and his feelings toward having to away loans for former GI's who feel they deserve better.\n\nI highly recommend this movie, this is one of those rare perfect movies and to be honest, it deserved it's best picture nod over It's A Wonderful Life. Even with it's ranking on AFI's top 100 films at #37, these days this film is still criminally overlooked and underrated. If you like films dealing with WWII, great dramas, and superb acting, you should definitely give this film a shot.\n\n5/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "It is hard to sum up a movie with as much character, human interest and compassion as this one, which deals with the transition from war to peace by three men who return home to their loved ones and their former lives after World War II. Sometimes called the \"greatest generation\", the men and women in the movie are a sampling of that demographic who are now passing into history. This movie leaves you with a great sense of satisfaction, not laughs or escapism but takes life as it was for many families and handles it with honesty and intelligence.\n\nTo start with, the main character performed by Frederick March tries to balance his conscience and responsibilities in a time when change meant moral dilemmas that were not easy to resolve, whether in personal or professional lives. His steadfast wife is Myrna Loy, who is understanding and sometimes critical but fully engaged in his life.\n\nAll three men in this movie and their loved ones were faced with challenges. In each case, they forced themselves or one another to face up to the task. These involved physical disability, personal relationships, unemployment, and making the transition from the battlefield to the workplace.\n\nThis movie has humour and fun as well as serious issues. Frederick March's character sets the tone. He doesn't moralize or patronize. He plunges into the fray...advising, chastising, getting angry, laughing or boozing. The other men respect him and he helps bring out the best in them. Dana Andrews, as the war hero whose return to civilian and personal life was almost humiliating, was excellent in his role as was Harold Russell (a non-professional actor) who went from big man in town to double amputee. Theresa Wright and Cathy O'Donnell played the women who salvaged their self-esteem.\n\nWhen all is said and done, these are flawed but good men whose courage is never in doubt. They had the good fortune to find strong women to lean on. With their courage and determination, they are able to move on in their lives, however changed it might be. To me this will always be a great movie. Despite changed times, the movie still has much to say."

It has a wonderful story that seems true to life and the characters give such insight into what many Americans must have gone through when the war ended and they had to pick up their \"normal\" life. I read that the dress Virginia Mayo wore to the night club was actually bought off the rack, rather than being made by the studio, just to give the authentic flavor needed.\n\nI love this movie for another reason, how well it shows what everyday life was like in the middle 1940s. Being a child of the 50s myself, I recognized the small kitchen style of the Upper class apartment from my grandmother's house. I saw the middle class neighborhood homes reflected in the house I grew up in, and recognized the lower class home Dana Andrew's character lived in from the homes of some of my own friends who grew up in lower class homes.\n\nTo me, this movie is a national treasure. Not only because it reminds us, as so many have said, of what our military heroes give up to serve this country during any war, but of the day to day depiction of how life was in the past for white Americans."
