        "review_detailed_main": "They rarely make a film with true talent and substance in Bollywood these days. A lot of Bollywood has just become a senseless over-production of childish comedy, over the top action and sleazy \"item songs\". No one pays attention to direction, acting, storyline and dialogues anymore. But Hamari Adhuri Kahani has ALL the ingredients of a genuine film that will touch your heart. Emran Hashmi displays one of his best acting performances in a romantic and emotional role. He has successfully played a character that you would usually expect from someone like Shah Rukh Khan. Vidya Balan is equally impressive. She convincingly makes you believe that she is a woman stuck in the situation portrayed in the film. Yet the overpowering strength of the film is the fresh storyline, powerful dialogues and gripping direction. The connection with the audiences is so strong that it really makes you feel for the characters and will almost push you to tears. The songs and background music of the film are the pleasant icing on the cake. If you want to appreciate a great romantic film that will truly appeal to your emotions, PLEASE go and watch this movie! You will not be disappointed!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all let me tell you that in the afternoon show of this movie, which doesn't have any Khan or Kumar in it, the house was full. Yeah, it's not convincing but it is true. The whole theater was full, especially with the youngsters. This clearly shows that Music hit, to Movie hit! Mohit Suri is popular for making films which are more related to the youngsters and especially the couples. The songs become popular before the movie release. He is the same director who made Ashiqui2 which became super hit without any stars and Ek Villain which collected 100cr at the box office without any storyline. So he rejoins the Bhatt camp and convince Mahesh Bhatt to write the story. Because of the family project, Emran Hashmi and Rajkumar Rao had been finalized for the respected roles. And Vidya Balan is selected because of the suggestion of Mahesh Bhatt. And then first of all, they create the soulful soundtrack. They even bought the song Zaroori Tha from Rahat Fateh Ali Khan for the better success of the album. Thus the film began to start! Story line is not refreshing. Old wine has been served in new bottle. But, the stars make the bottle a worthy drink. Undoubtedly, everyone will talk about Emran Hashmi after the movie. Though Vidya Balan is also fantastic and Rajkumar Rao also acts well. But, he is not convincing as a terrorist, or as an old man or as the husband of Vidya Balan. Vidya looks perfect for the role. But, it is Emran who makes the audience cry, who makes the audience to feel sad for him through his eyes, especially where tears come out from them. Music is outstanding. The best song that suits in it is Zaroori Tha. Title track is awesome. Jeet Ganguly once again proved that he can give the best! Last paragraph of that song is playing in the climax where Rao throws ashes in the garden, is the best scene with full emotions. Hasi and Hamnawa are also listenable. Dialogues are another plus point. The film is majorly dependent on Hashmi's powerful dialogues. Cinematography is as usual as we had seen in Suri's previous movies. Story looks good till interval, even after post interval, too. But, I don't convince with the climax and its twist. I'm hoping for something good for all, but, Suri only loves not so happy ending. This film shows the true love between two persons, so the Girlfriend-Boyfriend type people may not like this film. I'm saying so because I've watched some faces after the movie. On the whole, you can watch it once if you are a fan of Emran Hashmi or even Mohit Suri. I think it's better than Mohit's last 3-4 releases. But than also only Emran steals the show. This is his first U certified film, so family audience can also go for it. Hamari Adhuri Kahani can make only one difference and that is the return of Emran Hashmi!"

It is not some fun, masti, timepass movie for so called modern people who find everything traditional regressive. It shows the real situation not some make belief happy world. Yes, it is dialogue heavy and little filmy but that is expected of an emotional love story. Brilliant. Watch it."

She can get into any character very easily..she looks beautiful in the sarees. At some point you will predict the story, even then you will enjoy watching the movie for its simplicity in depicting this sensitive story. Kudos to the music director jeet ganguly for melodious songs which go very well with the movie..somehow all Imran hashmi movies end up getting awesome sound tracks. Hmmm.. The title song steals your heart.. Arijit Singh's magical voice makes u want to hear that song again and again. Good direction and all in all a nice movie..

The music is soothing, it brings a tear or two. I still have the effect in me. Honestly i wish this story was published as a book. It would have contained a lot of insight and more weight. But still, Mohit Suri has done a hell of a job. One of the recent best emotional movie I'v watched this is. Some of the scenes would just pinch a muscle in the heart, thanks to the music and contents of the scene. Bollywood is improving, what with the kinds of films like YJHD. Even though the ending of Ashiqui 2 had me in disappointment, the story telling and acting put up in this movie just made me register for IMDb and write a review. Emraan Hashmi, with his love-felt looks, brings out the pain of a person who hadn't felt love, and covered by the money he has. Rajkumar Rao is outstanding. I like his movies. His acts are subtle. Brings out the character and hasn't failed to do so in the movie. He makes us cry with his innocence in the 'real time' of the story. Vidya Balan is cute. I'd rather tell sweet. Conveys the plot perfectly. Overall it is a must watch for movie buffs who wouldn't want a movie to end. Thank You."

        "review_detailed_main": "From the ancient time period, our society has been male dominated where a wife is considered not more than a private property of his husband. Still the values haven't changed much and women are still tormented, beaten by their husbands. Such stories patronizing womanhood have been common in '80s social dramas. Story-wise the film looks a bit dated, but a tight script, nice dialogues, and a good performance from Vidya Valan makes \"Hamari Adhuri Kahani\" gripping. In other words, the film gets a modern treatment to an old story through beautiful sets and nice visuals. Emraan Hashmi as a business tycoon was a miscast whereas Rajkumar Rao attracts through his presence. A weakness persisting in the story was the inadequate elaboration of the dominance of the husband and retaliation of the wife , which was the main theme of the film. Instead, the romance between Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Valan gets most of the footage. However, few melodramatic sequences and a tragic end of the film do touch you at times for which the film is likable.\n\nRating: 2 stars out of 4"

        "review_detailed_main": "Hamari Adhuri Kahani, directed by Mohit Suri, the magician of love, and written by Mahesh Bhatt, the creator of emotions, miserably fails to ignite that intensity.\n\nWhat I felt after asking some viewers at the theater: characterization part is completely missing. There is no bond, no attachment, no feeling for any of the characters by the audience.\n\nHowever, having said that, the weakest link in this romantic ultra- melodrama is logic. There are huge, massive loopholes in the script, and often I was amazed how they can justify that. The timeline of the movie, the gadgets used and the over usage of tears; everything is done without any research into reality.\n\nThe plot is pretty simple: Married Vidya Balan falls for Imran Hashmi, the billionaire. However, Rajkummar Rao, her husband does not want to let go of her.\n\nWith a a triangle love story, there can be immense possibilities; if you add the Naxalite angle or of you include Dubai as a location or the office romance thing. But, the director decided to get stuck with the age old formulas; in fact, those mangalsutra sequences and all tears for the 'pati' and 'suhag' stuff made me cringe in disbelief.\n\nI was confused: why they have to go back to history, the previous blockbusters to ensure success in 2015? Why are they so afraid to try out something new, something unconventionally romantic. The love, and the purpose of love both have changed.\n\nFortunately, this was the first movie where Emran doesn't kiss; and unfortunately, this was the worst movie of Vidya I ever saw. She performed amazingly well, and carried out the clich\u00e9' dialogues in the most honest manner, but even her sparkling blue big eyes failed to save this movie.\n\nI had that sinking, depressing feeling all through the movie; as if love is only a mirror back of pain and hurt and stuff. It neither arouses empathy nor any false hope; it simply narrates an unfortunate story, in the most uncreative manner.\n\nAvoid it."

Well, I don't know why, but I chose Hamari Adhuri Kahaani to watch over Jurassic World(I'll watch that too, later :p), and Oh Boy! Did I made the right decision.\n\nThe movie is just fantastic, ek villain didn't impressed me at all(the songs were the ones which dragged it's so called 'success') But Aashiqui 2 was kind of good with some major plot holes, & the same goes with this one. I'm not implying that, Hamari Adhuri Kahani is one of a kind, It has many clich\u00e9 moments, but the way Mohit opted to narrate the story, caught me into it.\n\nThis movie is purely performance driven. Vidya Balan stole my heart with her innocence but I've been a fan of her acting skills since Kahaani anyways. Rajkummar Rao delivering a top notch performance And Emraan Hashmi stole the show, I'm not gonna publicly admit that i cried every time he had tears in his eyes, I'm not gonna do that :p\n\nAll in all guys, this movie is packed with a hardhitting story, with an amazing climax (ignore the one's who are criticizing it, watch it for yourself & then judge it), the atmosphere (locations) serves as an eyecandy including the songs which gave me goosebumps, literally every time when the tittle track went on.\n\nThe movie is made for a Silver Screen so do watch it there. Worth ever penny, you'll love it :)"

Its brooding with sadness & although its never entirely convincing, this story still has a few moments, that evoke a certain emotion within you. Its flawed, but not without its pluses!\n\n'Hamari Adhuri Kahaani' Synopsis: Five years after the mysterious disappearance of her husband, a woman becomes romantically involved with a wealthy hotelier and together they confront her past.\n\n'Hamari Adhuri Kahaani' is a tragedy & hence the film mostly deals with the downs of life. The main characters are finely written, but they are so sad beneath, that after a point, you're exhausted. No, this isn't a depressing story, but at its heart, its an incomplete love saga about 2 people who just can't be one.\n\nMahesh Bhatt & Shagufta Rafiq's Screenplay is impressive in parts, but lags otherwise. While the first-hour moves a slow-pace, the second-hour slips into full on tragedy mode. However, the final act is unconvincing. The culmination, especially, doesn't work. The Writing isn't bad, but it could've been stronger & more convincing. Mohit Suri's Direction is decent. Cinematography is alright. Editing is loose at times. Mithoon, Jeet Ganguly & Ami Mishra's Songs are wonderful. Raju Singh's Background Score is excellent, as well.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Vidya Balan is earnest in her portrayal of a women torn between a broken marriage & a relationship she can't accept due to her morales. Though her character is regressive, Balan makes her believable, despite the Script's loopholes. Emraan Hashmi is brilliant & also the scene-stealer. He is mature, subdued & absolutely perfect as the sympathetic hero. Rajkumar Rao has a small role, but he leaves a mark as the hard-to-love husband. Namit Das is passable. Prabal Panjabi & Narendra Jha are adequate. Suhasini Mulay is terrific a cameo.\n\nOn the whole, 'Hamari Adhuri Kahaani' is a so-so fare."

Mohit Suri's latest makes sure that its story reached the Bollywood audience. So we have this.\n\nAn orthodox and abusive sadist of a man (Rao) marries a tubby, young woman (Balan), injures her both mentally and physically, plants his seed, and a year later, goes on an unexpected outing, leaving her to stay on her own with her newborn. Five years later, a success- oriented and priggish businessman (Hashmi), who otherwise has a good heart, meets this destitute woman and showers his love upon her, also hiring her has his florist like he is going to build a country out of flowers. In other words, the film is about a man (the good guy) who sincerely loves the wife of another fellow (the bad guy), and after an episode of dramaturgy, goes on to unite the original couple. How convenient.\n\nNow we know what the story is, and lovers may be able to relate and rejoice with it, but the loose screenplay and terrible writing spoils what could have been a genuine representation of true love, or whatever that means. Fortunately, it is better than Ishqedarriyan.\n\nDirection is also to be blamed where three top actors of the industry are simply wasted. Hashmi, in an out-of-the-typecast role, bluffs while his co-actor Rao puts up an average act of being a monster. Balan just gets away with her dismal performance. I sat up on my seat when I saw nose-jobbed Amala Akkineni (of Pushpak fame) in a cameo. Tonite I am going to wonder what drove her to do the bit.\n\nAlthough, I must say I am impressed with some of the dialogs which were quite romantic and generally true. Otherwise, the film is filled with people talking nonsense, shedding tears like their eye sockets are connected to the Niagara Falls. How a selfish man suddenly turns generous is what largely affects the dramatic closure of the story. All said and done, this tragedy is not heart-breaking, but heart-aching.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Hamari Adhuri Kahani has a story that has all the ingredients mixed and placed in the mold. The makers just forgot to bake it.\n\nRATING: 3 stars out of 10. Should skip.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

Music is already hit and love to hear in cinema hall. Some dialogues are awesome and you'll love them more when they come from Emraan's mouth with awesome expressions.\n\nEmraan Hashmi displays one of his best acting performances in a romantic and emotional role. He has successfully played a character that you would usually expect from someone like Shah Rukh Khan. Vidya Balan is equally impressive. She convincingly makes you believe that she is a woman stuck in the situation portrayed in the film. With a broad spectrum of emotions, Rajkummar Rao wows you with his power- packed performance.\n\nThe only factor which will go against the film will be its script. The script is out-dated and filled with too much of drama which might contribute to some dull moments.\n\nBut still, the connection with the audiences is so strong that it really makes you feel for the characters and will almost push you to tears. Watch this one if you are moved by sad love stories. The good performances are an added bonus. My ratings - 6.5/10"

Take everyone in your family to watch this movie. The movie has very good story plot. It's not an illogical movie plot. The best part of the movie was that there limited songs as stupid movies have many songs to fool audience. This movie had 2-3 songs only at places where the scene demanded it and your heart wanted it. Mohit suri could not do a better job at directing an emotional movie that is universally rated with Emraan Hashmi in it. Go with a positive mind and you will truly appreciate this movie."

Enter the rich business tycoon, played by Emraan Hashmi, who falls for Vasudha with dark past.\n\nMohit Suri, who is credited with films like Woh Lamhe, Ashiqui 2 and Ek Villain, does not do justice to the area of direction this time. Written by Mahesh Bhatt, this one is coupled with lousy direction , insensible screenplay and predictable boring story gives you a headache which you never asked especially from actors like Vidya Balan and Rajkumar Rao, forget about Emraan Hashmi. The main drama unfolds in the later reel which again is intolerable with screenplay written by a school kid. Dialogues are over-top and amateur. Imagine a 5 year old kid say about his father \"Papa sirf kaam karte hain... mere liye time kahan hain unke pass\". Art direction and Cinematography is excellent. Songs are tuneful. Vidya Balan convinces you with her matured performances. Emraan Hashmi as usual is wooden in expression. Rajkumar Rao is wasted.\n\nOverall, a pathetic film in every sense. Poor- 1/5"

He just could not pull it off. Vidya Balan was okay but what could she do with a story like this? Rajkumar Rao acted fairly well, but again the plot put it all to vain.\n\nSeveral other minor flaws such as the valley of flowers scene incongruously stuck in the midst of the Bastar jungles, did nothing to help the overall lackadaisical plot.

It did nothing to help the movie, other than to perhaps attract a few viewers from the UAE!\n\nWatch this on TV if you must, and if you can sit through the entire film."

You see worst makeup in the beginning of the film of aged person. There is a scene where woman touches a man's feet for showing her gratitude towards him but you will laugh at this scene the way and place is comes, when makers must have been thought it's epitome of emotions. Old lame excuses for love blooming, like something has put in my eyes, Man looking at woman through the center mirror of car, recalling her through scent of flowers. Woman runs for her Mangalsutra, when she feels tender emotions towards another man. Deeya goes off to symbolize the danger on man!!! You will laugh on the dialogue like \"Ye banjaran kaun hai jo apni si lagti hai?\" Gone are the days for such cheesy scenes and dialogues. Enough is enough. We have seen all this innumerable times on big and small screen. Tear flows down mostly but emotions have been conveyed rarely. A person, who has achieved grand success in his life should have been confident but he always keeps his hand in pocket or cross fold his arms, which shows lack of confidence. Performance wise fine actor like Vidya Balan or Rajkumar Rao are wasted. Emraan Hashmi is OK. Songs are melodious."

        "review_title": "Two intense performances cannot save an otherwise absurd & badly written film.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Giving the Bhatts an advantage of their recent success stories, majorly achieved due to their proved music sense and the low-cost model they have been working upon, its quite possible that they might not incur heavy losses in this poor HAMARI ADHURI KAHANI too as per business terms. But if one talks about direction, characterization, execution and the writing in particular using some honest words, then this is one of the worst offerings from the team in the recent times (post another pathetic dud MR. X).\n\nPersonally, I don't even feel it was entirely written by Mahesh Bhatt (as publicized) since it has such silly, shabby and confusing story progressions that actually doesn't fit in with the name of Bhatt as a writer. Yes, the film begins with some intense sequences having a clear MB stamp dealing with a father, son and the mother, but then gets scattered so childishly that one cannot believe it has been really penned down by the same person we know by the name of Mahesh Bhatt, who gave us films such as Saaransh, Janam, Arth, Daddy, Swayam, Sir, Naam, Tamanna, Zakham and many more specifically written around emotional outbursts in broken relationships.\n\nTo give you some specific reasons for my above assumptions, What can you say about a script telling you a story of a single mother of 7-8 years old kid, left alone by her missing husband (since 1 year after the marriage), getting involved in a fresh affair and leaving for Dubai to work, without taking along her only dependent kid for some undisclosed reason? In fact its so weird to even assume that a script revolving around a single mother, features the kid in only few of its opening sequences and then again towards the climax, not mentioning him even once in the middle section when the mother is stepping into a new phase of life with a rich hotelier. Now how could Mahesh Bhatt even approve it, making every single character in the script look like a dumb, stupid person knowing nothing about what ought to be his or her first priorities of life to be precise?\n\nMoreover every key person in the story coming up with his own flashback after a while makes the narration heavy, boring and stale. Plus few absurd moments simply make you ask that, Is it the same film having those emotionally engaging promos promising a worth watching product from the Bhatts?\n\nFor instance, as Vidya's missing husband (Rajkumar) returns (who is a terrorist as per the police records), he easily gets into his old house and hides as there is no police surveillance around the residence of a wanted terrorist. But above all, meeting his wife after many years, he is not even concerned to ask about his only son and then fast gets into a weird revenge mode (partially making you recall the basic plot of SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY and numerous Hindi movies made on the its theme unofficially). Besides the script in its climax (issuing bizarre death sentences to its lead characters), once again refuses to give any importance to the 'Parenting' aspect of the storyline making you laugh instead of cry putting it bluntly.\n\nBeing an uninteresting drag throughout after making a fine start, HAMARI ADHURI KAHANI doesn't impress with its soundtrack too with only the title song making a decent impact on the listeners due to its relatable lyrics (since everyone has some kind of Adhuri Kahani in his or her young past). Probably that's the reason the Bhatts had to buy an extra Rahat Fateh Ali Khan track from his private album to add into the film deliberately. So no credits for that good song can be given to the Bhatts.\n\nThe script full of all seen before, heavy melodrama fails to take any advantage from its otherwise fine background score and cinematography, mainly due to many badly written dialogues ruining the entire scene like \"Mere Ghar Ka Choolha\u0085\u0085...\", \"Arey, Yeh Banjaaran Kaun Hai?\" and more. Also the lazy, illogical & half-baked characterization doesn't allow the actors to reach their viewers hearts ever in the film's 130 minutes of duration.\n\nTo give the two key performers their deserving due, Vidya Balan tries really hard right from her first scene itself, but her character developments mostly remain dumb and highly questionable hampering the overall impact of the intense act severely. Similarly Rajkumar Rao too tries to deliver his best in the short role but doesn't get the much required support from his confusingly written role heading nowhere. And talking about Emraan, I honestly cannot recall when he acted differently in a film other than SHANGHAI directed by Dibaker Bannerji. As a result, once again he remains the same as seen in his earlier films making no visible effort to somehow do it differently. However it was indeed a pleasant surprise to see one of my favourite actresses Amla back on screen playing Emraan's mother.\n\nIn all HAMARI ADHURI KAHANI doesn't turn out to be anything even closer to the ones written by the exceptional filmmaker a couple of decades back. In other words, it can easily be rated as a badly conceived film that evidently couldn't express the basic idea in the mind of its reputed writer, for which everyone stands equally responsible in its entire team, including the one and only Mahesh Bhatt."

Sure Mahesh Bhatt was struggling with his old writing skills.\n\nTitle song was good but doesn't make sense by playing it through out the whole movie.\n\nRajkumar's appearance was a waste. His dialogs were less than his hauling.\n\nEmraan could've done much better.\n\nVidya's acting was shocking.\n\nI'll blame Mohit for their bad performance.\n\nThough I liked the scene at Kolkata,\n\nA letdown movie."

It is a very rare film which overlooks the simple theme of two bachelors falling in love and making their love to end in a marriage facing so many troubles. This film brings you the perfect picture of how complex love can be. Love is not marriage and you do not know where you will meet your love which makes you feel that you love. Even if it happens you may be in a position where you cannot love.\n\nIt is a masterpiece of discussing those rare complexities of love. It is a complete different theme discussed in a bollywood film which makes it very special. The music and dialogues are very powerful that makes you feel the same feeling what arav and vasuda felt right at the moment. It was a film which feels to you and at the same time gives you or educate you above the deepest complexities of love and human interaction. A must watch film for every person who has ever felt the feeling of love."

Emraan has still a long way to go as an actor and just could not match up to the lead woman in the movie. The way it ended, should have moistened the eyes of an average chick-flick lover, but it certainly even failed on that count. I can't go with more than 5/10 for this one..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hamari Adhuri Kahaani is a film that makes the audience suffer as much as its characters. Its a distressing experience which you will either sleep through or it will end up inducing a headache. The story of a miserable love triangle with cringe-worthy dialogues and monotonous characters is what we are missing in Bollywood, isn't it great! The sad looking drama is pretentiously boring and synthetic. Instead of feeling sympathetic towards the characters I felt like laughing thinking how exaggerated the emotions were. What is more painful, is that it wastes the talents of some really good actors. Vidya Balan and Emraan Hashmi try their best but couldn't save this sunken ship. Rajkumar Rao was the best and convinces us with the sick character he plays. The only silver lining in this drivel was the title track sung beautifully by Arijit Singh and it induces more emotions than the film itself. Without that song the climax wouldn't have been heartfelt and much better than the rest of the film. I think one should just jump to the last 20 minutes skipping the rest of the film and having a much emotionally satisfying experience. Complete waste of time.\n\nRATING: [1/5]"

Vidya Balan is equally impressive. She convincingly makes you believe that she is a woman stuck in the situation portrayed in the film.

No matter what as a girl you have to live with him.I loved the movie however there are some falls into it.\n\n1.She should have taken a stand with the person who can take her out from all her pain and sorrow that she has got till now rather than supporting him she was doing all possible foolishness to support her husband. 2. He had exploit her in every possible manner and also he has become selfish that he can't see her happiness being with the other person who love her like anything. 3.Her husband ruined her life he should have told her to settle down and live her life happily with the person she loves.\n\nThe writers would have given a chance to a lady who has suffered so much to live happily. I am not happy with the ending as well they would have made like this that her husband realizes and he united them.\n\nBut overall its worth to watch and you can connect with this movie automatically."

This movie makes you believe in love and humanity. The story of this movie is very heart touching and unique. I suggest everyone must watch and also rate and review.

        "review_detailed_main": "To become an immortal classic, it is a mandate that every love story has to have a tragic ending and one of the lovers making the ultimate sacrifice to prove their love or both of them. It has been happening since the era of \"ek dujhe ke liye\" and even \"Titanic\" is a classic example. When Mahesh Bhatt announced \"HAMARI ADHURI KAHANI\" and advertised it as based on a true story of his grand parents, little did we expect that we would be an audience to a movie with a terrific screenplay about star crossed lovers who are not exactly in their teens.\n\nThe movie begins with the death of one of the protagonists and the events which happen shortly afterward. A diary which reveals a story of a star crossed romance.....\n\nVasuda (Vidya Balan) is a married woman and a single mother, whose husband Hari (Raj Kumar Rao) is apparently gone missing from half a decade. She is a florist in a 5 star Hotel and one day ends up saving the owner of the hotel Aarav (Emrran Hashmi) from an eminent fire threat, which is later revealed to be a kind of false alarm created by Aarav to test the efficiency of the staff.\n\nImpressed by Vasuda and her Arum Lillies, Aarav offers her a job in his Dubai hotel, which she refuses as she is tied up to her family. Vasuda accepts the offer soon after when she learns that her husband is now a part of a terrorist group which killed a group of American Tourists in cold blood.\n\nOnce in Dubai, Sparks fly and the florist and the hotel owner get into a torrid romance and they both travel back to India to enable Aarav to meet Saanjh (Vasuda's son) and to get a divorce arranged for Vasuda.\n\nIt is here that Vasuda runs into her husband Hari who is in a very bad shape and reveals that he is not a terrorist and he has been framed. When he learns that his wife is having an affair, the MCP gets enraged and walks out and gets arrested by the waiting cops.\n\nVasuda runs to Aarav for help who decides to go to Basthar (the place where hari was framed) to procure evidence proving him to be innocent.\n\nThe movie has a perfect cast, Emraan as the love lorn rich man Aarav Ruparel is impressive and excels in the romantic scenes as well as the emotional scenes.\n\nVidya Balan as Vasuda is perfect and the 7 minute monologue delivered by her towards the end of the film is classic remainder of what a perfect actress she is and yes the speech does raise a lot of questions in our mind, mostly criticizing our rotten customs which are hell bent on snatching a women's freedom.\n\nThe movie belongs to Rajkumar Rao, his performance as the male chauvinist Husband is classic. The scene where he discovers his wife is having an affair and the scene where his wife fights back are perfect example of what a fine actor he is.\n\nThe surprise packet is Amala Akkineni who plays Aarav's mother and her cameo is responsible for a significant twist in the film and also she has the title song picturized on her.\n\nMusic by Raju Singh is soothing and most of the songs prepare you for the tragic ending the movie is heading for, which in fact is a unique accomplishment.\n\nStory by Mahesh Bhatt is perfect and the screenplay gives it a classic approach by using the Arum Lillies as a Macguffin. Whenever Arum Lillies appear in the movie, the screenplay warns us of an eminent danger or a significant twist in the movie.\n\nDirection by Mohit Suri is exemplary and he leaves no stone unturned in manipulating your emotional chords . The only confusing fact is the time-line of the movie, it is not clear whether the opening scenes are a present day occurrence, because if they are, then the main story should have taken place sometime in 1994-95, and use of cell phones and laptops and skype is little too difficult to digest for that period and if the opening scene is set in the future, well! Then the director sure has a dark vision of India's future where we still have those buses in poor condition and kaccha roads......and a farm of Arum Lillies in Chattisgarh is taking cinematic liberties a bit too far.\n\nWell! Minus the few hiccups, the movie has the quality of becoming a classic in the distant future, and yes it was little ahead of its time.\n\nWatch this movie, if you are into star-crossed romances and want a change of scenario from the same old Bollywood routine.\n\nI would give it a 4 star for a 5 rating........."

Whereas I wasn't too impressed by 'Aashiqui 2' (2013), neither too fascinated by 'Ek Villain' (2014), but I have to admit that both still had an element of giving an immense feel of the pain of love, which again was down to the wonderful music and the constant running of very touching background music throughout the all three films.\n\nI have always believed that more than anything else, a tragic love story needs emotions that are able to connect with the people watching, it truly had that. The performance by Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Balan were outstanding I felt, so was Rajkummar Rao's. This was in fact amongst the very best tragedy films that I watched in my life.\n\nAnd so I sit to wait for Mohit Suri to come up with another one....."

I skipped this movie in 2015 for its negative reviews, but something in my mind told me to watch this movie because of the actors. Sheer brilliance by Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Balan. A must watch for Emraan Hashmi fans!!! By the way you will only understand this movie if you have ever fallen in love. Those people who don't have emotions will find this movie boring.\n\nThis movie brought tears to my eyes and goosebumps. Hats of to Mohit Suri for his directorial brilliance and blending of music in this romantic story.\n\nLoved this romantic movie after Ashiqui 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can still recall crying throughout the entire movie, even though I was only a teenager when I first watched it. And I still have a heavy heart when I see the movie. Every time I watch Vasudha and Aarav's love, it kills me not only because of how awful their circumstances were but also because of my rage at realizing that they could never be together. I am aware that the story of a rich man from a poor family becoming richer and falling in love with a typical poor woman was rather clich\u00e9, but the performances were simply lovely. Despite the fact that I am a hopeless romantic, I do know what makes a good movie. They could have just let Vasudha and Aarav be together, but they chose not to do so because not all love stories end happily. We always anticipate a happy ending in a Bollywood drama, but that isn't always the case; most of the time, we don't receive what we want or wish. True love is imperfect yet it is just so beautiful."

The music is even more amazing when watching the movie. It really enhances the scenes and the romance. I am very impressed by the beautiful flute and full orchestra complete with violins and harp.\n\nThis movie is full of romance and yearning. The movie was so good that it moved quickly.\n\nI suggest to enhance your viewing and do not understand Hindi, listen to the music with English translation. This movie got a point off for not translating the Hindi into English while singing. It is important overall to understand what these songs meanings are."
