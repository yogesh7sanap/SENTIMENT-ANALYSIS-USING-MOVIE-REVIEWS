        "review_detailed_main": "Knowing the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009) has been made in a sort of staged documentary style, similar to the kind of movies often seen on documentary channels (e.g. NatGeo), however without a narrator so common in documentaries, and including well-known actors (Richard Gere, Sarah Roemer and Joan Allen), making it more suitable for theatrical distribution.\n\nBefore my last year's visit to Tokyo I've been unaware of the true-life story this movie is based upon. In time an occasion came up to meet a friend in Shibuya city, contemporary center of Tokyo's youth culture (shopping, fashion, nightlife...), and that's how I've learned about the popular local meeting point for all Tokyoites, the Hachik\u014d Akita dog statue just outside of Shibuya Train Station, but the real story behind it has been still eluding me ever since. After seeing this movie, and some additional research on the web, all pieces have fallen into place.\n\nIn retelling the story of common bonding between the dog and its owner, so usual that it comes so natural, film is moving at slow pace, following events of an ordinary life, though not without occasional comedic and dramatic overtones. Even past the dramatic highpoint, when common acts of affection and loyalty evolve towards such an unheard-of faithfulness and ultimate devotion, pace of the storytelling does not change, relying primarily on fine details and emotional build-up. Of course, this might not attract everybody, providing that majority of movie audience today is highly dependent on fast paced, action packed scenes, getting thrills from 3D CG stylized ambiance and suspense, high volume amplitudes and aggressive, often rude highlights of any other nature. However, for those who can do without it, and keep alive their interest even in a simple story, who won't shy away from emotional involvement (as if this can be controlled), they shall easily find themselves consumed by its mere beauty and warmth. Usual man's-best-friend story, spiced with an intriguing yet inspiring detail, shall leave you a bit sad, inevitably pensive, but ultimately delighted. Even more so after the reading of the real-life epilogue."

One of the things that sets this movie apart from the other movies that involve animals is how they stuck to reality instead of throwing in some a-little-hard-to-believe elements here and there just to make it more entertaining.\n\nSometimes they show things through Hachi's eyes as opposed to human eyes, which helps you relate to him and understand how he felt and what he thought then, as well as emphasizes that Hachi is the main character of the movie.\n\nThis is not just a kids' movie. In the end everyone including myself was crying because we were so moved. It is a must-see."

Based on a true story, this film was shot mostly in Woonsocket, Rhode Island at a historic old train station. Beautifully shot and edited. The film runs less than 2-hours. The film generally adheres to the actual true story of a dog in Japan. The dog became a national treasure and a monument was erected to honor him."

        "review_title": "Surprisingly better than the original",
        "review_detailed_main": "Having now seen and reviewed) the original 1987 Hachiko Monogatari I have come back to this remake with fresh eyes and an upwardly revised opinion. While I still believe this movie in no way reaches the true potential of the \"story\" I think it at least matches and may even exceed the quality of the original.\n\nPerhaps of greatest surprise to me are the choices the director made in what he took from and what he rejected from the original story. He has moved the story from 1920's Tokyo to 2000's small town America, and this is not an unreasonable choice. However once the link with the original Japanese story has been so fundamentally severed the world is your oyster as far as story details go so having made that choice it does seem a little perverse to make the dog not just Japanese but an Akita, as in the original. The essence of Hachiko is essentially a love story between a dog and his master, and it matters not one whit if they are in Japan or America, if the master is a Professor of agricultural engineering or of music, or a street cleaner for that matter. It does not matter if the dog is an Akita, a Pekinese or a Great Dane. What is pivotal is the portrayal of a credible relationship between the dog and his master, and to achieve this the casting of both man and dog is absolutely paramount. The Akita is a magnificent animal but if these two movies are any indication it has a stoic personality that presents a challenge to a filmmaker who has only 90 minutes to bring the character to emotional life. Presumably the Japanese market for whom the original was intended knows this personality and compensated for it. In this American version the director cunningly introduces a Japanese character who is able to inform the viewer of the Akita's character, which somewhat mitigates and explains the dog's relatively passive behaviour, but nevertheless it still would have been nice to see a greater level of visible connection between the dog and his master.\n\nAs I indicated in my other review the conundrum of this story is how to present it without inferring at least some hint of abandonment on the part of the master's family. I think this version does a better job of this than the original, and certainly the character of the Master's daughter and her partner are far more sympathetic than the original, although there is still some lingering unease as to how a dog can remain essentially a stray within the community for a decade or so. In both movies the subplot of neither wife not really wanting the dog is totally unnecessary and simply wastes precious time that should have been devoted to developing the personalities and relationships of the dog his master.\n\nRichard Gere is not called upon to do much before he pops off but never the less does a great job. He presents a far more consistently sympathetic character than his counterpart in the original, although to be fair his Japanese counterpart is saddled with having to exist in the less relaxed context and culture of 1920's Japan. It has to be said the director's conception of a music professor as someone who plays music with all the sophistication of three blind mice for beginner piano, and who supervises very strange dances is more than a little naive. We also have to suspend credibility in the first 10 minutes in which Hachiko makes his way from Japan to a small American town \u2013 like people always send puppies randomly half way across the world in a rickety kennel with no documentation, no quarantine, no nothing, right? And they are routinely dumped on top of carts of luggage and accidentally dropped by people who seem to be deaf and blind...why did they even bother with this part of the story? This a waste of time that could have been better used to develop the man/dog relationship.\n\nIn summary a solid if not magnificent re-telling of the Hachiko story and probably as good as can be achieved while sticking to the Japanese framework."

The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)\n\nThe main characters never \"take flight\" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.\n\nHachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.\n\nA must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages."

I can't remember the last time I cried during a movie - but towards the last 15 minutes of the movie I didn't only cry - I cried from the depth of my heart, not out of sadness but from a much deeper sense of realization the power of true love and how it can manifest itself.

        "review_detailed_main": "I came to know of the Hachiko story from one of the film screenings during the Japanese Film Festival more than two years ago, and having visited Tokyo, who would not have heard and noticed that one of the exits of the busy Shibuya station had one exit named after the famous dog? Why an American version of the story would be made baffles me, if not only to tell of yet another dog story following the likes of the Lassies and the Marleys that because dog is Man's best friend there will always be a ready market for it?\n\nDirected by Swede Lasse Hallstrom, at least there's the sensibility to still ensure that Hachiko remains Japanese, only for it to be accidentally transported from a Japanese monastery, and thanks to a botch up in cargo handling, Hachiko the puppy's destination ended up to be an American town with the Bedridge train station, where his first night wandering around the station's platform brought him to encounter Professor Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere. Taking pity on the puppy whom he thought was abandoned, Parker brought it home to the opposition of his wife (Joan Allen), but who can deny a homeless dog especially one that looks as cute as a button?\n\nThe gist of the story you would already know from the trailer which decided to tell all. The film curiously didn't spend too much time with Hachiko as a puppy, and decided to fast forward to when it became an adult dog, starting to walk with Parker to the station, and at 5pm every work day, promptly made its way back to the station to wait for its master, and then walking back. The Japanese version did this very well with people interaction along the way, which this version decided to erroneously gloss over. It's not about just the Professor and his dog, but the community around in which the dog's loyalty, faithfulness and street- smartness touched. Sure there was some attempts at that in this version, but there was too little and probably wanted to approach the story in a different direction.\n\nUnfortunately it got a little carried away, and after the pivotal turning point, it somehow went downhill with the narrative being dragged out because here's exactly when the relationship between community and the dog would have taken over to move this to another emotional plane, and didn't because the foundations were not established, granted though there were enough moments and scenes to tug at your heartstrings.\n\nOne cannot deny that the Akita breeds are cute, and many would have missed the disclaimer toward the end of the credits that the dogs are for experienced dog owners, so don't you be heading toward the pet store to get one puppy on a whim, as the worst thing that shouldn't happen, is an abandonment because fancy has worn off, and would have been very contradictory to the message preached in the film.\n\nBetween the American update and the original Japanese film, no prizes for guessing that I much prefer the latter for the simple reason that it had more genuine emotions with a better focus on Hachiko, and the locale which the American \"Hallmark\" version just tries so hard to replicate. Good news is the Japanese film made in 1987 is now re-released locally on DVD and is available in the shops now, and hopefully, the homage paid to the original story and the dog at the end of the film would pique interest in more picking up that version to watch."

The story has been put forward exceptionally well by the cast and the director.\n\nThe movie has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes, yet remarkably you are kept spellbound after a couple of minutes into the movie. And as the other reviews suggest, making the whole theater grab onto their tissues explains how good it really is.\n\nLastly, coming for someone who also rates 'Eight below' as one of his favorite's, a high rating of Hachiko would seem a little biased to many. But in my honest opinion I don't think that anybody who has watched this movie can rate it below 10."

That's the basic plot, the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.\n\nJust finished watching this movie yesterday and still can't get it out of my head.

I was pretty much crying and sobbing the entire second half of the film and by the time it was over, it brought me down to my knees.\n\nRichard Gere was at his usual best but the real highlight of the film was the acting of the dogs. They were incredible in how they were able to portray the range of emotions through their facial expression and body language. The music throughout the film was brilliant too and that helped in driving home the felling of sadness and loneliness that Hachi went through.\n\nI had a dog too and it brings back memories of how sad and depressed I felt for a month after he passed away. I have experienced such undying, unconditional love and loyalty from my dog too and it made this movie extra special for me. If there was ever a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life, this has to be it. This is a must see for any person with a heart and soul. I know I am a better person today after watching this and I am confident it might also have the same effect on some of you. Thanks for reading and do take care whoever you are. Love your dogs and always remember that he will always be there for you even in your darkest, loneliest hours."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hachi A Dog's Tale (2009) : Brief Review\n\nEPIC !!! The longest sobbing i ever had for any film. After watching 2000+ films or may be even much more than that, after watching more than 100 tearjerkers, after watching more than 500 emotional sagas this Hachi A Dog's Tale recieved the Longest sobbing of my life. I remember so many films just because they made me cry like kid, i can name many just like that, just now but you know most of those films had that emotional roll down moments somewhere in the last scenes. It is mostly the climax where i had to use tissues but Hachi A Dog's Tale was like raining tears. I cried for approx 25 Minutes continuesly setting a new record for myself and may be for all movie buffs. I mean how emotional film it was despite the fact i tried to hold it acknowledging the fact that yes i am a movie buff and i had to look for Cinematic proportions before breaking down and fortunately there were no cinematic blunders, no mistakes in writing, no loopholes, no non-sense theories and I was all free to cry like a small kid as if i am locked in an empty room and no one's watching me, just cry out loud. And yes i did it. It is inspired from a true story of a college professor who finds an abandoned dog and he takes into his home and how the Dog sets an example to the world about loyalty. Believe me, the dog put us all humans at shame. His loyalty and emotions were far far greater and immortal than humans and this is what makes this film truly Epic. You will see many scenes proving this statement in the film. Lasse Halstrom wherever you are just take my salute and please recieve my thank you, it means a lot to me. The way you crafted this film has left me stunned and heart broken. I promise you here that sooner or later i will have a Pet and i hope it would love me just the way Hachi loved his owner. A rarest of rare 10/10* film in my List.\n\nRATING - 10/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

Well my journey is also coming at an end. My heart isn't just into anything anymore.\n\nThis is my last review and from the title you can see that it is dedicated to a little kitten. A stray cat had taken residence in our home and had given birth to a pair of beautiful kittens. One died after catching a viral infection. We rescued the mother and surviving kitten who had also succumbed to the infection. I am pleased to note that mother and kitten are safe and sound and the mother cat is pregnant again.\n\nBack to this review. It is the true story of a professor who adopts a puppy(Hachiko) and it grows to become a faithful dog that waited for his master at a train station when he left for work until he came back. One day the professor died from a heart attack and the dog did not know this fact. The dog still waited for his master for the next 9 years, 9 months and 15 days till his death. The original Hachiko Monogatari is a 1987 Japanese drama film directed by Seijiro Koyama and starring Tatsuya Nakadai, Kaoru Yachigusa, Mako Ishino and Masumi Harukawa. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the 2009 modern remake and stars veteran actor Richard Gere in the role of the professor(Parker Wilson). The story is basically the same with minor changes to the script to adapt to the American version. Richard Gere is such a wonderful warm and loving actor. You should see An Officer And A Gentleman(1982), considered his best film. His acting in the film is professional as always. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa(Kickboxer 2, Showdown in Little Tokyo, Mortal Kombat) and Joan Allen(Manhunter, Face/Off) have small supporting roles. The original Hachiko was a was a Japanese Akita dog.\n\nFor Ricky(2023-2023)."

Really, i couldn't find anything special in this movie. Sure, there are no blooper in this movie, a good cast and the right screenplay, but it's not enough to make of HACHI a great movie. Morover, this is a remake of the Japan movie \"HACHIKO MONOGATARI\" (1987): another Holloywood version of a beautiful foreign movie. It's better to see the original. This will be forgotten in a few years."

I hate it because of the blatant Hollywood emotional manipulation and the lack of any substantial plot. I simultaneously want to celebrate this as an 8/10 genuine heartwarmer (how I *feel*) and as a 3/10 artificial maudlin schlock fest (how I *think*). I've rated this a compromise that doesn't truly capture my reaction but I don't know what else to do."

I am a fifty year-old \"grumpy old man\" but I bawled like a baby for nearly half an hour after watching this film. I also let my Staffordshire Terrier come up onto my lap (and she is VERY heavy) and I hugged her for an age!

The stark bleakness of the scene really summarizes the heart breaking story of Hachiko's lifelong enduring love for his master very well.\n\nAnd, perhaps being made in Japan where the real events happened serves to making the 1987 movie seem more like a documentary rather than a Hollywood production.\n\nThere is a short version of the 1987 movie \"Hachiko Monogatari\" on you tube to compare for yourself.its easy to locate."

I even joined this site to encourage more people to watch it.\n\nIf you have to see one film in your life time, see this.\n\nIt breaks all barriers.

        "review_detailed_main": "Lasse Halstrom has made some lovely films over the years, such as \"My Life as a Dog\" and \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\" While \"Hachi\" is a nice and decent film, it just lacks anything to make it special.\n\nThe storyline is designed to pull the heartstrings, which it does, sort of, in an extremely predictable way. However, when it comes to character development and dialogue, it has all the depth of an after-school special. Between the small talk and unrealistically perfect lives of the characters, there's hardly a genuine moment.\n\nAnd despite the built-in emotionally charged subject matter, it manages to have very little drama or tension, even where there ought to be. Even the most dramatic moment in the film is telegraphed by a Richard Gere soliloquy that gives away what's about to happen.\n\nThe worst aspect, I found, was the lack of any reality when it comes to animal care. It's as if no one involved in the film has ever owned or cared for a dog, and picked up all their knowledge from watching Chaplin movies or something.\n\nIt's not a terrible film, but I'd recommend it to parents who want to share a film with their young kids that has a heart and can teach them some empathy. Probably too sappy for adults, unless you prefer your films really shallow."

One thing more, they have shown just enough bonding between the Professor and Hachi, if they were little more into showing the depth of their relationship it would have been so hard for me to watch it. I was already crying at the end, but what made the ending best was that the boy, the grandson of parker gets the same Akita dog and names it Hachi. It is the best ever movie, I think it is exactly how it should have been.\n\nI read a couple of reviews talk about crying during the movie and thought it odd. I can't remember the last time I cried during a movie - but towards the last 15 minutes of the movie I didn't only cry - I cried from the depth of my heart, not out of sadness but from a much deeper sense of realization the power of true love and how it can manifest itself. You hear so many times that there is 'God' in all of us if we can realize it - at the end of this movie you will know why it's true. It's a must watch movie."

I have over the years encountered them and they are very protective of their owners. Intimidating and a little scary to strangers.\n\nFilms with dogs at the center can be a little cheesy.

The dog's co-stars are Richard Gere and Joan Allen, who are both fine, but neither really has much to do other than lean into their usual on-screen personas (him: sexy, charismatic but a little bland; her: smart, sexy & prickly). This is an okay, sentimental tearjerker, good for the Holidays or for canine fans, but otherwise unremarkable."

Now I just watched it for the second time...\n\nThe film delivers on its story, but it feels like emotional blackmail from the start with a string-based soundtrack and a melancholic piano that never stops playing, leaving little room for surprise. Actually, the film could have had more cheerful tones, especially in the best sequences between Hachi and Parker, but unfortunately the piano did not cease its tireless purpose of provoking a forced feeling of tenderness, making everything already seem like a memory.\n\nApart from this great detail, the film develops in a normal way, at a decent and average level in all its aspects. The central figure is a dog that demonstrates a strong bond with its master, whose life continues with relatively normal events, almost monotonous for a large part of the footage, until the big event occurs. Until this point, I see a lot of austerity in terms of the quantity and quality of the director's work. There are the right and precise scenes to develop the story, but there is zero attempt to make a more complete and innovative cinematic experience.\n\nThe film continues down the stretch showing Hachi's famous feat, in a very limited way. The movie is decently made, but it settles for very little. It lacks ambition, a better emotional construction and a better sense of good cinema."

It's about friendship and loyalty. It's about respect and decency. And all this portrayed mostly without words.\n\nIt is very nicely shot and the music score is good too.

How on earth does someone decides to put this as a short shelf life and not consider this movie to come out during the Xmas holiday. You have two superb actors, Richard Gere and Joan Allen. Can you get better than that. Shame on the film industry. I couldn't get my own brothers to watch this film for a second time. They were so heart wrenched in watching it the first time around. The music, the dog and the acting made this film possible. I saw it six times and every time I saw it, I cried. It's based on a true story and everyone I know that has seen it, can't have enough tissues handy. You chose Marley & Me to come out during the holidays and while I liked it and read the book, there is no comparison. This was a beautiful movie in every which way.\n\nThis is an amazing story about loyalty and unconditional love. I saw the Japanese version of it and while it was very good, I stilled loved the US version of it. I don't know what possessed the film industry to ignore putting this film on the silver screen because it was so beautifully well written and the music was amazing. I believe this movie came out when Marley and Me did, and while I enjoyed Marley and Me, there were more lessons to be learned by this movie and not by a precocious dog, but one who was truly loyal. I guess because it was based on a true story, it makes it all the more heart wrenching that something like this actually happened. If you're a dog lover, you will love this film, because you could associate yourself with the character that Richard Gere played. He was actually very good, but the accolades go to the dog that played Hachi. I was so mesmerized by this movie, the cast. the music and the dog, that I ordered it from Amazon.com in Blue Ray.\n\nModify review below:"

So when I realized that he was working with Lasse Hallstrom in this one, I steeled myself to watch it. I love most of Hallstrom's films, but every once in a while, his weird losers just repel me. He's the Babe Ruth of the movies: the Home Run King, who is struck out more often than anyone else.\n\nWell, they don't strike out in this one. I smiled and leaked tears when the film maker thought I should. The three dogs who play Hachi at various ages are handsome creatures With Joan Allen and Jason Alexander.\n\nThis movie is based on the story of Hachiko, a dog owned by a Japanese professor, who waited for him every day when his train brought him home from the university. Even after the professor had collapsed and died, the dog waited every day until his own death nine years later. Hachiko became a symbol of loyalty and inspired the revival of his breed, the Akita -- there were only thirty of them left. I don't know how many there are now, but more."

        "review_detailed_main": "An Akita Inu puppy, transplanted from a Japanese monastery to a picturesque town in Rhode Island, becomes lost at the train station but is soon adopted into the home of a music professor and his wife. Low-keyed American remake of a 1987 Japanese film, \"The Tale of Hachiko\", itself based upon a true story, has sweet and lovely passages, though overall content is lacking. Family-friendly movies about the bond between humans and animals nearly always work if the casting is right; here, the canine who portrays the older Hachi is a gorgeous, expressive creature--so how could the filmmakers miss? Co-produced by its star, Richard Gere, and directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, the film touches on universal emotions when it comes to our beloved pets, but the human interaction (disconcertingly subdued throughout) is under-nourished. Playing Gere's wife, Joan Allen is unable to find a character in the writing; and when the dog is moved around in the film's latter stages, Allen's actions (and her subsequent disappearance) are puzzling. Gere doesn't really have a character to portray either, but he's appealing and unhurried in his scenes with the dog, projecting a warmly lackadaisical presence. Hallstr\u00f6m, minus his barbed sense of human dynamics, must have helmed this project as a lark. He indeed guides the narrative with an assured, steady hand, but \"Hachi\" is far too subdued overall to make a big impact. **1/2 from ****"

She would go to the window ten minutes before I got home; it didn't matter that there was no pattern to my schedule, somehow she 'knew'. Once I had to go away for a few months; I heard how sad she was, so I phoned and I sent home a shirt I'd worn, so she would know I was alive.\n\nShe was the smartest dog I ever met. But she would never learn to fetch (sometimes she went to get it, but only if she wanted it, she almost never would bring it back), it seemed to me that she had too much dignity.\n\nI did always did everything I could to make hers the best life any dog ever lived; I knew how loyal she was, and returned every bit of it to her.\n\nThat was 15 years ago. After the first few minutes of the movie \"Hachi\", I never stopped crying until the end. I loved the movie, the most moving one I ever saw. Beautifully made and unforgettable."

What does happen is a perfect idea for a 1 minute heart-warming TV adver. Instead it is stretched to movie length. Also, if you're going to steal a real-life event from Japan, steal it properly and drop the forced links with Japan - the professor hangs out with a Japanese guy and happens to get a Japanese dog....aha, OK."

I do not accept the notion that Hachi was too dumb to figure out that Parker was gone. After NINE YEARS, he could surely figure it out. This is not an intellect problem.\n\nLook at this from the perspective of a grief model (e.g. denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance). Hachi was stuck in denial with possible depression. Where others see loyalty, I also see an intensely emotionally wounded creature.\n\nAlso, I wonder about the symbolism of Hachi taking up fetching a ball on the day Parker dies. It surely has to have some significance: Parker has the ball visibly on the piano and is clutching it as he dies. From Hachi's perspective, he has made some shift in the relationship, doing something \"unnatural\" to please Parker. The expectation in fetch is that the person having the ball returns it to the the other. Parker has the ball. The onus is on him to return it to Hachi so play can continue. Maybe the symbolism is that when Parker leaves that morning, not only will Parker return home to family and wife but that Parker will return specifically to complete a connection to Hachi."

It a timeless and very simple story and all can watch and learn from. Some basic human emotions that trancends to animals alike. It hard to keep it together toward the end as the story concentrates on the dog. I was speechless towards the end and could not stop sobbing. The kind of film that will stick with you and learn to appreciate the power of love and loyalty no matter whom or where it comes from. Highly, highly, highly recommend you watch, rent, buy, borrow this movie however you can find it and just pop it in alone, if you are to scared for other to see you open up to true emotion."

But it was only with Hachi, did I realize that, at times, when things go dead silent and you have given up hope on yourself, there will be someone or something that will tell you, \"You're not alone.\" It made me realize that in today's world, where people complain of backstabbing and disloyalty, this movie will always tell me what it takes to be loyal, and realize what true love is.\n\nWatch it. It doesn't matter whether you cry or not at the end of the movie. That's not what the movie attempts to achieve. In fact, I still don't know what this movie's objective is, if any. Anyway, try this out for once. I am pretty sure you won't regret it."

The wife finds the dog at the end of the film, aged and still mourning his owner, she hugs him and weeps and then she too leaves(abandons ) him. Does any dog lover think that these are appropriate actions? To see this poor animal, every winter sleeping under a train in the cold/ frost and ice is very upsetting. Yes, for the emotional tug of the story it works, but totally inappropriate to treat an animal like this. If a spouse was so upset at the loss of their partner, and they wanted to haunt the railway station for the rest of their life to be linked to their lost spouse would you let them do it? To put it in human terms the animal was traumatized and needed love, care and attention. They should have taken him to the train station at the time of the professor's daily arrival and then taken him home, loved him, and made him comfortable. But these people just abandoned him.

I am lucky enough that in my job I get to take people who I work with to the cinema. After planning on seeing a gangster flick, we ended up going into the wrong screen and ended up watching Hachi: A dogs story. We did not move to the right screen as by my watch the film had started 10 minutes before. The point is, from the start of the film when the 'U' classification came up (Suitable for 4 years +) I was a bit disappointed. Now as an actor I like Richard Gere but for the first few minutes I found his character a bit 'wooden'. At first I put this down to him having a bad film, but the more I think about it I think it was somehow done to emphasise his relationship with Hachi. Anyway, half an hour into the film disillusionment had gone and I was really enjoying the film. What was excellent for me, was that because I had never heard of the film, I had no idea what was to come. The film does an excellent job of surrounding itself around Hachi the dog. The only fancy gimmick is the occasional sight through Hachi's eyes which is done in black and white but this is only occasional. There are no doggy voices or doggy thoughts, but you still get involved with Hachi's emotions and how he is feeling. Towards the end of the film I was that into Hachi's character that I found myself bursting into tears, something that had not happened to me since I was 8years old watching ET. Luckily, we were the only ones in the cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yeah we follow Richard Gere and a dog named Hachi. The film basically lacks everything that features a great worthy of holding a place at the IMDb top 250 - a good script, direction, cinematography, score, editing, and so on.\n\nI felt that the film lacks basically all qualities of these traits and that the director attempts to compensate for this by the intense and very dense use of classical piano music, which seemed unnatural, as well as with the dialogue throughout the film.\n\nAn example of this is seen in the scene where Richard Gere's son-in-law plays catch with Hachi and trips over a ball game. If you do decide to watch this film for whatever reason, try and notice the dialogue and his reaction to falling and how badly acted it is and how immensely unnatural it seems. It almost has a \"The Room\"-esque vibe to it.\n\nThe only way I can fathom that this film received such high praise is that it is watched primarily by dog lovers that schew the ratings so badly on this film.\n\nNot in any way recommended."

I cried my heart out for long after the film had finished. it so much more than a \"mans best friend film\" its a film about a really bond that outlasts humans. Its such a beautiful moving, and wonderful film.\n\nthe best I've seen in such a long time. love it! I've told many people about this film already and they all want to see it, and I've warned them all.... you may think your tough when it comes to films, but be warned you'll need tissues. any one thats had a dog/has a dog or any pet really will feel this film get slowly stuck in their throat. Richard gear plays the part so well and its just an all round winner. I can only wish my Akita is as loyal and as loving as Hachi. I think we may even see a wave of little puppies names after him now!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I reckon that Hachi: A Dog's Tale has been shown on one of the Sky Movies channels graveyard slot almost every day, for months now. Hmmm. Another shaggy dog story, no thanks.\n\nRadio Times online has a photo of a young boy with a puppy to go with it. Doubly no thankyou! So, I resisted even longer. Then I noticed the director was none other than Lasse Hallstrom, who not everybody knows, made as one of his earliest films in his native Sweden, 'My Life as a Dog', back in 1985.\n\nThat being quite a favourite of mine, I then recorded Hachi. But, My Life is a Dog it isn't and is very different and much more 'normal' and grown up and sober. For much of it though I still found myself sceptical; instead of my worst fears of having a small boy playing with his puppy, we have a fifty-odd year old man playing with his dog. All very cute and life-assuring but hardly high drama.\n\nOf course, this is a family drama and one that is obviously loved and so I adjusted my perceptions and then, enjoyed it. It benefits from a good cast - Richard Gere and Joan Allen as his wife and being filmed in the old school tradition - simply, slowly, beautifully. The simple piano-led music is evocative, emotive and fitting - and universal.\n\nHachi is a touching tale that certainly brought a lump to my Tarantino- hardened throat and certainly made me think and ponder. Recommended."

He came with the professor each time to the train and would just come at the right time to pick him up. To me, it was as if Hachi was protecting him. I have so much to say but little words to use. I really wish that there are words to describe how I am feeling. Just at the middle of the movie, I cried. What happened in the movie just came all of a sudden, and we didn't even notice that such a thing can happen. But it can when it comes to stories that begins with a Wonder then joy and then... I'm sure you guys already know this order. Of what happened in this story, i literally hated it. I didn't want such sadness involved in this story but it was. It taught me something that is really hard to teach to others. All I can say is grab some tissues and a pillow to hug because this film will bring out such an emotion that you didn't think will come out.\n\nThank you very much for taking your time to read this review. :)"

It's a dog waiting for his dead owner to come back while sitting in the same spot for years, how do you make that visually interesting? Director Lasse Halstrom partially solves this problem by having Richard Gere die very late into this movie, a bit too late perhaps. The whole family is just so bland, what do we get to know about these people throughout the movie? They're happy. That's pretty much the character development. There are only so many scenes about Richard Gere playing with a dog you can stomach without wondering when something's going to happen. The last half hour of this movie manages to save a lot though. Seeing Hachi interact with all of his owner's old friends who can't convince him he will never be back, watching him badly age while everyone around him knows he's wasting his time, it's all very strong because the build-up does work to some extent. It's kinda boring, but we do feel like we get to know Hachi well and that makes it all the more sad when we see him suffer. Everything that concerned Hachi I loved, the rest I can sorta do without."

This is a great true story. And I would hate to think that the real owners of Hachiko treated him with such disregard. But what shines through even in this shallow version,, is that a house, and all of our possessions are nothing compared to love, loyalty, and friendship of a beautiful dog like Hachiko. Too bad they didn't go for something with more substance. I would someone would do this story justice. Never was there a better dog story than this."

The climax of the movie is very sad but on the other sides gives a beautiful description of the emotional relationship between two living beings irrespective of the fact that one of them is human and other is dog. The movie also spreads a very beautiful message of spread love to get love. A must watch emotional movie."

(just one example)\n\nMaybe the Japanese original film, Hachiko Monogatari (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D_Monogatari) is better, if it can be found anywhere."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am almost certain this will be a fantastic film but surely a rip off of the tale of Greyfriar's Bobby (1961) set in 1874's Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nBobby belonged to John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a night watchman, and the two were inseparable for approximately two years. On 15 February 1858, Gray died of tuberculosis. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, the graveyard surrounding Greyfriars Kirk in the Old Town of Edinburgh. Bobby, who survived Gray by fourteen years, is said to have spent the rest of his life sitting on his master's grave. A more realistic account has it that he spent a great deal of time at Gray's grave, but that he left regularly for meals at a restaurant beside the graveyard, and may have spent colder winters in nearby houses.\n\nIn 1867, when it was argued that a dog without an owner should be destroyed, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Sir William Chambers\u2014who was also a director of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\u2014paid for a renewal of Bobby's licence, making him the responsibility of the city council.\n\nBobby died in 1872 and could not be buried within the cemetery itself, since it was regarded as \"consecrated\" ground. He was buried instead just inside the gate of Greyfriars Kirkyard, not far from John Gray's grave."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's not because you care about animals and find dogs cute that any movie about a cute dog and his sad fate makes it automatically a good movie. Because that is why this film is scoring so high on IMDb. Director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m was probably eager take make a film where he could jerk the tears out of people. I just couldn't help feeling constantly manipulated and pushed around by the slimy piano music and the forced script and acting. I was thinking before I saw this film: how can they make people care so much for a dog it would make them cry and there really is only one way, the easy way which they took here (No spoilers but futurama episode 1 has a 1 min dog-sequence which this film ripped off which works so much better then Hachi). I have to say the dog is cute -although I'm more a cat person- and he does look sooo very sad at times in this film you can't help but feel sorry for the poor animal, but this is the manipulative effect this film has on people and Lasse knows and uses it so well. The dog trainers did a good job, kudos there but you do sometimes notice the dog is looking at something (the dog trainer) out of frame who is directing the dog to do certain things. The cinematographer also scores some bad points: this film was filmed digitally on a Genesis camera, but the picture has a very video/TV-like look which reinforces the feeling this is simply a low budget TV movie and not the cinematic masterpiece a lot of people seem to think it is. I know people who loved this movie won't understand and think me unempathetic for saying all this, but I love films and sometimes you need to dare point out the bad as well. It's like when a bad actor dies. Nobody dare say he sucked coz emotions have the upper hand but he was a bad actor all the same."

It really shows how much dogs are our friends... they are loyal even well after our death! Loyal forever and ever. This loyalty captures your attention and melts your heart.\n\nTo find a good movie nowadays is not an easy duty, including animal movies. Well, this is a good doggy movie and one which brings back some of the formula that stopped being used long ago but was once so common, even though it's not in the same league as the greats from the past.\n\nRichard Gere leaves his leading gentleman roles and image behind and goes ahead with a far more serious and dramatic role as a professor who finds an abandoned dog and, after finding no one who wants to keep it, keeps it for himself. The two become best friends in no time. One day the professor unexpectedly passes away and that's when the pivotal part of the dog's loyalty comes up. It touches those who appreciate dogs and this genre of film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was surprised at how poorly written Hachi: A Dog's tale was. This film felt like a made-for-TV Hallmark movie that was written by a 50-year-old. The dialog and many of the scenes were very cliche and stale (ex: the skunk scene), making it hard not to roll your eyes while watching. The writing was also very emotionally manipulative, using a puppy's cuteness and other overly dramatic elements to play the audience. Another one of the major issues I have with this film is the pacing. There were many story elements that I felt should have been cut, and others seemed to happen too quickly. It also did not help that the film was missing a climax. The one moment that could have been the climax of the film took place a little over halfway through and felt abrupt, which I thought was an odd choice. Really, this film should have been much shorter; maybe like a 30 minute short. That would have helped with the pacing and left more of an emotional impact.\n\nIf you look past the stale writing, the technical aspects of the film are good. I really enjoyed some of the cinematography and visual choices that were made. I particularly enjoyed that all of the Hachi point of view shots were in black and white. This helped distinguish the dog's perspective, allowing the audience to understand Hachi's emotions better. Another aspect of the film I thought was done exceptionally well was the score. The composer's usage Japanese influences and the piano made for a very beautiful and captivating score.\n\nOverall, I have mixed feelings about the film. On one hand, the dog is very cute and fun to watch at times, but on the other hand, the film is rather depressing poorly written. For these reasons, I don't think I would recommend this film.\n\nThe Good\nThe Bad"

There are a lot of formulaic scenes strung together to show the relationship growing closer between Richard Gere's character and Hachi. I don't know why Richard Gere has lost his appeal but he's not a believable lead here. Joan Allen is fine as always. The dog is wonderful but the plot just struggled and then the end was a tear jerker. I think what gets people is what saves so many movies - the sound track which is gorgeous. It's not Turner and Hooch but sadly it's the other extreme. Average at best. ."

A college professor's (Richard Gere) bond with the abandoned dog he takes at home along with his wife (Joan Allen) and daughter (Sarah Roemer) . At the beginning the spouse isn't happy about it , but after failing to find the owner , she lets the reliable dog stay . Later on , a Japanese friend (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) reads the dog's tag - \"Hachiko\" (from the mountainous northern regions of Japan) . Parker attempts to teach the dog to fetch , but the loving animal doesn't want to learn. This very beloved friend would accompany his master to the train station every day and return each afternoon to greet him after work.\n\nIt is based on Hachiko, the Japanese dog that waited for his dead master to return for nine years , this \"Hachiko: A Dog's Story\" results to be a charming take on \u00a8Hachiko\u00a8 film (1987) by Kaneto Shind\u00f4 starred by the great actor Tatsuya Nakadai. Agreeable and provoking film that captures qualities that make this picture a classic dealing with the true story about a dog's loyalty to its master, as tragedy tests that loyalty even after his death and no animals were harmed . This is a new classic for a new generation, a thrilling saga of courage and loyalty . The animals in this film were in no way harmed or mistreated , being portrayed by three dogs which they appeared were under strict supervision with expert trainers for their handling . Paced quite energetically , as the story is efficiently told and through its profound and wizened eyes . The evocative scenery , photography and music enhance the story of \u00a8Hachi\u00a8 and its adventures , sufferings and adversities . The tale is treated in good sense and high sensibility , environment , animals , landscapes combine to enhance the glories of faithfulness . On May 19 , 2012, a bronze statue of the dog Hachi was unveiled at the train depot at Woonsocket Depot Square where the film was shot ; it is an exact replica of the bronze statue of Hachiko which resides in front of Shibuya Station in Japan.\n\nGood cast full of fine American actors such as : Richard Gere , Joan Allen , Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa , Sarah Roemer , Erick Avari and Jason Alexander . Glowing and glamorous cinematography by Ron Fortunato. Exciting as well as emotive musical score by piano composed and played by Jan A. P. Kaczmarek. The music all plays with the soul , it is so delicately composed , performed, and chosen for the movie that it is worth seeing just to enjoy the soundtrack . The motion picture was marvelously directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m . Lasse is a prestigious director and writer, especially known for What's eating Gilbert Grape? (1993), The cider house rule (1999) , Chocolat (2000) , Casanova (2005) , Salmon fishing in the Yemen (2011) and this Hachiko (2009) ; and he has been married to Lena Olin. Hachi: A Dog's Tale(2009) rating: 7.5/10. Above average."

It also helped us talk about real life loyalty and love and how that true friendship or bond is missing in the real world! Its truly a masterpiece and there is no one i know that has not shed a tear while watching this beautifully directed, written, and acted movie... kudos to the entire team, its a true movie experience!!

They deserve to be treated as well as a member of a family. I love animals so much and my love for them will never end. I hope you guys have a wonderful time of watching this movie and it would be perfect if you guys that have dogs can watch this movie with your dogs.

        "review_detailed_main": "I had better state first of all that I'm not particularly a dog lover, I'm more of a cat person, but I appreciate the bond that can exist between an owner and his pet. I should also say that if it wasn't for the fact the Richard Gere appears in this film I very much doubt I would have watched it. Having said that, what I saw was a very heart-warming story that will most definitely not be for everyone, but for those that can appreciate it, it's well worth a viewing. Here's a very brief summary first before I tell you what I really think (summary haters please wait outside the railway station while I write the next paragraph).\n\nParker Wilson is a music professor at a university and he commutes by train every day. One day he finds a puppy wandering about on the platform. Unable to find anyone to claim the dog he takes it home. His wife, Cate, is not best pleased and tells him he must find the real owner soon. He puts up flyers and asks around but nobody claims the dog. He even asks Ken, a Japanese colleague about the dog. Ken tells him that he has a symbol on his collar that says 'Hachiko', which means 'eight' in Japanese. As you can guess, Hachi (for short) becomes the dog's name. As the days pass the bond grows stronger between Parker and Hachi and Cate eventually relents and allows the dog to stay. Once fully grown, every day Hachi would follow Parker to the station and then go home until the evening when he would return to wait for his master. This goes on for quite a while and Hachi becomes a bit of a celebrity amongst those that work in and around the station. But something is about to go badly wrong and this will test Hachi's devotion to his master. Of course I'm not going to tell you what that is as I really don't want to give away too much.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that this film is based on a 1987 Japanese film called \"Hachiko monogatari\" by Kaneto Shind\u00f4, which is, in turn, based on a true story. There is a very nice musical score that complements the visuals perfectly and I love the occasional shots we get from the dog's point of view. Nobody does a long stare quite like Richard Gere, and he was excellent in his part as Parker Wilson here. Also worth a mention are; Joan Allen as Cate Wilson, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Ken, Sarah Roemer as Andy (their daughter), Jason Alexander, as Carl and Erick Avari as Jasjeet.\n\nAlthough this has the feel of a TV movie of the week, it is a very well done TV movie of the week. If anything the ninety minutes running time is a little long for the story and you begin to feel there is a little too much padding in there. But having said that I still found it a decent watch. Over all, although it is not for everyone, it did bring out some emotions in me that I rarely show and so I deem it\u0085 Recommended.\n\nMy score: 7.3/10"

I always recommend this movie but a lot of people don't want to watch it because of the ending. Highly recommend this movie to all ages.\n\nAfter many years, it still makes me cry after watching it. It's a beautiful story and Hollywood did a great job of recreating this true story. One of my all time favourites!\n\nIt will not disappoint. Best movie ever."

It may be the case that this film feels pretty unrealistic in a sense, or that the actions that take place are dumbed down for a younger audience, but this film is pretty average, but enjoyable nonetheless."

We are both animal lovers and it became clear early on that this was not light hearted and it became a difficult watch as you watch the dogs story unfold. You dont want to watch at times because it becomes painful but you do all the way to the sad ending!\n\nIt is a good film and prompted me to watch the Japanese version, the American one was based on the true story as was the Japanese one but this version is easier to follow and more relatable.\n\nI felt compelled to find out more and discovered a book written about the \"Loyal Dog Hatchiko\" - Hachi - The Truth of the Life and Legend of the Most Famous Dog in Japan written by Mayumi Itoh. The book is very compelling and sets out to separate fact from fiction using evidence but also give the reader background on professor, journalist and other people associated with Hachi as well as some background on the times and culture in Japan at the time. The book is very detailed and you realise this film is a simplified version and is more of a summary.\n\nI must admit that if you are easily upset or have sensitive children you will find this film difficult to watch and it will definitely leave you in tears."

No one will remember it as such but for the most part it's a light hearted amusing movie. Almost every scene has the same intention-to show Hachi's devotion and bond to his master. This does leave it a bit repetitive and going in circles but Lasse Hallstrom handles it with enough charm and style to allow the film to progress. This same fault starts to apear again once Hachi begins his wait, but at least this time the film has the other task of building the emotion of it. And without doubt this movie should have ended at the last scene in the station and that tag on with the kid puts this in the mix of most squandered endings.\n\nCan the story of Hachi be a compelling movie? Despite its weaknesses, this film will show you how it can."

Lindsey and the well-chosen director is the sensitive Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m.\n\nThe story really belongs to Hachi, a Japanese Akita who is befriended by a professor (Richard Gere) when left stranded at a train station (the film is transferred to an eastern American locale). The stationmaster (Jason Alexander) encourages the professor to take the dog home, much to the surprised annoyance of the professor's wife (Joan Allen). But the professor and Hachi bond, encouraged by the couple's daughter (Sarah Roemer), and Hachi follows the professor to the train each morning and waits for his return each night. Though a tragedy occurs, the strength of this dog/man bond is so strong that nothing can break it- not even prolonged separation. Hachi becomes part of the train station family and grows in respect when the ultimate test of his endurance occurs.\n\nAnd that is quite simply the story. There are some very beautiful little cameos by Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erik Avari, Davenia McFadden, and Robbie Sublet, but the true feeling of this film is that of an ensemble effort lead so very competently by Richard Gere's portrayal. It is a little film to treasure.\n\nGrady Harp"

I highly recommend this movie for animal lovers."

How did he get any veterinary care, or a decent diet, shame on the family is what I say. Irresponsible of Hollywood embellishing a story to personify a dog whom in reality was left out on the street to fend for himself. Going to the train station each day because let's face it that was where his source of food was! None of his family committed to caring for him, none of his family was interested in engaging him in a productive life whereby bonds of trust could have been established within the remaining family. Totally irresponsible of Hollywood to project this dog as the next cute dog everyone needs to have - no regards for it requiring experienced dog handlers with the skill to socialise and train what otherwise could easily become an aggressive dog towards strangers and other dogs without consistent, positive and knowledgeable dog training skill. Warning next sentence some viewers may find disturbing. Dogs are not humans inside a furry body, they do not speak our language and the reason the dog wouldn't retrieve the ball was because his owner didn't know the first thing about dog training, not because the dog wasn't capable of being trained to retrieve."

Why do they do it, time after time, why do they show so much joy every time their life companion shows up? Don't they get tired of us? I know we do, so why don't they?\n\nThis is a film about a dog so loyal that he waits every day his master's return, even if the man died ten years ago. The story is a true story, only it happened in Japan in the 20's. The movie was really well done, with as much an emphasis on the dog as possible. People except his master were just secondary characters, a thing that further underlined the dog's single minded obsession and love.\n\nRationally, if you think about it, any man doing what this dog did would be institutionalized as an obsessive compulsive. Would we respect the man in any way? And still, such a simple show of loyalty brought tears to my eyes that I could not stop from coming out. I knew I was inventing human traits for the dog, but it still would not make me feel any less miserable for that animal's sense of loss. I am also making an effort to not turn this review into a \"stop killing dogs, you brainless simpletons!\" so I stop here.\n\nBottom line: Very simple story, very effective movie, the actors were a little out of it, except Richard Gere who did great. It will evoke more feeling in you than a thousand romantic comedies, even of those that are not a joke."

But my brother had to see it for school, and i wasn't going to deny going to a dog's film. I love dogs, and i loved Marley and me with its drama, so i was expecting something like that. What did i get?? besides my unstoppable sobbing throughout the film and the fact that my red eyes hurt a lot later, i loved this film. This is the definition of an EMOTIONAL film. Richard Gere does it great here (better than in pretty woman, in my OP) with bonding Hachi, who was beautiful as a puppy, as the regular hachi, and even as the old one. He was extremely beautiful and i love beautiful and tender dogs. So even in the happy parts i started to shed a happy tear, but from the moment... (well, you know what moment) i couldn't stop crying throughout the film. I actually consider myself a sensitive guy, but i never cry OUT LOUD in the cinema. I tried to hold it, but just couldn't. This has to be one of the two films in which i have cried the most in my whole life, and that's a good thing. I actually love the emotional moments in every film. The story is greatly portrayed, and the relationship couldn't be better. God, when hachi dreams of him i just couldn't stop sobbing. Poor hachi, really. And of course what got me is the friendship and loyalty scent that this movie doesn't lack at all. I definitely will buy it, cause i love dogs and i love emotional films. And this film exceeded both things. I recommend it, even though it's inevitable you are gonna cry"

They inhabit their bodies with complete delight: witness them romping in the backyard, wagging their tails, tracking down a scent, or gazing up at you with pure adoration. They exude energy and a playful spirit as they explore every nook and cranny of their environment. They are our spiritual teachers - little Zen masters calling us to live in the present moment and attend to whatever rises right in front of us.\n\nHachi: A Dog's Tale is a tribute to all these qualities of dogs. If you've ever had a dog or longed for one, you'll find yourself pulled whole-heartedly into this story. And, like a good parable, it can also be read as a deep spiritual testimony to the power of yearning for one's beloved."

It is a must for anyone who enjoys a solid plot, character development and animal acting that is imperceptible. As other reviews have said, it is as if Richard and the Dog were a natural fit.\n\nThis movie is now on my favorites list, but I am not sure I can handle watching it again soon.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of traditional storytelling, delivering a heartfelt and emotionally resonant experience. Based on a true story, this film directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m beautifully captures the enduring bond between a dog and his owner, leaving audiences with a profound sense of love and loyalty.\n\nAt the heart of the film is the incredible friendship between Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) and Hachiko, an Akita puppy found by Parker at a train station. The narrative unfolds with simplicity and sincerity, allowing the audience to witness the evolution of this extraordinary bond. Richard Gere's portrayal of Parker is nothing short of exceptional, conveying a range of emotions that add depth to the character and enrich the overall viewing experience.\n\nThe film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the emotional journey of Hachi and Parker. The cinematography, coupled with Jan A. P. Kaczmarek's evocative score, enhances the storytelling and tugs at the heartstrings. The small town setting further adds to the film's charm, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nWhat truly sets \"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" apart is its ability to evoke genuine emotion without relying on sentimentality. The film's themes of loyalty, companionship, and unconditional love are universal, making it relatable to audiences of all ages. Prepare to laugh, cry, and reflect on the enduring impact of genuine connections.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Joan Allen and Sarah Roemer, contributes to the film's emotional depth, but it is Hachiko's portrayal by several talented Akitas that steals the show. The dogs' performances are nothing short of remarkable, capturing the essence of loyalty and unwavering devotion that defines the Hachiko story.\n\n\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" is more than a film; it's an emotional journey that lingers in the hearts of viewers long after the credits roll. It serves as a timeless testament to the profound connection between humans and their faithful companions. Whether you're a dog lover or not, this film is a must-watch for anyone seeking a genuine and moving cinematic experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Evidently, Hachi is an unbelievably emotional film, full of sentiment. The dog is lovely, the relationship is everything everyone hopes to have with their dog, but there isn't any real plot to go with this.\n\nFor the first half, it was dull, unfortunately, as although the development of the relationship was there, no real story was. It's a matter of a dog and its owner loving one another, lovely, but not engaging. Then there is the change in pace, and really it's not a very nice watch. The film is just horribly sad, the sentiment pulls at everyone's heartstrings. My girlfriend was in floods of tears for the majority of the film, because you feel so much for the dog, but something so enduringly sad can't be a perfect film can it?\n\nEvoking so much emotion means you cannot give it a terrible score, but without a story to truly follow it cannot be a brilliant film either. It's manipulative for sure, but I suppose it does its job in displaying a dog's loyalty."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" (2009)\n\nI thought I liked dogs as much as the next person and all, however the reviews and rating for this movie really had me perplexed. The real life story, which is the inspiration for the movie is really sad and heartbreaking. However, in my opinion the movie is really boring in every aspect, acting, music and especially the camerawork. And, again in my opinion, this do not deserve a place on IMDb's Top 250 films of all time. But if you like a sad story about a dog and his master, boring camera work, stale acting and constant manipulative sad music this is the movie for you. I know that I am probably in the minority here with this review, so pls could someone explain to me what I am missing.\n\nPs. Would have been a lot more interesting if it took place in the same setting and time-period as the real story.\n\nRating: 3/10."

Just a compelling window into the \"heart of a dog\" which leaves you drained far beyond the current \"crap\" that comes out of Hollywood. This film made me \"feel\" the sincerity of what it's like to love and miss another being when they are gone from your life. Sometimes a \"reality check\" movie is just what we need. Thank you Richard Gere and Joan Allen for giving us your gift of a real story instead of the high budget,brain dead entertainment that's so common. 10 out of 10 We've got another classic film here."

        "review_detailed_main": "First I don't always cry for movies and even if I do, I've never cried so bad like I did when watching this one.\n\nIt told a story where a cute dog forms up a solid friendship with his master. And a huge twist, something that this kind of dog wouldn't learn to do, happens the day the two friends' (dog and master) fate is changed. Then something very touching and sad happens, which tells us the fact that true friendship and loyalty will never be broken.\n\nAnd so, why was I touched by this film? While a dog can always wait for his master no matter what happens, we people don't always have that much loyalty. Many of us can be a bit \"cold\", or in another word, forgetful at times. We can be forgetful about the happy times and bitter stuff that we've been through with our friends, our loved ones when we argue or fight for just some little occasional conflict for instance. We can be forgetful about those good moments when we pretend that we can't forgive our friends for certain small mistake just because we like to pretend to be serious sometimes. However, this story reminds us of the value of cherishing something that's more worthwhile than some trifles which could possibly break our friendship and loyalty to somebody.\n\nThe movie is a small-budget one, and perhaps that's the reason why so many still haven't watched it. I highly recommend everyone watch it, even if you're not a dog lover. Actually I don't have a dog either."

Dog is not just a man's friend, its way way more than that and this movie does an excellent job putting that on the screen. A must watch movie.

That's a love that only a pure and kind animal like a dog can share. It's almost impossible to be found in humans. That's why when you are surrounded by dogs even homeless ones you can never feel lonely or abandoned. Because these cute creatures will treat you like you are their beloved king.Some people unfortunately take advantage of this. So please never treat with cruelty an animal because this is not what their pure loveful soul deserves.Just watch this movie and you'll understand."

        "review_detailed_main": "So I got interested in this movie seeing it had received such good ratings on IMDb and also since people unanimously shared their tearful experiences with this one.\n\nMy initial gut feeling was: how irrelevant a movie must be that centers such a great deal on an animal character. Was this yet another Lassie type movie? The cover certainly made an impression of this. 1,5 h, also seemed like a pretty modest run time for a movie that is supposed to get you carried away. Despite conflicting thoughts, I decided to not go with my cynical side, caught this movie and loaded it up.\n\nStraight away I found my empathy button pushed. The little Hachi is easy to consider cute and I wondered what events would follow the dog's entry in the life of Richard Gere's character, let alone the little creature interacting with the rest of the family- not as thrilled over sudden thrown upon dog ownership. As the movie progressed I got increasingly more unfulfilled, though. There really is not much going on story-wise and the acting is mediocre at best, which makes it hard to feel for any of the characters. Furthermore, the-world-seen-through-Hachi's-eyes-shots are embarrassingly trivial and the absence of these would have made a better film.\n\nI guess this story about the dog who waited for his dear master to arrive better suits as an exceptional anecdote, shared on an encyclopedic website, rather than as a full-length feature film. After all, is it possible to depict animal depth with credibility, which this movie tries to do?\n\nI started watching this movie with a smile but ended up feeling horribly regressed for having given it a chance. Lessons are to be learned from this, IMDb ratings should be taken with a grain of salt and from this point on I shun movies that feature dogs as main characters.\n\nIf you wish to get moved, \"The Elephant man\" is a better choice; it has incredible acting and displays immense beauty in the worst ugliness. Moreover, I believe the film \"Turner & Hooch\", which is dog-oriented too, is more enjoyable than his one whilst not claiming to be a masterpiece or as heart-wrenching."

So many movies attempt to be so much more than they can possibly manage in 90 minutes, this movie does not do that. Its purpose is stated entirely in the title, a dogs tale. This is a simple movie about a dog. Unlike Marley and Me, the movie is not about the OWNERS of the dog. The owners are obviously in Hachi - but the movie is about the dog, its life and its devotion. Given that the movie is also based somewhat closely on a true story, it makes it that much more powerful. It is too bad that this movie was not released theatrically or more well known. Easily the best movie for a dog owner to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am French, but work and live in under developed countries, and currently in Mozambique. In my compound, my Brazilian neighbors gave me 5 days ago a copy of a movie: \"Achiko\" with Richard Gere. I got so moved that I am now browsing Internet for learning more about some other faithful dogs such as Greyfriars Bobby (Edinburgh - Scotland), Shep (Fort Benton - USA), Fido (Borgo - Italia),... and so many...\n\nMy neighbors do not like dogs. They like cats! They were so moved by the movie that they knocked at my door a night, and gave me a DVD, saying, \"JP, you HAVE to watch this...\"\n\nI did. And days later I just think to myself: \"This word is walking on his head. Here, where I am, I see people dying of hunger, malaria, aids... I should think: there are more important matters than just a story between a dog and his 2-legs companion... But, no. It does not matter if it is a dog or not. It matters if you are, again and again, shown that being loved is a true gem, wherever it comes from.\"\n\nCinema is not always about technology, pre-conceived ideas about timing, 600 pages stories and things that should happen.\n\nSimon & Garfunkel once sung \"the Sound of Silence\" This movie is the Sound of Silence. The silence of love.\n\nI am amazed to see the reviews in IMDb. I sorted by \"Hated it\", and discovered than only 8 comments were below the current average of 8.1 ... and the lowest reviewer gave a 7, which is very very fair! I have seen so many reviews about other films in IMDb where at least some reviewers were saying \"it is the worst movie ... ever\". Here no such thing. It is possible to be unsatisfied with some aspect of the movie, but, as it is based on a true story, and the film has not added \"Hollywoodian\" effects, it stays rather simple, somehow difficult to classify, but it lets a print in your soul.\n\nTO ANY ONE READING THIS REVIEW: GO, RUN, FLY, go see this movie. It will stay in you like a good little companion"

It is beautifully written, the music is absolutely wonderful. I couldn't stop thinking to myself how much I was enjoying the soundtrack. Richard Gere gives a wholesome performance and the rest of the cast are pretty good as well.\n\nI highly recommend this movie to you, especially if you have young kids.

        "review_detailed_main": "Introduced to a little dog transported across the world, it's impossible not to fall for this puppy wandering a dark train station at night. Over time, you see the special attachment shared between Hachi and Parker and find warmth knowing he has finally found a good home. It's incredible how warm a dog can make a home that was once desolate.\n\nIf you have ever had the fortune of owning a pet, you understand the strong attachment you have with one. You protect them, provide for them, and love them despite being unable to converse. You can see a dog's emotions just from its body language, and the dog comforts you when he/she realizes you're distressed. It's an amazing feeling to have such a unique bond to an animal that is so pure (like all creations), and views you as immaculate despite your imperfections. Unfortunately, you have probably had to endure difficult times of struggling health, senescence and inevitable death. It's this period of such great love followed by emptiness that is so hard to bear.\n\nLike any relationship, it is when there is a strain that you discover the true colours of those involved and discover everyone's true emotions.\n\nI once heard a story of a young boy saying that humans need more time in this world because they need to learn how to love and then reciprocate. Dogs on the other hand are born into the world already knowing how to love and that is why they don't need to live as long.\n\nAlthough I agree with the little child, I would also add that the pain that a pet would endure if its owner passed away would be unbearable. I wished there was a way to offer Hachi solace and tell him everything would be okay. I wish for a lot of things.\n\nHachi was a loving dog who was saved by Parker. He's no ordinary dog...none ever are."

Despite the protests of his wife (Joan Allen) he brings the puppy back with him, to look after it until its owners are found. Turns out that the dog ends up staying with them for good.\n\nThe film is an Americanized version of the 1987 Japanese film Hachiko Monogatari, which in turn is based on real-life events that took place in 1920s Tokyo. The basic premise being the same in all three. A professor, an akita dog and a story about loyalty.\n\nThat being said, I think I would have rather watched the Japanese film. Because quite honestly, while I can see why some people might really love this film, it feels so patronizingly Hollywood to me. All the usual tricks are here. The attempts to mystify the Far East, the touching montages, the sappy music, the candles and tears in the corner of the eye, the idyllic small town charm. They even slap a GoPro on the dog, just to make sure we understand that it is its story. Quite honestly I expected the dog to start talking at some point.\n\nPlus there's an absolutely pointless framing story featuring the professor's grandson. Absolutely pointless, pure waste of time and film reel.\n\nStill, the film is professionally made, looks very nice and if there was ever only one man who could pull off this kind of story, it would have to be Richard Gere. Quite honestly I had more problems with the characterization of the dog than I had with him.\n\nNot really a good movie in my opinion, but it has its numerous fans, and I can see why. If the story interests you and you like dogs, go for it."

The incidents in the movie are well connected and reveal how an animal could be so loyal to his or her master.

But all in all it was worth it, as it makes you believe in love and loyalty to the end, definitely worth seeing. The dog, an Akita, was so amazing. It made me want to look into the breed a bit, but I think the idea is that any dog could be this loving and loyal to their owner. The actors/actresses did a great job, and just knowing it was based on a true story made it even more profound in my opinion. I am glad I did not see this in the theater and at home as I am afraid of how much I would have cried with the big screen, bad enough on my TV at home."

For others, who really don't much believe in such things, watch this movie, It'd make you do ! The soul-stirring loyalty offered by the pet will make you cry along. A deeply touching story that will make you agonize with the situation of the movie as you watch it !"

        "review_title": "kind of an impossible film to truly hate, though I don't quite love it",
        "review_detailed_main": "Hachi: A Dog's Tale may be 'syrupy' to some, that word that is a euphemism for 'sappy', 'sentimental', 'feel-good'. It's all that, but I think that what sets apart this film from what this could have been (maybe Marley & Me comes to mind) is that it sticks to being as simple as possible - it's a no-frills kind of light-hearted drama, if that makes sense. As soon as Richard Gere sees this dog at the station - basically as cute a puppy as one will see in a movie that's meant to be taken seriously - that's how the movie will go. It doesn't pump up much artificial drama at all, and the only real conflict is a major one that comes about halfway or maybe 2/3rd a way into the movie, and it's one that is meant to bring on the water-works for the rest of the audience in the remaining run-time.\n\nWho is Hachi (or Hachiko as his full name was in the original film and in real life, which this is based on an actual story in Japan)? A dog that is what is sort of written in the unofficial guide-book for good dogs: faithful, loyal and true. It also helps that Hachi is a happy dog, for the most part (maybe a few times he barks, but never really much at all except to be like 'hey!' to a human). It also plays on the universal truth for dogs that when their master goes away it's like the human is going away forever, and when he or she comes back it's like its the first time all over again that they're connecting. Dogs are great in that way, that their love and compassion is basically undying; in other words, the point of the movie is to show a kind of lesson for human beings as well - be more like Hachi, if you can.\n\nI think it also helps that Richard Gere and Joan Allen and (yes) Jason Alexander are very good in their parts, and keep things at the (in a good, clear way) simple level that director Lasse Hallstrom is keeping it at. While the score is the one part that could arguably be the sentimental part of the picture, with its soft and fluffy and sad piano and strings, it's perhaps necessary at times too for the story to work. If this were too quiet it might not have the proper resonance; it's one of those times with a heart-felt drama that I'm glad there's a score like this, even if it goes too far in certain moments. What works though is that the actors above, and even actors in smaller roles (the hot-dog vendor, the bookstore worker) have presence and have a good rapore with the dog.\n\nIs it a kid's movie? Sure. But it doesn't come with the Hollywood BS that so many movies get; the most wacky 'comedy' part is that Gere and his lovable dog get skunked at one point. Because it keeps it so... basic (is there another word for simple I can use), it can resonate with people since its not trying to pull a fast one or pull SO hard on the manipulation that its Hallmark channel. It's not quite great since there isn't necessary too much in the way of human character past Gere and Allen (there's also their kid and her family, but that's kind of weak), but it is all about the dog, as the title says. And hey, it's not Old Yeller."

Background score is pretty repetitive although it just manages to do justice to the movie.\n\nRichard Gere's performance is neat, the rest of the cast put up a just above mediocre act.\n\nHachiko is brilliant although his part of the script does not involve too much tricks other than waiting in the station.\n\nOverall .. Great movie... must watch for all dog lovers and even if not this movie can convert you into being one.."

Why the dog doesn't die in the first ten minutes to solve all the problems I don't know. If I was blind and deaf I still wouldn't give it 10 stars. Frankly, Richard should be ashamed of himself.He has let his country down. My sum of all fears is this movie becoming a success, unfortunately it appears that it may be, so my final question is, who do we blame, the director, Richard or the dog. This is the peoples decision. I can't make this. But you can, please everyone think what you have watched. is poison to the mind and an insult to humanity. One day Hollywood will make a good dog movie, maybe about a war dog, because this is unacceptable. Yours sincerely the most sensible movie critic on earth (apparently)."

Fact that this is a true story based movie, only made my experience far more deeper than I originally thought it would be. Yes, family of the professor could take this dog, keep him warm, give him home, or at least let him go every day on station to wait for his master and return him back home. I know I would do that, but somehow, producer of this movie wanted to make story even sadder, so he made it look like this particular dog was all alone on himself. I must tell that this fact somehow made me sad. Solitude is something I would not even wish for my enemies.\n\nBecause story and family involvement could be better, I give this movie a solid 9 and I must point out that this is very strong rating coming from me because I tend to criticize movies for even a smallest mistakes.\n\nMust see movie for all ages.

An americanized - Scandinavian version of the original, that even though portrays ideal behavior of the community in an idyllic setting, invades the inconscient with soft images, a subtle but slowly penetrating soundtrack and Richard Gere in maybe the best and more human role of his long career. I saw him at first as the sex idol in 'American Gigolo' and 'Breathless' and he marked my adolescence, but his mature self is far more enchanting.\n\nWhen God realized Man was far from perfect, he created dogs to counter - balance.The dog sight that dominates the movie which rolls in a very slow pace - as dogs' lives usually do - let us penetrate in Hachi's soul, and that ends up to be both devastating and deliberating. I feel at the same time sorry and so relieved seeing how love triumphs over death. I'm sure that if the movie had the adequate promotion and was on the cinemas for a while, it would have gained a far more higher position in the list."

However, it's the real story behind that made me sob some fifteen minutes after the credits rolled. It makes you think about the love you share and feel for those who are important to you and how far you are willing to go to preserve any trace of that love.\n\n\"A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than he loves himself.\" -Josh Billings\n\nI'd go hug my dog right now but she's asleep.\n\nPS.

Where have you been?\" Now that she's no longer with us, I'm the one who looks for her each day when I come home. We need more movies such as this one to remind us to cherish each day we have here on earth and not to take anything for granted."

It touched me in a way nothing really ever has. My history with dogs might have something to do with that, but quite frankly you have got to be one especially heartless and cold individual if this movie does not get to you.\n\nI could probably nitpick if I really wanted to, but why would I? What little flaws the movie may have do not take away from the story. Not only is it one of the most incredible stories I have ever heard, but it also just so happens to be a true one. I don't know what more to say, I'm honestly at a loss for words. Just watch it and see for yourself, it is an experience you don't want to miss out on. Trust me, you will need tissues."

My husband had suggested this movie saying it was a sad movie about a dog...so of course I was hesitant being that I love dogs.\n\nTruth be told though, this movie was so touching, heartwarming, moving and made me realize all over again how powerful the love and devotion between ourselves and our pets can be. If you've ever had a dog, wanted a dog or just like dogs in general, this is a must watch.\n\nWithout giving the story away...the premise behind the movie is about the loyalty that exists between a man and his dog even beyond life in the physical world. It's proof that love never dies and that animals...dogs in particular...have the uncanny ability to just feel and love without boundaries, logic or reason. They just do and once they're loyal to you, they'll love you forever.\n\nInterestingly enough, this movie was based on a true story...which makes it even more amazing. Richard Gere was wonderful in his role and Jason Alexander played a great supporting role and the dog deserves an Oscar. Who knew dogs could act so convincingly? You can actually see the thoughts and emotions in the dog's expressions, and what a gorgeous dog it was. I had never given much thought to Akitas before, but I'm deeply impressed! It'll make you want to jump through the screen and give him a hug.\n\nI highly recommend this movie. Just keep some tissues around."

Fast forward 9 years later, while a senior in college Dad received a letter from his parents that Dick had died. By accident rummaging through our family heirlooms after Dad died several years ago, I came across a diary book of his and in it was an handwritten eulogy he wrote upon learning about Dick's death. He wrote this in 1934 (excerpts) : ....\" No truer friend did I ever have than this dog. She had much to with shaping my character that is the virtue I possess for I learned from Dick much of the valuable principles of good living....\" This movie is for those who had a strong and stirring attachment with their dog and it does bring tears to our eyes because of it. There was a Hachi in our life at one time another that made this story so compelling. Richard Gere deserves all the credit for a wonderful story."

It's a wonderful sad story that leaves you heartbroken and tearful, and one cannot help but to feel the pain and sadness that Hachi felt. It leaves you wondering how a dog can have so much love and devotion when there are people out there who cant even show half the loyalty and love for each other as much as Hachi did for his master.\n\nKnowing Hachi's story I cannot help to feel wanting to be a better person and human, this movie leaves it prints in your heart/soul and is a story you will not forget. I have to say that Lasse Hallstrom did a terrific job with this movie, if not one of the best movies he has made.\n\nI give Hachi's story a ten because his story touched me deeply in a way nothing ever has. Living me wondering how unique this dog was and how loved he was and still is by us people who knows his story and devotion, and yes sometimes a dog really is a mans best friend, like Hachi. Undying love and bond for a master who did not return until the day they met again, a day Hachi waited for for ten years. Definitely a movie worth watching. Wonderful and amazing."

Or maybe it is because its so simple, no explosions or anything like you see in every other movie. Its not a typical Hollywood movie. You get caught in the movie directly, like when you read a really good book, you don't want it to end.\n\nAnd one more thing: This movie actually made me join IMDb to write a review and to rate it, cause it really is worth it. My advice is : Watch the movie, then rate it because i think it need 10 stars in rating!\n\nP.S You can watch this at any age i think, its a good movie for everyone, and i hope that my review has helped anyone to settle down and watch the movie!

I struggled to keep myself from crying as the story unfolded and we see how this remarkable dog idealizes its owner with unconditional love. Just the thought that this is a true story makes it so heart warming and if the whole world would treat each other with the love/respect as a dog does for its owner we would so much better off.I think anyone that loves dogs/pets should definitely see this as its the BEST movie especially of its type I've ever seen.."

If you have ever loved anyone,human or animal,you have to love this movie.In an era when one can like and even recommend craps like \"American Pie\" and \"Euro trip\" then i find it hard,almost impossible, to comprehend how one can even dislike this movie.Richard Gere has effortlessly produced a gem of a movie for humanity and has brought us closer to the universal truth of love and peace.If a dog can teach us what love is,we can definitely spread the message.\n\nTo rate this movie is merely a futile exercise as i truly believe that masterpieces like this are beyond any judgement or analysis.It's simply the most touching movie i ever saw."

The movie features an excellent BGM that did very well gel to the sentiment, I feel. The Censor board has approved this movie for General exhibition so it can be watched with your family. One small issue with the movie that apart from these two main characters the others weren't explored at all. The bottom line is that Hachiko's loyalty made me fear no dogs, instead love 'em."

I would highly recommend a box of tissues be handy while watching. Such a beautiful dog the Akita. We are the proud parents of two beautiful chihuahua's. A male and female and they are every bit as loving and loyal. They are always happy to see you whether you have been gone for many days or five minutes. They are our sweet babies and we love them dearly. They usually go with us every where we go!We went on a long three month tour of the USA and they went right along with us. They sleep with us. They love us unconditionally. I cannot imagine life without them. I highly recommend this movie if you are an animal lover, even if you are not an animal lover, it is a really heart touching movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the true story of Hachi, a dog that bonds with a college professor and that bond can never break.\n\nI liked this movie very much because its plot is based on a true story and it has a beautiful meaning. The direction which was made by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m is for one more time simple beautiful and he succeeded on making us bond with both the professor and Hachi, and follow their story. The interpretation of Richard Gere who played as Parker Wilson, it was simply outstanding and I believe he showed the true bond between a person and a dog. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joan Allen's who played as Cate Wilson and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's who played as Ken. Finally, I have to say that \"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" is a beautiful and emotional movie, and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that everyone will love it and learn something by watching it."

But I must say they focused too much on the actual story and should have inserted some interesting elements deliberately because it all looked like a boring story in the end. The actual story should have been told verbally by people coz the interesting part is only in the beginning and somewhat in the middle. I got bored in the end and was hoping to get something interesting in the end. A disappointing experience I must say. Well the part that I appreciate is that there were not too many characters inserted just to increase the length of the film. Than at sometimes I could not understand some of the things that the dog was doing. May be I was not able to understand. In all the humans as well as the dog performed very well but the story seemed to be a little bit uninteresting.\n\n\"Do not waste your time unless you are a great film buff.\""

Fantastic movie & greatly depicts why a dog is a man's best friend as well as we don't deserve dogs.\n\nThe movie is very simple, the actors have done a wonderful job in leaving an impact without being loud. Richard Gere & Hachi's connection is so beautifully woven that you can't help but get grief stricken when Richard Gere dies. The fact that I could immediately relate & imagine the actual story left a even bigger mark... imagine someone going all the way to be at the same spot everyday, for the rest of your life\n\nThank you Hachi, you were a good boy!"

Finally a film from the USA (albeit based on a true story in the 1920s Japan) that is without guns, explosions and free of violence and not based at all on romantic elements!\n\n\"Love and Loyalty\" succinctly sums up the film. The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)\n\nThe main characters never \"take flight\" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.\n\nHachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.\n\nA must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages."

Must Must Watch, I would say... even if you don't have a dog, you would love this masterpiece This was movie part... now coming back to original stuff...\n\nThe movie is the real story of an Akita dog born in November, 1923, in the city of Odate, Akita Prefecture. In 1924 he was brought to Tokyo by his owner, Eisaburo Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the University of Tokyo. During his owner's life, Hachiko saw him off from the front door and greeted him at the end of the day at the nearby Shibuya Station.\n\nEven after Ueno's death in May, 1925, Hachiko returned every day to the station to wait for him, and did so for the next 9 years, till his death."

I don't care how compelled the dog was to wait at the train station, no responsible pet owner would do that.\n\nAnd then the wife visits the town she left nearly ten years after her husbands death and acts like she is so surprised to see the dog living at the train station, like she didn't know that. It was her own daughter who let the dog out to return to the station.\n\nThe wife didn't seem that distraught at her husbands funeral: the love of her life who died suddenly and prematurely. She acted like she was at some distant cousin's funeral. OMG, I could go on and on.\n\nI did cry, rather harshly, at the end; but still thought the movie was the worst I can recall ever seeing."

The word Hachiko has come to be synonymous with loyalty, and for good reason. Such loyalty, devotion, love, just stuns me. The real story set's foot in 1923, when real Hachi was born. I'm animal person, and I like this kind of movies, but so far this one was the best I ever seen.\n\nWho ever did not watch the movie, I friendly recommended that they do.

In my life there had been three films that brought me to tears during my viewings of them: Bambi, Old Yeller, and E.T. Now there are four. This film is not perfect but the minor flaws do nothing to interfere with the beauty of the love and devotion shown between Hachi and his master. If I ever get the chance to travel to Japan, it will definitely be on my must see list to journey to Shibuya Station to pay my respects to the statue of such a beautiful animal. Hachi was truly Man's Best Friend."

Only a dog owner can understand the vibes/connection/mutual understanding between him and his dog\n\n3. I gave it 9 points as the movie is different from the true story. The true story is more touching.\n\n4.Richard Gere is outstanding in this movie. Never felt like he was acting. Actually i was surprised to see him working in this movie.By his acting ,he added that extra touch to the movie along with the DOG.\n\n5. You may find it weird, but the acting of the dog was remarkable... i mean ... if i had to give points in acting ..then the DOG will earn more points than Richard Gere. Yes ,the DOG acted in this movie rather than jump from one wall, kicking football or doing those crazy Home Alone tricks.\n\n6.This movie is completely powered with acting performance by the DOG and Mr.Richards. They are the soul of this movie.\n\n7. Good work done by the Station Master and the Hot Dog Man.\n\n8. Half the credit should go to the director Mr.Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m ,as he has put a lot of hard work in getting those perfect expression of the dog and also captured those special moments between the owner and the dog.\n\nSummary \u2013 I am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if the film is good.

While looking for a theme to highlight mom's life on her 80th BD, I took her to the movies without knowing what was playing and chose this over the 6 other gore feasts. Family loyalty and fidelity are highlighted in a clear and succinct manner by Hachi's behavior, while contrasting the denial of any bond by the grieving?? wife(she came back first to see her lasting Theater legacy before other family remembrances). I agree the modern day setting makes the story implausible, but we will forgive the national narcissism. Gere is splendid in matching the dog's facial expression. The camera work surrenders to the view by Hachi only partially. Great cure for eye dryness!!!"

The last 20 minutes are heart breaking and that wonderful soundtrack....oh ...I just have to warn you not to be emotionally drained because it will make you feel sad....just remember that love is stronger than life and death!

These people who are not moved by this movie...I must admit that I believe they are not been concentrated when watching it or they are the most cold-hearted beings.\n\nMovie itself is based on real life story and it's about the strongest connections and feelings between animal and human. And it is so beautifully made - structure, dialogues, acting, music, camera-work...everything is just perfect. It should be watched with your closest ones - with those in front you can naturally cry without holding yourself back because then the catharsis is stronger and you can fully express you feelings and after you get over this movie you can turn to life as a better person."

The movie is a simple story of a dog and his beloved owner. What makes this film strong is that the owner is Richard Gere, a highly credited actor who once again did a great job in this movie. Another strength is that Gere is supported by many great supporting actors and actress, Jason Alexander of Seinfeld being one of them, who all together played their roles great and making this tale a masterful film. Hachi the dog is one overly cute Akita, portrayed by 3 different dogs (different time lines of the film) all trained well. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is truly the best representation of loyalty, love and happiness. No matter how sad you feel, a dog like Hachi will make you feel more happy than a billionaire. This film can change you for the better, highly recommended, open to all kinds of audience. Enjoy the heart warming emotional film, just keep a tissue box next to you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hachi: A Dog's Tale was a film for every pet and animal lover full compassion , heart warming true story which was unbelievable but yet so close to my heart. Hachi ( means the lucky number 8 in Japanese language) was an abandoned dog who ultimately is adopted by Professor Parker Wilson in Bedridge Town Railway Station. Parker , following his wife's constant complaining to keep the dog, tries to give it to someone else but destiny plays different role and no matter how much he tries to shove Hachi away , it keeps on coming back to him with nobody willing to take the lost puppy. Eventually , a deep bond builds in between the two and Parker finally decides to take him home. Hachi becomes so close to his master that everyday he waits for him to return home at 5 PM in the nearby railway station and this becomes his regular habit. Now , a dog's story has always moved me right from Marley& Me to Red Dog and this film goes a one step ahead with such a delightful and touching story of a canine who becomes a legend in the small town after he waits for his master at the gateway of Bedridge railway station for nine years following his master's death. Lasse Hallstorm ( Chocolate , Whats Eating Gilbert Grape) has chosen a very heart-felt story which will make you laugh , cry , love and feel for dogs who I believe are the most faithful animals in the world. The direction is simply superb and script is tight that will keep you on your toes right from the beginning till the end. The cinematography is eye-catching , the art direction is wonderful with an awesome background score. The performances are stupendous. Richard Gere excels in the role of Professor who feel compassionate for the animal. The dog essaying the role of Hachi was gorgeous and full of expressions. Other starcast did a fine job as well.\n\nSo , overall , a superb story to be told , to be heard , to be seen. \" Dogs are the most beautiful animal on earth who needs only one thing from you - Love. IF you give them love , they will be your best and loyal friend\""

Presumably there are at least three dogs involved playing the puppy, the mature Hachi, and old Hachi. They are all fantastic. What strikes me every time, though, is Richard Gere's performance. I've not been a big fan of Gere's over the years, since seeing American Gigolo when it was first released. But he is so natural in this film and so clearly having real fun with Hachi, that it is a totally winning performance. Two small points in the Plot Summary: Carl did not teach Hachi to fetch. Rather, as Ken said, Hachi would fetch when it meant something, so the only time he fetched the ball was when he was trying to keep Parker from going to work, mysteriously knowing what was going to happen. Secondly, describing Joan Allen as a bossy, jealous wife kind of misses the point. Many couples decide against having a dog because one of them objects, and in fact she is won over when she sees how happy Hachi makes her husband."

Those scenes alone were enough to get me emotionally in pieces, and then came the final 15 minutes when the film comes to a close and I found out that it was based on a true story. Admittedly, the film doesn't surround itself with better than average human characters, besides the owner of course, but Hachi is enough to give the 90 minute runtime just the boost it needs. We all should be more like Hachi.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, to begin with a confession. I have been crying for nearly the last half hour. These have not been tears of frustration on watching yet another jaded entertainer or difficult to fathom artsy flick. These are tears of gratitude towards the director of the movie for what is easily the most sensitive and touching portrayal of the bond between a man and a dog. Richard Gere is the music professor at a college who finds an abandoned dog at the train station. He takes it to his home. His wife (Joan Allen) is initially against keeping the dog with them because of a reason. But slowly she understands that her husband had become totally crazy for it and he ends up becoming a part of their family which also includes a daughter. Gere finds out that its name is Hachiko. The film tracks the relation between Gere and Hachiko over their life time. The incidents are funny and poignant and you would be laughing as well as suppressing sniffles. Gere is in the acting form of his life and you can clearly see that he loves Hachiko. Their chemistry burns up the screen and lifts this from a very good movie to a truly extraordinary one. Allen is better than average as his wife. There are a bunch of characters that fall in love with Hachiko and they are sketched very vividly. But the film belongs to the titular Hachiko. The director uses black and white to show his point of view. Watching many scenes I thought I could understand that the director was trying to show that we may be thinking that our pet is really fine and cozy in its place but what it actually wants at that time is to be with us, in our arms. Hachiko wins your heart and bowls you over and devastates you by the end of the run time. I have never owned an animal in my life time. I guess it is time to set this right. As one of my friend wrote and it has stayed with me ever since, when you go and select a dog perhaps that may be the only occasion you get to select your relative. Unbelievable achievement. 4.5 out of 5."

It is the dog (s), in the character of Hachi, who brings it all home, of course. I'm sure it helps to be a dog lover -- a lover of BIG dogs that demand time and attention (not the \"toy\" breeds, although they can be cute). It probably didn't hurt (my rating of this film) that my own dog (not an Akita -- a tall, muscle bound American staffordshire mix) is similar to the character Hachi, in smarts and personality (my dog is a bit more fun, 'cause he likes to be play like a rugby player, and be goofy).\n\nThe plot is truly simple: abandoned dog finds man, Parker Wilson, at train station, wins over man with it's charm and cuteness. Man's wife, Cate, tries to interfere with the friendship/bonding process (don't all wives?), by demanding he not adopt another dog. Man's love for dog wins out, and wife relents. The rest of the movie focuses mostly on the bonding of Parker and Hachi, with small scenes of interaction between Parker's family (wife Cate, daughter Andy, and soon-to-be son-in-law, Michael), moving through life, interacting with each other and Hachi. And Hachi's penchant for leaving the backyard, on his own, and walking to the train station (everyday at the same time) to wait for Parker and walk home with him. Then a poignant story development takes place, setting the stage for theme of the movie. The event itself won't necessarily put a lump in your throat: but the things that happen immediately after...and for the remaining 24 minutes of film definitely will. Unless 1)you've been disconnected from the life-support system, or 2) You're one of those insufferable guys who feel they are too manly to admit they have emotions or too high-brow and sophisticated to be taken in by popular entertainment and \"cheap sentiment.\" (Funsuckers). If those don't apply, be prepared to tell any women in the room that, you, um...got some dust in your eyes, or something.\n\nThe script/screen story is based on a real-life story, only it has been Americanized. That's okay. The story still hits home. And the dogs which were used for this movie are brilliant actors! The cutesy angle (often used in films that feature dogds) is largely avoided; and the idea, when showing things from Hachi's perspective, to use some faded colors, instead of black & white, was spot-on. I have to admit, I generally enjoy the majority of Lasse Halstrom's work \"The Cider House Rules,\" \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\" etc). This is no exception. Two paws up!"

This story was told in such a simple way and its raw depiction of plain canine love wrenched me emotionally. Few movies have the power to reduce me to tears like this nowadays.\n\nAll the actors are excellent. Richard Gere as the human who follows his heart and bonds with the dog early on. The puppy and the grown dog(s) that act out the loving hearted Hachiko... Such pure love from another species... How can we as humans not feel touched by such devotion and loyalty? How can we, as a species, not feel awed by the trust that our dog friends bestow on us so freely? The movie did a very fine job of depicting the special bond in this human-canine duo. I loved it!"

This movie uses that real life story which makes the film entertaining enough and you'll probably get emotional at some point. But just as a movie this movie has TONS of problems. Richard Gere is good and so is the dog and as I said the true story is great but almost everything that is needed to make a great movie fall short in this movie and that's why it's hard to rate because when I judge this as a movie I can't help but give it a low rating. The cinematography is horrible. It looks like a hallmark film and the score is overbearing and saccharine. The whole tone is quite saccharine and this story in the hands of better writers and a better director didn't need to be so saccharine. I've never seen the original film but I'm interested in checking it out because it's Japanese and the original story took place in Japan and I see now reason why this version didn't. Honestly there probably is no point in this movie even existing if the original is as good as I hear but they were going to make it anyway but I see no reason why this version didn't also take place in Japan and had all Japanese actors. If you want the characters to speak English for North American audiences fine whatever, the people in Schindlers list spoke English not German that does t matter, but when you are telling a true story be as faithful as possible. The guy who played Richard Gere's friend should have played Richard Gere instead of being a forced Japanese connection. Shoot it in the real station where the true event took place. Lots of missed opportunity's and weird desicons. Also the movie drags a lot and repeats scenes over and over and has scenes that serve no purpose. This story is more designed for a 45 min short film rather than a feature. Anyway that's my take. One of these days I'll check out the original"

It will even exite you - yes, despite what you might think, there actually are moments of genuine suspense in this movie! It's by no means a thriller, but it still manages to get your heart pumping! I almost jumped out of my seat during the scene in the garage! People need to see this movie, movies like this just don't come around often. In some ways, it even changed my own life for the better. When thinking about Hachi, I always strive to be better than I am, to never give up, and to always believe that anything is possible. This might be the most important movie you will ever watch! It really has everything, an exiting, thrilling and heartbreaking story, lovealbe and relatable characters that are incredibly portrayed by Richard Gere and Joan Allen. This is without a doubt Richard Gere at his absolute best. The fact that he never won the Oscar for this is an outrage. It should be studied (and probably is) in acting schools everywhere because what they have managed to achieve here is nothing short of magical! Every scene, every cut is brilliantly concieved, there are nothing in this movie that is filler or unnecessary. You sit on your toes and are constantly floored by just how magnificent this movie really is. It will entertain you while at the same time cause you stop and think about what's really important in life. I will cause you to question your very own existence, to think about what is possible, what a dog is capable of and what really makes us all human. WOW! This film is history. It stands alone. It raises the bar for how movies as a medium should be viewed in our society. See this movie now, and then see it again a thousand times. Then watch it again."

This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead.\n\nI am quite sure that Hachiko, being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years, would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE, then he would not have to wait for 9 years\"\n\nI feel Hachi was neglected after his masters death, just left alone to fend for himself. Surely it would have been his masters wish that he was cared for after his death.\n\nIt saddens me that this happened.\n\nBut the loyalty and unconditional love shown by Hachi will live on forever and it was right to honour such loyalty with a statue at the very station that Hachi waited for his master to return for the entirety of his life.\n\nHachis story will live on forever and rightly so."

This one is a real dog and a real story. It does not, it does not do funny things or never becomes serious, it just plays itself as a dog. Hachiko, the dog is an amazing one and the story is fascinating too.\n\nIt was hard to believe that such a dog existed, till I got to read the real story. Akita, the breed of Hachiko seems to be most loyal of all the dog breeds and we are lucky to have such beings accompany us in this world. I am lucky enough to have known and seen the story by myself, although in a cinematic form.\n\nIt's a story that's worth telling and is worth knowing. There are aspects from where we as humans can learn something I believe. I learned to be more humble, and will try to be more down to earth. Death is a certainty that no mortal being can escape but the way we die makes what we are. This is the take away from the film. I hope to die in a way where I am remembered not just by my family and friends but by many more persons for the rightful deeds.\n\nThanks to the technical team of this film, for taking this story and making us a film, so that many more will get to know of this. Thanks to Richard Gere for acting in this low-key film and making his performance and also the film special. He seems to be a generous human, by playing his part in a film like this one. Of all the technical aspects, I liked the music by Jan A P Kaczmarek.\n\nIt's a 4/5 for a film that's tear-jerking, moving and memorable."

A music professor takes the dog home and unwittingly changes both their lives.This lovely family drama inspired by a famous true-life case of canine devotion. Richard Gere might not be the first actor you'd cast in a slushy animal saga but he's actually just right for the role, as director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m is determined not to milk the story for cheap sentiment. After a slightly wobbly prologue illustrating Hachi's unlikely journey from rural Japan to commuter-belt America, the film takes its time in showing how this four-legged akita puppy becomes an essential part of the household of Gere and his sceptical spouse Joan Allen.The following part of the film describes some very lovely,naughty and some sad moments which involve the dog soming to station every day waiting for his deceased owner to arrive and go to their home while playing with him.But the film certainly is affecting, especially when we learn of its inspiration in Tokyo and the exploits of the real Hachiko."

Not saying that Hachi will make you more sad than the other movie and definitely not saying that it is better than legendary Schindler's List, but it is a powerful movie you can't disregard."

This was a true story of a dog that had lived and died in 1934 with the last ten years of its life spent at a train station waiting for his deceased owner to return who never can in this life, but only in the next. And that reunion will leave you in tears, not only for the happy and deserved reunion between Hachi and his owner, but anyone we have loved and lost and imagined and hoped awaited them.\n\nBut if the reunion in our next life only exists between humans, I for one would be sorely disappointed not to have my own pets I have loved and lost and awaiting me at a place some have called the rainbow bridge. But this reunion between Hachi and his owner takes place where he has loyally and patiently awaited for ten years through cold and warmth, rain and snow. At the end of the movie we learn the true Hachi was a dog named Hachiko that lived in Japan. A statue of the dog has been placed there in a pose sitting and waiting as he had been seen for the last ten long years of his life, living for no other purpose than to reunite with the person he loved.\n\nI am often sent letters from animal rights groups asking me to help stop the dog meat trade in East Asia, Korea especially. I have been to Korea and and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I could only stay away from the markets I knew where it was going on to shield my eyes from something I knew I couldn't change. The practice I've heard seems to be dying out as a new generation shows a greater affection for dogs and an inclination for fast food, though the practice still exists with an estimated three million dogs each year being killed and eaten. It is in such places this movie needs to be shown. It would be a wonderful legacy for Hachiko if his loyalty and devotion could be rewarded by helping to change how dogs are treated not only in East Asia but everywhere in the world."

You've got to see it for yourself to get the full appreciation and I'm not a dog owner, nor have I ever cared to own one. What an emotional journey this dog took though. And to know this was actually based on a true story, made the movie even that more special, topping my list of favorites viewed thus far. The end does reveal who the movie was about. One cannot even compare this movie to any of Nicholas Spark's written novels turned into incredibly powerful 'tear-jerker' romance movies. Everyone, if you can handle this movie, don't miss out on it. Sometimes love runs deeper than the imagination can fathom and this wasn't imagination at all, this was real! I want that kind of love! Someone who will always be there waiting in anticipation of me and even going out of their way for me, to see me before I come home. That kind of love cannot be topped! This is a perfect 10!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I am not ashamed to say that I welled up at the end of this extremely emotional film. The film is based on the true story of Hachiko, an Akita dog immortalized for his undying loyalty to his owner. Hachiko would regularly meet his owner, Professor Ueno, at Shibuya Station each day after he returned from work. He faithfully continued to wait there for over nine years following Ueno's death. Hachiko would die on March 8, 1935, at the age of eleven. When he died, his owner's partner Yaeko Ueno, and the Shibuya Station staff mourned his death, and on March 8, there is a memorial ceremony at the station every year. In April 1934, a bronze statue created in the likeness of Hachiko was erected at Shibuya Station.\n\nThe loyalty, love, and devotion that poor Hachiko showed to his owner was nothing short of extraordinary. It really proves the bond between man and his dog. The performance of the actors takes a back seat to the story, but everyone is on fire here. Richard Gere known for his leading man and character driven credentials was outstanding. His performance was a mature and intimate portrayal of the master of Hachiko. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a remake of Hachiko Monogatari (1987) - which is even more heartbreaking than Hachi: A Dog's Tale. What I love is that the film is devoid of CGI, explosions or violence just pure raw emotion, loyalty, and love between dog and man."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is about the bond between a man and a dog. It is a fictionalized variant of a true story, but with the essence preserved, and thus bound to be emotionally appealing. It can be thought of as a love story between a human and his pet dog. The star is not the man as much as it is the pet dog. The setting and characters are almost a fairy tale. The turning of the man's feeling from neutral to strongly attached is iconic but still heartening. During the winding end to the film most viewers would likely be choked up or welling tears. The attribute of evoking these emotions is what makes it a top 250 film. The film engages in personification imbuing the dog with the possibility of human emotionality. The dog is not human, and likely does not feel grief, but does exhibit the very human trait of hope. One leaves this film experience enveloped with a pleasant feeling."

The dogs used are often difficult to train, but the trainers used did an excellent job and had these loving animals deliver a fantastic performance.\n\nI had not view this film until a couple of days ago, however it will stick to me in my heart until the day I die. I am a senior and make no apologies in saying I still cry when I think of Hachi, the real one and the dog actor.\n\nPlease, if you haven't seen this film, especially if you are a dog over, view it as soon as possible.

        "review_title": "A cute, sweet and tender film, which imports an originally Japanese story to the USA and which promises to make many children insistently ask their parents for puppies.",
        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not a fan of dogs... in fact, I'm one of those people who never had dogs, and that's why I didn't develop a great admiration for these animals, despite recognizing that they are excellent companions and can make a difference for many people, in different situations (for example, as part of police units or as guides for the blind). But the truth is that I feel every day how uncomfortable dogs can be, if they fall into the hands of careless owners, or those who do not teach them properly: they howl when alone, they make a lot of noise when other animals pass by, they run to sniff and lick other people without their owners paying attention if they want to have contact with their animals and, worse, they defecate anywhere without their owners taking care to collect the droppings. Yes, the education of dog owners in Portugal is non-existent in most cases. The fault, of course, lies entirely with the imbecile human owners, but it helped me not to harbor sympathy for these animals. The fair, in these things, always pays for the sinner.\n\nHowever, even the human being with less affinity for dogs will recognize the value and the moving beauty of this film, loosely based on a true story that took place in Japan, before the Second World War, and which has already given rise to at least one Japanese film, in 1987. What this film does is to take this Japanese story and transport it to the United States, telling it as if it had taken place on US soil, but keeping a lot of elements, implicit and discreet, that link us to Japanese culture (the dog breed, the dog's name, even the martial arts). I have nothing against remakes and I have to admit that Hachiko's true story deserved a movie... but the truth is that there are a number of similar reports around the world attesting to the loyalty and unparalleled attachment of various animals to their owners. So, if the idea was just to take Hachiko to the US, maybe it would have been better if the script had created a new and entirely fictional story, albeit inspired by the real Hachiko (and other dogs).\n\nHaving made all these considerations, I believe that we owe a tribute to Richard Geere for another exceptionally well done and very palatable work, in which the actor manages to monopolize our attention in a friendly character, that touches our emotional side. However, and if we exclude the three dogs that participated in this film and played the role of the protagonist, there is virtually nothing more to say about the cast! The remaining actors only say what they are told to say, without adding anything truly positive, nor receiving interesting and developed material for their respective characters. This includes Joan Allen, who appears to have dropped in this movie by parachute.\n\nOn a technical level, there are several positive aspects to be highlighted, such as the pleasant cinematography, the good choice of filming locations and the intelligent use of the sets and some visual and sound effects. It's not a flashy movie, but it does everything it can to touch our hearts and can even feel corny and sentimental, especially towards the end. I handled it very well, but of course not all people will like it. The choice of animals for this movie was really good, and they are just cute and adorable in the extreme. And we can't forget about that incredible soundtrack, based on sweet piano melodies. It all helps this movie to be exceptionally sweet and suitable for family evenings. However, I leave a note for parents: if you don't want your children to ask you, in an insistent way, to adopt a puppy, don't let them see this movie."

Of course, the Hollywood Hachi is modernized for today.\n\nRichard Gere was the perfect choice for this film. It's so tragic. I'm getting teary just thinking about it again and I watched it over a month ago.\n\nI must eventually check out \"A Dog's Purpose\" (a shame it got negative press because people are soo quick to react), which is by the same director.\n\nIf you're looking for a movie to make use of a full box of Kleenex, this is it."

I digress...\n\nBurn me at the stake, tell me that I need to be put down (because a dog's life isn't equal to a human's, but in fact much more valuable according to many who lash out at those who don't love the film), but this movie could have been 20 minutes and have the same impact. I'm not commenting on the history of the story, but the horrid execution of the telling of it...one which I'm not convinced even needed to be made into a movie.\n\nMany of those who have rated this movie a 10 are falling into the same trap as women who think movies like Dear John or A Walk To Remember are great. This movie is aimed directly at those who invest too much in their pet (ex. dressing their dog up, carrying them in a purse, making a facebook profile for them).

        "review_detailed_main": "Enjoyable and touching film. It begins and ends with an 11-year-old boy in front of his school class telling about his \"hero\", and the movie that unfolds is about his grandfather's loyal dog, Hachi. His name comes from the Japanese characters on his tag, but no other information about where he came from.\n\nThe small puppy is being transported by train, in a small bamboo cage, which falls off the gurney. No one notices in the crowd, and the puppy gets out. He then is discovered by traveler Richard Gere as Parker Wilson, who is a professor of music. He commutes daily by train.\n\nParker doesn't want the puppy, we soon find out that they apparently recently had one die, and had agreed not to get another. But with no place else to put the puppy overnight, Hachi was brought home.\n\nAlways good Joan Allen is Parker's wife, Cate Wilson. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is his good friend and fellow professor, Ken. And Jason Alexander is the train station supervisor, Carl. This is a fine story about the relationship between a man and his dog. Richard Gere is superb as he usually is in this sort of role."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a remake of the Japanese 1987 Hachi-ko, with the story now taking place in Rhode Island as opposed to Tokyo. With the change of scene, we receive a very Americanised film now focussing on a picture-perfect rich family in suburbia.\n\nWhat works well is the very touching main story, based on real life events. We make a positive connection early on to both Hachi and the kind professor that owned him. The film also did well to train the 3 animals involved in playing Hachi. Apart from that, there's very little to the film.\n\nThey stretched 30 minutes of content into an hour and a half film. The film isn't interestingly shot, nor is the dialogue of note. The framing of the story was unoriginal. No risks were taken in this film, and no rewards reaped. My favourite part of the film was learning that the director's name is \"Lasse\".\n\nYou might have some sympathy about the film struggling to fill a feature film with the story of a dog waiting for its owner. However, when you read the actual story, you see there's more to it. A student followed Hachi to the home of the professor's gardener, where he learned more about Hachi's story. He published the story and did a census of the Akita breed - only 30 were found across Japan. Hachi's story popularised the breed and Hachi became a symbol of loyalty amongst the populace in imperial Japan. If more content was needed, the real life story offered more possibilities.\n\nYes, there are cute dog scenes. Yes, the dog is nice. Yet, halfway through, I felt like I was waiting years for the film to end..."

Then I must take into consideration Hatci. It worths a straight 10/10. As far as 18/10 is not feasible in IMDb, I must reduce my rate to 9/10."

Yes, the dog is very cute, but if you want to watch cute dog videos, the Internet has a lot more to offer. The real story of the bond between this dog and it's owner is amazing, but this movie doesn't do it justice. What this movie does however accomplish is that it won't just bore you, but also leave you feel slightly depressed at the end. Who the heck needs that?"
