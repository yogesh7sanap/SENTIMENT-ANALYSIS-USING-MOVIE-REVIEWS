        "review_detailed_main": "First there are funny films that leave an impression for a lifetime (e.g. Golmaal of Amol Palekar, Chupke Chupke of Amitabh & Dharmendra, Hera Pheri, Munnabhai MBBS) and then there are those casual weekend watches which makes you laugh your heart out at certain moments during the film but nothing you'll recommend to someone the next day. Housefull 4 qualifies for the latter. One great thing about the movie is that it's NOT a vulgar comedy filled with hindi slangs (which many other directors bank on today to make people laugh). It's old school, clean and meant for a family watch & I really loved it from that stand point. Akshay Kumar is brilliant. Kriti Sanon is good too. Certain one liners are outright hilarious and will make you laugh. Problem is that the support casts (including stalwarts like Johnny Lever) are absolutely horrible. Chunky Pandey & Bobby Deol should stop acting. They are an eye soar. Johnny Lever's acting as a transgender is difficult to watch and in just how many movies more are they going to make Riteish Deshmukh behave in a feminine way. There's no originality left in that any longer. The music is terrible & the story is rubbish. However, the best part of the movie are the last 20 mins. So there's a bit to look forward to. Therefore, if you're not doing much this weekend, you might like to buy the tickets for this one or not. I'll leave that choice to you \ud83d\ude0a"

The second half, I must tell you, it was unbearable for my stomy. I laughed so hard, so loud, I couldn't imagine ever. Akshay Kumar, Ritesh Deshmukh, Bobby Deol, Pooja Hegde and Kriti Sanon, all have done a remarkable job. The best was Johnny Lever, oh my God! I couldn't take a moment of calmness. Mamma Mia again rocked it. We need Housefull 5. My ratings for all the Housefull Series are as below: H1 : 7.5 H2 : 9 H3 : 6 H4 : 8.75 Yes, I'm an Akkian, but this is my true review, not a biased one unlike the idiot Taran Adarsh who never underands comedies \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I couldn't stop laughing when he Rated Prem Ratan dhan Paayo and ABCD 3 as 4/5, Dabbang 3 as 3/5 saying entertainer and one of the best movies of Bollywood Dil Chahta hai as 2/5 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"

I knew that all the films were bad but there was something about them which gave me enjoyment whilst watching them. The fourth film, however, is just straight up terrible.\n\nHousefull 4 is about three couples who get reincarnated 600 years later as they find out that they're about to marry the wrong person.\n\nI'll just get to the point. This movie is just atrocious. Out of all the Housefull films, this one is most certainly the weakest. What sells this movie is its huge scale and ensemble cast but apart from that, everything else is poorly made. I think the jokes in this film is the worst out of the four. Majority of them get constantly recycled and some of them are just childish and disgusting. There were a few moments and jokes which I thought were creative and actually got a laugh from me but there is so much rubbish that overshadows them. It starts to get tedious really quickly. The visual effects were a pain to sit through. It seemed very noticeable where the effects were used and it made me repeatedly facepalm in my seat. There was also an absurd amount of perversion scattered throughout which weren't clever or funny. It goes to show the struggle the writers went through in terms of writing unique and witty humour.\n\nThe acting was fine. Akshay Kumar was clearly trying to funny and is definitely the best part of this film. Riteish Deshmukh and Bobby Deol were fine. The three actresses didn't have much to work with and just had the purpose of being eye candy. It's so sad to see talented actors like Nawazuddin Siddiqui be completely WASTED and pointless to the film's story.\n\nIf only the film actually tried to provide us with jokes that were actually funny and unique as well as giving a compelling story with fleshed out characters in the forefront rather than a bundle of cameos, references to past and current actors and illogical sequences that make you shake your head in disappointment.\n\nEven if you're a fan of the Housefull series, I reckon this installment won't satisfy your expectations. It's better to skip this one and watch something more worthy of your time."

And Riteish Deshmukh..that guy is a really good actor. Give him a break from the girly stuff. Johnny Lever ..feel sorry. There was nothing he could do when the script was so bad. Bobby Deol I interviewed you a while ago and you are so kind hearted and warm and I still love you. Dharamputra ko sau khoon maaf! Rana Daggubati.. what a let down after the classy Bahubali..but atleast you got the best line!\n\nThe outtakes were funnier than the film!\n\nMy husband Ajit sat mostly poker faced through the film that was a comedy, while I laughed at the absurdity of it all. He had the last word.\" Now you know how much I love you!\" He was keeling over in misery in Housefull 3\". To brave Housefull 4 is truly a demonstration of selfless true love..Lol.

It's only Akshay Kumar who gave his best. Though there were some great actors like Ritesh Deshmukh, Kriti Sanon, Johnny Lever but they couldn't make it up to the mark. Moreover it's better I talk less about Bobby Deol. Yeah one thing, Nawazuddin Siddiqui's presence made it a little cooler. Cinematography- 8/10 This is the point where Bollywood is improving day by day. Absolutely no words against the location chosen by the director. Everything looks absolutely fine regarding costume design, graphics used etc. Overall - 6/10 If you want to chill out for an evening just go and watch it with your friends. One suggestion don't have too much of high expectations like the ones from housefull one or any other comedy films of Akshay Kumar."

        "review_detailed_main": "#FinalVerdict\n\nHousefull 4 is that rare genre of films which will test your patience with its foolishness, shock you with its lack of logic & launch a vicious assault on your senses. Utter nonsense!\n\nUsually, a paragraph is devoted in reviews to detail the plot & screenplay but to say that Housefull 4 has even a semblance of the two is a poor joke. The audience is just going to shake their head in dismay & frustration as the intolerable cruelty unfolds.\n\nFridays are becoming a messy hodgepodge in Bollywood with each transient months, in the matter of getting an epochal release and a Diwali release is an event in itself. But the makers of Housefull 4 have literally shown a middle finger to the audiences. Sure, we relish madcap entertainers, but what director Farhad Samji serves in Housefull 4 transcends all limits. He attempts a crazy, simple entertainer yet again, but peppers it with inane, ridiculous episodes that makes you wonder, is this for real? Sara Bodinar and Sajid Nadiadwala's story drains you at the end, despite the actors putting their best foot forward to make you giggle. The banal jokes & the lame PJs coupled with the muddled screenplay are clearly responsible for the EPIC mess.\n\nThe soundtrack of Housefull 4 is pleasant, with the composer (Sohail Sen) belting out a couple of hummable tunes. The plush locales of London & the grandiose production design ( Subrata Chakraborty-Amit Ray) gives the film the required scale. And that's it.\n\nVFX should've been better. Editing (Rameshwar S Bhagat) is uneven. This singularly unfunny film plumbs the depths of comedic bankruptcy by a director who quite frankly, hasn't delivered anything funny in a long time.\n\nAkshay Kumar plays to the gallery but is letdown by the writing. Also, he tries too hard to be funny. Riteish Deshmukh hams to the hilt. Bobby Deol looks out of place completely. The leading ladies - Kriti Sanon, Pooja Hegd and Kriti Kharbanda - are pure eye candies. Chunky Panday is wasted. Ditto for Ranjeet, Johny Lever, Sharad Kelkar, Rana Daggubati and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.\n\nOn the whole, it'll be difficult for Housefull 4 to sustain once the initial euphoria settles down. It's all bad. All of it, every last instant, every single word. Simply put, Housefull 4 is an unforgivable farce. This is public harassment - a precise sentence I'll use to describe the experience. If you thought comedy could sink no further. Watch just 15 minutes of Housefull 4 and you'd be disavowed of that notion."

But Even as a standalone Comedy film this has utterly failed. The previous housefull movies at least made us laugh!\n\nExcept few scenes, the humour wasn't really there. The dialogues are poorly written, instead of making you laugh ; in reality they annoyed me a lot. Except Akshay's Portrayal other performances were just below average! I had high expectations from Ritesh But man did he disappoint!\n\nThere are only two Things that Liked in this film is one Akshay's performance as I said before and the CGI or Art Direction in general. Asthetically the film had high scales and properly maintaned their standards For the entire runtime. With a Premise that could have been interesting if done properly but has been totally wasted under lacklustre script writing and Bad choices.\n\nThe Tonality shifts, Between comedy and drama/action it just makes all the things more confusing! Sometimes these blends do work pretty well but it should be handled properly and under a expert supervision! Unlike here where the film itself doesn't know where it's headed, and makes the audience feel the same.\n\nThey should have focused more on the script and dialogues rather than investing lots of money in VFX department. If the content itself is good enough ; Average CGI would do the Job damn well!\n\nAfter finishing the movie I still don't get why Nawazuddin, one of the finest actors in this generation accepted to do that small ridiculous role! It was Sad to see to be honest.\n\nIn the end, I must say it's the Worst movie in the Franchise, Although I loved what Akshay has put on the table but His sole presence couldn't save the movie unfortunately.\n\nWith that poor of a script and direction, it was bound to fail."

Its Housefull and how can i forget it has to be stupid, and yes, i won the bet. Disappointed. Even Om Shanti Om of Farah Khan production was better than this.

Even Riteish also. So why they did it, are they unemployed? Why bobby here? He and Akshay looks too much old. They don't fit this crap comedy movie. For Akshay only, he is good in acting but bad in choosing. I think he does't ever choose any movie rather every movie offer he gets, he does the role. Most brainless and idotic movies in bollywood mostly made by Akhsay the hero.\n\nAkshay forgets and this is the worst part of the movie. What the actors are doing in this movie they know themselves. Song after every 10-15 minutes. Just a brainless full of hollow comedy. AVOID IT ANYHOW if you don't want to torture your existence. Otherwise, YOU'LL REGRET.\n\nThe director Farhad Samji, I checked his profile in IMDb, he has the creator of most of the crap movies now a days. Dilwale,It's entertainment, Golmall again, Houseful 2, Himmatwala, Houseful 3 etc.\n\nThe song Bala is good. Akshay is is good in acting. Johnny lever wasted."

Guiltilly or not.Even Anees Bazmee made Welcome which was a benchmark in Bollywood.But Sajid Khan And Farhad Samji are intollerable. Housefull 4 is a kind of a film which makes us compare which was the worse part first,second,third or fourth?while watching it because we are thrown in our thoughts at the very start of the film. Neither the film is much funny nor it has a kind of magic which makes us believ disbelief.\n\nI watched Entertainment directed by Farhad Samji as a child, this sort of films are crappy mind numbling creations filled with tacky humor and childish gags supported by hamming of deliberate actors. I did'nt enjoy Housefull 4 because i have grown up but i will argue confidently i won't have enjoyed it as a child also because not even a six-year old would be categorized as a age bracket in this sort of movie which is both misleading and illogical. And offensive is the word which already attached with housefull films.They insult women,they insult homos,they insult our minds and now they are insulting the ancient era's.\n\nTo be fair i have been an Akshay Kumar fan and i am his biggest fan since long time i have enjoyed his slapsticks such as Garam Masala and Bhagam Bhag they were dhamaal multistarrers but housefull 4 is not only offensive but it is unfunny and belongs to Humshakals family of films. But to give credit where it is due,the locations are mindblowing and some scenes with jokes do land expectedly Akshay Kumar is good as Bala but not great as Harry and tries too hard to make us laugh and mostly succeeds but Akshay Welcome and Bhool Bhulaiyaa were still far better films i would prefer on any day rest of the cast is wasted. What is also missing his bromance of Akshay and Riteish which is totally a concern because atlas it was a lifeline in these otherwise mindboggling films with idiotic gags and wholesome torture. But the grand presentation some average music (espesicially good Bala Track) and some hard hamming make it save from boredom by death. Chunkey pandey is also seen last time as Akhree Pasta! I believe !\n\n4/10"

We both enjoyed watching the film but its upto you that what's your taste is. I know it's a franchie so we expect more but this film doesn't deliver that comedy like his old movies. Acting is good, storyline is ok ok. The length of the film makes it boring. Akshay Sir is all over in the film. Songs makes the movie Lenghty. Movie doesn't need any song except Bala because this is the only song which make some people watch the film. Hahaha. I'll give 5 star because I enjoyed half of the movie of its runtime. Not that boring it is like people saying.. Its time pass movie. Review by - Mayank Bharat Bhushan Louteriya"

After watching this movie, I was shocked to know that this has broken all the records of previous Housefull.\n\nTbh, this movie can be awarded for the most offensive dialogues of the year 2019. People judging sexual preferences of other person, actress calling herself \"mein abla hu tabla nahi\" are one of the many disgusting lines given to the leads here.\n\nI was shocked to see that Akshay agreed to do such a movie which completely tarnishes his image as a person who is trying to give a social message by doing movies like \"Padman\", \"Toilet\" .\n\nThe only rating given by me is for the comic timing of Akshay apart from that this movie has absolutely nothing going for it. Sorry to see such a movie even being in theaters for so long forget about earning crores.\n\nSeriously, it's hard to understand that people thought it as a comedy as it shows the standard that the movies has degraded to these days"

        "review_detailed_main": "Now the story totally different then the remain with the same main actors. The story goes a few centuries back and mixed with the modern times in a place somewhere in India in a mythical place called Sitamgarh. Many of the scenes happened to Bala the main role (acted by Akshay ) have been made in his former reincarnation and as the strory unfolds after he 2/3 th of th movie affect the remain members of the story except . The ladies who understood\n\nThe ladies are more active than before as all ...\"have the karate belt \" .\n\n. .\n\n. .\n\nI m ...joking but this is true . All ladies are very capable to beat men ! This happens to more than 5 times in the movie .\n\nThe story concept is quite impressive even if the story is weird after near the first half in Sitamgarh and gets even more weirder as the story unfolds. Equilibrium is before end whre present and past coexist with all story members effected in this time-mix . A few examples:\n\nAksay is seen to discuss with the birds - something s omen?- later you see his friends do the same . Any other watching them thinks they are mad IN the same weird PoV the funny think man (Jony Lever ) identifies himself as a former dancing woman!\n\nThe today's Pappu identifies himself as a bad Hercules acting as Leonidas in the Marvel's movie 300 after the 3 friends identified him. Morphing CGI and a bit of fantasy helped for that. .Weird and funny together. Faulty by-remixing of Greek history in an Indian movie!!!\n\nMadhu + Bala = Madhubala the former names of the older pair. Very interesting word play (starring Akshay + Kriti) . Good also to notice Kriti is Crete in Greek and Madubala was one of the most famous Greek songs of the 60s era,\n\nBy closing here I dnt liked to the whole result. Ther are a a few horror scenes with full action with a very weird plot . Jut before the story revolution I felt well suffered from a rather boring plot although the end satisfied me in part.\n\n3/10."

All is going accordingly till their past life catches up to them.\n\nAfter seeing some reviewers bashing Housefull 4 and seeing a 3.3 rating on imdb I did not plan on seeing the film but my niece insisted so I had to. 10 min into the film and I am laughing already. I ended up loving the film and this is by far the most entertaining comedy film I have seen this year.\n\nAkshay is gold. He has done such an amazing job with his comic timing and expressions. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job. He is perfect for the role. He does two role with distinct personality differences and did a marvelous job. I liked most of the cast as well especially Chunky Pandey's work.\n\nThe set is gorgeous. The costumes are amazing. The film shows time period of 1419 and some gorgeous looking palaces. The film looks pretty, cinematography is excellent.\n\nSongs are nice. I liked Ek chumma and Shaitan ka saala. Dialogues are amazing. Most of the comedy relies on play on words and I found those hilarious. The most wonderful thing was that the film did not take itself too seriously there were some self-parody that I liked.\n\nI liked Housefull, and Housefull 3 but did not expect Housefull 4 to be this good. Very entertaining film. I haven't laughed this much in a while. The film deserves much higher rating than current 3.3."

They were supposed to marry the three lead actress but due to something (see the movie) cudnt marry and now Akshay reminds rest 5 of them about their rebirth to get married.\n\nDidn't reveal whole story here. A must watch for Akshay, ritiesh, Bobby and housefull fans"

A complete comedy entertainment, full of laughs, dashing dialogue timing and surprise sequences makes this movie highly outstanding. A great story presentation along with amazing historical scenes visualization.\n\nFantastic comedy twists displayed on many occasions with stunning acting from all the cast. Akshay kumar define himself to next level, and Bobby Deol is always a splendid actor, he must act more in future movies, Ritesh has performed equally important. All 3 heroines are pretty beautiful and acted very nicely, these 3 heroines must be given more movies in similar big budget because they are solid performers of present time."

The story very much reflects around him and keeps him in front of the audience for most part of the movie. Rest of the five actors/actresses have got their part of the roles almost equally divided. The actresses not only add glamour and beauty but also a lot of comedy and emotions. Other characters like hotel manager (played by Johnny Lever), Akhri Pasta (played by Chunky Pandey), Maharaj((played by Ranjit),etc. are equally supportive and entertaining. The villain of the movie, (Suryabhan/Michael) also does play an important part in the movie. The movie brings a rare/different type of story for the audience and is a must watch."

But most of the 1* reviews are of those guys who have a specific agenda and this anyone can verify by visiting their profiles.\n\nComing to Housefull 4 review. My review 5/10. IT PROMISES ENTERTAINMENT AND IT DELIVERS. If Golmaal Again is ok Total Dhamaal is ok then Housefull 4 is definitely OK. A thumbs up for the team from entertainment lovers.\n\nIt has slapstick moments as well as some hilarious situational comic moments. The blend of period and comedy works well. It is the grandest comedy to come out of Indian Film Industry. It is the first Reincarnation comedy to come out from cinema.\n\nPositives: Bala and Harry, characters that will be remembered for a long time by comedy lovers. Some ROFL moments in Akshay Kumar style. IHIYEYEE whenever this thing happened the audience were guaranteed to laugh.\n\nKriti Sanon who perfectly fits in the drama as well as comedy scenes.\n\nVFX and locales. Its a movie to be watched in a theatre.\n\nJohnny Lever and Ranjit provide some genuine laughable crazy moments.\n\nBackground score is nice one.\n\nClimax is a laugh riot...right from the Mujhse Shaadi Karogi song played :P to the 4 knives xD.\n\nTreat to watch characters in 2 eras.\n\nNegatives: Badla kawali in 2nd half.\n\nRiteish Deshmukh was a bit underutilised.\n\nSongs this time aren't as peppy and foot tapping as previous parts.\n\nAs it has slapstick humor some jokes fall flat and some are like laugh when the audience laughs.\n\nBobby Deol is kind of misfit in this movie as comedy is not his cup of tea although he tries.\n\nComedy movies have been bashed by critics but enjoyed by audience. Be it Dhol, Phir Hera Pheri, Bhagam Bhag, Dhamaal or Bhool Bhulaiyaa all have been given negative reviews. Housefull 4 is not in this league but it's decent in parts."
