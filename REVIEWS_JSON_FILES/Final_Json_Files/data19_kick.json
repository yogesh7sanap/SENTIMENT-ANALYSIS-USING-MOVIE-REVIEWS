        "review_detailed_main": "Very honestly, this movie is nothing extraordinary and one really wonders how it became such a colossal grosser.\n\nIt is however watchable and holds the interest entirely thanks to Salman Khan who has mastered the art of making slapstick hits.\n\nSalman is a natural entertainer, no doubt about that. He is the first person to acknowledge that he is not making art cinema, so bearing that in mind Kick is entertaining enough in its genre. Salman has the unique knack of making even the crass entertaining. It is his expressions and the nonchalant way he goes about it that lets him get away with it.\n\nI loved Ready the most of his recent movies, followed by Partner and Dabangg. Kick is more on par with Jai Ho, but as I said before, Kick is certainly watchable and especially so for Salman Khan fans. I have to admit that I have a soft corner for Salman:)"

        "review_detailed_main": "A remake of the Telugu film of the same name, 'Kick', which marks the Directorial Debut of Sajid Nadiadwala, is a film that rides on the sheer star-power of Salman Khan. And expectedly, Salman dominates the show with a charismatic, energetic performance, that leads the film. He's in top form!\n\n'Kick' Synopsis: An adrenaline junkie walks away from a whirlwind romance and embraces a new life as a thief, though he soon finds himself pursued by veteran police officer and engaged in a turf war with a local gangster.\n\nAs a film, 'Kick' is entertaining, but in parts. The first-hour is superb, with the comedic as well as the romantic sequences, working big time. The second-hour is considerably weak. The entire cat & mouse game between the thief & the cop lacks the fizz. Also, the culmination looks hurried & even the villain's track, for that matter of fact, isn't full-proof.\n\nChetan Bhagat & Nadiadwala's Adapted Screenplay begins on the correct note & hits all the right points, but weakens in the latter hour. A much stronger second-hour was most definitely needed! Nadiadwala's Direction is lavish. Even the Production Values are outstanding! Cinematography is brilliant. Each & every frame has been captured beautifully. Editing is alright. Music by Himesh Reshammiya & Meet Bros Anjjan is foot-tapping. Action-Sequences are spectacularly executed.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Salman is the life of 'Kick'. As Devi, he's absolutely lovable, while as Devil, he's ferocious & heroic. The Superstar's charisma alone makes 'Kick' watchable. He doesn't fail to deliver, even when the writing dips. It's a super act, without doubt! Jacqueline Fernandez looks gorgeous & does reasonably well. Randeep Hooda is perfect as the tough cop. Nawazuddin Siddiqui enacts the villain well, although he tends to go over-the-top at times. Mithun Chakraborty is winsome in a cameo. Saurabh Shukla is wasted. Sanjay Mishra & Kavin Dave are hilarious. Nargis Fakhri sizzles in an item number.\n\nOn the whole, Watch 'Kick' for Salman. He's still got it & how!"

After watching on my computer it was not the same experience. Despite that it is a decent movie and you cannot take that away from it. What I would like to highlight is even if the experience was not liked the first time my emotions still flew. I mean my eyes were wet when the girl who was ill emerged.\n\nIt is not like most of the Salman Khan movies, thus being underrated cause me discomfort. As a fan and as a human being one should appreciate his work as charity. A movie inspired from that is something that I appreciate.\n\nSalman looked great throughout the movie. A tip I would like to give him. It is he looked better with a 'non'clean-shaved look.\n\nTone, Script & Story: See IMDb Storyline.\n\nDirection, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified and were Eye candy. Music: Good. Acting: Justified.\n\nFinal Verdict: It is a decent movie. If you love Salman's work, you will love it even more. All I wanted was to feel kick like the first time I watched it but that's OK."

        "review_detailed_main": "You have an intelligent cop chasing after a foxy thief who specializes in high rung robberies and speeds off on a bike or a cycle or whatever he can lay hands on. He also informs the police well in advance where he is going to strike next and he does and the cops cannot do anything about it.\n\nNope! I am not talking about the DHOOM series, I am writing about KICK-replace Randeep Hooda with Abhishekh Bachan, the film would pretty well be named DHOOM 4 and can boast of Salman Khan as the new villain in the series. But alas- we have the thief here as the main protagonist, and Randeep Hooda intelligent than Abhishekh Bachan and dumb heroine who can't act to save her life-is a psychiatrist but lets a weirdo play mind games with her.\n\nThe movie begins in Poland where psychiatrist Shaina Mehra (Jacquline Fernandez)meets her future husband Police man Himanshu (Randeep Hooda), and comes clean about an affair she had with a weirdo Devi lal Singh (Salman Khan) who she breaks up as he is not serious about life and does not do anything unless it gives him a kick. Himanshu tells her that he is in Poland hunting a clever thief Devil (Salman Khan) who has till now successfully got away with heists worth 600 crores INR.\n\nBefore long both of them realize that Devilal and Devil are the same person and he has a major agenda on his hand in Poland and is in fact using both Himanshu and Shaina to pull off a heist on philanthropist Shiv Gazra (Nawazuddin Siddiqui).\n\nThe story line is intelligent, but there are huge gaping holes in the screenplay which surprisingly was worked upon by 4 writers Rajat Arora, Keith Gomes, Sajid Nadiadwala and surprise surprise Chetan Bhagat. It might well have been written by a novice and all he needed was to watch the Telugu DVD from which the movie was made, as the movie is 95% faithful scene by scene to the original.\n\nSalman has a cool air throughout the movie and you do not see him switching between the two characters as he should be, instead you are subjected to \"this is my movie-I will do what I wish\" attitude.\n\nJacqueline Fernandez has only 30 seconds of fame in the song \"Jumma Ke raath\" where she breaks into a hot jig and leaves everyone gasping for more. And the rest of the movie she would actually give a complex to a zombie. The role required someone more mature and someone who can actually act.\n\nRandeep Hooda will go down in history as the only lead actor who has managed to hold his own in a Salman Khan movie, it is sheer pleasure to watch this talented actor underplay his role and his dead pan one liners in the climax are absolutely hilarious since he delivers them with a straight face.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui gives a striking performance as the psychotic villain, but he is not given enough screen time to actually perform to his fullest. It is sad to see Mithun Chakraborothy accepting such inane roles. Nargis Fakhri is not exactly a malaiaka Arora to set the screen ablaze with her item, one of the easily forgettable visuals in the film. All said and done, go ahead and watch this movie if you have nothing interesting to do, or if you are a die hard Salman Khan and if you have not seen the original."

The movie starts with an absurd fighting sequence that is stretched beyond any reason. The movie is too cheesy and Salman Khan looks like a dimwit for even agreeing to act in this movie. No character, no substance and a total waste of time! The whole story revolves around Salman Khan like any of his new movies, and tries hard to project him as a larger than life figure with cheap antics."

Khan is wonderful in his role, as is Hooda. Though Fernandez is not as strong an actor as the other two, she acts naturally and believably. The songs (with the exception of \"Hangover\") and choreography are average, but the filmography is grand. Overall, this thriller will keep the viewer thoroughly entertained."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have not watched the Telugu version.\n\nBut if you were to ask me what is the most annoying thing about its remake, then I would say this peculiar background jingle \"Kickya Kickaaaa...\" that plays every time the lead character tries to be over- smart or punches a dialog on to our face.\n\nSalman Khan supposedly plays a superhero with a Godly name Devi because even after sitting through the 140-minute torture, I couldn't fathom his actual role. Narrowing it down, he is the good Devi Singh for the world and his girlfriend (Fernandez), but is also the evil Devil for his enemies. But at the end, everything mixes up and you wonder if it was the most outrageous Samaritanship you have seen on-screen. He can teleport, fly, dance, break-dance, smirk, jump from bridges/skyscrapers, ride a weird vehicle, save women from being molested, pay up hapless children's hospital fees, et cetera..\n\nThe film is basically about how Devi Singh takes on the original evil guys (Siddiqui, Sharma) with a mask that looks like Krrish has put on weight. This you will see if you are brave enough to control your patience after 30 minutes into the film. Khan uses slapstick and situational comedy to bring out screw-ball, but fails disastrously. His expressions, stances, dialogs all blew. Not to mention many sequences were taken from his previous potboilers. He acts childishly throughout and instantly turns into a hard-faced dandy when confronted. I can even say that this is Khan's worst performance for me.\n\nHooda can be seen in one of the wasted roles of his career and for the first time I am disappointed with Siddiqui as well. He only cackles through the film and that is the second most irritating thing. There is no vindictiveness nor there is any substance about his villainy. Fernandez is hot, agreed. She slightly resembles Zeenat Aman, agreed. But can she act? If your definition of acting is wearing a body-sticking top and a very short pant, trying to be more voluptuous than Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, then YES.\n\nComing to the screenplay. Chetan Bhagat has maybe charmed me once or twice with his writing but this is pure buffoonery. Screenplay can be divided into 3 parts: first - the 40 minute stupidity, then some melodrama and cheap twisty plot points stitched together, third - predictable climax with a hackneyed flashback. Writing is preposterous and all this substandard parameters just downs the whole parade.\n\nIt mixes action and humor, and while few Hollywood films get away with it, this was bad. Terribly bad. The stunts are poorly choreographed, showing us not the actual fights but the aftermaths where Devi Singh comes out victorious. Every time. It has 4-5 songs for its supposedly cheesy audience with Narghis Fakhri coming to quench your lusty desire (hope is audacious?!).\n\nIt references Dhoom 2 & Jai Ho. If you were to mix up those films and create an output, you would get an unedited version of Kick. Hrithik Roshan skated in Dhoom 2, here Khan cycles. Roshan had a revolutionary mask in Krrish, here Khan has a toy mask with red outline. While I did appreciate where the second half was going and suddenly my hopes went up, it was soon diverted into the usual climactic pitch, leaving me tired, stabbed and dead.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Kick may look like it is for Khan's fans, but trust me it is worse than Jai Ho, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, etc.. Although there is this one animated sequence that I loved, depicting Devi Singh's childhood, it cannot really be termed as a salvaging factor. The animation is top-class. If I could advice, I would say just erase the thought of going for this. It sucks.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

        "review_detailed_main": "When the trailer of Kick came out, I actually thought this is going to be a superhero movie about a vigilante who saves people on a bicycle, because of how it was shown. I thought his superpowers will be enhanced senses. And of course that's what Kick is about, except it's not good. Kick is one of those Salman Khan films which basically remind you what Salman Khan films are all about. Plus this is directed by Kabir Khan, who is like the directors with whom Salman Khan makes all his films. When I watched it as a teenager I really liked it. But now...meh.\n\nKick is about a guy named Devi Lal something something, who was born on 29 February because of which he became an adrenaline junkie. He was born laughing instead of crying, rode a cycle on the 10th floor sitting on it backwards, he has every degree on the planet, he doesn't do a job because he doesn't get a \"kick\", he pees upside down etc. So basically you get what kind of a person he is. He falls for a psychologist whom he calls Madam Psycho (apparently Salman Khan fans are supposed to find it funny). She insults him so he leaves her to become Devil, a vigilante who steals money to save kids who have cancer.\n\nThe problem with this film is that it wants to be cool, but it doesn't have the means to be. Devi's childhood is shown in a cartoon with an animation that can even make Motu Patlu feel ashamed. When he is fighting the security guards, their bones are shown to get broken in Mortal Kombat's style, except the animation is too smooth to look natural. Devi makes a hologram at home which is supposed to trick Randeep Hooda into thinking it is actually him, but when he stands in the hologram's way it passes through him giving out light and sound, instead of the projector way that holograms are supposed to give.\n\nKick is a fantasy for a chhapri, no doubt about that. It's something they'd love to watch. I only saw it thinking it's going to be something unique. But it has Salman Khan in it so what was I even thinking? If you are some Salman Khan loving chhapri who has never watched a single movie with good VFX, you might actually like this. But if you have seen literally anything else, you won't like it."

In the name of art they are looting people and big banners block all screens too such that common people do not have option to watch other movies as I wanted to watch Pizza 3D but no screen was available.

        "review_title": "Despite its shortcomings, this is one of the better films of Salman which might remind you of finding your own KICK in life before its all over.",
        "review_detailed_main": "First addressing the people interested in slamming it down due to its avoidable minuses, yes the film defies all logics as always seen in a typical Hindi film aiming at entertaining its larger section of viewers, ignoring the others. It doesn't offer any fresh or unpredictable storyline taking the easy path. Has a longer length with few unwanted scenes and mediocre songs thrown in uselessly hindering its otherwise likable progression. Takes too long to come to its actual story plot. Has few close resemblances to films like THE GENTLEMAN, KRISHH and DHOOM, whereas is yet another remake of a South hit with the same title KICK (Telugu) released in 2009. And needless to say has Salman Khan in almost every frame of the film right till its last minute as desired by his die-hard fans who have fondly given him the title of BHAI.\n\nBut having said that, KICK still cannot be rated as anything bad or ridiculous despite having all the above mentioned hiccups in its around 145 minutes of duration. And the reason behind this contradiction is that the film does have a breezy entertaining feel maintained till its impressive climax, has few enjoyable sequences coming in at regular intervals performed well by all the known faces and it holds you on firmly through some superbly written dialogues by Rajat Aroraa.\n\nTo give you a fair idea, KICK has no cheap sequences, objectionable lines or cheeky avoidable humour as seen in many of Salman's recent films including JAI HO. It doesn't drag after a while and keeps progressing at a brisk pace, though having all those unwanted songs and sequences adding to its extra length. It doesn't go into that silly & boring 'Love Angle' mode as the latest sequels of KRRISH and DHOOM do. Keeps the much needed fun element intact even till its finale leaving you with all positive vibes. And more importantly this is one of those rare films where Salman Khan doesn't take off his shirt in any of his last minute fights breaking his own set norm religiously followed in the last few years.\n\nBesides where Salman successfully manages to keep you hooked in the first half along with Randeep Hooda & Jacquelin, there Nawazzudin Siddiqui comes in to provide his big noteworthy support post intermission keeping the energy going. And saying the bitter truth, both Randeep and Nawazuddin frankly can be called the second source of oxygen to this latest Salman Khan movie made on a weak premise. In addition, KICK also gets some valuable strength from its entertaining supporting acts led by Sanjay Mishra in his only scene at the Police Station, Mithun Chakraborty as the spirited father, Saurabh Shukla as the girl's pa, Archana Puransingh in her one scene playing the loud mother, Kavin Dave-Sumona in the film's opening chase sequence and Vipin Sharma as the enjoyable, annoyed minister towards the end.\n\nPlus two other thankful saviors of KICK are that this time the lead actress doesn't tease you at all due to her calm & pleasing appearance (ignoring her diction) and the lead actor i.e. Salman doesn't look like an arrogant, over confident star performing the role at his own will, ignoring any specific demand of his actual character written in the script. In other words KICK has the Salman Khan we saw in WANTED & DABANGG, but not the one witnessed in READY, BODYGUARD, EK THA TIGER or DABANGG 2 to be precise.\n\nMoreover it's the unexpectedly surprising debut achievement by the director-producer Sajid Nadiadwala which simply makes you think that why Sajid didn't opt for direction in all these years for any of Salman's film, since he has actually managed to deliver a much better product than many renowned directors of the industry, unarguably. Anyway a good start has been made with a bang and I hope he will give us much better films in the future which would ideally be based on some original scripts and not just be the routine remakes of the south following the easier path. Interestingly one fight sequence in its first half has been straight away taken from Prakash Mehra - Amitabh Bachchan's SHARAABI released in 1984. And I would really like to know that whether it was unintentional or Sajid actually wished to pay a tribute to the master film-maker in his very first venture.\n\nComing back to KICK, cinematography & action gives an international look to the film, especially post intermission in its actions sequences and background score keeps the tempo high as required. Sadly the soundtrack remains the weakest link of the film once again and one or two catchy hit songs could have easily taken the project to another level altogether. Here the point to be noted is that the original Telugu movie does have few melodious upbeat tracks composed well. So I wonder why they didn't go for the official rights of those songs only, following the ROWDY RATHORE route playing it safe.\n\nNow apart from the commercial aspect, the one thing I would personally like to appreciate here is that since his last two attempts, Salman is trying to give a social message through his films fulfilling his moral responsibility towards the people being their loving celebrity. Unfortunately he failed to give that message impressively in JAI HO but has once again tried to do the same in KICK. And I hope this time the message reaches the maximum, encouraging them all to find their individual KICK of life, before the time is over.\n\nSumming up, I would like to rate KICK as a much better movie than KRRISH 3, DHOOM 3 or even EK THA TIGER in terms of entertainment. So Salman is definitely here to get a bigger Iddi this festive season along with Randeep and Nawazuddin loudly claiming their respective shares too."

This time Salman bang the BOLLYWOOD with KICK. Almost 7th month passed and there wasn't a Blockbuster and with Kick here it is. Shania (Jacqueline Fernandez) parents ask him to see Himanshu (Randeep Hooda) and during train journey Shania narrate about Devi Laal (Salman Khan)who is free soul man who always search fun and ready to help and how he left her because of her insulting behavior. On the other hand Himanshu is chasing a thief Devil. The Story has many twist and angles and full of drama. It has fun, music, action and also has some social message. This is Sajid's debut as Director whereas he has a stature as Producer. Go for Kick for Salman, for Jacquline, for music and entertainment. A joy ride for cine-goer."

        "review_detailed_main": "Over the past few years, we all know what to expect from a Salman Khan film. A wafer thin plot, a bad guy, some good music, a beautiful but dumb heroine, a little of romance, drama and comedy and above all - a larger than life Salman Khan.\n\nSalman rarely plays a character in his film. Some exceptions were Dabbang and Ek Tha Tiger. Otherwise Salman plays himself in most of his films. We all know his acting abilities and hence as an audience we are prepared for his movies well in advance.\n\nKick is a typical Salman affair. It has all the ingredients as mentioned above. The story of man who changes jobs because he doesn't get a 'kick' from them could have been interesting but the writers and makers are more interested in Salman.\n\nThe plot has many holes and as usual the logic factor is missing. A lot of questions were moving in my mind. But when Salman is on screen, you tend to forget them for that moment because the man demands your attention and kept me entertained.\n\nAnother person who seems to be having a time of his life is Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Currently, one of India's finest actors, he delivers one excellent performance as the villain. He beautifully hams it and plays the comic book villain to the perfection. There are just two scenes between Nawaz and Salman and Nawaz makes Salman look like a statue with his performance. Brilliant.\n\nMithun and Hooda are completely wasted as Salman's father and the cop hunting Salman. I know why an excellent actor like Hooda would have signed this film and thats the irony for terrific actors like Nawaz and Hooda in Bollywood.\n\nJacqueline plays the beautiful but dumb psychiatrist to perfection. The music is good and some of the banter between Salman and Hooda is good fun.\n\nKick is a timepass film. It is better than Bodyguard and Ready but nowhere close to Ek Tha Tiger and Dabbang 1."

But the two plus point of the movie is first its music and second awesome negative performance by Nawazuddin Siddiqi. Surely this movie gonna be in 100 crore club but as far as I am concerned it is another disappointment from Salman Khan.God knows when we will be able to see a strong scripted movie from him."

Salman khan is a genius if I think of it. Why the hell would he change anything if the idiots out there keep excepting this crap. Why even try to do something better. I mean people that are calling this a classic need to get their head examined. I'm not a Salman khan fan but I loved him in Wanted and the original dabaang but now it's getting ridiculous. I just saw xpose with himesh and I can say with a straight face that his performance and te film was an Oscar contender compared to Kick. We as an audience need to start rejecting this garbage or a day will come where Hindi films be nothing but this nonsense."

        "review_title": "Kick: A Glossy Salman Masala Fare",
        "review_detailed_main": "There is a new genre which has originated in the last few years and it is called the Salman Khan genre of Bollywood movie, which has only one highlight and that is Salman himself. Kick also explores the typical Salman Khan genre of movie and takes it to dizzying heights with a glossy packaging by Sajid Nadiadwala who debuts as a director with Kick.\n\nKick is the remake of Telugu blockbuster of 2009 with the same name, but Sajid has made enough and more changes in the screenplay to fit it to the bollywood mold. It tells us the story of Devi Lal Singh (Salman Khan) a Good Samaritan who gets a Kick by doing odd jobs which gives him an adrenaline rush, what instigates him to become Devil is explored in the 146 mins of screen time.\n\nThe Story is by Vakkantham Vamsi and screenplay by Rajat Arora, Keith Gomes, Sajid Nadiadwala himself and with additional screenplay by Chetan Bhagat. The beginning is weak which explores Shaina (Jacqueline Fernandez) and Devi Lal (Salman Khan) love story which goes nowhere excluding some funny sequences. The screenplay picks up with the entry of Inspector Himanshu Rai (Randeep Hooda) and Devil (Salman Khan) and it suddenly becomes a racy thriller till the climax. It has too many characters with too many plots going in parallel which has no relevance to the main plot. There are too many loop holes in the script which does not form a cohesive narration. But it is the dialogues of Rajat Arora which is the winner and brings the applause and the whistles.\n\nSajid Khan has not compromised on anything, whether it is the lavish settings, brilliant action sequences and grand song picturization. As a debut Sajid has shown a spark as a film maker. He does complete justice to Salman Khan the star, giving him a larger than life role and showcasing all the Salman antics which he knows will be lapped up by the audience. While watching this movie and the way the audience were going berserk it proved that Sajid has a winner in hand. I hope only if he invested a bit more on the screenplay then it would have been a complete package.\n\nCinematography by Ayananka Bose is another highlight of the movie; Ayananka captures Polland and India beautifully. Action by Anal Arasu is very impressive especially the Bus chase sequence in Warsaw.\n\nAlmost all Salman Khan movies are strong in music content, and Kick is no exception. Himesh Reshamiya (Jumme ki Raat & Tu Hi Tu), Meet Bros (Hangover) and Yo Yo Honey Singh (Yaar Na Mila) have given foot tapping music. To compliment it Ahmed Khan has choreographed the songs beautifully and on a lavish scale. Though as per the screenplay Jumme Ki Raat and Yaar Na Mila look a bit forced.\n\nAfter Dabangg , Salman Khan looks at ease in Kick, he makes a strong impact with a tailor made role of Devil which was missing in his last few movies. Randeep Hooda as Himanshu Rai does a brilliant job and stands tall in front of Salman's larger than life portrayal. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the main villain Shivam brings the arch typical villain of Bollywood back with his portrayal and is excellent. In this movie it was important to have a very strong actor playing the villain to compliment Salman's Devil and Nawazuddin does complete justice. Jacqueline Fernandez does not have much to do other than looking good and she does add the glamor quotient well. Mithun Chakroborty, Archana Puran Singh, Saurabh Shukla, Sanjay Mishra & Vipin Sharma are wasted in brief roles.\n\nSajid Nadiadwala does a successful job of creating a typical Salman Khan blockbuster and it will definitely rake in the moolah, but my humble suggestion please do not look out for logic and you will be not be disappointed. Kick is definitely a movie for the Salman Khan fans."

Remade from a tamil movie, this movie is yet another worst piece of logic less movie of him, that has on the contrary, made fans drool over him and the collections is the proof.

        "review_detailed_main": "The wait is finally over!! The tremendous expectations and the hype for KICK is truly worthy!! Every film which contains Salman Khan, one thing is clear: \"Unabashed Entertainment\"!! And yet, this star gives it to you time and again!! So here we go:\n\nStory: Let me tell you that the story is truly different from what you've come across in most of the films. Devi Lal Singh (Salman Khan) is an adventurous guy and his life is incomplete without one thing: \"KICK\"! Without KICK, there is no fun, no excitement for him! He falls for a psychiatrist Shaina (Jacqueline Fernandez), Shaina doesn't like Devi first but after she gets to know about him, she also shows her affection for him. But due to uncertain circumstances, their life has another plans! Adding to it, there are other characters which makes the movie more interesting!\n\nCast: Salman Khan: There are simply no words to describe this actor! He truly raises his bar for his films and his stardom with every film!! Ever since WANTED (2009), his fame has reached to another level with huge leaps and bounds!! All I can say is, especially to all the Salman fans: \"Rejoice\"!! For the actor delivers yet another power-packed performance!\n\nJacqueline Fernandez: She is going to get more praises and fan-following after this film, which will change her image for various people who think that she is just a glam quotient in films!! I can say that she emerges as a competitor to all the \"A-List Actresses\" in town!! She is beautiful, glamorous, charming and sexy!! She is truly remarkable in a full-fledged role!\n\nRandeep Hooda: This actor is no less than the top actors!! He is just magnificent!! Not many actors have the opportunity to have a screen presence with a star like Salman! But he truly compliments very well with scenes with Salman especially!!\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui: He is a masterpiece!! He charms you in every role that he has played, whether big or small!! And as the antagonist, he succeeds with expectations you might have from him!! His screen presence and the dialogues he delivers will take you by surprise!!\n\nDirection: Sajid Nadiadwala, as we all know, has given many hits time and again but what you see with this film, you will never believe that it is directed by a debutant!! It doesn't feel that you are watching a typical Bollywood film! And this film proves that Bollywood is at par with Hollywood!! The film has an international level with never- before seen actions, remarkable thrilling moments, powerhouse dialogues and the extravagant screenplay!!! And getting all these elements from a first-time director is no easy task!! Worth applauding!!\n\nMusic: The music is another element that compliments to this enterprise!! \"Jumme Ki Raat\" is a rage among people, \"Hangover\" sung by Salman himself is another wonderful creation, \"Yaar Na Miley\" is another tune worth hearing! Another version of \"Hangover\" by Shreya Ghoshal is truly beautiful! Overall, another well-composed music from Himesh Reshammiya!\n\nOverall Verdict: On the whole, KICK is a Bollywood film that has tremendous appeal and repeat value!! It will be loved by classes and masses especially for Salman fans, this film is no less than to \"rejoice and celebrate\"!! It has a bland first hour, but the second hour takes the film to another level and that also, with terrific elements at the right time!! It has all the power to rewrite \"box-office history\" and will be glorious in days to come!!\n\nRating:****"

        "review_detailed_main": "Salman Khan is one such star who has been entertaining the Bollywood film industry for 25 years. Many naysayers believe his films are illogical but do Salman's fan even care about? KICK was one of the best Bollywood action movie made in the recent time with well-executed action scenes , snippy-snazzy stunts and of course it gives you one and the only SALMAN KHAN's charisma.It is enthralling and gives you an entertainment potion right from the beginning till the end.\n\nAs Shania and Himanshu meet each other to discuss about their prospective marriage in a train narrating their past story , little they know that they are talking of one person who is common between them had changed their respective lives - Devil Lal Singh or the Devil who loves to get an adrenalin rush with a KICK in his life.\n\nCelebrity producer Sajid Nadiawala gets into the director's chair for the first and chooses a Telgu remake of same name that came in 2009. The trailer was definitely a big thumbs up along with chart busting music. For the first time, I went to see the movie being as general audience rather than a Salman's fan and to my surprise I loved the film right from the beginning till the end. The movie begins on big note with a grand entry of Salman ( always something to look forward ) with whistle and noise cheering from the audience and next follows is few comic scenes along with romantic track. For the first 45 mins, the movie has nothing much going in its favor but gains steam aftermath once Salman gets into the character of Devil. The cat-mouse game between Hooda and Salman , the action sequences well shot in Glasglow, Scotland and climax between Salman and Nawazzuddin are some of highlights of the film. On the flip side, the editing is loose with shallow script which hinders the movement of the film. The film could easily be trimmed making it more impacting. Background score is decent. Cinematography is fabulous. Art direction is enchanting. Action sequences have been well-choreographed. Music by Himehs and Meet Brothers ( who gave musical score in Ragini MMS 2) is foot-tapping. Salman Khan steals the thunder with a convincing performance. After Tere Naam, I liked his emotional outburst scenes when he is about to save the cancer patient. He will be applauded for entertainment which is expected out of him. Randeep Hooda will surely get recognized after this film. He is outstanding as the diligent cop. Need we say anything about Nawazuddin Siddique. He is one of finest actor we have in Hindi Cinema and am sure , he will be more popular after his shrewd and cunning yet enjoyable character. Jacqueline Fernandez is looking gorgeous but need to work on acting skills.\n\nOverall , KICK delivers what it promises - Entertainment. This has style as well as substance. Salman's super stardom and well-defined content will make it sustainable at the ticket window and has good legs to prolong its splendid run. Good 3 /5"

        "review_detailed_main": "In order to deteriorate the cinematic aesthetics, one more addition to the pretentious genre-defying all basic elements of storytelling and narrative, it is again style over substance with Salman Khan's superficial extravaganza in a South Indian remake of the same name.\n\nDevi Lal Singh (Salman Khan) is frantically searching for \"Kick\" which gives him real pleasure whatever work he does. Devi falls in love with Shaina (Jacqueline Fernandez) a psychiatrist. On account of some disparities, Devi leaves Shaina. On the other side, a top cop Himanshu (Randeep Hooda) is searching for a masked robber called Devil. Then there is a baddie Faroz (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) who is the target of Devil.\n\nSajid Nadiadwala's directorial debut is half baked with mediocre scenes. He uses the template made for Salman, inserts different actors, an item-song, some absurd and abrupt comedy scenes, that is all and it will sure earn 200 crores. His effort to bring Salman in every frame is pointless as it does not serve any purpose. Salman is patronizingly taking the advantage of his persona and style.\n\nSalman Khan again plays himself as his previous films with the stiffness in his dancing and tacky dialog delivery. His body language is exactly same as it was in his previous films Dabangg, Bodyguard, Ready or Jai Ho etc.\n\nRandeep Hooda does a good job; however, his character is the victim of poor writing. Being a potent actor, with the limited screen presence Nawazuddin Siddiqui gives a good performance but sometimes it is annoying, goes over the top and looks like ham. There is no clear motivation behind Siddiqui's character running behind the money.\n\nJacqueline looks beautiful as a psychiatrist who can dance extremely well but does not have any patient to take care of.\n\nThe plethora of decent actors cannot save the movie due to irregularities in the screenplay. We see Mithun Chakraborty, Sanjay Mishra, Archana Puran Singh and Saurabh Shuka but everyone gets unobserved.\n\nThere is nothing new in \"Kick\" except the word \"kick\" has been spoken uncountable times. The narrative jumps from one place to another without giving you any logic or precise motive behind the happenings. Larger than life actions sequences with songs shoved in between.\n\nAvoid this piece of junk unless you are an unshakable Salman Khan fan."

The film is right out of Salman Khan's wardrobe, but the best thing about it is that it surprises you in the second half.\n\nWhat I love about Kick is that it has a fantastic social message, which not many films have these days, but it looks like Salman is really trying to focus on this, since Jai Ho. There are many scenes however, that will remind you of Dhoom 3. The way Salman goes about his business, plays the cop Randeep Hooda and certainly some of the action scenes looks like it's been ripped out of the Dhoom 3 book of Aamir Khan.\n\nThis is a through and through Salman Khan film. His comedy and romance in the first half is brilliant, and his action and portrayal of anger in the second simply superb. In my opinion, this is his best performance since Dabangg, and wipes the floor clean of the likes of Jai Ho.\n\nJacqueline Fernandez looks out of this world on screen and shares a fantastic chemistry with Salman. She is definitely here to stay and I'm looking forward to seeing her in bigger chunkier roles like Kick. It's great that she was not dubbed for the film as her Hindi has come a long way.\n\nRandeep Hooda is a revelation and every film I watch of this guy, I become a bigger fan. He is suave, stylish and packs a punch with his cop role, and walks shoulder to shoulder with Salman in each of their scenes together.\n\nOther notable performances are Nawazuddin Siddiqui who has seriously come a long way from his minor part in Sarfarosh to become a fantastic supporting actor. Sanjai Mishra has a very small role but will make you laugh non stop. Mithun Chakraborty is very effective too.\n\nThe music from Himesh Reshammiya is disappointing and only Jumme Ki Raat and Yaar Na Miley are catchy enough for you to want to sing. The film lacked a really good romantic song - Salman Khan's Hangover is certainly not that!\n\nOverall the film is power packed Salman film with excellent supporting performances, a lot of action but a fantastic social message at the end which really makes you think about how we live our life, and the struggles of some of the unfortunate ones."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Dil me aata Hun, samajh me nahi\" \u2013 This tag line literally has summarized most Salman-starers in recent past; where logic takes a backseat and entertainment is the key-word. Post the not-so-good BO performance of 'Jai ho', Dabangg Khan is back to his Robin Hood territory of a man of Grey actions but a heart of gold. Ace producer Sajid Nadiadwala has for the first time, stepped in director's shoes and does a decent job riding on Khan's repute and some class performances. A brief about what kicks this 'Kick' \u2013\n\n\u0095 Plot: What do you get when you mix 'Ready' comedy, 'Dhoom-2' plot and 'Jai ho' emotions? A 'Kick'! Yes, this one is a clear-cut deja- vu cocktail with ingredients in that sequence. First half is slow and bores with its mindless gags and mad situations. However, the movie picks pace a little before intermission and continues to accelerate in the second half when romance takes a backseat and action-drama takes over. Though the climax isn't great, it doesn't disappoint either. In all, it does manage to give the audience a kick (adrenaline rush) with paisa-vasool entertainment.\n\n\u0095 Cast: A Salman film is supposed to be a one-man show. Not his one, as it gives enough footage to Randeep Hooda and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Salman is as usual his entertaining self, looking more handsome and fit than he did in his earlier flicks (with or without French-beard). What differentiates this one from Dhoom series is clearly Hooda, who doesn't appear a loser and gives equal takkar to Khan with his killer mannerisms. However, what gives this movie the real kick is Nawaz! This man clearly overshadows Khan with his brief yet emphatic role. His devilish yet funny reactions steal the show from the on-screen 'DeviL'. It seems villains are the flavor of this season. After awesome performance by Riteish Deshmukh in 'Ek villain', Nawaz's villaingiri will be fondly remembered. Jacqueline adds to the glam quotient (esp. in Jumme Ki rat song) and emulates Kat to some extent. Interestingly, she is nowhere to be seen in the last 15 minutes of the movie. Rest of the actors \u2013 Mithun DA, Archana Puran Singh, Saurabh Shukla, Sanjai Mishra and Sumona just come and go. Nargis Fakri fails to mesmerize in her item number.\n\n\u0095 Music: They say \u2013 \"Too many chefs spoil the dish\". Same happened here as a mock tail of Himesh, Yo Yo and Meet bros couldn't do any magic and ended up creating average music. Jumme Ki rat sounds more like Chintata and Yaar Na mile is unexceptional. However, Salman shows signs of improvement as singer \u2013 Hangover is melodious to some extent. Ahmed Khan's choreography is ordinary.\n\nFor those searching for some meaning and logic or any other serious stuff, this one is not for you. However, Kick doesn't fail to entertain and with no major release coming in the next 2 weeks, this one will surely mint gold at box-office. Watch it for Nawaz, Hooda and of course Salman.\n\nBhai Ki Eidi ban-ti hai!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had seen the Telugu version of \"Kick\" and I wasn't really impressed by it. I felt it had a nice concept but it could have been better. I didn't really have High Hopes for Kick but when I saw the trailer, I felt that this movie could be different. I had a few doubts since the Original version had many unnecessary scenes which hampered the overall impact of the movie.\n\nWhen I saw this movie , today . I really felt good. It was a well made movie. And Considering the amount of vulgarities shown in the these types of masala movies . Kick didn't have any.\n\nStory Wise : The Story is a bit different from the original. The first half has less BS from the Earlier version. Though it drags and is annoying sometimes(on many occasions , lack of logic) but the decent flow of songs and the antics of Salman Khan keep you in the loop. the Action Sequence was excellent ( Well Choreographed , Excellent VFX)\n\nThe 2nd Half is a Game Changer. Apart from a couple of illogical scenes .This half is a total roller coaster ride.Action Sequences are top notch with some excellent cinematography esp in the Poland Sequences.\n\nActing : Salman Khan is back with a bang. Be it the comic, serious or even the romantic scenes.He was Fantastic in all of them . He was enjoying the role. Randeep Hooda was top notch. Really impressed. Finally he gets a role to show case his talent. Excellent. Badass.\n\nNawazuddin was a revelation . He was mesmerizing from the his start till the end. He was excellent in his every scene. Jacqueline was sweet in her role. She is extremely beautiful. She didn't seem forced. She did a great job.\n\nThe supporting cast were good in their parts.\n\nMusic : Songs were not completely forced. One could have easily anticipated them.\n\nAction : Better than Dhoom 3(In terms of Special VFX)\n\nDirection : Considering it's Mr Nadiawala's First movie . It's pretty impressive.\n\nOverall, A perfect Eid Entertainer. Nothing more Nothing less. It has a message which \"Jai Ho\" failed to convey.\n\n6.5/10 - This is coming from a die hard SRK fan. I'm impressed.\n\nThe Second half is a game changer"

The reviews show the true nature of a few people who are filled with puerile hatred and jealousy over the popularity and success of Mr Salman Khan. Let the haters hate , For those who seek total entertainment , Mr Salman Khan owns and runs the one stop shop ;)) The End. We hope for a sequel , although it's tough to come up with an equally gripping story line , it could be done Mr Khan shines in movies where there many baddies with meaty roles, as he simply cannot justify us all anymore that one villain is enough to give him a tough time. Mr Khan , if it's an action flick you are doing next , then please get tougher opponents and that's when you shine best Thanks for entertaining us ."

The hero (Salman Khan) who fights for his friends and dignity of women turns to a Robinhood kind of thief who saves terminally ill children, a cop (Randeep Hooda) tries his best to catch the Devil, a villain (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) with a strange menacing smile and a heroine (Jacqueline Fernandez) who basically does the narrator's job; in summary this is all Kick is about. Songs have nothing special about them so that we want to remember, story is OK,sometimes you can see real humour and comedy, good support from supporting cast like our very own Mithunda. You need to watch the movie to get the fun, this movie is not for serious review."

Bhai shows some mean dance moves, leaves and then wins the girl, becomes pal with the cop who is hunting him down and does good for the country by taking out rogue state and non state elements who are playing with the country's health. Bhai, who is close to or more than twice Jacqueline's age, looks statuesque like a Greek God. His rippling muscles can still set hearts on fire. He doesn't sleepwalk through his role, which is a relief and puts visible effort. That is good enough, Bhai. Jacqueline looks really hot with those \"sexy secretary\" specs. She gets a lengthy role and doesn't screw it up which is the best thing which can be said about her acting. Hooda has become typecast as a cop. Nawazzudin, with his mean smile, is brilliant as the dastardly nephew of the home minister. The script has holes big enough to drive your SUV through. But then, searching for logic in a Salman Khan movie is like searching for a virgin in a whorehouse. You won't find any. On the plus side, there are many witty lines which had me cracking up. The music is catchy and thankfully, there are not too many songs to slow down the pace. The action scenes are frankly, childish and the chase sequence sucks. However, Bhai papers over all these cracks with his endearing stupidities and ensures you get your bang for the buck."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first thing you should know about Kick is that it is an outrageously silly film. It lurches from a thwarted love story to infantile comedy to slick action to shamelessly manipulative melodrama without any attempt at coherence or consistency. Kick is the official remake of a 2009 Telugu blockbuster also called Kick, but debutant director Sajid Nadiadwala bungs in Hollywood-inspired action, snatches of Dhoom 3 and even a smattering of Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Salman Khan plays Devi Lal Singh, an adrenalin junkie who has quit 32 jobs in search of a kick (incidentally, every character in this film says Kick at least a dozen times, just in case you forgot which film you were watching). He falls in love with a psychiatrist named Shaina, played by Jacqueline Fernandez. With great affection, he calls her Dr Psycho. Jacqueline is like a pretty wax doll and even the film doesn't take Shaina seriously. Anyway, Shaina can't put up with Devi's hunger for excitement, so they break up. And he somehow evolves into Devil, a Robin Hood-type masked robber who steals from the rich to give to the poor. Enter super cop Himanshu Tyagi, played by Randeep Hooda, who becomes both Shaina's fianc\u00e9e and Devil's nemesis. Cops in Hindi movies are usually bumbling idiots but Himanshu is a whole new level of incompetent. Are you following this story? It doesn't matter. Because a Salman Khan film isn't about the plot. It's about Salman, who once again plays his signature persona \u2014 a charming, playful, slightly crooked superman with a heart of gold. What's fun is that Salman is in on the joke. He's aware that he's on the screen not to deliver a performance but to give us a good time. But even if you're willing to ignore the logic-free story and buy heavily into the cult of Bhai, Kick is bumpy, and far too convoluted to deliver the joyride of a Dabangg. What does work are the thrilling action sequences; Rajat Aroraa's crackling dialogue; and, above all, Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the wicked Shiv Gajra."

Everything was going fine until Devi Lal Singh turns into Devil...how? Why!? And who is that police inspector about to be married to Shaina? Will he finally be able to catch Devil from the clues he leaves? And what would Shaina do when she finds out the true identity of Devil? The answers of these questions are what kept the audience glued to their seats till the very end. USP of the movie is definitely superstar Salman Khan. The audience cheered at everything he did; be it his heroic stunts, his runs, his chase scenes, his dance moves and what not. However, Jacqueline Fernandez and Randeep Hooda did quite a good job and justified their roles, as much as they could have. Actors Nawazuddin Siddique and Mithun Chakraborty carved the movie into a masterpiece with their experienced acting performances. Songs like 'Hangover' does entice you completely and 'Jumme ki raat' and 'Yaar na miley' lures you to dance. The screenplay, direction and most importantly, the story leaves you mesmerized in every way possible. To sum up, 'Kick' is a blend of comedy, romance, drama and definitely a box of entertainment and will not disappoint you, and how I got to know it!? That is because the crowd clapped till the last set of credits were rolling down."

The naysayers or those baying for his blood may frown on the slipups and blemishes in his movies, point out gaping plot holes, accuse him of opting for remakes rather than original concepts, slam him for using his superstardom for masala entertainers\u0085 but you cannot overlook the fact that when Salman saunters on screen, he sets it ablaze with his charm and magnetism.\n\nThe star-performer carries the weight of the entire film comfortably on his broad shoulders. Everything he does on screen is emulated by his fans pronto: styling, hair style, killer dialogue, dance steps et al. Referred to as 'Bhai' by those close to him, he is now the 'Bhai' or the iconic on-screen characters he has portrayed over the years -- Prem, Radhe, Chulbul Pandey, Lovely Singh, Tiger -- for zillions of fans across the globe.\n\nSalman, the star machine, is the Pied Piper of Hindi cinema. He *doesn't* promise path-breaking or art house cinema. The focus is on those three magical words: Entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. And that's what matters to a wide majority of movie-going audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sallu in lime-green shirt within minutes of the feature start. Electric, ever-green.\n\nWith some heart, a little soul and no mind, the film is saved by its complete lack of pretence. A refreshing take on accepting oneself as the first step to progress.\n\nSalman plays Devi, an honest, bold and adventurous soul who naturally has trouble sticking to the safe, narrow line that family and society seem to love to recommend.\n\nAs usual, Salman's character is a decade or two \u2013 perhaps even three in this case \u2013 younger than the actor himself. Compliment. The plot's central underlying tension is Devi's struggle to accept himself for what he is: a constant thrill seeker. So he finds a way to satisfy his own nature as well as society's demands: he decides to super-kick criminals, getting his thrills in the process and making the world a better place. What a life.\n\nJacqueline Fernandez as the romantic interest is a dud - lifeless at best, annoying at worst.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui is great as usual.\n\nThe supporting actors are superb across the board in yet another instance of a little noted but oft-recurring phenomenon that's almost become a rule across B-town productions. The lead-hero/heroine characters are being mercilessly repeated across films with only cosmetic differences from one production to the next. Meanwhile it appears the writers are more willing to experiment with supporting characters, thus allowing for improvement. I believe it's this trend, as well as the mammoth acting talent at hand that is eager, desperate - rightly so - to shine.\n\nThe dialogue is mediocre, but a few punchlines become minor gems thanks to Salman's captivation of the audience and his total immersion into the role of someone who knows how cheesy he is, but would rather be honourably cheesy than pretentiously intelligent. He pulls it off precisely because there is no insecurity \u2013 he knows he is fundamentally cool in the eyes of his audience and working from that position of strength, he can choose to remove that hat whenever he pleases. And he removes it often.\n\nMajor flaws: needlessly long build-up to the climax that exposed the huge gaps in character development and dialogue strength\n\n6/10"

The movie is slow in the first one hour and then pick up the pace.The first half of the movie is average.The story is very different than the Bollywood movies and is a good masala movie.The acting of Randeep Hooda and Nawazuddin Siddiqui is good. Salman has done a lot of hardwork for this role.Jacqueline's acting is average and she doesn't have much role to play.The dialogue are good. The stunts are like rohit shetty's movie stunts.The songs are good.The Telugu version of the movie has more comedy than the Hindi Kick.If you have watched the Telugu kick then this movie will be a total disappointment.If you haven't watched it then it is good movie."

Nawazuddin as usual was awesome and Randeep too done a great job. Jacqueline looks beautiful throughout the movie. As like his previous release Jai ho, this movie also has a great message( presented in a much better way) and it has been shown in a nice way what causes Devi Lal to turn to Devil. Nice soundtracks also specially Jummee ki Raat and Hangover. Comedy, Romance, Entertainment,Emotions, Great Action scenes,Faadu dialogues, good plot and Kick!\n\nthe only con about the movie is the first part is little boring but as it moves on, it gets better and better. Recommended for Sallu fans as well as his critics. Go! Get a KICKKK.."

He starts to feel romantic for his therapist, Shaina (Jacqueline Fernandez). Despite her initial distaste for Devi, Shaina has become fond of him over time. However, unplanned events have caused them to go in different ways. Further adding to the film's tension are the several supporting players. Amazing. This is one of the best romantic Action movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Simply stated, I was entertained. Very entertained! Unsure about how several of the audiences approached the movie, anticipating an Inception like dexterity in the script, I had it coming, never forgetting that it's a Salman Khan Flick after all. And speaking of Salman, a very vibrant reboot in terms of his de-aged look during the initial half as well as his very refined dance moves(way better than what he shows in his recent few movies) instantly tell you that Sallu Miyan means business. That connoisseur of Muscle residing in me couldn't help noticing a marked improvement in his build and apparently, the actor has also packed up decent physical conditioning preparatory to the movie, Now, understandably, the Sajid Nadiadwala Debut direction comes out with a very obvious set of glaring gaps in the overall course of events and a lot of otherworldly exaggerations. To the relief of the entertainment seeking viewer, Salman's presentation of almost all the recipes of expressions throughout the entire roundabout more than makes up for it and you seldom get the time to shut down your amusement gauge and pay attention to the plot. There's a marked richness in the cinematography and the stunts give even Dhoom 3 a run for the money(We are talking Bollywood here). However, the ace of spades in Nadiadwala's stack of cards remains the incarnation of Nawazuddin Siddique covering up for all the needs for a bad guy. The class of meanness and in-your-face SOB-ness played by him is simply unsurpassed, especially looking at that very small durations he is seen on screen. Ah, that morbid laughter oh his. Speaking of small presences, Jacqueline Fernandez's Jived up, near gymnastic dance might worry her Bollywood feminine counterparts. Randeep Hooda remains that usual nice-gray guy seen filling the space for an anti-hero(or should we call him an anti-villain). Music clearly disappoints and had it not been for the leg-ilicous Nargis Fakhri, the movie would get big time song-deficient. Kick still lands in the territories of Salman's worth remembering works, if not his best in the current decade."

This is more like the 20th cigarette a chain smoker has, gives you a mild kick, but only leaves you feeling full of self pity.\n\nNawazuddin and Hooda do a great job of what little roles they have and as such are the only bright spots in the acting department, seeing them bring such honesty to such a ridiculous movie gives major kicks.\n\nThe 4 songs are all catchy , Honey Singh/ Himmesh Reshamiya, hot chicks filled goodness, with the random Salman steps to boot, super kicks.\n\nI love the fact that movies have given up trying to have albums with 12 songs and instead have only 4 songs each of which are blockbuster, my personal favourite is Tere Bina Kick.....Fakri hmmm Fakri....mann karta hain naam mein hi ....\n\nJacky is there to do a Job and By God she does, lehenga, skirts, microminis, librarian, the homely girl who goes wild, every kick that an Indian Man seeks from a woman she has delivered, god bless her soul for making this movie tolerable.\n\n-s was there even a script writer or was the entire movie hammed? Kick,kick,kick,kick,,,,,,OK I give up...\n\n+/-s Salman Khan...love him,...hate him.....\n\n+s Songs, Jacky, Hooda, Nawaz...technically/visually very sound.\n\nIn the end \"Picture Na Toh Dil Mein Aata Hain, Na Samajh\"..If you go for this movie you're going to end up Kicking yourself(one last time)..you're much better off watching the official promotional music videos and trailers on-line.....they are the best part of this movie.....(I say this while watching the Tere Bina video for the 5000th time on YouTube)."

Despite my conviction that the media's criticism of Salman Khan was unfounded, I do believe that he has become more positive as a result. Each picture presents a unique set of obstacles, but he may choose how to tackle them. The incredible connection between Jackline Fer and Salman Khan is matched only by the genius of her choreography. There is currently no more gorgeous pair in all of Bollywood than they are. In the future, they will have to work additional hours. Therefore, Kick is amazing since he is perfectly prepared for life."

And so he could not continue with any job for much long because the job lacked kick. His love Shaina(Jacqueline) accidentally insults him blaming him of not caring for their future. This, along with a social concern, changes Devi Lal to Devil setting him up for the other ways of making money, robbing the richer and helping the poorer. Meanwhile, Shaina becomes a psychiatrist in Poland and meets Police Inspector Himanshu(Randeep Hooda), both seeking Salman Khan unaware of the truth of Devi and Devil respectively. Devil challenges Himanshu to stop him from robbing Nawazuddin on Eid.\n\nActing part is good. Dialogues have been exciting and songs have been well composed.

Salmans character is a fun guy, intelligent but does not take life seriously and a circumstance in life changes him completely and he chooses a new life. It shows Salman as Being Human, i wont give away too much but Salman Fans will love him.

The film does have a few flaws, The worst being That Salman Khan is in Poland during a hiest and a minute later escapes from the polish police who strangely are driving a UK Police Car and even more strange is Salman Khan who in Poland escapes police driving a London Bus (No.10) going Kings Cross?

Sadly all the three of them disappointed me.The production value was obviously good but there was no use of it because the script ruined it.I don't know what did Chetan Bhagat write because whatever i saw it was almost copy paste of the original Kick.I thought Nawazuddin only acts in good movies but now I know that it's not true.I was even wondering if i am watching Kick or Dhoom4 as it is even somewhat similar to Dhoom3.Salman Khan is in his typical avatar.There are even references of Chulbul Pandey from Dabangg only God know why.There are many forced jokes which fails to make you laugh.Even the twists in the movie make no sense and it actually kicks your brain and intelligence.I wasted 700 rupees on this movie which obviously turned out to be a bad decision.So don't waste your time and money on this movie instead do something else which actually gives you real Kick."

When it comes to stunts, Salman Khan is unparalleled. Beautiful Jacqueline Fernandez cozies up to charismatic Salman Khan in this film. Nawazuddhin's portrayal of the villain is really unnerving; he does a fantastic job with his body language, sentence delivery, and wicked chuckle. Amazingly satisfying jolt there. Comic moments abound in the story's opening chapters, and the protagonists and antagonists are introduced in engaging ways."

To my delight, the film lived up to my high hopes that its two main actors, Salman Khan and Jacqueline Fernandez, would provide. This is, hands down, the best movie I've watched in a cinema since Eid al-Adha 2013. In terms of the performances, it really outstrips my expectations."

In between, the first part was fun , thrilling, and enjoyable....Second part took me by surprise, good performances by Randeep and Nawaz and in some scene Even Salman really acted (acting wise) and it made the second part acting wise better, Why Devi lal Became Devil was touchy and different..\n\nJacqueline is definitely hot , classy, elegant and is definitely a commercial star....She complemented Salman well...in Jumme ki Rat she stole my heart with those moves...\n\nNargis was a sexy edition...\n\nSPOILERS: Like all Salman khan Flick, no definite story line..some bizarre action scene like walking in-front of a running train, jumping from 50 storied tower and many more...Keep ur brains home and u can enjoy it thoroughly.....\n\nMusic is good and Himesh did a great job, ChoreogrAphy perfect especially The Item song Yaar na mile to mar jawa....Costume wise they experimented with nice Full length dresses on Jacqueline....\n\nMoral: Even a Smile can Give u a KICK...Kick really makes your life lively....

Jacqueline Fernandez stuns as always, and she and Salman Khan make a fantastic onscreen pair. Nawazuddhin is scary in his role as the adversary, with excellent body language, line delivery, and a particularly evil cackle. Wonderful kick, there. In particular, the opening half is packed with hilarious comedic moments and fantastic character introductions."

First half could have been more compact, especially the Mithun-Salman scene in the bar. 3. Full of high-octane Hollywood-par action scenes- from the 4min cycle chase to the bus chasing scene- everything was remarkable. 4. Direction is outstanding, Sajid Nadiadwala did a super job as a d\u00e9butant director, left no stone unturned. The idea of using drone camera just clicked in his favor. 5. Alvira Khan did a good job in costume designing, Good screenplay, thanks to Ayanka Bose 6. Salman Khan, Randeep Hooda & Mithun Chakraborty acted well but Nawazuddin Siddiqui is the show stealer, you will even forget it is a Salman Khan film every-time he appears on the screen. I wish his role was a bit longer. 7 . Jumme Ki Raat, Hangover & Tu hi tu are catchy, especially Tu Hi Tu is very delightful. Jacqueline Fernandez's 30 second solo dance sequence in Jumme Ki Raat is magnificent. 8. In terms of script, some scenes were predictable, scriptwriter could have thought a bit more about the first half, no need to make some scene unnecessarily lengthy. 2-3 scenes were logic less but \"itna to chalta hain \" 9. At the end, its a fultoo entertaining, paisa-wasool, whistle bajaao fim, it has Salman's essence, Good story, Nawazuddin's entertainment so it is the best choice for your Eid. As for me, Its a Super Hit!"

Salman G is once again back with another crap but this time with more ways of giving irritating expressions. There are bad movies, there are crap movies, there are unbearable movies and when you goes ahead of all these things then comes movies like Kick. Before I review this movie I would like to tell you that during watching this movie you need to restart your system several times, which will be hanging into nothingness throughout the movie. Basically movies of Salman has nothing to offer so one doesn't expect much in terms of content so its better to not even think about it. There is nothing like story in this movie. Kick is a brainless movie. Film is mixture of Prince : Vivek Oberoi starer, Krrish Franchise, and Dhoom series, but in Kick neither the Hero is as fit as Super Hero and nor he is as brilliant as robber of Dhoom franchise . Devil aka Salman is always in search of a Kick and when you watches this movie you really feel to give a kick to him. First half was too inconsistent makes you to feel bored. During first half few scenes are stretched too much. Salman is still learning acting. To hide his age and wrinkles on face he has used mask of Krrish in this movie. Act of Nawazuddin and Randeep Hudda somehow saves this movie but again Navazuddin haven't given enough screen space. I can guarantee that makers would have spent more money on visualization of one pack tummy of Salman to show it as six pack than all other VFX work. Sajid Nadiadwala as a director did strictly average job. Action is good enough to impress Indian audience. This Kick hurts you mentally as well as physically by giving 2hr 30min long torture. Salman please stop this nonsense we can't bear it anymore Last words: My duty was to warn you now watch this movie at your own risk and kindly make sure that Hospital should be nearest to the Cinema Hall in which you are going to watch this movie. Those who still want to watch it, best of luck hope god gives you strength to bear this crap. My Rating: 0/5"

He develops love feelings for his therapist, Shaina (Jacqueline Fernandez). Shaina has developed an affection for Devi despite her initial dislike for him. However, unanticipated occurrences have led to their divergent paths. Multiple secondary characters contribute to the film's tension. Amazing produced excellent results."

Well about the movie, its a bit too complicated for a normal Bollywood movie lover. I find it really difficult to understand Hollywood flicks because i don't enter a theater to wrack my brains but to entertain myself :| but this movie left the worst Hollywood mind bogglers far behind. The direction is awful (reminded me of the movie TEZZ-however there is no connection in the plot) music could be called just average, script is like 'just forget it' The only saving grace for this movie is going to be, it is a Salman starrer and there is Eid around the corner. All in all, I expected a lot much more from u Salman after this long break, but i guess u have learnt to disappoint me (Ek tha tiger, Dabanng 2 n now this one!) There is no doubt that this will b a bumper hit but it definitely doesn't deserve being one! Bhai, hope u don't disappoint us next time :)"

This is a tremendously worthwhile and creative endeavor from a cinematic standpoint. The plot is so genuine and true to life that it's almost tough to take in, the cast is perfect for their parts, and the cinematography is delectably colorful."

        "review_title": "An entertaining KICK!! Go for it !!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Kick (Review) \u2013 Sajid Nadiadwala popular as a producer dons the director's hat for the first time for this year's Eid release Kick. Sajid Nadiadwala's Kick is the remake of Surender Reddy's 2009 telugu film with the same title starring Ravi Teja and Ileana D'Cruz. The Hindi version stars Salman Khan and Jacqueline Fernandes in the lead.\n\nSalman Khan plays the character of Devi Lal Singh who intends to find a Kick (Getting High) in anything and everything he does and just because of that, has changed about 32 different occupations after getting bored of each of them. Jacqueline Fernandes plays the character of Dr. Shaina Mehra, the love interest of Devi Lal Singh. The story begins in Warsaw in Poland where Shaina is asked by her parents to go and pick up Inspector Himanshu played by Randeep Hooda to talk about a probable marriage alliance between the both of them. Shaina and Himanshu are however not interested. On the way from the airport, Shaina explains the story of how she met Devi Lal Singh and how she initially hated him and later how they fell in love. Himanshu on the other side would have come to Warsaw in search of a criminal who loots money from people who are in public life and explains his part of the story to Shaina. Devi Lal Singh once gets caught by the cops (who have been shown in bad light in the movie) and forces to handcuff him and take him to the police station as he feels there is a kick in being handcuffed. Salman Khan fans also have a small moment of surprise as Chulbul Pandey (Salman in Dabangg) makes a brief appearance. The whistles in the theatre when Salman Khan jumps off the bicycle and walks past a speeding train stands testimony to the star value that he possesses. These and a few other sequence of events forms an entertaining first half. What happens later between Devi Lal Singh and Shaina??? What happens when they meet in Warsaw?? Which is the thing that gives Devi the ultimate kick??? Who among the two will marry Shaina forms the equally entertaining second half.\n\nThe screenplay by Rajat Arora, Keith Gomes, Sajid Nadiadwala and Chetan Bhagat is neat and can be easily understood. DOP Ayanka Bose has done a good job. Some of the action sequences in Warsaw have been captured well. Drone cameras have been used for the first time in Hindi films to capture few action sequences. Sajid Nadiadwala has done a pretty decent job as a director in his first directorial venture. Some action scenes where Salman drives a bus in Warsaw seems overdone at times but that can be easily forgiven as it falls under a limit of exaggeration that can be set for a movie by a larger than life star. Himesh Reshammiya has scored good music for Kick with 2 songs that you can take back. The peppy 'Jumme ki raat' and a pleasantly different 'Hangover'. Salman Khan as usual is at his candid best and does justice to what is expected from him. Jacqueline Fernandes looks good and gives a decent performance as well. Mithun Chakraborty as Salman Khan's father in his brief role does a good job. Randeep Hooda does complete justice to his character as well. The talented Nawazuddin Siddiqui does well as ever as Firoz. He could have definitely been utilized in a better way. Saurabh Shukla does a good job as Shaina's father Mr. Mehra. Archana Puran Singh and Nargis Fakhri have made special appearances. Certain parts of the print and social media are projecting Kick as a superhero movie and Salman Khan playing the role of a super hero. To set the records straight, neither of that is true. Watch the movie and you will echo my opinion.\n\nOn the whole, Salman Khan's Eid release Kick is definitely an entertainer which you can go for and not repent about it. Kick can be considered as an \"Eidi\" from Salman Khan to all movie buffs. Go and get your share of KICK !!!!"

Nothing seems original and attractive on the big screen.\n\nIn Dabbang he had an aura beside him but sadly in this movie even Salman Khan is not able to carry the burden of a 2 hour long torture. Jacqueline is sweet and cute. Randeep Hooda in a la Dhoom cop avatar(horrible). Only Nawazuddin deserves some praise for whatever mad work he did.\n\nSalman you deserve a better movie surely!"

I walked into the theater with the anticipation that the two key actors, Salman Khan and Jacqueline Fernandez, would blow me away, and I was not let down by either of them. Since the holiday season of 2013, this is easily the most enjoyable movie I've seen in a theater, and it could well be the best movie I've ever seen.

        "review_detailed_main": "Kick is yet another ode to Salman's star power, a scintillating addition to the pantheon of \"bhai\" movies which are made solely because of the fact that his crazy fans will pay to see their hero on screen- wriggle, giggle, waddle, dawdle, strut, and shake- any number of times.\n\nIn Kick, Salman essentially plays his own larger than life character on screen- Devi Lal Singh, good at heart, physically tough and a balls out crazy genius. He is someone who can do anything and everything- a scientific genius as his multitude of degrees and doctorates prove, he can do daredevil stunts on fast bikes and jump across skyscrapers, and in the defense of a couple in love, when he hits one goon, others simply disappear. In short this man is more superhero material than the entire Avengers team combined, and everyone in the film, including his father (Mithun Chakraborty) and even the police cop chasing him (Randeep Hooda) is almost reverential in their love for Devi. He has one condition for his superhero-giri though- he should get a kick out of it, an adrenalin rush.\n\nDoes Kick then becomes the longest Mountain Dew ad in the world? Sadly, no. Because in the 146 minutes running time, Salman's kick inducing moments are too far and too few.\n\nWho needs a director for a Salman movie, thought Sajid Nadiadwala, and he makes his directorial debut with this formulaic film. Adrenalin junkie Devi Lal's thirst for kicks and his own pride nips his budding romance with the always impeccably dressed psychiatrist Shaina (Jacqueline Fernandez). But then, women really do not matter in a Salman movie- for his fans, he might as well romance a banyan tree for all that matters, not someone as pretty as Jacqueline. Cheers and wolf whistles will be guaranteed even then. Devi Lal's innate sense of justice and humanity transforms him into the masked Devil- a Zorro like character who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. Ironic though, because after raking 50 crores in 2 days, and set for more in the next few weeks, the only people laughing off to the bank will be Salman and Sajid.\n\nThe first half of the movie is dull, the second half is where things brighten up. My advice, enter only after the interval. Bike chases, heists, catchy songs all are in the second half, along with a scene stealing Nawazuddin Sidiqque as the loony, craven nephew of a corrupt politician. Is he the poor man's Irfan? Might be so for the time being, but looking at Irfan's trajectory, this guy will also go places.\n\nIf Aamir is presumably trying to change the world through works such as Satyamev Jayate, Salman used his own perceived \"heart of gold\" personality to do his version of \"do good\" in Jai Ho, and follows it up in Kick. Jumma is in the air for bhai fans, for them the movie is drool- worthy stuff, all out Salman. Even the movie poster features only himself! Others- know that you have been warned- 5/10"

The media's skepticism of Salman Khan's newfound maturity, in my view, is unfounded. No matter what movie he directs, complications occur, but he always gets his way. Even if you don't think the choreography is great, you can't deny that Jackline Fer and Salman Khan have great chemistry together. Now everyone in Hollywood wants to be seen with them. They need to make more of an effort going forward. This means that kick is perfect in every way and meets all requirements."

This movie is the remake of Tollywood movie KICK which had came few years back , And the same movie had taken in Kollywood name Thillangadi . Because the movie is a bit story so it became success in all the languages .\n\nAs usual Salman Khan action is good. It is a true action come Comedy movie .Bit it haven't reached the level like before Salman khan movies . So a bit disappointed to me . And the songs are good in this movie, As well as the music is OK i enjoyed with that. Finally at last the twist is good that Salman khan will be appointed as police to catch the DEVIL ."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kick the latest action movie starring Salman Khan is the remake of a telegu movie with the same name. One could guess right of the bat that this movie is no different than any of the recent movies featuring Salman Khan, a no brainer with a lot of low quality special effects action.\n\nThe movie has weak story line and a poor script with the main character (Salman Khan) looking for what he calls a \"kick\" in everything. One simply doesn't expect this kind of movie from Sajid Nadiawala. The movie features Randeep Hooda as a very smart and highly reputed cop ,but apparently he cannot even figure out who the culprit is even when his entire profile is described to him by Jacqueline Fernandez. The movie is riddled with several such logical loopholes. The only watchable parts of the movie are the songs \"Hangover\" and \"Yaar na miley\" ,the latter featuring Narghis Fakhri giving a very much needed guest appearance. The biggest plight is that in spite the movie fails all over the board it has become the highest grossing Bollywood movie of the year 2014 (kinda makes you wonder about the taste of people nowadays).\n\nAll in all its a pretty good movie to update yourself to the standard Indian movies have fallen to in present times. It is a must watch if you find yourself having a few extra hundred bucks and nothing to kill time, you might get a few pity laughs out of it."

It is important not to compare this film to the Telugu original and to watch it with an open mind. The HR score is wonderful, but the action scenes are the focus of the show. In his debut as a director, Sajid Nadiawala performed well. Salman, the Bollywood star machine, is the pied piper. He does not guarantee the production of new or art house films. Three enchanting words are highlighted: entertainment, entertainment, and entertainment. This is the primary concern of the great majority of moviegoers. It would not be an exaggeration to say Salman is KICK's soul."

        "review_detailed_main": "After a series of Bad movies (real bad) except the decent EK tha Tiger, this one is a kick for the Dabangg khan to uplift his falling career. Honestly, I had almost Zero expectations. The trailer was also not very exciting and my presumption about the moving having no story stood 100% correct. 4 writers credited(even including Chetan Bhagat), but what you get is inconsistent & and an incoherent screenplay.\n\nThere are snatches of Batman, Zorro, Dabangg, Aks, Bodyguard & Especially Dhoom:3. In fact many from it. But where Dhoom:3 failed miserably to deliver any kinda Fun, Kick does it right. It's moreover a Dhoom 3 done right. Salman is Outstanding. He plays himself. Like the dialog-\"Main Dil main aata hun, samajh main nahin\", it's a larger than life character best suited to him. The action(though very less) was brilliant. Considering its a Bollywood movie, the production values were superb. Especially a chase sequence in Poland looked spectacular. Songs are decent with good presentation. Among the rest, almost everyone performed hammy yet amazing.\n\nRandeep Hooda did what Abhishek Bachchan should do in a better way, Jacqueline Fernandis too was impressive. It was Nuwazuddin Siddique in the second half who took the maximum claps with a superb performance. He was notches higher in scenes with Salman.\n\nThe cinematography deserves special mention. It was fab and a bit artful!\n\nOverall, despite its flaws, lack of logics, zero story, and some exceeded runtime, Kick does succeeds in providing decent entertainment. A good Eid-flick. Extremely Watchable. And that extra 0.5 is for Salman and his dancing. LOL!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you wanted to see a superhero movie, like Spiderman, with amazing cinematography, great storyline, a movie which will captivate you for the whole runtime, a professional made film, then you picked seriously wrong! Same as Bodyguard, Dabangg 2, Kick is also a time waster, with no story. Salman looks pretty cool and has a charming style, but thats the only good thing i can say about this film. It has some average songs which are placed totally wrong during the movie, almost as wrong as some annoying TV commercials. I like hearing some nice songs during an Indian movie, but they shouldn't be placed so randomly.....and all that dancing and the costums, dancers, backgrounds and all it's pretty silly.......i mean, is it a movie or a stage show??? Ek Tha Tiger was 100% better made than this. Even Jai Ho had some nice parts. Well, i guess it can be a good entertaining piece for those masses from India, but it really isn't a good quality film. Far from it. That stunt where Devi jumped from the window is sooooo bad, my God, i can clearly see Salman's double, and the editing is simply terrible, which makes me believe that it's the work of an amateur. They even speculated something about working with a stunts director from Hollywood...it's really disappointing. When he's driving that bus, cars are getting crashed although is clear they aren't even touching the bus, is just hilarious. Tere Naam, Lucky, Wanted, Sajaan, Garv,...yeah, there weren't the best movies in the world, but they were enjoyable, good to watch, some i even watched again and again. But this one, with all the car crashes, explosions and all, is a very weak movie. Well, what do you expect from a man who became movie director over night? Just amateur work. Salman should stop making such movies which are pulling him down really hard. I give it 5 out of 10 stars, just for Salman's look and performance and because i'm one of his fans. But i'm disappointed."

Nawazuddin Siddique played a great role of villain in this movie , Jacqueline Fernandez also have a very good performance. Music is also good 'Jumme Ki Raat' having good dance is huge hit.

I respect salman khan as a human being.....but he should understand that you cant always present the same dish to the audience which has nothing to do with serious acting but just muscles and attitude show off.... some good points about this movie are some good acting performance by Nawazuddin siddiqui and Randeep Hudda..........Jacqueline Fernandeze here is just being presented as a typical baby doll bollywood heroin My conclusion on this would be that it would be a good timepass and a one time watcher for Sallu fans but it fails to impress serious audience.....but can give a feel good factor due to its action sequences."

Few portion of the film are well written and successfully executed specially the portion acted by Nawazuddin, Mithun and few emotional parts of Salman Khan. I don't understand if a producer investing 60-70 Cr to make a movie why don't they invest for a good script. First 53 minutes, movie is like a comedy reality show, then next 53-112 minutes, it's copied from Dhoom 2, Dhoom 3, Krish and Krish 3. Kick is good only last 15- 20 minutes.

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this with my brother who is a die hard fan of Salman, of course being a 90s and early 2000s movies, I wasn't too keen on the movie. I just wanted to spend some time with my bro and that's why decided to watch together. Safe to say my negative opinion of the movie did not change. Weaknesses are numerous:\n\nActing : Salman's character was extremely poorly written. I have not seen such senseless people in the real world. I expect reel characters to have some sort of similarities to real life people, but sorry to say adrenaline junkies are hardly like this. He gave one of his worst acting performances as well which did not help things at all. Really his box office success has coincided with his dwindling acting efforts. Jacqueline is stoic and expressionless and just like Katrina delivers dialogues with a foreign accent which is irritating in a Bollywood flick. The kids also did not get any tears out of my eyes whatsoever as I did not relate with their grief at all. Only saving graces were Nawazuddin Siddique and Randeep Hooda in terms of acting.\n\nWafer thin plot : There is no real story whatsoever. The story keeps jumping from flashbacks to present abruptly and incoherently which adds an element of illogicality to the movie. The movie has been advertised as a thriller in some places but there is no thrill whatsoever in the story. I even don't criticise predictable thriller but the movie isn't remotely close to a thriller. The journey of Salman seems very stretched and bores you seriously right from beginning to end.\n\nExtremely poor action sequences : I am not at all a fan of action. I only like action when it is kept logical and without all those irritating sounds and one man beating up thousands. This film had many of the aspects of action which annoy me. I slept through the action scenes because after a stage, they were unwatchable.\n\nToo preachy: The film is clearly a way to demonstrate the greatness of Salman as a human and reflects on his charity work quite clearly. I have read about all these stuff on Internet. While I appreciate his efforts but I feel it is an incredibly boring topic to make a movie on, the movie should've been listed as a documentary rather.\n\nForced comedy : The movie has been enlisted as one belonging to the comedy genre. It had nothing but crass, forceful and utterly unimpressive comedy. Every single situation which tried to extract a laughter led to irritation and not once throughout the movie was I remotely close to laughing.\n\nAnimated childhood: There was no precautions about inserting animations. Right from my childhood, I believe in watching realistic movies and have never been fascinated by all these superheroes,cartoons,animation and caricatures. The director should've made the effort to enlighten audiences of what to expect which might not be what the audience is prepared from the buildup and trailer. Animated movies are a completely different genre and they should, in no way be included in movies about real people and situations.\n\nKick A, Kick A background noise : After Salman's weird and stupid actions, there is a continuous disturbance in the form of that Kick A Kick A thing, really gets on your nerves, I can assure you Strengths: Music : None of the songs are too pleasing to the ear with the exception of Hai Yehi Zindagi. That song hits the jackpot and convinced me to declare this aspect of this movie as a strength. Real touchy one which was the only significant takeaway from the movie.\n\nLocation: The Polish locations were eye catching and enhanced the viewing experience."

It's a great piece of entertainment because of all the drama, emotion, and love that permeates it. Salman's clothing, especially during the train scene, was very memorable. For pure amusement value, nothing beats it. Kick, propelled by Salman Khan's stellar performance, is hands-down the year's finest film. Though it's a rip-off of the Telugu film of the same name, Salman Khan gives a fantastic performance, and the rest of the ensemble holds its own."

After the ordeal, I can say Kick is an incredibly poor and unbelievably cheesy movie. The script is rubbish, SK's acting skills are nonexistent. He is so bad that one feels embarrassed several times during the film. He can't dance (he moves like a wooden Tinkertoy Pinocchio) let alone act.\n\nThe plot is obvious and nonsensical, with major continuity and just plain logical flaws. It shamelessly pulls all the stops of Bollymasala (melodrama, stupid baddies, heroic megastar with a weak spot for children, gaudy interiors, idealized in-laws, etc). The result is a well-orchestrated paean of praise for one of the worst actors ever to appear on any screen on this planet: SK. If I were he, I would feel so embarrassed I would not leave my apartment in the next 100 years. But, no, he must have a colossal ego and be refractory to criticism. Unbelievable Kick was such a box office success. An acceptable Randeep Hooda did his best to help save the boat, to no avail. Miserable movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kick : Clear definition of this word is \"strike or propel forcibly with the foot\" and its a verb but what does SALMAN meant to say about KICK? What is his KICK?. In the whole drama he always utters\" isse mujhe kick nahin milti\". Debuntante Director Sajid Nadiadwala comes into direction after producing blockbusters in his earlier works, a good way to start his career in direction with Bhaijaan where he knows making a full fledged movie with him can earn him a lot overnight,irrespective of lousy plot. Coming to performances, Salman Khan (as Devi Lal Singh aka DEVIL) he can act,he can fight, he can make u laugh with his massy body language, his screen presence his enough to make u entertain but a new makeover of being bad boy with soulful heart. Jacqueline Fernandez(as Shaina Mehra) a psychiatrist with hotness cum glamour quotient performed well. Randeep Hooda(as Himanshu Tyagi) tough cop with 100% track record(almost in every cop movies with some exceptions) but unable to catch DEVIL was convincing. But stealer was Nawazuddin Siddique(as Shiv Gajra) he was the best thing in this action drama. with some comic villainous sequences(like Prakash Raj) was top notch. Especially a sequence where he kills a doctor wrapped under bubble-wrap and he is popping the bubbles, it was very natural. Comic quotient were added by Saurabh Shukla and Special Appearance by Sanjay Mishra, both of their sequences were hilarious with Salman Khan. Mithun Chakraborty(as Vidvan Singh aka Salman's father)with less screen presence still performed good. Unexpected Archana Puran Singh(as Salman's Mother)? she is just 4 years elder to him but mother role?? Shocking Surprise. Screenplay by 4 writers will always make confusion but some of the sequences were hilarious like Sanjay Mishra sequence and when Salman meets Saurabh Shukla for the first time. How come Randeep can't recognize Devi and Devil where he says\"Case and Face kabhi nahin bhulta\" he was just wearing a birthday mask. Story and script was on low side or I would say promoting being human but better than Bodyguard and Ready. Action sequences were top notch but that jump scene can't be compare to TOM CRUISE jump from Burj Khalifa. Songs are hummable with catchy background score. Dialogues by Rajat arora were good especially in the first half and\n\nOn the whole, its a complete entertainer with action,comedy,romantic quotient but 2nd half was too slow and unnecessary lengthy. No matter what are the reviews it will be a blockbuster at the box office. Everyone will always watch it only because SALMAN KHAN, his screen presence is enough to fill the pockets of producers and distributors.Its more about Being Humanism but \"ISME MUJHE KICK NAHIN MILI\""

Indeed, I predict that this film will become Salman Khan's career high point. Sajid Nadiawala's directing debut was promising, and the actor-turned-director should continue in the role. In my opinion, the media's criticisms about Salman Khan's improved attitude are unwarranted. Issues arise in every film he directs, yet he always manages to get what he wants. There's no denying that Jackline Fer has excellent chemistry with Salman Khan and that the choreography performed on her is fantastic. They've become Hollywood's cutest pair. It's expected that they'll put in more effort in the future. As a result, kick is excellent and has all requisites."

        "review_detailed_main": "Last night, through the rustling wind and pounding rain, I heard the faint strains of a song. It was the Spirit of Bollywood crooning a melancholy melody, reflecting upon the newest product it had just belched out. Kick is almost there: it melts the brain, burns a hole in your pocket and causes a tsunami of rage within you. A poster of the film.xactly like every other previous Bhai film, made for Bhai fans. This means a) The script would depress a dull primate b) All women in the film are utterly stupid, c) Bhai is an angelic godlike creature sent to us by Lord Xenu only to be worshipped d) There have to references to previous Bhai films. It's called being meta. What's that you say? This Bhai film is different and good because it has a huge budget and is set in phoren locations? If Jai Ho was a smelly sock, then Kick is a smelly sock placed in an fancy box and wrapped in a silver foil. You open the box and the effect is still the same. The massive budget of the film doesn't much manifest itself into the visuals in a convincing manner. There is an appalling animated sequence and the CGI looks like it was made for a few rupees in a basement Pentium 2 PC. In a scene where Bhai drives a bus through parked cars, the cars fly around like video game rag dolls. But once again, this is a masala commercial film and I shouldn't expect anything smart or classy. Right? Wrong. You can choose to have a good script. You can choose to entertain audiences by not insulting their intelligence. You can choose to not have Jacqueline Fernandez playing a psychologist whose idea of treating a patient is to bring him home and then take him to a bar. You can choose to not show Saurabh Shukla bent over an exercise ball with a hulking, tattooed yoga instructor looming over him. The only agenda that Kick has is to squeeze Bhai into every frame of the film and make him a contrived superhero. I'll avoid making any Kick puns about how hard the blows feel, but I can tell you the film does contain one interesting scene. Bhai dances in a club to 'Saat samandar paar' and jeers at Randeep Hooda by showing him the text on the back of his T shirt \u2013 it reads 'LOSER'. Is that meant for the audience or Khan being self-deprecating? I don't think so. The supporting cast in Kick, despite looking decent on paper, doesn't work very hard either. Considering the script, it's not surprising since everyone in the Kick universe exists only to make Bhai's idiotic superhero look \"cool\". Hooda sneers his way through the film and Nawazuddin Siddiqui hams to the hilt \u2014 every time there's a manic bark of laughter from him, it's like he's imagining the sound of his bank account being credited. As is the case with most Bhai films, none of the setbacks are going to matter as such, because for die-hard Bhai fans, they're trifles in a box of goodies. And a review of the film is hilariously useless, because no known force on this planet can stop a Bhai film from sending the box office registers ringing. Bhai seems to have discovered the elixir of life with the Eid release strategy. In the annals of time whether or not the chaand shows up, a Bhai film certainly will. No wonder then that the Spirit of Bollywood wandered through the city last night, drunk and depressed. The last words of its song are a haunting echo: I tried so hard and got so far. In the end, it doesn't even matter."

If you want to see an intelligent movie, please don't waste your money and time. Its such a stupid movie full of blunders. Perhaps hardcore fans of Salman Khan may find this movie enjoying, what about others? Acting was terrible. This might become a huge hit, but it is never a good movie. There's absolutely no logic in this movie. This movie is an insult to those who have brains and use them. Malayalam movies are much better than Hindi movies.

Ineffective humour and exaggerated sound effects made for a not so pleasant experience.\n\nAs the plot moved on, it picked itself up and even got me somewhat intrigued. The Lothario had (somehow) become a serial robber and the police was on his tail, what will it happen next?\n\nFrom the moment the plot was resolved and the hidden cards became revealed, it fell totally flat all the way to the final scene.\n\nAll in all this is a relatively charming mediocre experience."

Devi Lal Singh, played by Salman Khan, is a risk taker for whom the term \"KICK\" is essential. Without KICK, everything seems uninteresting and mundane to him. Shaina, a psychiatrist portrayed by Jacqueline Fernandez, piques his attention; at first, Shaina doesn't like Devi, but after getting to know him, she starts to have love for him as well. However, unplanned occurrences have altered the course of their existence. The film is improved with the introduction of new characters. Amazing."

Salman Khan and Jacqueline both gave amazing performances. I found it to be quite entertaining. Whatever the situation may be, I want to wish the Kick's Team the best of luck with their future endeavors.... To that end, I eagerly await the next chapter...

Salman Khan has proved to us that he doesn't know how to act.I wouldn't reveal much of the plot to you. Salman Khan as Devil; very similar to the Sahir in Dhoom 3; wears a mask; very similar to the infamous Krrish mask in the Krrish series; rides a bicycle. Believe me, Salman wouldn't fit into that bicycle seat. Randeep Hooda as the cop is alright. Nawazuddin is as usual irritating (Which Idiot said that he could even act) Jacqueline Fernandez has nothing to do but just dance and sing and appear in a handful of scenes. The film seems never ending as it stretches miserably till 146 torturous minutes. Songs are nonsensical like Jumme Ki Raat, Hangover, Yaar Na Mile. WARNING: KRK appears in a teeny weeny role, but his role may shock you as he is the actual Devil... Yes, you read it right.. Only for DIR HARD Salman Khan fans (Which obviously I ain't)"

Salman Khan's actions are beyond explanation and absolutely extraterrestrial. In the film, Jacqueline Fernandez is presented as extraordinarily beautiful, and she and Salman Khan have excellent chemistry. The mix of Nawazuddin's menacing manner, perfect timing, and contagious cackle makes him a memorable antagonist. It packs an incredible punch. The first portion is filled with excellent character introductions and hilarious comedy situations."

        "review_detailed_main": "So Salman Khan once again comes up with his big budget release on Eid. Kick is a Bollywood remake of South Indian movie of the same name. It is directed by debutant Sajid Nadiadwala. It stars Salman Khan, the protagonist, as Devi Lal Singh aka Devil, Jacqueline Fernandez as Dr. Shaina, Randeep Hooda as Inspector Himanshu Tyagi and Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the antagonist, as Shiv. Music is given by Himesh Reshammiya.\n\nSTORY: Devi Lal Singh (Salman Khan) is a fun loving guy who falls in love with Dr. Shaina. Devi always wants to try something different and always wants a 'kick' in his life. Situations separate them both. Dr. Shaina goes to Poland and Devi Lal becomes Devil, the thief. After Devil, is Inspector Himanshu Tyagi played by Randeep Hooda. Then comes the antagonist, Nawazuddin. The story unfolds. Watch the movie to find out more.\n\nSCREENPLAY: The screenplay is very poor. There's no pace in the movie. Some sequences are very dull especially in the first half. Second half picks up a bit. Just a bit.\n\nACTING: Salman Khan is good. Jacqueline is decent. Randeep is good as well. Nawazuddin looks a misfit. He does not look like a villain at all.\n\nMUSIC: Music is above average. Jumme ki raat is worth a watch.\n\nOVERALL: Kick is as good as Ek Tha Tiger, Bodyguard and Dabanng 2. It is a typical nonsense masala movie with no proper script. Watch only and only for Salman Khan.\n\nSalman Khan, please come up with something better next time. Thanks!"

The film's two protagonists, Salman Khan and Jacqueline Fernandez, were the primary reasons why I enjoyed it so much; neither of them disappointed me in any way. This may be the finest movie I've ever seen, but I haven't been to the movies since Eid '2013, which was also the last time I went to the theater.

But this movie is copied frame by frame from Telugu movie yet it doesn't entertain not even 10% of it. Sajid would have changed the story a bit for north people yet his direction worked out pretty well....\n\nFirst half is less gripping, but you will be indulged as story progress. If you haven't watched Telugu version you would feel the story similar to dhoom 3 only where aamir khan robs bank and no one knows how!! But the purpose of robbing is different that's it. If you're huge fan of Salman then you'll take this movie as you took all his other remakes..If you're not that fan the please leave your thinking cap at home while coming to theatre.\n\nWith poor editing, dull action scenes dull despite the hype, music being Okay by himesh and the only that seems legit were dialogues which were Delivered good. Well that much said you will walk out less satisfied With this movie.\n\nThis movie will be attracted for only 3 things Salman khan, Salman khan, Salman khan and nothing else. I personally feel this is desperate attempt of Salman khan since jai ho to create a good boy image and all those charity stuff etc.. I would give 6/10.it's a one-time watch. Watch it on your own risk!!"

I hope you like this film, which I am sharing with the world. This video held my attention throughout and definitely deserved many viewings. At least six times, and each time was enjoyable, I watched this video. Fantastic acting from both Salman Khan and Jacqueline in this film. It was enjoyable to me. Whatever the situation may be, I hope the best for Kick's Team in their future undertakings.... More than that, I can't wait for the sequel... Kick, starring Salman Khan, isn't just about him, however."

Watch it objectively and recognize it for what it is: a celebration of \"original\" fans like myself and the Sanders on Sisters, who we have been missing for so long but are now getting to see again. It was enjoyable to go through this. These women packed a powerful punch with their performances. Totally deserved of the praise it has gotten. The movie moves along at a great clip and seamlessly transitions between scenes.\n\nWhatever the case, this-call let's it a \"revival\"-shows the world that we have once more been blessed with the sight of these three amazing women together, \"running wild\" in Salem. I won't pretend that I didn't want to compare the small differences between this and the original, but what good would that do? The story, the humor, and the excitement are just a few of the novel and original elements present here."

The success of Sajid Nadiawala's directorial debut shows that he should continue to make films in the future. Recently, Salman Khan's attitude has changed, and the media has attacked him, but I do not feel their criticisms were warranted. Each picture has a problem, yet he can do anything he wants. Jackline Fer's choreography is exceptional, and she has a strong rapport with Salman Khan. They are officially the most adorable couple in Hollywood. They must work more going forward. The greatest thing is having everything."

In this film, Jacqueline and Salman have great chemistry, whereas Randeep Hooda's character is not difficult to discern. When elements such as drama, tragedy, and love are united, a quality work of entertainment is produced. The way in which Salman behaved on the train was utterly unique. It meets the purpose of amusement fairly effectively. Salman Khan has the most spectacular performance of the year in the film Kick, which is also the finest film of the year. Even though it is a remake of the Telugu film of the same name, Salman Khan's performance is so fascinating that you forget that the rest of the ensemble is just as good."

It would be an understatement to say that I liked this sequel. Without a doubt, they made this movie because they care about the viewers. There was always a part of us that found something appealing about the sisters or that could relate to at least one of them, despite the fact that they were trying to devour children. It's impossible to miss Betty Midler's transition into an icon with hair and makeup in place. The best movie I've ever seen, in my opinion."

Unquestionably, Kick is the finest film of the year so far, thanks to Salman Khan's commanding performance. The film is a remake of the Telugu film of the same name, but Salman Khan's performance is spectacular, and the supporting cast is outstanding."

Despite the difficulty in localizing the film's effects, the film's action scenes are superb. This is a substantial advantage. In general, it is possible that seeing this film in a theater will be enjoyable for you. This is perhaps Salman Khan's greatest performance of the year, and he does an outstanding job. Kick is a far more enjoyable film than Jai ho. There is just one memorable statement in the whole film, and that is \"Mein dill me atta hu dimaag me nahi.\""

Music is awesome, with Honey Singh, Meet bros, HR, and Salman himself. This is definitely a movie with dance music! It's good for a family movie as well: clean film like any Salman movie :) Good message, as expected. You should watch it! And Jaqueline and Randeep Hooda do a great job as well!"

The focus is on those three magical words: Entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. And that's what matters to a wide majority of movie-going audience.\n\nTo state that Salman is the soul of KICK wouldn't be an exaggeration. He's committed, charming and competent, so much so that it's difficult to take your eyes off him. Post DABANGG, those who felt that the actor's movies lacked a cohesive script to match his superstardom, are sure to feel satiated with KICK, since the film has it all and does utmost justice to Salman's aura. In fact, the film gives him the platform to exhibit his range as an actor/star and his real-life role of a good Samaritan/humanitarian further. Rest assured, the fans and the fanatics -- even those who aren't -- are in for a treat!\n\nRandeep Hooda is supremely efficient, delivering a performance that stays with you. And this is a huge compliment, since the film is a Salman show from commencement to conclusion. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a powerhouse of talent and KICK gives him the opportunity to cross over to the commercial league. Nawazuddin is simply outstanding, essaying his part with gusto. In fact, it won't be erroneous to state that along with Salman, Nawazuddin will walk away with plaudits after KICK.\n\nJacqueline Fernandez does very well, although her diction needs to be worked upon. She looks great and her dance in 'Jumme Ki Raat' is sure to stun you. Mithun Chakraborty is in top form yet again. The sequence with Salman towards the concluding moments stay with you.\n\nThe supporting cast -- Saurabh Shukla-good, Sanjay Mishra-awesome, Vipin Sharma-super, Archana Puransingh-alright, Kavin Dave-first- rate, Sumona Chakravarti-perfect -- each of them contribute well to the proceedings.\n\nOn the whole, KICK is a paisa vasool, seeti-maar entertainer. Get ready for a Tsunami called KICK at the ticket window. It is sure to rewrite box-office records. Salman fans, rejoice. KICK is a sure-shot B-L-O-C-K- B-U-S-T-E-R. To quote a dialogue from the film: 'Woh apni Eidi lene zaroor aayega'."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just like 'Salman', the storyline of his films convey the dialog 'dil mien aata Hun...samajh mien nhi'. However unlike his typical mas-ala potboilers, this one has a riveting storyline along with doses of entertainment. YES, KICK has the magnificence that was lacking in Salman's previous movies.\n\nThe first half is blended with several comic and romantic scenes where Salman is crazy, never like before. Special mention to that Police Station episode where 'Sanjay Mishra', 'Mithoon' and 'Salman' make you go LMAO! But your intuition of the film being a typical 'Salman; entertainer proves false with 30 min to the brilliant interval point. It's the second half that gives the film a 'KICK' to a new level which with Salman bringing a different shade to his character. The suspense emotional plot is appealing and climax will stun you with it's snazzy, breathtaking action sequences and the brilliant execution. The dialog's are a topnotch. Take a bow 'Rajat Arora'. Truly clap and whistle worthy. Music is one of the USP's of the film where 'Jumme Ki Raat' is already a rage, 'Hangover' and 'Yaar Na Miley' add up to the rhythm of the film. Blemishes? Yes, in the first half, one or two sequences seem to be dragged. However 'Sajid Nadiadwala' excels with a milestone in his first directorial venture. He presents 'Salman' in such a way that he's beyond 'MESMERIZING' in the entire film from the comic, action, romantic sequences to the emotional one's. He carries of the role with flamboyance proving out to be one of the best performances of his career. 'Jacqueline' gets biggest role of her career and makes her presence felt, especially in a key dramatic scene with 'Salman'. She looks smoking hot and her dance will make you go gaga. 'Randeep Hooda' is supremely efficient, delivering a performance that stays with you. 'Nawazuddin Siddiqui' is a powerhouse of talent and KICK gives him the opportunity to cross over to the commercial league. Nawazuddin is simply outstanding, essaying his part with gusto. In fact, it won't be erroneous to state that along with Salman, Nawazuddin will walk away with plaudits after KICK.\n\nAll in all, a full-on commercial film which is not just relies on Salman but is backed by a good plot and treatment that gives a joy ride. BLOCKBUSTER written all over it!"

Yes its better then ett or dabangg for that matter.\n\nPlus points ::\n\n1- extremely vicious villain (NAWAZ) 2- extremely great visuals 3- extremely great dialogues 4- movie's being interesting level grows from start to end 5- salman khan's robotic dance 6- best action for a bollywood movie ever. 7- best cinematography ever 8- very nice songs\n\nMinus points ::\n\n1- movie's start really shows its the first time director is taking his directing.

In point of fact, the movie gives him the opportunity to display even more his flexibility as an actor and celebrity, in addition to his real-life position as a good Samaritan and humanitarian. You may rest easy knowing that everyone, even those who aren't fans or aficionados, is in for a treat! Excellent flick!!!

Although Salman Khan's demeanor has lately shown signs of improvement, he has been receiving criticism from the media, which I do not feel was warranted. However, despite this, he is free to act in whatever way he sees fit during the films. She has a fantastic relationship with Salman Khan, as well as outstanding choreography, and Jackline Fer is a terrific dancer. They have quickly become Hollywood's prettiest new couple.

EVEN the educated people who are stressed out at work all day and have other problems in life. They need a movie which will help them disconnect, and simply relax with all the jokes and upbeat songs.

There are two markets which finally co-exist in our industry.\n\nPlease don't hate on these films. Instead, watch these films as simple entertainers. Don't want to waste your money?

Consequently, I stopped noticing Hritik Roshan's presence. The scenery and action sequences were executed with exceptional skill. Finally, the moment has here!! All the anticipation and high expectations for KICK are warranted. Undoubtedly, any film featuring Salman Khan will deliver \"Unapologetic Entertainment.\" This well-known figure continues to simplify your everyday routine."

I also encourage that people see this film and appreciate it. This film was fascinating and worth seeing many times. I've watched this movie at least six times and really loved it each time. Salman Khan and Jacqueline were fantastic in this film. I really enjoyed it. Anyway, best of luck to Kick's Team on their future projects.... By the way, I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel... Kick, for a change, has much more to offer than Salman Khan's charm."

In case you saw DABANGG and thought the actor's subsequent films lacked a compelling narrative worthy of his celebrity status, you'll be more than pleased with KICK. Salman Khan, who starred in the film DABANGG and became famous because of it, is the film's main attraction. He uses the movie as a platform to promote both his acting and the real-life humanitarian efforts he undertakes. The one thing that can be stated with sure is that everyone, whether they are fans or not, is in for a pleasant surprise! What a fantastic movie!!

There is no denying that Salman Khan and Jackline Fer had great chemistry together, and that the choreography performed on Jackline Fer was exceptional.

These three beautiful words need particular consideration: entertainment, entertainment, and entertainment. This is the primary concern of moviegoers. We may argue without much hyperbole that Salman is KICK's moral center."

He falls for a psychiatrist named Shaina (Jacqueline Fernandez). Shaina doesn't like Devi at first, but after learning more about him, she develops feelings for him. However, owing to unforeseen events, their lives have different intentions! In addition, there are other characters in the film, which makes it more exciting! Amazing. ."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Kick\" is a Bollywood action film that packs a punch with its high-octane stunts and adrenaline-pumping sequences. Directed by Sajid Nadiadwala and starring Salman Khan in the lead role, the film follows the story of a man named Devi Lal Singh, also known as Devil, who craves excitement and thrills in life. Devi's character is portrayed as a quirky and unpredictable individual who finds joy in performing audacious acts, often for the greater good.\n\nOne of the film's highlights is its action sequences, which are choreographed with precision and flair. From exhilarating chase scenes to jaw-dropping fight sequences, \"Kick\" delivers on the promise of edge-of-your-seat entertainment. Salman Khan shines in his role as Devil, bringing charisma and energy to the character. His chemistry with co-star Jacqueline Fernandez, who plays the female lead, adds a layer of romance to the narrative.\n\nHowever, while \"Kick\" excels in its action and entertainment quotient, some viewers may find the plot to be predictable. The storyline follows a familiar trajectory, with the protagonist battling against a corrupt system and facing personal dilemmas along the way. Despite this, the film manages to maintain its momentum through its brisk pacing and engaging performances.\n\nAnother aspect of \"Kick\" worth mentioning is its music, which features catchy songs that complement the film's mood and tone. Tracks like \"Jumme Ki Raat\" and \"Hangover\" became instant hits among audiences, adding to the film's commercial success.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Kick\" is a Bollywood masala entertainer that delivers on its promise of action, romance, and drama. While its storyline may not break new ground, the film compensates with its slick production values and charismatic performances. For fans of Salman Khan and adrenaline-fueled action movies, \"Kick\" is a must-watch."

Sajid Nadiawala did an excellent job in his directorial debut. The Pied Piper of Hindi film is Salman, the star machine. He makes no promises of groundbreaking or art-house movies. The emphasis is on three wonderful words: entertainment, entertainment, and entertainment. And that is what counts to the vast majority of moviegoers. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Salman is the spirit of KICK."

There are certain jokes that will make you laugh out loud, but the vast majority of jokes aren't nearly as funny as they might be. In spite of the fact that the film's effects are difficult to localize, the film's action moments are outstanding. This is a significant positive. In general, it's feasible that going to watch this film in a cinema may be a fun experience for you. It's safe to say that this is Salman Khan's best performance of the year, and he does an amazing job with it here. Kick is a far more entertaining movie than Jai ho. There is just one memorable sentence in the whole movie, and it goes as follows: \"Mein dill me atta hu dimahgh me nahi.\""

Also starring are Nargis Fakhri, Randeep Hooda, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and Jacqueline Fernandes. Sajid Nadiadwala delivers a compelling story and outstanding acting for the marginalized.

Though it very well may be the best film ever made, I haven't gone to the cinema since Eid 2013. I had great hopes for the ensemble, and they were not only met, but beyond. Brilliant.\n\n131. In compared to Salman Khan's previous cinematic roles, \"Kick\" stands out as one of his best. Jacqueline and Salman have fantastic chemistry in this film, while Randeep Hooda's job is straightforward. When you mix dramatic elements with tragic ones like love, you get a great piece of entertainment. In a really one-of-a-kind display, Salman exhibited impeccable behaviour aboard the train. The intended purpose of amusement is met effectively. Kick, also the year's greatest picture, has Salman Khan's most remarkable performance. It's a remake of the Telugu film of the same name, but Salman Khan's performance is so compelling that you forget about the rest of the ensemble, who are all excellent."

At the Warsaw station, the attractive psychiatrist Dr. Shaina-Jacqueline Fernandez meets the Indian police officer Himanshu-Randeep Hooda. A common topic of conversation when they meet together is their respective backstories. Here, Shaina narrates the story of her one and only fling, the 'Kick'-obsessed Devi Lal Singh-Salman Khan. She details the highs and lows of their short but passionate romance, and how he ultimately abandoned her for another high. Himanshu fills her in on all his amazing exploits, including the fact that he has finally met his match in the shape of a crafty thief."

The fact that they went back to their roles roughly 30 years later and showed no signs of aging is iconic, and I'm so glad this movie was done. 10/10 for me. Fantastic film, man.

I feel that Salman Khan's attitude has become more positive as a direct result of the criticism that he has received from the media; nonetheless, I do not believe that their criticism was warranted. Although every movie has its own unique set of problems, he is free to tackle whatever challenge he chooses. The incredible choreography of Jackline Fer is matched only by her extraordinary relationship to Salman Khan. They have now become the prettiest couple in all of Bollywood. In the future, they need to exert greater effort than they did before. Therefore, Kick is incredible because he has everything."

It's delightful to watch; it excites you, keeps you on the edge of your seat, has just enough jump scares to keep the kids interested, and leaves you beaming from ear to ear.

There are four Bollywood stars that no true fan would want to miss: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Saurabh Shukla, Mithun Chakravorty, and Sanjay Mishra. If you're a fan of Bollywood movies and/or Salman, you'll like this one. TAKEN DOWN BY SALMAN KHAN, WANNA KINDLY REVIEW IT If you give it a go, you'll have an awesome time.

One of the greatest movies of the last several years; a must-watch. It would be an understatement to describe Salman Khan the \"soul\" of the picture. It's all okay with Jacky, Randeep, and Sidique."

Seeing this movie in a cinema is highly recommended. This is perhaps the greatest performance of the year by Salman Khan. His efforts here are really remarkable.

This is a film that every person who like Bollywood movies should see, regardless of whether or not they are Salman fans. WANNA SEE SALMAN KHAN ROCK?

Jackline Fer, in addition to being a wonderful dancer in her own right, has a terrific working relationship with Salman Khan and generates gorgeous choreography.

The whole cast, not only Salman Khan sir, is unforgettable. Both the acting and the talking are superb. Khan sahab had an appearance that couldn't be matched. As a result, I was able to block out the image of Hritic Roshan. Amazing locations and action scenes. It's been a long time, but it's done at last! There's a lot of hype about KICK, and it's not without reason. Every movie starring Salman Khan has one thing in common: \"Unapologetic Entertainment.\" Even so, this superstar always delivers the goods!"

I honestly feel this is the most fun movie I've seen in a theater since Eid '2013, and perhaps ever? Regarding the actors, their performance even beyond my expectations."

Salman, the celebrity machine, is like the Pied Piper of the Hindi cinema industry. He does not guarantee the production of any ground-breaking or art-house films. The emphasis is placed on those three lovely words, which are entertainment, entertainment, and entertainment. And it is what the overwhelming majority of moviegoers care about the most.

Despite the film's tremendous action moments, its effects remain elusive, which is a huge advantage. This movie has the potential to be entertaining to see in a cinema.

Though I must admit that the original remains the better image, I was still quite happy. Again, due to the more authentically witchy vibe of the 1990s, it was effective for this time period and audience. This is something that we can envision adding to our daily diet for a while. It was amusing, upbeat, and emotionally compelling, in my opinion.\n\nNow that I think about it, I'm laughing. Since this movie made me feel like a child once more and gave me a wonderful, positive feeling inside, I don't understand all the objections.

To everyone else who is interested in viewing a good movie, here's my recommendation: go see this one. This film was enjoyable and definitely deserves a second viewing. This is one of my favorite movies, and I've watched it no less than six times. The performances by Salman Khan and Jacqueline in this film were superb. It was quite enjoyable to me. In any case, I wish Kick's Team the best of success with their next movies. Meanwhile, I'll be patiently awaiting the arrival of the sequel. Unlike most of Salman Khan's films, Kick isn't merely a showcase for his charm."

Any hiccups? Yes, of course! The first half could've been tighter. Randeep Hooda is supremely efficient, delivering a performance that stays with you.Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a powerhouse of talent and KICK gives him the opportunity to cross over to the commercial league.Nawazuddin is simply outstanding.Jacqueline Fernandez does well.On the whole Kick is a full on entertainer that will give you the much needed 'kick'!Kick is the best made and the most fun. If you're a fan,you just hit the jackpot.KICK IS SIMPLY KICK ASS!"

Jackline Fer's amazing connection to Salman Khan is only equaled by the brilliance of her choreography. There is no more attractive duo in all of Bollywood than they are right now.

Kick is excellent Its first half is filled with hilarious humor, and each character's introduction is fantastic."

They talk about their pasts with one another. Shaina tells the tale of her ex-boyfriend Devi Lal Singh-Salman Khan, who lived only for 'Kick.' She tells her friends about his insanity and their whirlwind relationship, until one day he breaks up with her for a new high and goes away, never to return. Himanshu tells her about his heroic exploits and how he has now met his equal - an astute thief. Great action film!!!!"

Although it's largely humorous, there are some heartwarming moments as well (you might want to have some tissues on hand), as well as some poignant ones about the meaning of life and work, and it's a moving movie about friendship. Additionally, my daughter loved the movie a lot and made a point of commenting on how unusual it was for the men to cry in the movie."

The actor-turned-director Sajid Nadiawala showed great potential in his directorial debut, and it is recommended that he continue working in this capacity. The attacks that have been leveled against Salman Khan's new attitude by the media are, in my view, unfounded. Even though obstacles appear in every movie he films, he is still able to do what he sets out to do. There is no disputing that Salman Khan and Jackline Fer have wonderful chemistry together, and moreover, that the choreography that was done on Jackline Fer was outstanding. They have evolved into Hollywood's most adorable couple. In the future, it is anticipated that they will put in a greater amount of work. As a direct consequence of this, kick is fantastic and fulfills all requirements."

I don't think the media was right, but Salman Khan seems to have a better attitude now that he's taken their criticism to heart. He's free to do anything he wants, despite the fact that every picture has its own unique problems. Jackline Fer is a fantastic dancer and has a great rapport with Salman Khan. They have become the prettiest couple in Hollywood. In the future, they need to work harder. Therefore, kick is fantastic, as he has all desirable qualities."

The film's two protagonists, Salman Khan and Jacqueline Fernandez, did not disappoint me in the least. This is the finest film I've ever seen, maybe since Eid '13, the last time I went to the theaters. Brilliant, and it not only met but beyond my high expectations for the actors."

Maybe it was all the fun that Salman Khan seemed to be having in the film. Maybe it was just the genuine quality he brought to his interactions with the other characters. Maybe it was the entertaining music, dance and action sequences. There were definitely several laugh-out-loud moments. This is a fun film designed to showcase Salman Khan. If you are familiar with Hindi cinema and Salman Khan films, you will appreciate many of the Bollywood references. If you approach the film as a pure entertainer, you will enjoy KICK."

He re-enters their lives while maintaining the charade that he has forgotten all that has happened to him. A more profound enigma and a mission of unequivocal pursuit may be found behind it all... Such an invigorating and action-packed movie. I have been keeping up with the progress of this movie for some time now. The performances of Salman Khan and Jacqueline Fernandez were the primary reasons why I did not experience even the slightest amount of disappointment. In all candor, I feel that this is the most enjoyable movie that I have seen in a theater since the holiday of Eid in 2013, and maybe ever? With regard to the performers, the performance was so good that it even exceeded my expectations."

It is a wonderful kind of entertainment that is packed with excitement, passion, and love. In particular, the scene with the train highlighted Salman's one-of-a-kind flair. It is recommended to watch for the sake of entertainment. Due in large part to Salman Khan's amazing performance, the movie Kick is without a doubt the best one to come out this year. In spite of the fact that the film is a carbon copy of a Telugu movie with the same name, Salman Khan gives an outstanding performance, and the rest of the cast does a wonderful job of supporting him."

Both parties prefer to reminisce about times gone by when they get together. In this piece, Shaina tells the tale of her one and only lover, the 'Kick' obsessive Devi Lal Singh-Salman Khan. He had a serious crush on the movie. Their relationship lasted for a short time, but she describes it as intense, and she explains how he finally dumped her for someone else. Himanshu tells her everything that has happened to him since he first met someone who could equal him in knowledge and cunning."

The media has recently blasted Salman Khan for his apparent shift in attitude, but I do not think their comments are legitimate. Every image has an issue, but he can fix them as he likes.

Now, every song appears to be a smash, since the music is excellent. Salman Khan's playback singing is a wonderful addition! Salman Khan's antics transcend explanation since they are so amazing and out of this world. In the film, Jacqueline Fernandez is stunningly beautiful, and she and Salman Khan create a fantastic on-screen duo. The villain's portrayal by Nawazuddhin is scary because to his truly evil gestures, speech, and cackling. Excellent kick The wit and introductions of each character in the first half of the play are superb."

Excellence in music Outstanding cinematography Very, very, very gorgeous and attractive film with a solid plot Each and every character is unforgettable, not only Salman Khan sir's. The acting and dialogues are excellent. Khan sahab's appearance was just unmatched. It caused me to forget Hritic Roshan's appearance. Fantastic action scenes and locales. The long wait is at an end!! The enormous anticipation and fervor around KICK are absolutely justified!! In every film starring Salman Khan, one thing stands out: \"Unabashed Entertainment\"! And yet, this star delivers again and again!!"

I encourage that people view this film and enjoy doing so. This film was engaging and worthy of repeated viewings. I've watched this film at least six times, and I've always appreciated it. Salman Khan and Jacqueline performed really well in this film. I enjoyed it a lot. Anyway, I wish Kick's Team the best of success with their future projects.... In addition, I shall be eager to see its sequel... Kick, a film starring Salman Khan, has much more to offer than simply his charm."

Great music, and it looks like each new song is gaining traction. Salman Khan's playback singing is a wonderful bonus to the film. Salman Khan's antics are so fantastic and out of this world that they defy description. Jacqueline Fernandez is very breathtaking to see in this film, and she has great chemistry with Salman Khan. The villain in the narrative is played by Nawazuddhin, who gives a performance that sends shivers down your spine with his brilliantly wicked gestures, diction, and cackling. Superb smack The story's first half is great, full of amazing comedy and character introductions."

Since Sajid Nadiawala's first picture as a director was well received, he should likely continue in that role in the future. Even if Salman Khan has shown marked improvement in his attitude as of late, I do not think the media's recent criticisms of him are fair. Every one of his movies has problems, yet he can still do anything he pleases with the plot. The chemistry between Jackline Fer and Salman Khan is strong, and she is a talented choreographer. They have become Hollywood's prettiest couple. Next time, they need to put in more effort. Having no wants or needs is amazing."

        "review_detailed_main": "The following is the plan: Story: I can tell you one thing about the narrative, and that is that it is unlike anything else you have ever seen in a movie. The character of Devi Lal Singh, played by Salman Khan, is a daredevil whose life isn't complete till he can say the word \"KICK.\" Without KICK, he believes that life is empty and uninteresting. Shaina, a psychiatrist who is portrayed by Jacqueline Fernandez, is the one who piques his interest; at first, Shaina doesn't like Devi, but once she learns more about him, she starts to develop affections for him as well. Devi is the one who piques Shaina's interest. However, unanticipated occurrences have caused their life to take a different path than they had planned. The inclusion of additional characters can only serve to elevate the overall quality of the picture. Amazing."

Sincerity dictates that I would rate it on par with the original. And because we were able to use cutting edge technology in the year 2022, we were able to produce breathtaking visual effects! Additionally, the music was outstanding; just listening to it causes you to feel a certain way. I think we succeeded in doing this. I was glad to see more of Sarah because she was my favorite character from the previous movie. She made me laugh out loud and was obviously having a great time. Stretch out! To my delight, it looked like everyone involved in making this video."

The quality and emotional power of the story stem from how accurate it is. This performance is superb and faultless. I've watched the show maybe a dozen times, and each time I've enjoyed it. With a strong supporting cast and no plot holes to be detected, life at an engineering school has been accurately depicted. The entire movie is hilarious. Since TZP and Ghajani, tremendous progress has been accomplished. Anticipating the DVD release with zeal. In fact, I'm thinking of going to the theater for a second time. I currently own 30 Bollywood DVDs and have seen approximately five of them in theaters. I'm an Australian who adores Bollywood movies; I have no doubt that whatever comes next will touch us profoundly. If I could, I'd give this movie a higher rating. I, for one, would. I don't think those who give this movie a bad review should be able to critique or even stop others from seeing movies. This movie is charming, loving, and humorous. You may also cry for various reasons in addition to laughing. You'll be laughing one minute and empathizing with their suffering the."

This movie easily ranks in the top five among those I've seen. I consider myself fortunate just to have the chance to see this movie. The film has everything a cinema enthusiast might desire. It had everything I could want in a good story-it made me laugh, it made me cry, it taught me life lessons. It was similar to getting sucked into a good book."

Jacqueline and Salman have fantastic chemistry, and Randeep Hooda has a defined role to perform. You won't find another role like this anywhere else in the show. It's fantastic entertainment because it's so full of life and feeling. The sequence with the train, in particular, really showed off Salman's unique style. If you're looking for something entertaining to do, watch this. Kick is, without down, the finest film of the year, and that's mostly because of Salman Khan's fantastic performance. Despite being an exact replica of a Telugu film of the same name, Salman Khan delivers a fantastic performance, and the rest of the cast does a great job of supporting him."

On the other hand, the music and the plot both fall short of expectations. In general, seeing this movie is going to be well worth your time. There are certain laughs that you have no choice but to give, while others come naturally to you. The picture has some terrific moments of action, but it's tough to single out the specific special effects that were used. At general, it is recommended to see this movie in a cinema. It is safe to say that Salman Khan gives his most impressive performance of the year in this. His work here is really remarkable. The action film kick is an improvement over Jai Ho. This movie just has one sentence that is really memorable, and it's \"Mein dill me atta hai dimahgh me nahi.\" That back and forth is quite well attended. I really hope you like what you're seeing.
