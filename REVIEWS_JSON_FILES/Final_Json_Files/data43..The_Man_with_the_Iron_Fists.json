Russell Crowe and Lucy Lui did a fair performance,but even they couldn't salvage the movie.I'm being very critical with my review b/c it's unfortunate to see a movie that had the potential,but didn't live up to it."

Also because I am a huge Wu-Tang Clan fan. What I expected to see was some decent fight choreography back-dropped with a grimy, old-school soundtrack. Now from what I recall on the soundtrack part, it did not deliver. And I know that RZA could have incorporated a couple tracks that would have lined this film up nice. Some that could have been included were; Da Mystery of Chessboxin', Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin ta F*** Wit, and pretty much anything from the 36 Chambers album. The fight scenes were mediocre until near the end to which I decided I would suck it up and just watch the rest of the movie. The first scene of the film actually made me angry because the fight scene was chopped up (which I hate), and the track they used in the background (actually from the 36 Chambers album) just didn't fit right!\n\nOther things that were disappointing, other than Bautista from WWE showing up, was the weak script and amateurish plot. The dialogue was horrible (see quote from above) and the plot was...well there wasn't really a plot at all. I walked out of the movie asking myself/trying to remember what the story was really about. I'm not sure if it was because I was blown away by RZA's acting or because I was too busy trying to figure out why Russell Crowe was in the movie at all.\n\nThe set and costume design were the only things I thought were good about the movie. And the effort to create something visually appealing did not go unnoticed. But its all about the story and characters, which were both lacking aside from Lucy Liu's bit. Wait I think I just remembered what the movie was about...yeah it's pretty weak.\n\nIf Quentin Tarantino had more involvement/any involvement at all in this movie it might have been quite possibly something spectacular. But then RZA would have probably not been in it. Hey when is Kill Bill Vol 3 coming out?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes I gave this movie an eight! Why, you might ask? Because it did all the things it was supposed to do. Reading all the reviews, I can't understand what people were expecting this movie to be. Judging from the trailer, you can tell it's going to be a dope kung fu movie but you also see that RZA is playing the main character. I didn't expect much from his acting but he did an okay job nonetheless. The plot was solid, nothing complex or in depth like Inception or Dark Knight but who really expects a complex plot from an action movie. I sure as hell don't. I'm a film student and I noticed a lot of things wrong from a logistics stand point, but I know how to turn off my head and just enjoy a film for what it is. I didn't make the movie, so why waste my time talking about what I would have done differently because I'll never get the chance to. But I can write a review based on how I experienced the film.\n\nTHE GOOD - The score was great. An interesting mix of hip hop, symphonic and other genres. The costuming, weaponry, set design were all great and looked great on film. This film had a lot of funny moments. As an adult, I can appreciate the humor from a dirty joke and they did them well. The fighting and action were awesome. There were times where my best friend would consistently tap out of excitement for how awesome the fight scenes were. The acting was okay, but I think the best job goes to Lucy Lui and Russell Crowe because they gave the best performances.\n\nTHE BAD - I don't know about RZA playing the main character. He did okay on some parts but on others he was very dry. I also would have preferred someone else to narrate. Like Morgan Freeman or Laurence Fishburne. I named those black actors because it seemed like the Filmmakers were going for an urban feel, but RZA's strong east coast accent was very distracting at times but I don't think that was a huge flaw, it's just a matter of taste and that's what the director wanted so I can respect that. There were a lot of cheesy moments. Some of the dialogue was cheesy and even certain points in the movie, you kind of whisper to yourself \"Really?!\" But knowing Quentin and RZA they both are Kung Fu lovers so I looked over the cheesy moments because I knew they were just paying homage to all of the Kung Fu movies that they grew up watching. It would have been nice to have a more detailed plot. Some characters weren't established well enough to care for them, but with me I didn't want to care I just wanted to see some flying kicks and daggers. Those nappy ass wigs that the Wolf Clan made me want to chew bricks. The hairstylist should be fired but, again, it's all a matter of taste. That was just a creative choice made by the director and I can respect that.\n\nOverall, the movie is just a fun flick to go see on a Friday night. Lots of blood, decapitation, fun martial arts, subliminal dirty jokes, sarcastic humor, special effects, and a unique, urban take on the classic Kung Fu films we've learn to love over the years. This is not a movie you waste your time dissecting. You either love it or you hate. I took the movie for what it was and I loved every minute of it. It had everything an action flick should have, great action, great costumes, great weapons, solid plot and good actors.\n\nCongratulations, RZA on your first film. I'm sure he can'y do anything but get better. He definitely has a vivid mind and I'm anxious to see how he evolves.\n\nLastly, whenever you're reading a review, make sure you learn how to decipher an authentic review from that of an upcoming filmmaker. We all tend to be very hard on each other and ourselves. A lot of these reviews, contain inhibitions about creative taste rather than the movie itself. No one cares about what you would have done differently. All they care about is if it's worth their ten, fifteen, twenty dollars. That is all."

        "review_detailed_main": "RZA's film has some amount of imagination,but, simply put, he has no idea how to build, pace, or tell a story. He has made the unfortunate mistake of imitating a genre he loves without understanding what makes it work. The dialogue is half nonsensical exposition, half nauseating one-liners. Lots of clumsy penis and vagina jokes.\n\nThe plot is so diffuse...there is not enough time given to any character for them to be read as an actual character. The film fails in tying together any of these frayed threads and also fails to make what happens in any of them significant or sensible. For example there is a \"betrayal\" plot which happens in the first two minutes of the film, when there is no context to make that betrayal meaningful, make the traitor seem particularly villainous, etc. The acting is very broad and simplistic, which I guess is to be expected given the things RZA expects them to say. He doesn't seem to understand that all of these things, the characters, dialogue, plot points, etc. are pointless without a proper context.\n\nSome people might be inclined to tell me it's the \"point\" of the movie to not have a story, to be a loose framework on which a series of fight scenes are hung. I'd first suggest that that is not a meaningful effort to make. But even as a visual spectacle or stylistic effort, it doesn't do very well. All of the fights are basically the same knife/sword play... none of the characters really have a specific fighting style, and the CGI gore lopped onto the fights is excessive and silly. The music cues are embarrassingly overdone...any time the film wants you to feel an emotion, the sappiest orchestral music instantly kicks in, to the beat of a hip hop song.\n\nI think it's possible that RZA could make a good film someday, but this certainly isn't it."

You see that the movie is practically written, directed, produced (Al-bed Eli Roth) by a rookie film director (and rap/hip-hop legend) RZA. And you think its going to be trash... Okay got it opinions are opinions everybody has one, but take a step back and see what this movie is. Its not meant to the the next great kung-fu movie. Its not meant to be a Oscar winner. It was conceived as a new/interesting look at mixing two different things and seeing what comes out (kung-fu and hip-hop). In this regard i feel as though RZA did a good job incorporating the two together. Do not get me wrong this movie had its fair share of problems that i feel like a more seasoned Director will be able to sniff out, however that is not the case and i feel like too much banter is thrown RZA's way. Give the man a break.\n\nAll in all i though this was a enjoyable film and a movie i could watch again. I respect RZA from coming out his comfort zone and trying something new like directing and i am excited to see his future work."

        "review_detailed_main": "Produced (not directed or written) by Quentin Tarantino (so you know it's going to be bad) \"The Man with the Iron Fists\", Wu Tang Clan member RZA's first try behind the camera, doesn't disappoint as far as \"bad\" movies go. This is truly an exercise in visual and structural ineptitude, which could only be the work of an amateur filmmaker. RZA, starring alongside an obese Russell Crowe and Cung Le (which should tell you all you need to know) in this rather poor grindhouse homage to old Kung Fu movies, narrates the simplistic story of a black blacksmith (RZA) who must protect his village from a deadly band of assassins. But even this story takes a hit, as it becomes overcomplicated by RZA's dreadful storytelling abilities. This mess of a film also stars Lucy Liu, who is by far the most tolerable character, playing the Madam of the town brothel. But not even Liu playing a watered down version of her character in \"Kill Bill: Vol: 1\" or a halfway decent final battle sequence can conceal the amount of problems that essentially cut \"The Man with the Iron Fists\" off at the wrists. Truthfully, I haven't wanted to like a movie this much and been so very disappointed by the result since \"Battle LA\".\n\nWhy is this movie so bad? Well, the fact that the entire movie distractingly switches back and forth from English to Mandarin (I am only speculating) for reasons unexplained to the viewer, is the first of many head shakingly dreadful decisions made by RZA. But for a more in-depth breakdown, the following is a very brief (that is, if you enjoy long rants) analysis of RZA's first film:\n\nRZA is no writer: While the classic Martial Arts film concept itself is interesting, the script co-written by RZA himself, as well as Eli Roth (Tarantino's prot\u00e9g\u00e9) is rather weak. Surprisingly RZA (only one of the best DJ's/lyricist alive) can't write dialogue to save his life. And while Roth has never been a master of the spoken word himself, it becomes all too obvious between which lines of dialogue RZA has written and which are insertions from Roth, when a character goes on a stiff 5 minute rant that ends with a rather Tarantino-esque one-liner. As for the story itself, the problem lies in that it becomes overly cramped with stupid subplots. Every time the story begins to head in a finite direction, RZA does his damnedest to add another idiotic twist, or have the character cease all action in order to spout out one more bit of needless exposition, complicating matters for an audience that was barely on board to begin with.\n\nRZA is no director: Sometimes a filmmaker can get away with gratuitous violence because it is intricate to the story (or sometimes simply on pedigree alone). But when your story hangs on by a thread and your directing is suspect, the sporadic occurrence of intense brutality doesn't so much come off as shocking, as much as it adds to the clunkiness of the film. Now, RZA does use some stylized camera techniques that obtain a semblance of that cool-factor he is looking for, but yet again, problems arise when he uses them in excess.\n\nRZA is no actor: Maybe the least important aspect of a grindhouse film like this is the acting, although there is something to be said for a self controlled actor who knows how to overact. In saying that, every scene with RZA, is almost comically stunted by his inability to hold his own around A and B-list actors and actresses. His own character must run the gambit of emotions here, from anger, to sorrow, to a man who is in severe anguish. So, if anything, his own script asks too much of him.\n\nSomething good: If you try hard enough, you can probably find something good to say about any movie\u0085well, maybe except for \"Grown Ups\". In the case of \"The Man with the Iron Fists\"\u0085um\u0085well\u0085the soundtrack is good (although, at times ridiculously misused) but this is to be expected since music is what RZA does (NOT DIRECTING). Final Thought: I do realize the intention of a film like \"The Man with the Iron Fists\" is to champion a hardy slathering of over-the-topness, but that doesn't change the fact that this is quietly one of the worst directed films of the year. At times it's so bad that one would wonder how Quentin Tarantino thought it was a good idea to financially back this project at all. But on the other hand, it wouldn't shock me if it were to come to light that Tarantino had given RZA the money, called up a few of his actor buddies, and told Eli Roth to make his script readable, as a repayment for RZA's work on the Kill Bill soundtracks.\n\nWritten by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

        "review_title": "Not intended to be a masterpiece, not a bad film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, a disclaimer: All in all, this movie succeeds in what it sets out to do. It's a homage to grindhouse Kung Fu movies of the 70's and 80's and it succeeds very well in being just that kind of film. People go around saying how crap it was, but let's remind ourselves, not every movie is trying to be a masterpiece, and your subjective expectations don't mean this is a bad movie. Everyone went in expecting to see Kill Bill for some reason, because it was produced by Tarantino.\n\nAt any rate, the film has quite a nice plot, reminiscent of the movies it tries to pay homage to. It's a simple plot, not many twists and turns to it, but it does draw you in. It has drama, it plays on base emotions like greed and lust for power, and it involves a bloody multi-faction war. Basically, the governor of a Chinese province is transporting some gold (for no specific reason, I assumed it was collected taxes or army wages), and assigns a warrior clan (the Lions) with protecting the shipment while it passes through their area, which is infested with several crime syndicates. The Lions clan leader is murdered by his lieutenants as they want to claim the gold for themselves. Later on, the story starts involving another warrior clan that is protecting the gold (Geminis), a crime syndicate (Wolves), a mercenary army (Jackals), a blacksmith (RZA) that just wants to leave with his beloved woman, a whore house where said woman works (The Blossom House), a mysterious assassin (Poison Dagger), a mysterious cowboy (Jack Knife, played by Russel Crowe) and the son of the murdered Lions clan leader (Zen Yi or X-Blade).\n\nThe film contains several fight scenes and violent acts and if you are an action fan, you are gonna enjoy this. The cinematography is quite good, especially in the final battle scene. The acting is excellent for the most part (except RZA at some parts) and considering this was intended to resemble a grindhouse b-movie film. I especially enjoyed the obese Russel Crowe in the role of Jack Knife.\n\nOverall, it's a good watch if you don't go in expecting to see the masterpiece of the year in Kung Fu movies, or a parody along the lines of Black Dynamite. It was certainly much more enjoyable than Argo 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I've never reviewed movies but I'll give it the old Jr. high try. This movie with it's solid effects and even nicer fighting is still flawed. Maybe a review is too strong of a word here's my bad/ good list. I've left a grade to give a better Idea of my disapproval.\n\nThe bad: 1. Focus the dang camera (C-), I'm not an expert but who the hell is focusing? Lucy Liu during a big speech has her helper in focus and she just off focus. If I spent $2000 on a wedding video I'd like the bride in focus, geez. The focus was out of control in a lot of places which was distracting.\n\n2. Rza (D-) although I do really think this is a work of love and it shows, WTH was he thinking staring in this? If he's too afraid of what his friends think of him if he stops doing his best droopy impression, don't be the lead actor! I mean it's 10-20 minutes, or however long he's in this, of him looking emotionless. I mean grimace man or look sad when bad things happen! How hard is it!!\n\n3. Flashbacks (F)There's an origin flashback an boy is it misguided and uncomfortable! It's just so underdeveloped, maybe the extended version would make sense of it but it really could have been shot better. I imagine this is to Southern Americans (not South America, the Hey Y'all kind etc), what bad American war movies are to Germans. If you're gonna deface us do it with a little finesse.\n\n4. Character motivations sucked(big ol' F), I mean really sucked! I would have been happy to give this a 7 if the characters would make a little sense. Somethings could have been resolved easily I think by just a few lines of dialogue but nope it's all thrown at you with no solid direction.\n\n5. The \"almost\" makes it a crime(F), like where was everyone's head? You have an almost great movie and no one could ask for help or give it??\n\n6.Split screens (F), Why? Was action happening at the same time?, nope. Bad call, again in the right hands maybe. Here 4 minutes of film that wasn't worth the editing time.\n\nThe good:\n\n1. Costumes(B+) were cool, I liked them even the goofy ones, had no problems really. The wigs were really fun and funny.\n\n2. The action(A-), was really great. Fun and funny with no real let downs you get into it and the end battle to me wasn't disappointing except for rza's acting but he was actually passable here(sort of).\n\n3. Effects(A), yup solid, don't care if it looks Kill Billish. Come on, I've actually watched anime since forever and that's how blood sprays in most of those. Dumb to even bring kill bill into this(sort of).\n\n4. Weapons(A+) lots of great gags and deaths. You can tell a lot of time went into conceiving these and the deaths.\n\n5.The villain(A++), Silver Lion and Bronze Lion are great and eat up the screen, none of the heroes come close to these two guys charisma on screen! I mean why the heroes played it so straight without any wink wink moments is beyond me. Did they really think this was a serious movie?\n\nWhich comes to my overall review! 5/10 C+, basically there's a lot going right here enough to be watchable, enjoyable even become a classic b movie. But it was so close to being more it's a little sad.\n\nnuff said, MEMO Art"

I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of movies like this. I have never really been into martial arts type movies although I have seen some really good ones. That said, while not being all that amazing of a movie itself this one was super entertaining and had some interesting fight sequences that I really enjoyed. The movie is way over the top and unbelievable, but it fit in this movie. If you are looking for an Oscar worthy type martial arts movie then I recommend 13 Assassins or War Of Arrows. This movie is really just visually fun and the fighting is entertaining, which is good sometimes. I liked it more then I expected. Overall, better then anticipated, martial arts fans may really like this. I say B."

He got together with Quentin Tarantino to make this movie and it definitely feels like a Tarantino movie.\n\nThe movie does not especially feel new. It is made in the old fashioned kung-fu movie style. It feels old, there are a lot of floating around a bit like Crouching Tiger. The blood and violence is so over the top just like the old fashioned kung-fu films. Bloody literally flies! :)\n\nThe difference between the old movies and this one is the soundtrack. During some scenes there are some WTC songs and hip hop songs... which i liked. I thought it brought a new feel to the movie. It worked really well.\n\nIt has got some big names it it. The film stars Rza, Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu and former WWE Champion, Dave Bautista. There are some pretty good effects in it and also some great fighting scenes. The choreography was good too.\n\nThis film is excellent entertainment.\n\nI will give this film a 7 out of 10.\n\nIf you like the old style Monkey TV show, kung-fu movies then you will love this.\n\nIf you would like to read more of my Movie reviews, please like my Facebook Page:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

It was extremely cheesy and not in the fun obvious sort of way but more like it was done by mistake. The movie felt like it was filmed in a month and all of the characters were never given an opportunity to develop. It was a very busy movie, especially when it came down to the action scenes. Although there is plenty of action, I felt like I was watching a \"Bourne\" film due to the constant shaking of the camera and the sloppy transitions.\n\nThe fighting was not technical. The typical Kung Fu-esque flying through the air was clumsy instead of smooth and elegant. All of the lines in the movie were awe full. The plot was stupid and forced. The Chinese David Bowie villain could not be taken seriously.\n\nAnd the worst most annoying part of the movie was the digital blood splatters. Every time someone was stabbed, digital blood would squirt out of the wound completely enveloping the screen in red but not getting on any of the characters or furniture in the movie.\n\nI hated this movie a lot and others in the theater seemed to feel the same way as throughout the movie people constantly kept walking out and not coming back.

It is a tongue in cheek take on old school martial arts films and I for one enjoyed it a lot. The fight scenes were outrageous and rightfully so. If you appreciate the beauty of Asian women then you are in for a real treat with this film. The plot wasn't deep but it wasn't meant to be. It is just a bit of fun and nostalgic for the films made by such production companies as golden harvest. Sometimes a guy wants to watch a movie and not have to think and this is the perfect film for that.\n\nI found it interesting that Russell Crowe was in this film. He must have quite a sense of humour. Casting Batista I thought was pretty good as the character suited him well. Lucy Liu is always sassy and I the other actors brought some much needed humour to the movie."

CRAP\n\nfor those comparing this to KILL BILL: you are retards... Kill Bill was a good film.. it had style, good action scenes, good dialogue, carefully set up, stylistic, cool, good lines, good actors, great soundtrack (RZA did a great job there)... but this film... oh God... BAD\n\ndon't waste your time, don't buy into the hype.\n\nRZA has talent no doubt, but this movie sucked... maybe his next film will be better... or maybe this was intended to be a BAD movie.. who knows. For 15 million USD i'm sure it will sell tickets and make it's money's worth from all the unfortunates like myself who will be lured in from the fantastic trailer... anyway..\n\nI'm out- Peace"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay so I read a lot of reviews on IMDb before deciding whether or not to watch a movie, but this is my first time writing a review. Because I was really interesting in seeing a movie by RZA and the preview made it look like a Tarantino kill bill-esque movie, which I really like. I felt I had to review this movie because the rating is currently pretty low. I watch a lot a movies and am really into writing and screen writing, so of course I wasn't expecting an exceptionally scripted or written movie.\n\nIn the past couple of days I have seen a few movies I wasn't too excited about seeing, but I'm running out of new ones. I saw Abraham Lincoln Vampire hunter, Alex Cross, and Sinister. I just watched this movie this morning and although all of those movies are very different, I was by far the most entertained by TMWTIF. I though Russel Crowe did a pretty good job with what he was given, and RZA did okay as actor and I really like when he narrated. Also the fight scenes soundtrack is really cool, with good wu-tang beats and a few verses. It was pretty cool seeing the Kung-fu fighting with the rap playing, pretty different.\n\nAll in all, if your looking for a movie with a really good storyline, plot, and script, then you probably shouldn't watch this movie. If you just want something to put on that's really cool to look at, with good music, attractive Asian women, and really good fight scenes then you probably won't be disappointed. It's a fun movie and deserves a little better rep. I'd watch a sequel."

I'm sure the movie said it, but the movie kept bouncing from character to character which made it hard to focus on the storyline. The action scenes were way too comical to be taken seriously. The blood would shoot out of them like the geyser Old Faithful. At one point I didn't know if this movie was supposed to be taken seriously as an action film or meant to be a comedy. One of the characters had an 80's style hairdo that made me laugh every time I saw him. The movie dragged on much too long without substance for me to stay interested. Just random fight scenes that made me laugh more than appreciate the arts of Kung Fu. I felt I was in a nightmare that Oskar Schell had from Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close."

If anybody thinks it's terrible it's because they're taking it too seriously. A simple, fun, colorful movie with a bit of CGI to highlight what is already well-choreographed practical FX action. Although some can complain there's not enough Russell Crowe, or that it has every action clich\u00e9 in the book, but therein lies the fun of it. Nothing's too precious, and lots of stuff is in there just because it's cool *cough Iron Fists cough* Ever see Iron Monkey, Hero or even Shoot 'em Up? This is along those lines. I'm glad that when a Wu Tang member went kung fu, they went all out. Worth watching with friends."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is set in nineteenth century China, Jungle Village is home to several warring clans . On the hunt for a fabled treasure of gold, a band of warriors, assassins, and a rogue British soldier descend upon a village in feudal China, where a humble blacksmith looks to defend himself and his fellow villagers . There the African-American blacksmith (RZA) makes deadly weapons for the clans, intending to use his payments to purchase the freedom of his lover Lady Silk (Jamie Chung), and leave the village . As an undercover emissary named Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) arrives in the village to monitor the gold and takes up residence in the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu) . As he leader of the clan called Gold Lion is assigned by the Governor to guard his gold that will be transported through the region . However he is double-crossed and killed by the villain Silver Lion (Byron Mann) and greedy Bronze Lion (Cung Lee) . As seven clans, taken on a fortune in gold , let the battle begin.\n\nThis luxurious Kung Fu film was spectacularly filmed with good production design , colorful cinematography , a lot of fierce struggles and breathtaking scenes . The flick displays lots of violence, action filled , thrills and groundbreaking combats . This is a colorful, Shanghai-set and quite budget movie ; leave no clich\u00e9 untouched , though the fighting are magnificently staged . The flick also contains some sex scenes and nudism in charge of whores of brothel and a lot of blood and gore . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action , surprises ,fierce combats and rousing fights. Amid the glamour and grandeur of the scenarios is developed an intrigue about nasty clans , including betrayal , crime and exploring the dark side of Chinese power . It is a homage to Run Run Shaw classic films , a known producer , recently deceased , of Chop-Socky genre who made lots of successes such as \"The 36th Chamber of Shaolin\" ,\"Five Deadly Venoms\" \"Killer Clans\", \"Return of the Master Killer\" and many others .\n\nThis rated \u00a8R\u00a8 picture is starred by a lot of new and old figures from Kung Fu movies such as Cung Le , Byron Mann , Rick Yune and the veterans Gordon Liu and Dennis Chan . Furthermore , a brief cameo by mythical Pam Grier . Impressive and breathtaking fights with deadly use of fists , feet and palms , along with such weapons as swords, sticks , and lances . And hundreds of armored warriors reenacted by lots of extras . Overwhelming attacks and exciting combats very well staged , the result is a strong entry for action buffs . Kung Fu training scenes are a direct reference in \u00a8Kill Bill\u00a8 by Quentin Tarantino , enhanced by the fact that Gordon Liu stars in both movies . RZA and Eli Roth worked on the screenplay together over two years, talking through every aspect of the story, down to the detail of every weapon . The first cut of the film was four hours long. RZA suggested splitting it into two films, but producer Eli Roth disagreed, and it was ultimately cut down to approximately 90 minutes. The picture finishes with an opening credits showing a demonstration of martial arts by main actors against an empty backdrop similarly to old Hong-Kong movies of the 70s."

However he is betrayed and murdered by the greedy Silver Lion (Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Cung Le).\n\nGold Lion's favorite son Zen Yi (Rick Yune), a.k.a. The X-Blade, seeks revenge and heads to Jungle Village, but he is defeated by Brass Body (Dave Bautista) and rescued by the local Blacksmith Thaddeus (RZA). Meanwhile the Gemini Female (Grace Huang) and the Gemini Male (Andrew Lin) protect the Governor's gold, but they are vanquished by the army of Silver and Bronze Lion.\n\nThe Blacksmith is abducted by the Lions and has his arms severed by Brass Body. However he is saved by the British Jack Knife (Russell Crowe), who is the emissary of the Emperor, and he manufactures iron arms for Thaddeus. Meanwhile the Governor sends the Jackal army to fight against the Lions and they hide the gold in the brothel of Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu). However, Madam Blossom and his girls form an army of black widows and together with Jack, Zen Yi and The Blacksmith, they fight against the Lions.\n\n\"The Man with the Iron Fists\" is a classy trash with a senseless and messy story, no character development, spoken in English and with an irritating hip hop in the soundtrack. In the environment of China, the pretentious RZA wastes budget, a wonderful cinematography and a great cast in an unfunny and violent parody of Wuxia that never works. The worst, he believes that he can be a lead actor using the same facial expression along the movie. The funniest part is when the obese Russell Crowe's character Jack Knife calls Crazy Hippo of fat man. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Homem de Punhos de Ferro\" (\"The Man with the Iron Fists\")"

I eventually saw THE MAN WITH THE IRON FIST and as it turns out its not as bad as people made it out to be. Its no genre defining masterpiece but it certainly is far from the worst movie ever made.\n\nThe storyline I've noticed moves at a really fast pace. At times the characters and their motivations are revealed so fast you need to have a sharp attention span to know who's who and what their purpose is. The action scenes aren't perfect but are reasonably well done. At times the fight scenes appear as if their edited a little fast but the film doesn't utilize the very annoying shaky cam style so the action is easier to follow.\n\nThe acting I'll admit wasn't the best I've seen in a film. The best performances are mainly given by Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu and Byron Mann. The rest of the cast aren't what you would call God awful, they just seem a little wooden at times but that doesn't really hurt the film very much.\n\nOverall, THE MAN WITH THE IRON FIST to me was better than I expected and despite its flaws it manages to entertain although I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is a bit of an uptight film critic or perhaps to someone who is a die hard fan of the Shaw brothers style kung fu movies with high standards. Its better to a bit open minded with this film and try and take it as is."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I entered the theater to watch Rza's movie \"The Man with the Iron Fists\", I had a couple of expectations for it. From only seeing the trailer and no review on the movie, It seemed to me that this was going to be a throwback to older martial arts/kung fu style of fighting movies. After seeing that Quentin Tarantino produced the film, it made me even more excited and could not wait to find out where this movie might go. From what I know this Rza's first film he has ever directed by himself. So, I was interested to see what he brings to the table.\n\nAs the intro of the movie starts playing I get this weird feeling that this might turn out to be a wreck. But, as it plays on I find out what kind of goals they were going for in the making of this. The overall art style through the movie ended up blowing me away. This movie looks astounding almost the whole way through it. I think that is one of the main things they were going for and you can definitely tell it has a Quentin Tarantino feel to it. The Characters and scenery have great originality and a overwhelmingly awesome feel to them. Most of the acting was actually pretty good and had some big name actors like Lucy Lu and Russell Crowe. I had a little problem caring for the main plot but, each characters stories were interesting to say the least.\n\nThe thing that made this movie even better was the soundtrack. It is mix of slow jams, rock, Chinese oriented, old west, and hip hop. It just gave the movie an over all great vibe and was satisfying. The sound effects were overall decent and did not sound to fake or stupid to ruin my experience. Most of the acting was great and only a few actors were noticeably bad.\n\nNow I know what most people are wondering about is the action and violence in the movie. I can say that it is a great action oriented movie and has plenty of great fighting scene. The first half of the movie to me is the better half when it came to the fighting scenes. It was thrilling to see them flying through the air kicking each others asses. The problem I had with the second half though, was the amount of CGI they used and I'm not saying CGI is a bad thing either. It just felt that they used to much of it towards the end and it seemed different from the first half.\n\nMost people are probably expecting a gore fest of a movie sense Quentin Tarantino has his name on it. Which is definitely a bad thing in my opinion. But, after watching it I did not feel that it had as much as I was expecting. Don't get me wrong though, it is still a violent movie and there is scenes where it gets particularly gory. There is plenty of blood to enjoy and I think they did a great job.\n\nI got a lot of joy out this film and that is good for being Rza's first main stream movie. The overall main plot was unfortunately not that good of an experience for me and they did kind of veer off into another direction then I wanted it to when it came to the ending segment. These things did effect my personal opinion for the movie but, it definitely was not bad. I do recommend this film for at least a one time watch and maybe even a second if your friends have not seen it. I give it a 7.5 out of 10 and remember this whole review was opinion based so, don't yell at me! Hope this helped out a little and I hope you enjoy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Man with the Iron Fists is not a film you can watch with your brains turned on. Let's start with that. Presented by Quentin Tarantino, produced by Eli Roth and directed RZA of Wu-Tang fame, it's a film not to be taken seriously, but rather enjoyed on a stylish level.\n\nAnd if you can manage that. If you can enjoy movie just for its style, its action, its over the top moments, then this is definitely a movie for you. It's a mad mix of influences from old country westerns to wuxia martial arts films to anime to hip hop culture to sheer, unquantifiable badassery. It's a story of old blood feuds, newly-sworn vengeance, strangers and old clans, heroes and villains, warriors and assassins. Everything this movie does is for the sake of looking cool. It cares little about logic or continuity or reason. If it decides that something would be fun to do, it goes ahead and does it. And because of that, I can see why some people might dislike it. It's not a film for everyone. Personally I enjoyed it quite a lot, just because it was so much fun to watch. It had cool characters, badass action scenes, lots of martial arts fighting and a storyline that kept me entertained from start to finish.\n\nBut, to be fair, the film is not without its flaws. The hip hop music by Wu-Tang clan is an obvious choice, given the directer/leading man, but there are certain scenes where it's an ill fit for the mood. Furthermore, RZA's Blacksmith is not that interesting of a character. He's clearly going for the audience surrogate, the everyman, but he gets kind of lost when you have Russell Crowe, doing one of his funniest and most memorable roles in recent memory, as Jack Knife and Lucy Liu playing the sultry Madam Blossom. Even Dave Bautista's Brass Body is more interesting and has more personality than Blacksmith. Not that the latter is bad, it's just that the former ones are so surprisingly good.\n\nBut in the end that's only a nitpick. The Man with the Iron Fists is a fun movie. It's more than a little brainless, it's not for everyone and there's certainly a lot of \"so bad it's good\" to its quality, but I enjoyed it. Recommended to all fans of Tarantino and his kind of movies."

Fights are badly choreographed, but most actors know what they are doing, so its bearable to watch. There a lot of beautiful Asian girls, witch is also brightest thing in this, well lets call it a movie. And i must add, special effects are pretty good. But, I've seen kids on YouTube making great visuals in their homes, so that makes no impact.\n\nRevealing you plot it would be just waste of time. If you have hour and half of your life to waste. Watch this movie. I had couple of goods laughs, not believing what I'm watching. Other than that... Well avoid it if anyhow possible."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mindset before movie: Excitement! After watching Kill Bill and Repo Men, I've seen what RZA can do with a soundtrack, I was looking forward to see what he can do as a director. Especially with Mr. Tarantino backing him up alongside Russell Crowe and a group of Lius?! I was sceptic at the same time. I've seen some of the spaghetti kung fu westerns Tarantino has funded recently, so I kind of braced myself before I hit 'play'. I was also thinking in my head; \"Please make Russell Crowe's character a bad-ass...I miss bad-ass Russell Crowe!\" But really, expectations were middle of the road at best.\n\nMindset after movie: I am so jealous of RZA. After seeing RZA in a number of interviews around Kill Bill, I know how much of an addict of kung fu he is. I'm willing to bet that this movie has been a dream of his since he was a kid. He gets to star as a kung fu master birthed into a story in a style that he had the chance to create. How many times have you projected yourself onto the screen as that bad-ass hero who gets to murder a bunch of bad guys that had it coming? He just did that...for real! I really enjoyed this movie. This is the 70's kung fu movie China would have made had they the funding and the resources. I'm pretty sure that's what the RZA intended and I think he pulled it off. It had a lot of over-the-top blood-spattered action, with some cheesy scenes that will make you scratch your head and Russell Crowe wasn't as bad-ass as I hoped he would be but at least he was a little bad-ass. The RZA's acting wasn't that good, but I'm letting that one go because he's fulfilling a dream. If I had the chance I would have done the same even though I'm probably a terrible actor and I would be like \"eff you, I'm living my dream!\" On another note, the props master was a creative one, the weapons and combat gear in this movie were pretty cool and the fighting seemed more for the look because it's fancy and unrealistic but it doesn't have to be realistic because it's a kung fu movie.\n\nIf you're like me and enjoy the kung fu classics for the action and not the realism, you will enjoy this. I saw scenes that reminded me of some scenes out of movies like Enter the Dragon and some classic Jet Li titles that I have watched over and over when I was a kid. On the other hand, if you only said you liked the kung fu movies because you thought it made you look cool to your friends or boyfriends, you're probably not gonna like it.\n\nGuys: Will probably like this.\n\nGirls: Probably won't"

        "review_detailed_main": "So RZA is the a rapper that is really into the Kung-fu genre. And even presented and even help market a movie like \"Ong-Bak\". So now he is into the directors seat and tries to use all he Kung-fu movie knowledge to make his vision come to life on the big screen. Like most Kung-fu movies it isn't really about the story, the story is alright in this but when it comes down to it. It's all about the kickass bone-crunching, blood splattering and limbs flying action. And for the most part it's a pretty darn entertaining flick. It's not one of the best Kung-fu movies I seen but it does well trying to mix some hip-hop and modern feel to it. The acting chops are pretty bad in this movie, it tries to make a homage of the kung-fu genre but the bad acting went along with it. Russell Crowe is basically the only good actor in this. He plays Jack Knife who you don't really know much about throughout the whole movie. Besides the fact that he is a badass western style guy that wields a gun/knife chainsaw. The rest of the cast is over the top but it works for a movie like this. I don't know if RZA is suppose to be the main character in this, cause he doesn't have much action scenes and he is hardly in the movie. He also looked high throughout most of this movie. But he is the Man with the Iron Fists so...The thing is I couldn't tell who the main protagonist of this movie is. There are main characters and just when you think who this movie is suppose to revolve around it throws you in a loop. Anyways if you want to see a movie with some sex and a lot of violence with hip hop music this one might be for you. Personally I was entertained and you will hear some \"Oohs\" and \"Uuhs\" from the audiences. Jin who is mostly known for being a freestyle rapper that is good at doing rap battles as well. Anyways he is in this as well as some pointless sidekick character. I don't know if he really needed the money or something but it was kinda sad to see him in that role.\n\n7.4/10"

There is quite a high gore-factor though, so it's definitely not one for the squeamish. All the performances were very good with Russell Crowe, despite a very Aussie sounding English accent, standing out for me. I was impressed with RZA; I thought he did a very decent job taking on the dual role of actor and director. Lucy Liu was as reliable as ever and I also liked the performances of Rick Yune and Byron Mann. It's quite a simple tale told with a very highly paced action orientated script. It's well made and did just what it said on the tin. This is one of those where I'm going to disagree with popular opinion and give it more credit than most because I didn't think it was that bad.\n\nSteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 6.6/10.\n\nYou can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

Perhaps I'm too cynical and jaded, but most of them are far too predictable and over-produced without getting into a big rant about those movies. The Man with Iron Fists, however, felt honest and the over-the-top weapons and fights were both entertaining and inspirational, while never attempting to be realistic and obviously being a homage to exaggerated wire-fu effects. I laughed, I cared and I enjoyed watching it and that is more than I can say for a lot of the big budget polished productions that try to cleverly tug your heart-strings and manipulate you according to their demographic research for the movie."

Unfortunately, RZA is no match for QT, not even in the acting department, and the result is an utterly atrocious, poorly written (horror hack Eli Roth co-wrote the script, so no surprises there), shoddily directed mess, with horrible performances from a surprisingly impressive supporting cast: blaxploitation star Pam Grier looks embarrassed, Lucy Liu is as bad as she was in Charlie's Angels 2, a whole slew of Asian performers seize the opportunity to be in a mainstream Hollywood production but no doubt regret their decision, while Oscar winner Russell Crowe puts in quite possibly the worst performance of his entire career.\n\nEven plenty of outrageously bloody violence, courtesy of make-up maestros Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, and a bevy of hot Asian chicks cannot save this film from being a virtually unwatchable disaster. The plot is a mess of martial arts clich\u00e9s clumsily thrown together with little regard for pace or narrative cohesion, and the ridiculous action scenes fail to generate a sense of excitement thanks to RZA's lack of experience (or talent) behind the camera and clumsy editing. As penance for this travesty, I suggest that RZA visit a mountain top monastery where he can dedicate the rest of his life to studying the real classics of the genre; in time, he might learn where he went so horribly wrong. At the very least, we would never have to suffer through another RZA movie.\n\n2.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 3 for the gore effects and for sexy Grace Huang as Gemini Female."

I was not expecting a movie on the level of Crunchy Tiger-Hidden Cracker, and this flick delivered on the lowest level.

He didn't write it or direct it. Moving on.\n\nThe movie was very much like a modern Kung-Fu movie. The costumes and colors were beautiful. Absolutely stunning in parts. The action was fun, although hokey at times, but like many based on myth and a modern take on classic films. Very much to the tone of Detective Dee, Hero and even Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now this is only in action. Nothing more.\n\nThe story was your average story. Nothing new on that. People wanting to kill each other for various reasons. Revenge, hatred and sex. All your typical themes. The characters were not developed very well and I think that was a big misfortune. Russel Crowe, an ancillary character, was the best actor in the film. Hes a dick but no surprise there. RZA's acting was pitiful. Really just bad. He seemed to be coming into his own toward the climax and still was just terrible.\n\nOK so after everything I stated why 7 stars.....cause it was a throwback. It was a throwback to something Wu-Tang, specifically RZA (look at the new vids of Wu-Tang) has always admired and used as a theme in their music and videos. A lot of the action, the old school references to costumes, typical hierarchy, kung-fu power stand offs in the old action films.....etc. The biggest complaint I heard was the split screens. This is why I referenced the Manga. Manga is just like that. I do agree it threw the viewer off and was unnecessary but that was the reference. He tried to mix all the genres of Kung-fu with his own story and honestly, it was entertaining.\n\nIf your looking for a fun kung-fu movie that doesn't take itself to seriously in the plot department, you will have a fun watch. If your looking for character development, solid plot and more realistic action, watch Zatoichi or IP man."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Man with the Iron Fists is heavy-hitting contender for worst movie of 2012. Almost every element of this film has been mismanaged in some way and the result is laughable . Every single line in this script is bad. There's no other way to put it. Dialogue in this movie rivals The Room for its obvious, unimaginative and sometimes downright cringe-inducing interplay between what can only loosely be called characters. Its poorly paced, characters are one-dimensional and underdeveloped and RZA can't decide whether he wants to be the main character in his own movie. Its atrocious.\n\nAnd the acting isn't much better. Most of the cast botch their poorly penned one-liners, which makes this movie even more difficult to watch. RZA doesn't take centre stage until more than halfway into the mercifully short runtime and doesn't do anything special with the material he prepared for himself. Lucy Liu looks like she wants to murder her agent (or Quentin Tarantino) for making her do this movie. The film's only saving grace comes in the form of Russell Crowe, who makes his wholly unoriginal character and tedious dialogue a little more tolerable. If there was an award for great actors doing their best with awful material, Crowe would be a nominee.\n\nThe gimmicky action sequences look cheap and the special effects rival 2008's Twilight for believability. Costumes, hair and even sets look cheap throughout. Its clumsily shot, awkwardly cut together and riddled with continuity problems. Further, the music is jarringly out of sync with the movie. Surely RZA's history with Wu-Tang should have yielded a par-for-the-course score for his directorial debut, but alas it was not to be.\n\nThis movie should be shown to film school students as a warning of the dangers of allowing yourself too much creative control of your own movie. It feels like RZA did not have enough people around him telling him 'no'. A steady, experienced hand in screen writing or cinematography guiding RZA might have yielded a watchable movie. Instead an average idea has been turned into an asinine production in the hands of an arrogant amateur filmmaker. Don't let the Quentin Tarantino tagline fool you, this movie is appalling.\n\ngoodbadreviews.wordpress.com"

With that being said, I also hated the fighting choreography on this movie , it's simply terrible, as the dialogues are almost as childish as the plot itself ... There was nothing in fact to like about this movie , although it throws everything at us : a bit of comedy, a bit of Superhero stuff, a bit it drama, a bit of sex, huge amounts of blood (a bit like on Spartacus TV series), and of course those poor choreography fights. I could almost understand the formula, because it has been made before, but even that is getting boring and with little to offer: you know , the world moves on, changes and we evolve ! Poor Russell Crowe, poor Tarantino, to have their names involved on this one... poor me because there where thousands of more interesting things I could have done instead of watching this."

It's sorely disappointing.\n\nThe most egregious part of the film is the overuse of narration. Show, don't tell. The music doesn't fit most of the film. Russell Crowe's character is out of place, although it's at least reasonably portrayed for what it is.\n\nThere are decent moments. The first time X-Blade has to fight, and parts of the final showdown in the brothel are reasonably novel.\n\nLucy Liu and all the prostitutes are criminally underused when they could have been part of interesting and extended action sequences.\n\nDialogue and plot are juvenile. For a film that could be a natural fit to humour, there's very little in this that's funny.\n\nToo many editing cuts between characters. Insufficient one on one fighting, largely pointless seventies style screen effects. Almost complete lack of tension.\n\nI've probably seen worse martial arts films, but not many. The cheesy low budget films are better than this."

There are tons of kills in this in which blood just shoots everywhere; it's made to be silly, which is what makes it so good.\n\nTwo sons murder their father and all that stands in there way to get the gold is the favorite son, Zen Yi. Zen Yi tracks them down after learning what they did. Meanwhile, a man named Jack Knife arrives at Jungle Village and is bad #ss. He slices up this dude in a brothel and then has his fun. The local blacksmith is planning to run away with one of the brothel's girls, Lady Silk. The Lions, the ones who killed their father, want the blacksmith to make them weapons. Something happens and they get mad at him and get this guy whom some how is made of bronze to punish him. He brutally slices his arms off, Jack heals him and makes him Iron hands, and then he's ready for revenge. So the last part is this big battle at the brothel, lots of outlandish gore and so on. So, if you like movies like Kill Bill, then this is for you.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If you are into ridiculous violent films, then check this one out."

And for his first film it does rather well.\n\nThe good: 1. The veteran actors. Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe were excellent in this. You can tell they were having fun.\n\n2. The visuals. This movie had great costumes (sans the wolf clan), sets and overall setting. It really brought you into the small town and brothel.\n\n3. The story. While it does start slow, it picks up nicely and finishes very well.\n\n4. The soundtrack. Asian style hip hop in RZA's Wu-Tang model. Excellent.\n\nThe bad: 1. The pacing. It starts very slow\n\n2. The cheesiness. You expect it, but it is way over the top.\n\n3. The CGI. Particularly the blood and scene with the wolves. Why make an homage to old school martial arts flicks and not go with all props.\n\nThe so-so:\n\n1. RZA. In fact he is a capable actor and has room to grow, his martial arts skills were nonexistent and I couldn't take him seriously.\n\n2. Dialogue. It is predictable and cheesy mostly but there are some good Buddhist ideologies thrown in there.\n\n3. The other actors. Most are mediocre.\n\nOverall, a lot of room for growth for RZA, he has great potential as a writer and actor."

This movie brings all the possible clich\u00e9s you could find in those films, all seen under the street culture angle.\n\nI give this movie, like, an 8 for being original and true to its colors, a movie based on the passion & respect that RZA has for 1970-1980s kung fu flicks. Before watching, just listen to 36 chambers, get some vibes on, chill out and enjoy the movie to its worth."

What he did that he took ideas from all these movies and made this one, which is a complete torture, stupid, senseless and utterly utterly very utterly horrible.\n\nRussell Crowe, as the picture set on dates where Wild Wild West guns were not invented, so the director gave him a role in which he only enjoys orgy's, very pathetically, as he has grown fat, so created a stupid scissor gun for his character. What on earth were they thinking.\n\nRest of the characters inspiration is as following:\n\nRZA, Mortal Kombat Jackson inspired.\n\nDave Bautista, X-Men inspired.\n\nRick Yune, Wolverine and Iron Man inspired, imagine the horror of his character.\n\nDo not watch for your own good."

The music however decent, did not fit and only lended itself to make the whole production that much more ridiculous. The dialogue was just awful.

About the only actor that did fit was the WWE wrestler, whose acting by the way was on par if not better than most everyone elses.\n\nWatch it for what it is.

No surprise Q. Tarentino supported this movie and well done Universal for having the guts to produce/ distribute it.

        "review_detailed_main": "By Marie Cinquino www.thatsmye.com\n\nThe Man with the Iron Fists is a web woven by so many spiders, it is hardly a web anymore. Fight scenes are a culmination of mechanized steam punk weapons, traditional kung-fu, and a drop of bona fide style from Quentin Tarantino. Costumes and ambiance are infused with hip hop and funk, that tangible bit of RZA that we first saw in his animated series turned film, Afro Samurai. This sort of stylizing, for instance, leads Silver Lion (Byron Mann) to look like an Asian David Bowie who wears WWE title belt to define his dominance. The action is entertaining, visuals are captivating, and the hip-hop paired with kung fu creates a beautiful unique fusion. I was intoxicated as \"Shame on a N***a\" played during the opening scene, as sharp dressed, funky kung fu masters slaughtered one another so outrageously violently, only Tarantino could have molded it. However, all of this is not enough to distract from plain bad acting, and a cheesy plot that seemed to be less than secondary.\n\nThe majority of the film takes place in \"Jungle Village\", a believable feudal town where Blacksmith (RZA) earns a living forging weapons for the warring clans. Jungle Village is run by the recently corrupt Lion Clan. Gold Lion (Kuan Tai Chen), the leader, is betrayed and murdered by his previous allies, Silver Lion (Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Chung Lee). This transparent momentum sets off the consistently flimsy plot. Things get corny as prince charming faced X-Blade prepares to avenge his father's death, leaving his lover behind after receiving matching tattoos over their hearts. Gold Lion begins his quest to acquire gold and crush other clans, with the help of Brass Body, played by former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista who clearly learned how to act in the ring.\n\nIn the midst of a gruesome struggle against the Lions and Brass Body, we learn of Blacksmiths origins as a slave on a plantation in what is assumed to be the Southern United States. He escapes on a ship which sinks, washing him ashore to be found and adopted by monks who teach him about chi and controlling his energy. Jungle Village, in addition to gang wars, is home to the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madame Blossom (Lucy Liu) who houses Jackknife (Russell Crowe), a character who looks like hr got lost on his way to the set of Wild Wild West. Undoubtedly, Crowe delivers the best performance, and the presence of the Blossom adds sex to the violence. It is often unclear where Madame Blossom's alliances lie, but eventually she and her girls, help to destroy Gold Lion and Brass Body. In the end, only Blacksmith possesses the skills to defeat Brass Body, and his knowledge of the long-lost tiger style, with his iron fists.\n\nThe clash between clans and the contrast of east and west made for engrossing visuals. The unique weapons added an edge to the fight scenes, as did the knowledge that the Blacksmiths powers stemmed from strength of mind, rooted in Buddhism. The soundtrack was powerful and well crafted, except for when Wiz Khalifa's \"I Go Hard\" played and greatly detracted from the drama and tension that should have been present. Why use Wiz Khalifa when you have RZA? This represents everything that was wrong with the movie: the allowance of cheesy, bad acting when they had other, competent actors that could have replaced the bad, the use of fluffy, unimportant plot points when there could have been more kung fu. With the combination of RZA's knowledge, and the star-studded cast, it should have been better."

Since most movies hire the best actor for the leading role, I was scratching my head, trying to figure out who I was supposed to cheer and who I was supposed to boo until about half way through the film when it became clear who the \"Man With the Iron Fists\" was going to be. Also, I seemed to be watching an Asian style martial arts film, so the American Hip Hop music was a bit discordant. The English sound track seemed a lot like a bad dub---all except Russel Crowe who did an admirable impersonation of Richard Burton. And then there was the problem with the women. As in all of them, except two, were prostitutes. Not at all what you expect from an Asian martial arts film. The numerous plot holes did not help. If you try to make sense of the story, you completely miss all the awesome special effects, like eyeballs popping from their heads and bodies splitting in half.\n\nBy the end of the first viewing, I was ready to give it a 3, maybe a 4 if I was feeling generous.\n\nBut certain scenes stuck in my mind, so I decided to give it a second try. This time, I armed myself with sake and tequila. And I enjoyed this film a lot. Especially the eyeballs flying out of people's heads and the bodies splitting in half.\n\nI predict that this is one of those films that will get panned upon release and then become a cult movie later on, since cult movies generally improve upon subsequent viewings."

However, the elements are there that could have made it a really good film. It was too bad that the project was not handled by better hands. The direction and writing by RZA (his first time, I believe) seemed too haphazard. He seems to be more concerned with pulling off one graphic violent scene after the other, rather than effectively telling a cohesive story. To his credit, his camera angles were all very imaginative though.\n\nIt is not as bad as reviews would have you think. It is an ultra- violent martial arts extravaganza as RZA's hero Quentin Tarantino would have done it. This was obviously inspired by the audacity of Tarantino's \"Kill Bill\" but not done with the latter film's focused storytelling technique. Be ready to see body parts being chopped off, bellies being gutted, blood gushing out like fountains, the works! This was not rated R-18 for nothing. If that type of gory violence makes your stomach churn, then do not watch this."

BUT! Then you have a movie that had EVERYTHING in the world to be perfect just throwing it all away to the garbage\n\nRussell Crowe and Lucy Liu carried this movie on their shoulders really well, but even that is not enough to save this terrible, boring attempt to tell a story. I really think that 1.- Not only the main actor, but also the main character, should of been replaced. There was no point in having RZA's character if you were going for a conventional semi-standard movie. Go big or go home. I don't even know who to blame, the director, the editor, the execs? the trailer editor who made me believe this was gonna be an entertaining movie. 2.- I was bored... It was kind of worth it for the amazing Lucy Liu and her whor...s sequence, BUT this didn't save the movie, nor Russel Crowe (who was amazing in every frame he was), nor the interesting Gemini brothers, nor the OK villains, no nothing, I don't know how the 4 hour version was maybe it would of made sense. The fighting sequences in general were good, the deaths were good, but the moment the fights stopped it was boring.\n\nJust heads up to the people who were mislead by the trailer and though this was gonna be a massive tournament or showdown between 7 clans to the death... it is not."

It was mostly because it seemed absolutely ridiculous, but in the way I'd totally love this film. I was right.\n\nFirst of all, the story is way more interesting than what it might sound in any summary. It was intriguing, just like all the actually Chinese kung-fu films I've seen. They are a weird mixture of violent action and some sort of low-key fantasy. The plot structure is interesting, because at first it introduces a several characters, whose stories intertwine with each other and the main plot. That doesn't work unless the characters are as interesting as they are in The Man With The Iron Fists. Of course the story isn't the greatest one out there, but it's surprisingly good. It's better than I expected, but it's very typical for an action film, apart from few details. But then again, almost every movie plot has those few details to make it different from the mass, but what is now very typical for the mass.\n\nIf I could choose one thing I love the most about this film, it would absolutely be the soundtrack. There's no reason for hip hop to work in a kung-fu film, but it did, and I was in love since the opening credits because of the weird contrast between the picture and the sound.\n\nAnd now that I'm talking about picture, wow. Visually this film was astonishing, and I don't just mean the cinematography in general. This film definitely had some astonishing shots, but mostly I love the choreography of the fight scenes. Now I read that someone said that the fight scenes were too ridiculous, now absolutely there was some dark humour mixed in there, but it made them even more fun to watch. And during several fight scenes I just was astounded by how clever some of the fighting techniques were.\n\nThe Man With The Iron Fists is absolutely worth seeing, even if it won't become your favourite film. It's worth seeing even if you might not like it. The thing is, it's violent and it's definitely very marginal, but it has a weird combinations you'd never expect from a movie like this."

Probably most unfortunately, it falls right in the middle of that and, in the end, is mostly just forgettable. There's a lot of crazy and cool stuff to see, although there have been plenty of actual kung fu movies that were far crazier. The biggest problem with the film is they just don't let you see anything for very long. It feels like it was edited by a cokehead monkey with some serious ADHD. There's barely a shot in the film that lasts more than a second. Therefore, the action is hard to follow. It seems like the set pieces were well set up, but you just really can't tell what the Hell is going on. That's really what destroys it. The script and performances aren't that good, sure, but you don't expect that in a martial arts movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino's name is attached to this movie and the beginning you think you know why: there is a little hell hole of a town that is going to become the scene of a showdown between all sorts of powerful and weird characters. However, in reality Tarantino has nothing to do with the film other than friendship with RZA, the American rapper who wrote and directed the movie and also starred as the lead character.\n\nThe idea is that RZA is a lover of kung-fu by wire, melancholist of the past era of martial glory. But there is a reason why that era has past. Even more so, the old Chinese films, no matter how cheesy, had some sort of weird plot that made it all matter, either in depth or in sheer ridiculousness. This film doesn't have that, instead a linear and boring story of just about everyone imaginable fighting and double crossing each other for no good reason.\n\nIt's always nice to see Lucy Liu, Russell Crowe must have participated for fun alone and Bautista is a monster of a man. Compared to giants of beauty, skill and brawn, RZA appears as a pale and useless character. He is the \"technician\" of the bunch, but not even there can we find some shred of innovation.\n\nBottom line: great visuals, huge budget, some good acting from some of the actors, but a weak story and a bland lead character. In the end it just shows us that the old Chinese martial arts movies that we loved as children were not great because of their budget, but also because of something that misses from this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS is a '70s-era, grindhouse-style kung fu movie made by American actors and producers with an extreme case of nostalgia. It's an entirely odd film that never really gels or sits comfortably with itself; imagine it, if you like, as a pure and unashamedly camp B-movie which just so happens to feature some A-list talent (most noticeably Russell Crowe as one of the main actors).\n\nThe main problem with this movie is RZA, a hip hop star who fancies himself as the film's writer, director and lead actor. Unfortunately, he's hopeless in all three of those roles. His direction is probably the best of his three skills, purely because it's so simplistic, a case of pointing the camera in the right direction and shooting; difficult to go wrong really, especially when your movie is so fast-paced. His writing, though, is horrible, basically throwing various opposing gangs and characters into one location (Jungle Village, which sounds very Chinese, of course) and having them fight each other for the whole of the running time. As an actor, he's appallingly wooden, and casting himself in the lead role smacks of conceit.\n\nAs a result, what you have is a film that's only worth watching for the action; at least it's plentiful. Unfortunately, despite the presence of martial arts choreography Cory Yuen, it's hardly brilliant, although passable in places; the plentiful CGI bloodshed is a little wearying in places, though. The fights are fast-paced and typically involve wicked-looking knives being used to eviscerate enemies, along with broken bones and other grisly methods of death. None of it is realistic in the slightest, it's all over the top and mildly entertaining.\n\nThe casting is a mixed bag. Crowe is an actor who I feel antipathy towards in some of his blockbuster movies, but his acting is naturally the best in the movie. Lucy Liu plays exactly the kind of one-note character we saw in KILL BILL: VOLUME 1, and Rick Yune is the usual bland, go-to Asian-looking guy of many a B-movie. The actors familiar from genuine Chinese cinema, like Cung Le (BODYGUARDS & ASSASSINS) and Daniel Wu (NEW POLICE STORY) are better, particularly the latter's cameo as an aged kung fu master. While it's true THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS occasionally brings back the demented spirit of the films it seeks to pay homage to, the hip-hop influence is off-putting and it's only worth the one watch unlike some of the classics of old."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hip-Hop and Martial Arts, two of my favourite things, come together in The Man With Iron Fists, directed by RZA of rap group Wu-Tang Clan, a group that make no secret of their love for the old Kung Fu classics in nearly every track they make, and as a bonus the film is also ''presented'' by Quentin Tarantino, so surely this has to be good right? Wrong. The main negative being that this film is unsure whether it's trying to be a serious Martial Arts film or a cheesy homage to old 1970's films like Enter the Dragon or Drunken Master, and what we get is something that lies in the middle: a plot not good enough to be taken seriously and a film not funny or outrageous enough to work as a homage to past films (like Kill Bill done to perfection).\n\nThe story is the usual ''band of villagers unite to take on outside force of bad guys'', and this time our 19th Century villagers consist of a freed slave who finds himself in China working as Blacksmith (played by RZA), an English soldier (Russell Crowe) and a brothel owner (Lucy Liu). The plot is the central weakness of the film; there are nice fight scenes splattered with beautiful gore throughout the film, and there are moments where the cinema was laughing out loud, but overall, the film just feels flat, not helped by the simple fact that we know what's going to happen as it's been done a million times before. Stories like this only work when the script is full of intelligent and captivating dialogue or memorable characters, but sadly both Crowe and Liu fail to impress in their slightly minimal and withdrawn roles, whilst RZA shows literally no emotion in his role, he just seems like a civilian who got lost on a film set. Ironically the script lacks the sort of creativity a Tarantino film would have and the film just ends up seeming empty.\n\nBonus points for WWE fans like myself, as legend Dave Batista pops up as a villain who can turn into steel! Also the fight scenes with their creative ways of brutality must be applauded for sheer originality and the soundtrack is immense as expected coming from Wu-Tang alumni, but ultimately, a film that failed to live up to expectations.\n\n6/10"

Not even the endorsement by QT (also known as Quentin Tarantino) makes this better. And yes it is only an endorsement! I say this because quite a lot of people actually thought it was by him.\n\nRZA is the real \"genius\" behind this. But while he has bewitched (if that is the right word to use) a lot of people with his music in general and Wu Tang Clan in specific, his effort into movies must be a dream he had when he was still a teenager. The movie/story betrays that! But that doesn't change the fact that a lot of actors have fun making this. Especially Russel Crowe. But RZA did not only misjudge the story, he also made a bad call casting himself in the lead role ... Man with the Iron face is more likely. Because his \"perfomance\" gives any Steven Seagal (role) a run for his money, when it comes to least expression ..."

And some are not only bad at comedy, but bad overall, like RZA or Bautista. Plus the soundtrack is - OK, it's not as grating as Ladyhawke's but they're playing in the same league.

        "review_detailed_main": "I was fooled by the \"Quentin Tarantino\" mention, serves me right. The only way to watch this movie is to consider it a parody of Kung Fu movies. The storytelling, script, acting are all painful. Lucy Liu is one of the few to be credible, but then she played the same role in Kill Bill so she had more experience. The main actor RZA is supposed to show an array of emotions, all I could see was a blank face all along. The dialogs do not make sense, and it is almost a pursuit to a killer one liner...which fails to deliver. There are a few modern buildings visible in the background and all main characters, who are supposed to play bandits in a small village in ancient times, benefit from a bright smile, guess bleached teeth/veneers were already fashionable at the time. Do not bother watching if you enjoy martial arts movies, or have any respect for Chinese culture."

These flaws are namesakes of old kung-fu movies. Take out these flaws and all you would have is a generic action flick. This movie screams classic kung- fu from start to finish RZA did a great job in presenting a great classic genre.\n\nThe movie is not without its flaws though. Although there is a great cast in the movie, may of the actor's performances do not meet what you would expect from them. The field of view at times feels to small, especially during action sequences."

Maybe in foreigners' eyes, every Chinese looks like same, but in our eyes, only some people can act KongFu movie.Actors' hair style are worse than actors\u3002I want to know what's the name of Mc Jin's hair cut,a huge d i c k? How can I call it is a KongFu movie. 90's HongKong Kongfu movies are better thousands of time than that. Also, KongFu not means muscle, in many Chinese KongFu movie , actors are not muscle man. They are thine but strong enough. In Chinese idea, big muscle man does not stand for wisdom. On the Contrary, big stands for stupid. This movie did show out American Style, but, this movie does not relate any Chinese culture."

I don't usually write reviews, but when I do (I'm the world's most interesting man apparently) it's to praise an underdog, or to criticize an over-hyped movie.\n\nAny person that has watched vintage kung fu movies knows for a fact that it is extremely difficult to come up with a plot that is coherent or remotely credible. In what world do men need to fight on a constant basis? none. But RZA manages to create a story that manages to put several opponents against each other, which I thought was incredibly smart. There are other martial arts movies out there with smart plots (Hero, Ip Man, etc.), but let's face it, it's not the easiest plot to write.\n\nIt brings back vintage kung fu with it's classic visuals. Little CGI and no green screen (at least it was imperceptible to me). The choreography could have been better (2012's The Raid was particularly impressive) but it was still cool to see some very particular techniques - like X-blade's, the gemini's, and Lucy Liu's fighting styles.\n\nThe costume design was very good. A lot of Kung Fu movies nowadays have tried to avoid loud costumes, to avoid the whole Power Ranger's look, but I thought the costumes in this movie were awesome.\n\nA lot of overacting - as it should be - just like vintage kung fu movies.\n\nThe Soundtrack is awesome - but I would have enjoyed it more if it had more Rap.\n\nKudos to RZA on his debut movie. Hope he filters out some mistakes and squeezes out some more movies."

I actually came away feeling annoyed. Annoyed that junk like this can even get funding. Imagine how many great scripts there are out there which can't get funding; how many great directors there are who can't get hired; how many great actors there are waiting for a break...and then this gets made! RZA cannot write screenplays. RZA definitely can't direct films. Bautista cannot act. Why can't these people stick to what they do best? Music in RZA's case and Bautista? Dave old son, do anything but please stay away from acting. As for Russell Crowe? Well he should be ashamed or at least embarrassed, especially with lines like \"My name is Mr. Knife! But you can call me Jack!\" Don't get me wrong - I understand this is supposed to be tongue in cheek but even tongue in cheek has to be witty and clever - this is neither. I can switch my brain off and quite happily enjoy an action film or comedy so long as it's done with a modicum of talent. In this case I should have pulled out my brain and thrown it out the nearest window. The absolute nadir of cinema."

An Afro American as a lead role in an 18th century Kung Fu movie? (results could have been different, if they had a good actor with good Kung Fu skills) David Bautista (from WWF) doing a Tiger Style ? Why does he even needs to do Kung Fu, if he always turns himself into metal while fighting? The lead Cantonese actors seems like they have just stepped out of world famous Hair Stylist's Parlor.\n\n2. Lead Hero \u2013 RZA !!! Even Enrique Iglesias is a better actor than him. RZA sucks !! He looks so sucky. Feels like some devil has sucked the hell out of him.\n\n3. Very disappointing to know that RZA is an avid follower of Q. Tarantino. Till date, only Robert Rodriguez has done justice to Tarantino.\n\n4. Russel Crowe !!! Apart from pussy licking, fingering and butt tapping, he has nothing in this movie to work on. Wondering how he signed this project.\n\n5. This movie is unimaginably unimaginable."

Russell Crowe's performance is a far cry from Gladiator, but not as bad as it could have been. Lucy Lui has always been pretty hit and miss with me, and I found her performance the weakest of the seasoned actors in the film. I was excited to see Cung Le and Dave Bautista, being a big fight fan, but wasn't expecting much from them. They were relegated to side characters and had very little dialog, which kept the movie running smoothly. As far as RZA, I was surprised. His acting is far from wooden and stiff, and you can tell he has a love of the far east. His narration was a bit dry, but his delivery as a main character and fighter was passable. All in all, the movie is great for kung-fu fans, hardcore QT fans, and people who don't want to complain about every movie they see. Seriously, it's called catharsis! 7/10! Good watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "I gave this movie an 8. Simply put, it is a throwback to how kung fu flicks use to be. I prefer the old ones over the new ones. The old ones are more authentic, the new ones, not so much, excluding the legend of yip man movies, which I'll guarantee most people who watched this film and downgraded it, never even heard of the movie or the man for that matter. People knocked the violence of this movie and deemed it, \"unnecessary\". While I would agree with that part at certain junctures in this movie, it is no more violent then Kill Bill 1 or 2, and looked at the rating on those films. So that's just a cop out by many pointing a finger at that.\n\nMatter fact, look at \"Five Deadly Venoms\", which is a classic and arguably the best kung fu film ever made. Has a rating of \"7\", on IMDb. Now, look at Kill bill 1 and 2. BOTH films are rating higher than Five Deadly Venoms! This makes the average Asian person laugh they *** off, and any westerner or happens to know the nature and the culture of martial art films.\n\nBottom line, when it comes to martial art films, Americans don't know s***. The Asian and Eastern world knows it. Some of us here know it. Americans actually believe Van Dame films qualifies them on the subject. So as such, we like American martial art films that are about as authentic to martial arts as French bread is to French cuisine. For everyone knocking the RZA's acting in the movie. As an Action or Martial Arts film, the lead NEVER has been or needs to be a superb actor! Van Dame Sucks! And people love his movies at one time. Bruce Lee is the greatest innovator to martial arts as far as progression and bringing it to main stream audience, but he would not win an Oscar for his acting. These types of films do not call for strong acting, but for strong dialogue and fighting sequences. Just like old Arnold and Sylvester films. Great action actors, not great Actors by any stretch.\n\nSo to sum it up, you're opinion is your opinion, but I'll let you know you don't know what the hell you're talking about."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Man with the Iron Fists is a terrible film, and also a blast to watch. This transcends the \"good/bad\" duality of films that many viewers possess, and in my opinion is so enjoyable because of the many issues with the film. To start, I will lambaste the poor dialogue, wooden acting, and horrid script provided in this film. RZA, star, writer and director, is no Jackie Chan, that is for sure. These issues are a detriment to the quality of the film, and many viewers may be rightfully turned off by the poor quality in the above categories.\n\nI, however, love me a bad movie, and this one fits the bill quite well. As a fan of martial arts films from all eras, this film really captured the sleazy, low quality budget of many kung-fu films from the 70/80's. It seems RZA was emulating this style, and it works well in this case. The blood spurts, and over the top schlock here - with heads and arms lopped off, bronze fighters exploding, and so forth, make for quite the ride of hilarity and ridiculousness that kept me completely engaged. The wooden acting and horrid dialogue add a level of hilarity here that only, in my mind, keeps the engagement going. Its fun to laugh at things sometimes. The action here is of mediocre quality from a Wuxia perspective, with some good stuff, some bad stuff, and some fun stuff.\n\nOn the negative side, there are certainly issues here with the script ad direction that make for some moments of absurdity and boredom that are not fun. The pointless and oddly shot T and A portions of this film, with Russell Crowe basically having a horridly shot orgy with some prostitutes, is pointless, kind of gross to watch, and not fun.\n\nThis film gets a 6/10 for me. In my mind, this is because it achieves a level of enjoyment from many of its campy and absurd moments. The poor script, acting and direction from its main star borders on hilarity, while the campy schlock of the rest of the films makes for an enjoyable, cult-film like experience. I enjoyed this film, and would recommend it for fans of martial arts films, and those who enjoy a good bad movie."

Warrior Zen Yi (Rick Yune) hears of the death of his father, and travels to avenge this and re-claim the gold. But then the gang responsible are themselves ambushed by a gang, lead by Silver Lion (Byron Mann), who kill them and steal the gold for themselves. Arriving in town, Zen Yi joins forces with Jack Knife (Russell Crowe), a lone wolf cowboy who plays by his own rules, and the Blacksmith (RZA) an escaped slave who makes a living forging blades for the rival gangs and who's in love with a local prostitute who works at a brothel run by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu), who has her own plans to gain power.\n\nFormerly far more of a support actor than a leading man, rapper turned actor RZA takes the leading role and makes his acting debut with this flashy, hyper-kinetic martial arts action fable, presented by Quentin Tarantino, and timely with the current resurgence of period kung fu flicks, probably generated by that man. An all star cast put themselves through the motions, in a tale filled with glitzy martial arts sequences infused with a funky hip hop soundtrack. It's undoubtedly all style over substance, and the plot is a jumbled, slightly over complicated mess that tries to be more than it is, but the action (what it's all about) delivers, and will please the hard core fans that have come to see it.\n\nAs I said, an all star cast are on display, the most high profile of which would be Crowe, whose inexplicable appearance can be explained by an apparent friendship that sprang up between him and RZA on the set of American Gangster (which just goes to show there must be loyalty in Hollywood), but all the same he delivers a spirited, campy performance that chews up all the charisma, while the likes of Liu, Mann and up and coming star Yune fit the material well. This wasn't the sort of stuff that was meant to win any Best Actor awards, so all the gusto that is put in should be appreciated, and, while it's short comings don't go un- noticed, it delivers where it's supposed to. ***"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was excited to see this movie because the trailer did everything right, and the fact that Tarantino was in on it sold me. But that's the problem, The problem is that the movie was completely blown out of the water by 'Django Unchained' which came out 2 months later.\n\nThe film is a cross between an old Western and a Kung-Fu movie, which if you ask me, is a match made in heaven. And that definitely bumps up the score to a 3, and the characters are interesting and well introduced. One character, the Jack of Knives, is probably my favorite, he's the rugged cowboy who doesn't want trouble. The other main character, the Blacksmith, is the former slave who moved to China to lead a better life. Which is also another issue, You'd think that when they wrote the screenplay and listed the blacksmith as a former slave, Tarantino would warned them that the film would be compared to 'Django'. But no, they let it slide.\n\nThe story is really good, and that says a lot for a fighting film. The story is that after the head of a major fighting clan, the Lions, is assassinated, the next in line to take over begins coordinating a plan to rob the governor of his gold. While the premise is generic, it also helps the film. I haven't seen a fighting movie that wasn't entirely focusing on comedy in a long time. It's up there on the generic (but good) fighting film list right next to the first Mortal Kombat.\n\nThe biggest issue, is the pace of the story. The story, moves too fast, one moment they'd be talking about stealing the gold, the next moment, they're talking about the women in the brothel. Or they'll be in the middle of a fight, and at the same time talking about something important that is inaudible over the sounds of the fighting.\n\nThe issue to parallel the last one, is the character development. The Jack of Knives is interesting, but towards the end of the movie he starts to jump all over the place with his real objective. They gave every other character a good ten minutes to explain their story, but no Jack. Another, is Lucy Liu's character, I know they gave her a name, but other than the few good sexual innuendos they used with her character, she was completely boring, so boring that they might have well just not given her a name.\n\nThe final verdict for this film is, it's bad, very bad, but not so bad that it doesn't deserve to be seen. I know that the film was originally 4 hours long, and then they shortened it to an hour and a half, I think that's where the problems of this film come from, it's too short to live up to the expectations the trailer put on it. So once again, It's bad, but it's bad enough to be good in it's own way."

        "review_detailed_main": "Set in Jungle Village in Imperial China, the village is a place of constant strife with several clans vying for control over the area. As a shipment of imperial gold is schedule to come through the village, a mysterious Blacksmith (RZA), Zen-Yi (Rick Yune) a man seeking to avenge his father's murder, and Englishman Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) cross paths with several parties seeking possession of the gold.\n\nThe Man with the Iron Fists was a passion project for RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan who upon producing the soundtrack for Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill studied Tarantino's direction. RZA met with Eli Roth and the two discussed RZA's idea for making a martial arts film which Roth was intrigued by and the two spent around 2 years refining the idea in between other projects. After several drafts and RZA producing a pitch film at his own expense, the duo acquired the support necessary from Universal and Strike with a budget estimated between $15-20 million. According to RZA, the initial cut of the film was four hours long with RZA considering splitting the film into two films but Roth vetoes this idea and the film was scaled back to 96 minutes with RZA the editing process but saying he would release an extended cut. Upon release the film received mix reviews who praised the performances and fight scenes but felt the film itself was slightly messy. The film opened in fourth place behind newcomers Flight and Wreck-It Ralph and only made about $20 million at the box office making it a minor disappointment, but it did do better on Home Video. There's a lot to like in The Man with the Iron Fists. Even if the titular man is probably the least interesting part of the movie.\n\nTo start off, RZA has spared no expense when it comes to bringing the energy and excitement you expect from this kind of martial arts mash-up. Jungle Village is a well realized place with tons of details and colors that really pop and the film does a solid job of mixing the tropes of kung-fu, spaghetti westerns, and blaxsploitation to create a really fun experience. The movie features some fun characters who are unique and memorable such as Lucy Liu's beautiful but deadly bordello owner Madame Blossom, Russell Crowe's lecherous bad-ass Jack Knife, Rick Yune in an against type performance as Zen-Yi, and Dave Baustista as hulking unstoppable brute Brass Body. There's a lot of fun details in this movie that fully embrace the goofiness of the genre with the spectacle with the various \"powers\" exhibited by the characters reminiscent of the kind of over the top violent fun of Fist of the North Star or Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky. The only downside I'd say is that the titular Man with the Iron Fist played by RZA feels like the least engaging part of the movie. Make no mistake, I think RZA is good in the movie, but because of the way the film is edited it feels like he's a bit of an extraneous element in the story as the main emotional crux comes from Zen-Yi avenging his father and as a result RZA feels like he's been positioned as something of a \"forced lead\" when the film should be more of an ensemble piece centered around Zen-Yi. This is based on the extended cut Universal released to home video, and while it's undeniably the best way to experience the movie it does feel like a lot has been crammed into something to small to contain it.\n\nThe Man with the Iron Fists can't be faulted for its passion, energy, or drive, but there is the sense the film feels like it's been a bit too truncated and is asking for more wiggle room. I still enjoy the movie and recommend it to martial arts film, but it's very much a diamond in the rough."

Upon the first watch, I find this movie to be a total waste of talent and money when we got a diverse cast from both from East to West with colorful costume and set to be one hell of a bloody feast but because the script and acting suck major ass this movie left me speechless with disappointment aside from some cool scenes and nods to old school Shaw Bros flicks . When I rewatch it yesterday the movie does get a bit better when I shut down my judgmental brain fully embrace this movie for what is it: \"A TRY TOO HARD TO BE ASIAN MOVIE FROM THE WEST\". RZA got my respect for how much of a fanboy he is to what he loves and that passion he brings to this movie is undeniable but it still not enough to save this movie. If you guys really want to see The Man with the Iron Fists done right then I highly recommend the martial art tv-series \"Into the Badlands\" starring Daniel Wu and a production team that actually give a damn about what they are doing."

His \"acting\" was painful to watch. His character provided part of the voice-over narrative; but made it sound straight out of Compton. Also, the soundtrack was exceptionally ridiculous for what was supposed to be a period piece. The dialog - too much awful there to put to words. Russel Crowe must have owed somebody big-time to agree to do this tripe. In addition to being terribly miscast, he seemed embarrassed to be there. Lucy Lui, as always, was a welcome addition to an otherwise hopeless and hapless endeavor."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can only imagine that when Rza was a youngster he played at kung fu and he likely imagined himself emerging victoriously from great battles. This film written and directed by Wu Tang Clan member Rza pretty much has everything that I remember growing up watching the films that The Man With The Iron Fists pays homage to. There were flying and acrobatic fight scenes, there was a tragic ill-fated couple, the Genesis', and a gruesomely high body count characterized by severed limbs and even a gutting, by none other than Russell Crowe as Jack Knife. I couldn't really tell if the scenes that made me laugh out loud were supposed to be funny or if they just turned out that way, especially as the movie progressed and it seemed that it was actually taking itself very seriously. I however could not take it too seriously given that it was supposed to be somewhere in China called Jungle City and the only Chinese speaking character was Lady Blossom (Lucy Liu), not only did all the key Asian characters speak English, the accents were distinctly American. There was this huge missing piece called authenticity. And it seemed very tongue in cheek every time our title character was called Black Smith, he was a blacksmith by trade but seriously it just didn't seem that they were discussing his vocation. I was glad that we were given the back story of Thadeus Smith (Rza) so that we knew how he came to be in China, because for most of the film he seemed out of place and then it made sense why he was there. There were warring clans all around trying to get their hands on the Emperor's gold all with hip hop tracks and a Bluesy tune as the back drop for some very gory fight scenes, this contributed to the lack of authenticity because the story and the scoring was very contemporary. The Quentin Tarentino influence was quite obvious since blood is expelled from the wounded clansmen much like a very powerful sprinkler system. In the middle of all the murder and mayhem surrounding the claims to the gold is a beautifully pink whorehouse, where so much of the action seems to culminate, no pun intended. The final great battle happens and Madam Blossom is in the thick of it wearing white and never a drop of blood blemishes her outfit. Really? I give this film an amber light for making me laugh, otherwise it might have been blood red."

It was just laughable until you realize the entire movie is just like watching a beginner film student wasting good time with a stupid script, childish language, and horrible acting. Even the costumes and hair looked like a porn movie or cheap music video. And the Asian actors talk like they all grew up in Orange County and had never acting in anything but a music video. Just terrible! And the idea of a blacksmith that has a Voice Over like Shaft with the rap music does not work at all.... maybe it could have been possible if Tarantino or a solid director with a better script and dialogue.. but this was low quality and poor judgement. Surely they will make their money since i saw it only cost like 15m but i don't know where the budget went because it was not on any good actors except Crowe and Liu who had small parts.\n\nI gave it a 1 since there is nothing lower... and don't understand how it got a 6 on here.

The rap music seems out of place and most of the songs are terrible. I do like rap, but this RZA guy has no talent. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is seriously some of the worst rapping I've ever heard. The only rapping I can think of that sounds similar is J-Roc's freestyling (from the Trailer Park Boys). Did Tarantino have a lobotomy that I'm unaware of and become a full fledged retard? This whole thing is so pathetic that it seems like RZA must have had a hand in it because the movie is about as bad as his rapping. I like martial arts movies and I've seen a lot of martial arts movies. So trust me... if you haven't seen this spare your eyes and ears and just watch something else."

Everyone seemed to have their own tail that came together in one big climax at the end.\n\nMy only real complaint is far too much use of wire floating fights.

There is something to be said about minutes of people showing off their choreography talent in minutes of fighting then quick floating, camera shifting, and other such nonsense that modern cinema tends to be plagued with.\n\nHowever, I felt the tale was pretty good and deserves praise for anyone who is a fan of the Kung-fu genre and enjoys good hip-hop."

I had hoped that Tarantino could have helped save this picture, from itself, but unfortuantly no. RZA needs to understand, that just because you can pay the bills and are famous, does not make you an actor, director, writer or anything of the sort. This shows that making movies, takes experience and skill, and to be a good actor, training is mandatory. One can't help but thinking that RZA was surrounded by yes-men and the wrong friends telling him, that no matter what, it would be a great idea to do this.\n\nNow for the picture itself, there's many other rewievs here, so don't want to spend too much time.

It seems like this year I have watched far too many terrible movies, and am in desperate need for the first breakout movie of the year. RZA directs this kung fu action/comedy film which fails at many levels. First of all it has too many characters crammed into one film. RZA intended this movie to be over four hours long and divide it into two parts, but instead of that they edited everything and made it into one 100 minute movie. That really hurt the pacing of the film which moves at a ridiculous pace and seems to hurry everything. The film doesn't works as either an action film or a satire because in the first place the action scenes are quite terrible and in the second it is far from being funny. The script also lacks some clever lines and a better story, while the acting in this film is terrible. I know that in some way this film tries to pay homage to the 70's Shaw Kung fu films, but it still was messy, and the spoofs really didn't work. This is one of those movies I really don't want to spend too much time talking about because I feel it was a complete waste of time. The film may be presented by Quentin Tarantino (because he is friends with RZA and has had his music on many of his own screenplays), but it is far from his work. RZA could have used some help from Tarantino because this is another proof that making violent films isn't an easy thing.\n\nThe film begins by introducing several different characters which are all linked to Jungle Village. A blacksmith (RZA) narrates the action as he tells us what is going on. The leader of the Lion's clan, Gold Lion (Kuan Tai Chen), has been brutally murdered by Silver Lion (Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Cung Le) after they hear that the Governor's gold is going to pass through their village. Gold Lion was assigned the task of protecting the gold while it was being transported, and now that he has been betrayed, Silver and Bronze Lion prepare an army to steal the gold. In the meantime, Gold Lion's son, Zen Yi (Rick Yune) decides to avenge his father's death and attack those responsible. Zen Yi is defeated however by Brass Body (Dave Bautista), who works for the Lion's clan, but before he's killed, the blacksmith manages to save him and escape. Silver and Bronze Lion manage to steal the governor's gold and hide it in Madam Blossom's (Lucy Liu) brothel. Jack Knife (Russell Crowe), an emissary of the Emperor, happens to be staying at the brothel when all this occurs. While these events are taking place, the blacksmith is caught by Brass Body and has his arms severed. Jack Knife decides to help the blacksmith and makes iron arms for him. They join forces along with Zen Yi and together they face the Lion clan in a blood bath.\n\nAs you can tell there are a lot of different things going on at the same time and way too many characters for a short film like this. Everything just seemed so disconnected that it never even worked as a spoof. I really didn't care much for any of the characters either, and to say that there is no character development whatsoever is an understatement. I also had a lot of issues with the editing of the film with so many chops here and there. The action scenes never felt believable, and everything felt like a complete waste of time. This film may have had some interesting actors working here, but it is just terrible. Please skip this film.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

Free your mind, the movie is a story.\n\nGet a story simple enough not to be boring, add some fantasy elements, oriental scenery and 50% of the action style (oriental). Add western action style 50% ( more or less - depending on taste and each man vision). Colors are awesome to catch the view , music is great - every tune fits the events . Sprinkle over (like every 10 min. or so) bits of humor or life philosophy - real creative sparks that shine and prevent boredom. That's pretty much the recipe for this movie - a la Tarantino . If you go in expecting masterpiece storytelling you're in for a treat, treat for eyes. ears and mind at the same time. I think this movie is art and an enjoyable one, it's stylish ...\n\nI know people say Tarantino has nothing to do with it, maybe some recipes can be learned ... like from master to pupil. One other great movie (unerrated as well) comes to mind - Bunraku (2010) - if you like either one watch the second one too - same mixture but with different proportions.\n\nConclusion: The unrated version of the movie kept me focused every second - and I felt great satisfaction at the end - definitely worth my time and the money spent. 9 out of 10 where no movie reaches 10 :) ."

If this crap is to pay in anyway homage to the real Kung Fu movies it falls so short its not even funny.\n\nDon't go see it and don't buy it. You will surely find the DVD's in the trash behind the Walmart or Target for free then again i wouldn't even bother its SERIOUSLY BAD.

It's just so incredibly dumb. It makes sense that rap \"artist\" is behind this wreck, because the dialogue, the scenery, everything is so tacky and cringy and awful it hurts. Even something banal, like character hairstyles, makes you want to stop watching, it's so unconvincing a laughably bad. And even the fighting scenes, which are supposed to be the strongest point of this genre, are just horrible. The battle choreography is extremely lousy done and chaotic. Tacky colors don't help either. And above all that comes the sad llama face of the main protagonist, whose acting skills can be compared to those of a brick. I can't in all honesty believe that somebody actually read this script and said \"let's do this\". There is absolutely nothing good about it. I'm still in shock from what I've seen. I can't imagine bigger fail than making an homage to kung-fu classics in this day and age with all the technology and cinematography available and creating a movie which is undeniably worse than those flicks made with rope and stick 30 or 40 years ago. A fail of epic proportions. And they made a sequel. Unfathomable."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Chinese martial arts genre have undergone some attempts at making it sexy again, with Stephen Fung flying the flag in the east with his genre mash up given that steampunk flavour, and RZA in the west adopting a mash up with the Western and hip hop music added to the mix. And RZA aka Robert Fitzgerald Diggs made The Man with the Iron Fists his labour of love, working the story together with Eli Roth, putting himself in the lead role, and having directorial duties, all with the stamp of approval from Quentin Tarantino, bringing all the goodness of those Shaw Brothers classics now updated for the modern audience.\n\nDoes it work? Very much, for the martial arts film fan in me, this movie has it all, with RZA going to painstaking lengths and making it all inclusive, with probably more genre elements put into this movie than any I can remember in recent memory. The only key difference is the use of the English language amongst a smattering of Chinese and Cantonese, and violence - not that the Shaw Brothers Classics didn't have their fair share - that were amplified to stratospheric heights with blood baths following blood baths, and possibly every kind of bodily dismemberment you can imagine. On one hand, this continues the discourse whether screen violence, which is getting more explicitly graphic, is necessary, while on the other with its ultra-realism, made it seem a little bit cartoony as well.\n\nBut as mentioned, what made this film stand out, is that adherence to the rules of the game, and ingredients that had made this genre a success. There are femme fatales, secret and hidden weapons, booby traps and dungeons, formidable opponents, assassins, clans and more clans, animal motifs, sexy-sounding names, a brothel that's more than meets the eye, inns serving renowned cuisine, motivations of revenge, corrupt government officials, gold, escort services, lovers wanting to call it quits and retire into the sunset, betrayals from within, and not forgetting some good old Shaolin involvement. Not forgetting the martial arts themselves, featuring a whole variety from those which are metal-enhanced, naturally with a title like that, yin-yang combination courtesy of the Gemini-Twins, enhancements with wire work, and made all the more fluid with real life martial arts practitioners, all under the choreography of Corey Yuen.\n\nAnd RZA also wastes no effort in bringing together recognizable names from the East in roles big and small, such as Gordon Liu as a master monk, Cung Le as the number three in the Lions Clan, Daniel Wu as a supporting antagonist known as Poison Dagger, Chen Kuan Tai as Gold Lion under thick makeup, MC Jin and Leung Ka Yan. Other recognizable actors of Asian descent include Lucy Liu as Madam Blossom the brothel mistress, Jamie Chung as the main squeeze of RZA's The Blacksmith, Rick Yune as Zen Yi The X-Blade, the heir apparent of the Lions Clan, and the list goes on, with Westeners like Russell Crowe as Jack Knife, a man riding into town with a unique gun and rotating blade weapon, and others such as Pam Grier in a short tangent of a flashback, and Dave Bautista who plays Brass Body. In short, it is serious fun to see who pops up next, if you haven't already glanced through the cast list.\n\nNothing's too serious in this film, as narrated by RZA's Blacksmith, telling his tale about the time when the governor's gold has to pass through Jungle Village, and how many started to converge upon the village to set their sights on such treasure, while those minding their own business start to get drawn into the same series of events. Characters are split down the middle into good and evil, and fighting is just one other scene away. Given Western inputs, I'm not at all surprised by the level of sex and violence to obviously creep into the main narrative, with everything being too explicit rather than subtly suggested, but the hip-hop music worked with incredibly crafted visuals from the filmmakers.\n\nIf you, like me, are a fan of the genre, then perhaps you should make a beeline for this and witness how possibly everything get thrown into the story, and still coming up on top with its inventiveness and creativity at breathing some freshness into its version of an update. A definite recommend!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino made a rousing success when he captured the spirit of old 70s martial arts films in 2003's 'Kill Bill'. Rapper and first- time director RZA tries desperately to accomplish this feat in this ridiculously violent martial arts flick. Compared to Tarantino's effort s however, this one conclude come with less-than- stellar results. This film has the adrenaline and energy as well as the competent performances of a likable cast including Russel Crowe, Lucy Liu, RZA, and many other Asian actors. Everything else from the plot, to the pacing, to the characters, to RZA's direction, falls flat. If there is anything this movie greatly succeeds in, it is paying flashy homages to classic martial arts movies of the 60s and 70s, along with spewing more than enough stylized blood and gore gives Tarantino's movies a run for their money. But it seems that RZA's directing chops lead little to be desired in the end. Set i 19th century China, this film is set in a village where the residents are terrorized by the vicious Silver Lion (played by Byron Mann). When a British warrior Jack Knifeman (played by Russell Crowe) arrives on the scene, he teams up with teams of a blacksmith (played by RZA), a sexy swordswoman (played by Lucy Liu), and a group of warriors to fight against the evil Silver Lion and his minions including Bronze Lion (played by Cung Lee) and a man with golden brass body (played by Dave Batista).\n\nRZA exercises with a style that adds plenty of winks to Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' and other old Chinese hack-and-slash entries. It is over-the-top and it is not meant to be taken too seriously. If this style feels a bit reminiscent, that is because the man working beside RZA is producer Eli Roth, who is greatly known for soaking the screen with utter gruesomeness in parades of torture porn flicks. From beginning to end, this film parades on a near-constant series of excessively violent action sequences of character engaging almost tongue-in-cheek martial arts battles that wield plenty of bladed weapons, spears, and a profound amount of gruesome killings. But if these sequences are supposed to be fun, then why do they feel so numbing? Although the occasionally choppy editing is one factor to blame, this maybe because the director fails to execute with a competent story and characters we can come to care about. The premise revolving around the evil Silver Lion is interesting enough, but when the plot itself following this scene is not only thin as paper, but eventually ceases to make much sense and offers nothing more than a sluggish pacing and characters that are so one-dimensional it is hard to take interest in any of them. How many character must sustain throughout the picture without getting a proper background of who they are? If there is one remotely interesting figure here, it would be most certainly be Russell Crowe's character who is blessed with a heartful performance as well as enough grit to make him a character to root for the blood-soaked showdown in the final twenty minutes. The rest of cast is simply set with very little to nothing to work with, except perhaps Byron Mann as the tyrannical villain, but even his role feels utterly forgettable.\n\nThe Man with the Iron Fist is an ultra-violent martial arts extravaganza that is strongly capitalizes a graphic, bloody martial arts fights, but fails to succeed in just about every other area in terms of plot, character, and a solid direction. In simple words, this movie never quite takes off. If the martial arts action comes as an eye-feasting attraction, then that one redeeming aspect this film has going for it. Otherwise, it is simply an uninspiring mess."

However, I am disappointed in myself for waiting so long to see this entertaining movie.\n\nYou can not, I repeat CAN NOT go into this movie thinking it's going to be a Bruce Li classic. You can tell that this movie was made for pure bloody fun, a silly but original script with just the right amount of \"cheese\" in it, and most importantly, to entertain not only fans of the genre, but hopefully everyone with an open mind.\n\nIn my own opinion, this film got such bad reviews because some people went into this movie completely wrong. Based off the trailers, you should have known that this movie was not going to win an Oscar for best picture. This movie was made for it's over the top entertainment.\n\nNext time you watch this film, if ever again for some of you, open up your mind and laugh at the insane stunts and over the top fight scenes, the classic cheesy \"rothish\" one liners, and most importantly have fun with it. Mad props to RZA and everyone involved in this film.\n\n8 out of 10 for being a fun, underrated martial arts film that should have got a little more love."

There's this, the nasty yet lame Hostel movies, the awful From dusk till dawn sequel, and Hell ride which I haven't seen but looks far from good. Maybe he thinks producing crap movies makes him somehow cool because his idols did it in back the 70's. This though is maybe his best work as a producer thus far, which is very nearly a complement. Mr one draft Eli Roth helped out with the script, which is a bit like asking Hannibal Lecter to help out with the cooking, or maybe getting him to look after your baby for a few hours, as the movie more or less forces the audience not to care in the slightest about anything that happens. And it's one thing to incorporate (steal) clever or unique ideas from some movie that few have ever seen, or even know about, but it's quite another to take the crap elements (very poor writing, nonsensical plots, bad acting) and reuse them into a new movie, because that's just recycling old stale dog turds and making them into fresh soft new ones. I quite like RZA's soundtracks, but as an actor he's as charismatic as his big iron fists. While Mr Crowe is the best thing here by a mile, and he only agreed to be in this because he gets to romp around with pretty Asian women for most of his screen time. It's hard to think who this is for because adults will be bored by the lack of anything to latch onto and the sheer stupidity of it all, while the content is too violent for young children. A movie for idiots then, and very stupid easily pleased idiots at that."

Talented actors like Russel Crowe may fool you into thinking you're watching a real movie at certain points, but that won't last long. The story itself is clunky. The gore is pointlessly excessive. Oh, and did I mention RZA? His character serves no real purpose and could be left out of the story without it really changing much at all. His character does literally NOTHING until joining the climactic fight scene in the final 20 minutes. That's also the first time you see the \"iron fists\" in action. Maybe they should retitle this movie: \"The Man with One Expression Who Watches a Diverse Group of Fighters Kill Each Other for 2 Hours Before Killing Like Three Guys so He Can Have a Movie Named After Him\".\n\nNot sure how this one got made."

This film was loosely thrown together, has a script built on hackneyed clich\u00e9s, and contains so many antagonistic groups and individuals that it lacks any cohesion whatsoever. If one wishes to convey the feeling of remoteness in a foreign/Asian country one shouldn't have characters delivering lines in modern Bronx, Cockney, Estuary English, or whatever else. Just for laughs is alright, but this is becoming a trend, and I fear that the quality is going down and down. Most of the actors are worthy of far better things. The computer effects are impressive.

Honestly, I cut films a lot of slack, but this is nothing but references to films you'd rather watch than this.\n\nRZA plays a blacksmith (called smith) working in a village where the recently usurped Lions gang is planning on stealing gold from the empire. The son, X-blade, of recently murdered Gold Lion is on his way to get revenge on Silver Lion, and is up against the Lions, some assassin, and a guy who is made of bronze or something. Meanwhile, Lucy Lui is the head of a brothel where RZA's girlfriend work, also the temporary home of mysterious Russell \"I'm fat now\" Crowe. RZA gets involved when he saves X-blade from the blah blah blah I'm sick of describing this film.\n\nJam packed full of action sequences that'll have you thinking \"The House of Flying Daggers was good, wasn't it?\" and \"Remember those Baby Cart films? That's what I should have been watching instead of this\" and lush visuals that'll have you thinking \"Hero was better\" and \"Ninja Wars is great\", characters that'll have you saying \"Wasn't there a guy in the X-men with metal skin too?\" and scenes that'll have you saying \"RZA actually copied that mirror bit out of Enter the Dragon?\" and \"This splitscreen is terrible\".\n\nEven the script was awful (check out Russell Crowe's \"I'm Mr Knife\" bit and Lucy Lui's speech to the hookers at the end). This is a 'homage' film gone wrong. Even Kill Bill Vol 2 is better than this one, and that film wasn't any great shakes. Django Unchained is a film that lovingly pays homage to an old genre of film and still manages to be original and entertaining. The Man with the Iron Fists is nothing but stylish visuals, some gore and loads of people waving blades at each other, with very little actual martial arts.\n\nThe cover was right however: \"You Can't spell kung fu without an F and a U\" F U RZA \u2013 your film was crap.\n\n***Flies up into the air to hip hop music, produces large metal blade, spins round and jabs 'submit review' button with blade while suspended in air*** ***Receives loads of 'review not useful' hits from Wu Tang clan fans, all suspended in mid air, wielding blades, while spinning round***"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have occasionally enjoyed this wave of grindhouse pictures, like--\"Planet Terror\" and \"Hobo with a Shotgun.\" But a lot of them have been disappointments. I'm talking about the boring and overwritten \"Death Proof\" and the oh-so-irreverent \"Machete.\" \"The Man with the Iron Fists\"--Wu-Tang Clan member RZA's first shot behind the camera, is an exercise in visual and structural ineptitude. The RZA, starring alongside an obese Russell Crowe, in this rather poor grindhouse homage to old Kung Fu movies, narrates the simplistic story of a black blacksmith (RZA) who must protect his village from a deadly band of assassins. Not even a halfway decent final battle sequence, (if you can make it that far), can compensate the insurmountable problems that makes this so laborious to watch. Truthfully, I wanted to enjoy the movie for what it is--an over-top-bloody, action sequence extravaganza--but couldn't. The movie tries to maintain a edginess throughout---graphic fight scenes, blood spatter, etc. but falls short. Levels of debauchery that are simply unpleasant at times (including a disturbingly obese Russell Crowe ripping anal beads from out a prostitute in a bath tub) for example. The last half of the film takes place inside the brothel, and there is not a single shred of female nudity in the film. The film was entirely filmed in China, and whose original duration exceeded four hours. The RZA suggested dividing the work into two films, however, and not surprisingly, his proposal did not receive any support, thus forced to reduce its length to just over an hour and a half. Therefore, when you remove 145 minutes of a 240 minute film, the first thing that suffers is the story itself. What's left of the story is a mess and no real sense of direction. Characters are in and out of the story line so quickly, the audience doesn't have a chance to be clear on their motivations and alignments.The martial arts sequences consist of a saturation of close-ups , cables, and computer generated effects, that denies the viewer the chance to appreciate the exchange of martial techniques. Considering the background and motivations of the director--and his talented cast--such a waste of unused talent is incomprehensible. The RZA's directorial debut is not terrible--and yes that's a compliment. For a grindhouse homage it's rather boring at times-- and the scant 95-minute running time seems painfully long. Further evidence that supports the fact that grindhouse trailers are almost always more entertaining than the movies themselves."

        "review_title": "Tarantino, take the pen...and the camera while you're at it",
        "review_detailed_main": "One of The Man With the Iron Fists' only notable selling points is the fact that it revives the somewhat muted genre of martial-arts filmmaking and that it denotes Quentin Tarantino's \"involvement\" on the poster. And when I say \"involvement,\" let's just say that Tarantino's hasn't been confirmed a producer, writer, director, or actor in this film at all. It is known, however, that the film's director, RZA, is good friends and an old colleague with Tarantino, and it's likely that he was on set from time to time and possibly gave some directorial input to RZA. It's too bad that Tarantino couldn't have at least snagged the pen used to write The Man With the Iron Fists for a couple weeks and return it to RZA, who could then follow it as it shows.\n\nThe film's one good idea is used, I suppose, to the best of its abilities, and that is combining a 19th century setting with loud, boisterous gangster rap, primarily taken from RZA's former rap-group Wu Tang Clan. Yet when I'm citing the setting and music as the best things in a martial arts film, we have a little problem. Our story concerns a village blacksmith (RZA), who supplies weaponry for clans that reward him with money, who he anticipates to use to emancipate his wife (Jamie Chung) from prostitution and leave the Jungle Village. When the Lion Clan leader is betrayed by his own accomplices attempting to protect a heavy shipment of gold, all chaos ensues between surrounding gangs, and in walks Jack Knife (Russell Crowe), hired by the Emperor, to protect the gold and ensure the prostitution rate steadily function in this time of chaos. This forces the blacksmith to become trained in combat in order to fight off the gangs and win back his woman.\n\nDid you catch that? Neither did I. But the plot is the least of people's worries when it comes to martial arts films. Stylistically is where the film shines, but in terms of the action sequences, the choreography is choppy, uninspired, and hard to follow. Shots are cut so quickly and so rapidly that there is no sense of placement, making this a very awkward endeavor to sit through. Not helping is the persistent reminder that people like Quentin Tarantino have come along in recent years to present to us what a good homage should look like, and when we see something else, regardless of its merits, we think back to other films of similar style, craft, and purpose. I'm sure not one person who saw the Kill Bill films didn't think of it when watching The Man With the Iron Fists. There's also a rumor that says the original cut for this film was four hours long, which as impossibly impractical as that sounds, I could believe it. The film feels compressed and disjointed; too many underdeveloped characters, several relationships that go unexploited, and a lack of structure and direction are all prevalent, appearing that there was little method to the madness unfolding. Yet even at four hours, while it may have expanded on characters and relationships, this ninety-minute cut is already asking a bit too much out of the audience to stay seated during it.\n\nThere are films like Sin City, The Raid: Redemption, and the aforementioned Kill Bill that are homages on-top of attempting to be their own little thing. They work largely because of their precision and artistry incorporated by the auteurs that man the camera. RZA, while having possible potential as an actor, is too involved into this film, manning the camera, being one of the the co-writer, and one of the several funders for the project. He simply does too much, and because of that, this film feels like there's way too much input from one workaholic rather than a collection of thoughts and suggestions from others.\n\nThis is somebody's film, but not mine in particular. Martial arts films are a genre of film that can achieve admiration by me because of their distinct style and detail, but can simultaneously achieve tedium because of their inherently repetitive nature. I wasn't even a big fan of The Raid: Redemption, the acclaimed Norwegian film from last year. If anything, RZA has established himself as, at very least, a confident screen-presence and an intelligent composer of slick set-pieces. Yet the end result is tiresome, almost completely vacuous of a central idea or compelling moral, repetitively concocted, occasionally incoherent, and, above all, lacking in a focus. It provides us with so many characters and relationships that channel one another that we, again, simply want Tarantino to spring from the set to provide clarity and cohesion.\n\nStarring: RZA, Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, Jamie Chung, and Cung Le. Directed by: RZA."

You may know what I mean as you watch the opening titles (with Chinese subtitles) appear during a fight scene, which brings back fond memories of Saturday morning TV, but your smile quickly turns into a grimace as it's accompanied by \"Shame on the n. that try to run game on a n....\" and out of place hip-hop music throughout.\n\nOverall, everything else is good except for RZA's acting which led to me believe he had same kind of ability, as Bronze Body (Bautista), but his is totransform his body to wood. It seems RZA may have done better by also paying tribute to William Castle flicks giving audiences an opportunity to vote on playing something else like \"The Kid with the Golden Arm\"."

The graphic killing added nothing of interest to anyone over 14 years old. RZA's name says it all, instead of a real name he uses pretentious initials - immature garbage.\n\nThey must have paid a ton of money to Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu to be in this excrement. They should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nI found some of the reviews interesting. Those that say this can not compare to Kill Bill or other Tarantino and Rodriguez stuff are wrong. Tarantino and Rodriguez have unwarranted halo effect on their junk. This movie, if it had either of their names attached, would have been graded at least a 7. Their movies are mostly pure junk and are as bad as this one."

To sum up the plot, Mr. X is a bad guy who has Mr. Y be is magical ninja killing machine but Mr. W. but come in and stop both of them before it's too late (idk what happens if Mr. X wins? Probably more of the same thing that has already been happening which is nothing). This movie was so stupid I stopped watching it because it went nowhere. I will say that they did a good job capturing the culture of modern day china with the architecture, the technology, the food, the constant dialogue in English, the 24/7 kung foo fighting, the children trying to feel you up for coins, and the abundance of brothel and whores footage. It really does make you feel like you're there, almost like a documentary. Amlost makes me want to give it a 2, but that's against my principles."

        "review_detailed_main": "I guess I cannot be too critical of a film that I only managed to watch for 20 minutes before I had to walk out, and I'm not usually 'that guy', but in this instance I just had to be. Let me try and sum up the gist of what was going on, in a story that seemed to come from a brief thought of a Kung-Fu movie from the notes of Robert Rodr\u00edguezes ideas pad after too many Tequila's. There was this guy, Golden Lion, who was killed by a few other poorly named lions, and this Golden Lion's son was on a mission to avenge his father's death, by the time I walked out of the film there was a brief appearance from an overweight Russell Crowe and aging Lucy Lu, whose characters relevance to the story wasn't clear but I am guessing they were going to get mixed up with the Blacksmith and his girlfriend, who again didn't seem to have too much relevance to the 'revenge mission' taking place, apart from the Blacksmiths narrative, which was poorly written. And don't worry, if you are planning on watching this movie once reading this review (which is very unlikely) there will be no spoilers, as again, I don't know the ending or twists myself. But let's go back to what I do know, and that is that this movie is a very poor one. You can see where the writer and director, former rapper RZA, got his influences from; and that's very clearly Quentin Tarantino, whose name appears on the poster declaring that he presents this movie. Now let's get things straight, in no way am I comparing the two, as Tarantino is a film god in my eyes, and all geniuses are close to insanity apparently, and this is clear here, as he allowed his friend to release this movie, but also attribute his name to it. However, I can slightly see why, and let me explain this before I sound insane, Tarantino loves Robert Rodriguez, and the latter creates movies in the same mould as this one, so my theory is that Tarantino thought RZA was creating a Rodriquez, but it just didn't turn out that way. The tongue-in-cheek nature of a Rodriquez film, mixed with over-the-top violence and a fantastic score, with brilliant actors littered throughout, was all attempted by RZA, but failed at it miserably. I walked away from the film trying to find him a little creative in thinking that it was possibly done tongue-in-cheek, but I don't think he is a clever enough film maker to pull it off. The script felt like an 80's dubbed Korean movie, with one liners that would even stand out in a Nicolas Cage movie. The fight sequences were all about shocking its audience with great effects and extreme blood and gore, but it was laughable. The corny and cringe-filled romantic scenes were made even worse by 90's porn music. In turn it all reminded me of the children's programme Power Rangers for some reason, an overly violent version. It was just terrible, need I remind you that I get all this from just 20 minutes of viewing, I could have probably written a novel after the whole thing. Let me give the man a break and just say let's forget about this movie, and hope that RZA comes back with something better next time. That's as nice as I can be. 1 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "'When it comes to money, things get funny.' Thaddeus the Blacksmith\n\nRZA (born Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, aka Prince Rakeem, Bobby Digital, Bobby Steels , The Abbott, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, The Rzarector) is a Hip hop MC and influential producer best known for his work with Wu-Tang Clan. Here he expands his influence by conceiving, writing, composing the musical score, directing and starring in this very strange movierama ,THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS.\n\nMadame Blossom summarizes the plot by saying 'Power belongs to no one, until it is seized through sex or violence.' One critic was able to give the pan for the story as follows: 'In Jungle Village, the leader of the Lion's clan Gold Lion is summoned by the Governor (Terence Yin) and assigned to protect his gold that will be transported through the village. However he is betrayed and murdered by the greedy Silver Lion (lawyer/actor Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Cung Le). Gold Lion's favorite son Zen Yi, a.k.a. The X-Blade (Korean American famous fashion model Rick Yune), seeks revenge and heads to Jungle Village, but he is defeated by Brass Body (Dave Bautista) and rescued by the local Blacksmith Thaddeus (RZA). Meanwhile the Gemini Female (Grace Huang) and the Gemini Male (Andrew Lin) protect the Governor's gold, but they are vanquished by the army of Silver and Bronze Lion. The Blacksmith is abducted by the Lions and has his arms severed by Brass Body. However he is saved by the British Jack Knife (Russell Crowe), who is the emissary of the Emperor, and he manufactures iron arms for Thaddeus. Meanwhile the Governor sends the Jackal army to fight against the Lions and they hide the gold in the brothel of Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu). However, Madam Blossom and his girls form an army of black widows and together with Jack, Zen Yi and The Blacksmith, they fight against the Lions.\n\nGreat costumes, extraordinary hair styles for men, pretty sets, flying action and blood blood blood are the main attractions here. The story is supposedly set in feudal China but much of the dialogue and situations are very much of this decade. Filmed in Hong Kong and the US the characters are basically an Asian mix of what appears to be a cluster of American actors. One is left wondering how such people as Russell Crowe, Pam Grier (she plays RZA's mother) and Lucy Liu (and what did the publicized Quentin Tarantino do in this picture?) connected to this extended Oriental rap session. But in the end, if silly dialogue and absurd fights and lack of plot make for a colorful evening's escapist entertainment, then here it is. A tagline for the film spotlights the theme: 'They put the F.U. in Kung Fu.' Grady Harp, July 13"

It's laughable that IMDb requires 10 lines of text for a review, as this movie only needs 4 to describe how fundamentally awful it is. Occasionally Lucy Liu has an expression on her face that shrieks 'OMG, who wrote that line' , shortly before the film jumps to some artsy visual effect and some scene with maybe some bare female flesh, backed up with some wu tang crap.

        "review_detailed_main": "Here are the main problems with the movie: 1. Bad acting - nearly all the leading roles provide us with poor performances, including RZA himself.\n\n2. Bad storyline/script - the story isn't terrible, although similar plots have been regurgitated countless times before. But the progression of events and the way the story is pieced together lets the production down badly.\n\n3. Bad direction - Although there are some scenes and shots in the movie which have some fancy and praise-worthy cinematography and fx, other parts of the movie just seem very quickly shot, without care. More attention by the director would have improved things.\n\n4. Don't care about characters - this goes back to the acting and script. At no point in the movie do you really feel true empathy for the characters. They seem like cardboard cutouts, not real people.\n\n5. Average martial arts - while there are some impressive fight scenes, most of the martial arts in the movie is nothing spectacular.\n\nOverall: This really comes across like an episode of the old Power Rangers TV Show, cheap and rushed. Or like the first Mortal Kombat movie. They all have a similar sort of vibe. If you removed the blood and gore from the movie you could see it as purely children's entertainment. As far as it's replay value, I'd say it's about zero. Can't say I'll ever watch it again.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan of RZA and Wu Tang, you'll hear some of their tracks throughout the film and get to see RZA in the role of a protagonist. I don't think you'll be amazed by any means, but not totally disappointed. It gets 4 out of 10 from me, a lot of other kung fu flicks from the 70s and 80s, even up to present day, are much better than this. As long as you watch it without expecting anything great you'll possibly be mildly entertained. You'll want to watch it anyway if you're a Wu fan, just don't expect Fist of Legend, Drunken Master or Shogun Assassin, it's nowhere near that level but still not the worst martial arts movie out there. Just a shame that it leans more towards being a bad film than a good film."

I was greeted with a exclusive look at Django unchained, this made me very happy. Before I go on, I will list the good and the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe action - It was legit to say the least. The movie dished out plenty of action and plenty of good action at that.\n\nThe acting - Honestly the acting was surprisingly good. Will it win an Oscar? Hell no, but was it good for an action movie? Yes, very.\n\nThe soundtrack - This might be the best part of the movie. We get the classic Wu Tang music mixed in with some classic 70s Kung Fu music and some rock.\n\nThe characters - Almost every character in this movie was good, there wasn't that one character that annoyed everyone, it was just a solid effort all around.\n\nRussell Crowe - Honestly this was the one element I was nervous about. But honestly Crowe really gave Mr. Knife some life, it was thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nFilm length - I can't tell you how many good movies have been ruined by being dragged out for sooo long.\n\nClassic 70s Kung Fu feel - Aaaaaah loved this! It really felt like a classic throwback to some old Kung Fu movies, you can really see Tarantino's influence here.\n\nThe bad:\n\nMovie title - Honestly, if you see the movie you will realize why the title does not fit.\n\nNot enough RZA - As the main character I would have loved to see way more RZA kicking butt.\n\nThe plot - Was it the greatest? No, it was a little lacking but NOT that big of a drawback.\n\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It sounded AMAZING, looked crisp, had some superb action and was consistent. As RZA's directorial you couldn't ask for much better from the Abbott of the Wu. It brings action, legit characters and RZA kicking butt, what more do you need?\n\nI will definitely recommend this to my friends."

I hated it so much that I actually watched the whole film for some reason - perhaps to see if it really could be as bad all the way through.\n\nThe film was clearly supposed to be a retro Kill Bill style Kung Fu spectacular. But it was an extremely poor imitation - it's characters were poorly written - the costume designs were used to try and flesh out the characters further - but the concept artists should be ashamed - ultimately this is a monumental and embarrassing failure.\n\nAt times I had to rewind and re-play in disbelief at the awkward cuts and disastrous choreography and as the action switched awkwardly between slow motion and high speed nonsense.\n\nIt goes without saying that it was poorly written with not a single twist, surprise or saving grace.

I didn't expect anything in terms of acting (just look at the cast!) nor the story (c'mon, it's a chop-socky flick!), so I was depending on the fights to deliver: hell no! They were slow, uninspired, completely generic and dare I say, dull. They're not even in the \"so crap it's good/funny/entertaining\" category a la Van Damme, they were just plain bad. So, a kung-fu movie that has no story and bad actors is to be expected, but a kung-fu movie with crap-fu? Avoid at all costs. This one definitely has Iron Fists, not for fighting, but for fapping!"

For Example: -A black person in feudal China -A man who for no reason can change his skin into bronze on a whim -The entire population of China speaking English with American accents, although sometimes they speak Chinese and then revert back to English just because they can. -That prosthetic arms can be made of iron and when forced onto an amputee's stumps function perfectly.This is again in feudal China. -Also that once iron prostheses have been cleaved to your stumps you become proficient in unarmed combat -The existence of nylon tights and stockings in feudal China -1980s glam rock hair styling in feudal China -Did I mention that the prostheses have magical powers (not explained at all) and can somehow summon tornado's or something?\n\nThere was no coherent plot, zero opportunity to relate to the characters, a cast of what might as well have been tree stumps for the level of acting they delivered and a tonne of nonsensical choreographed violence. I accept that this last is usual of a martial arts film but at the same time added little and wasted time. The films score, celebrated by critics apparently, was not impressive as far as I'm concerned. That it sometimes featured rap songs or sci-fi esque synthesiser tones, amongst the regular backing, was also distracting and nonsensical.\n\nThere were also a number of pieces of symbolism which were entirely forced upon the audience. For example the way two dead bodies fell to form a Yin & Yang sign. Again these added nothing to the film and in fact detracted from it in the fashion in which they were delivered to the screen. I have seen more cogent symbolism in episodes of Family Guy.\n\nAs much as I like to see scantily clad women this use of cheap tricks to gain attention was gratuitous. That the one of the films major settings was a whorehouse explains this but at the same time it was not done tastefully. The desperation with which the director, RZA, tries to attract attention is pitiful. Someone also needs to tell him that split screen and screen-wipes are great tools to use in a comic book child's cartoon but aren't needed in grown-up's films.\n\nRussel Crowe's performance was perhaps the only one which calls for any merit. However why he sullied his career by appearing in this example of cinema bilge is beyond me. His character also adds very little, his only motivation being greed and the small size of his role not allowing him to rescue the film. RZA appearing in his own movie is an act of colossal narcissism. That he wrote the film doesn't confer upon him the ability to act. Something he proved throughout the film. He can't direct either considering the bile he released. On a different note, in my opinion RZA isn't a real name. It's an acronym. Whatever RZA is attempting to prove by calling himself RZA is irrelevant. I think it makes him look stupid.\n\nI considered at some point during the film that this might be spoof of the entire martial arts genre yet the film takes itself far too seriously for that. The opening and closing credits make it appear as though RZA was attempting a grindhouse style but doesn't follow through to any other portion of the film. I only managed to finish this film because I was writing this very review during the second half.\n\nDon't watch this film. It will be a waste of your time. RZA shouldn't be allowed to direct any more if this is the standard we can expect from him."

When the hands of the village blacksmith, RZA, are cut off he becomes the Man with the Iron Fists. Can he defeat Brass Body (David Bautista) who seems invincible?\n\nWhat you need to know: RZA is the blacksmith and he also directed this confusion. Not good. Quentin Tarantino lent his name only to this because he is friends with RZA and he is probably regretting it. Also not good. Most of the movie is shot in the dark and things were hard to see and focus on. Bad and not in a good way and this, most of all, added to the confusion. There is a lot of fighting with CGI and this only added to the confusion. Again, not good. RZA does narration throughout and that was, for sure, not good, because his voice wasn't that clear, kind of throaty. Too many of bad guy assassins looked too much like Zen Yi, the X-Blade (Rick Yune) - one of the good guys - and it was hard to tell who was a good guy and who was a bad guy in the beginning. Way not good. The Rap music in the beginning contained many N and MF words. Really not good. Our only hope was to follow Jack Knife to insure he was a good guy. He was. Finally, something good. But, we kept an eye anyway.\n\nYou will have to contact Russell Crowe and ask why he was in this. The whole crew was Chinese except him. Kind of out of place. See? Lucy Liu as Madam Blossom made more sense. See? Yes, both were good, regardless.\n\nIf you are so intended to stay with this and are not sure what is going on and who to follow, then just follow Jack Knife, RZA, and Zen Yi, the X-Blade as they are the good guys. Everyone else is questionable. When you see a movie as confusing as this, it is good to know who the good guys are from the get-go. It's the only way to enjoy this confusion as sometimes the story seemed to veer off the rails and go into other directions. Oh, also, keep in mind that everyone is after the gold. That is all you really need to know. How good is that? HA ! (3/10)\n\nViolence: Yes. Sex: Yes, many simulations. Nudity: No. Bloody Gore: Yes. Language: Yes, and in the music too."

What a luck that the idea of making 2 movies out of it was not materialized!(Although there is a clear clue at the end that a sequel is considered!)\n\nIt was bizarre to see Chinese people speak English between themselves and every now and then, Chinese and foreigners would speak Chinese. The combats were not martial arts, nor realistic and the Chinese-like thought-process was a mess. In addition, the fighting was covered with rap music! Next time what? folklore music maybe? There was not any acting, nor attachment to main characters. Finally without obvious reasons, there was often no logic nor correct physics in what we were watching.\n\nA complete waste of time and money"

Most Martial Arts films that are created in the Shaw Brothers tradition will always ask viewers to suspend their disbelief, and ask viewers to become steeped in the mythos of a story that is most times only hinted at, in much the same way that readers of comics are asked to within the pages of any given title. If you can watch a film like the \"Five Deadly Venoms\" and overlook the fact that its never explained why the Poison Clan members became bad guys, or why the last student(who was taught all the styles, but never mastered one) needed to seek the help of one the members of the Poison Clan to beat the others, you can overlook some of the story structure \"problems\" in The Man With the Iron Fists.

Russell Crow delivers nicely, but his character is as thin as a sheet of paper. Lucy Liu shines as the brothel owner. Unfortunately, on top of that the plot is not going to keep you anywhere near the edge of your seat. There are characters introduced that lead to nowhere or are supposed to by comedy characters but end up \"missing in action' It is very hard to recommend the film and for most of the time it seems like a waste of time."

Both Rza and Tarentino made their respective films for the same reason - ego. So to be fair which director stayed true to the genre they both claimed to love? Tarentino hired Gordon Liu and that was all. Rza began with Kuan Tai Chen. (Unfortunately a lot of his scenes were cut and should not have been.) Then he went on to finish the job properly. So if you came to this movie expecting Tarentino and Bill you were set up for failure the same as if you sat down to watch Woody Allen."

DON'T even think that because Russel Crowe and Lucy Liu are in it or because Quentin Tarantino's name is on the poster that it must be somewhat decent....it's not. The plot is confusing (I still don't know what the main plot or main character was supposed to be), the dialogues are so terrible it's not even funny anymore and the story is just unimaginative. I mean....the story is set in a place called \"jungle village\"....go figure.\n\nAnother thing that annoyed the hell out of me was the mixing of Mandarin and Cantonese in the different scenes. I know it's supposed to be all fantasy and that it doesn't need to be geographically correct or anything, but just pick one dialect for God's sake! The story is already very very weak and the mixing of dialogues just destroys the whole thing.\n\nThe only good thing about this movie is that big Bronze guy, he was kinda hot. And Lucy Liu was also decent, but the scene where she was holding this 1-minute speech in front of the prostitutes was just awful. Not because of her acting, but because the speech itself was rubbish. Throughout the movie I felt so sorry for Russel Crowe for having to gain all that weight to be in this movie, cause it just wasn't worth it. I hope they paid him well."

There is nothing even remotely interesting about the plot, it's predictable and just plain bad. The movie feels choppy and well... the director is horrible, no other way to put it. Then again, RZA is essentially just another flavor flav. If you want an real martial arts action film, there are hundreds of them produced in HK/China every year, just go to the foreign films section of Netflix or Blockbuster. If you want Quentin, watch Grindhouse.\n\nWhats more, the director, RZA is a racist and yes, he is of a minority ethnic persuasion. Chinese people are portrayed as Mongol savages throughout the movie. There is an African fellow working as a blacksmith in British colonial China. There also happens to be a lone British officer wandering about what is described as a \"jungle village\" and there happens to be (conveniently) a classy brothel in the center of it all, reminiscent of Hong Kong during this time period. This is culturally, geographically, and historically incorrect. RZA manages to warp 4 separate parts of the globe from potentially different time periods, into one village.\n\nOh whats more, the treatment of the African man's arm amputations is inaccurate to say the least. Cauterizing the wound like they do would lead to infection and certain death. 19th century medical knowledge was certainly better than what is depicted in the movie.\n\nWhat's more? LUCY LIU CANT SPEAK MANDARIN WORTH SHIFT. She should seriously stick to English speaking roles.\n\nAll this is due to ignorance on the part of the person who wrote the script RZA, but then again, he has just about the same education level as Flavor Flav.

What a shame.\n\nA shame because this Movie looks pretty good and has enough Kung-Fu Madness and Violence, the required over the top Comic Book Characters, and some neat gadgetry that make this, visually, an Entertaining Homage.\n\nHis Friend Tarantino should bring this Guy down a notch or two, tweak that Ego, and maybe, just maybe He could make a Movie that really Kicks-Ass. That is if RZA can refrain from Speaking or Starring in it, because if the \"TROOFF\" be told most of this Movie is degraded by his oral overreach, including the out of place \"Musical\" Soundtrack."

To begin with the o.s.t was a big fail so it kept throwing me off the already cheesy n clich\u00e9 action scene. I can see this was to be made like Sukiyaki Western Django done by my fave director Takashi miike san. i urge people to go check that out. even though it 'has' a star-cast , the movie fails so badly at being even funny. I am writing no spoilers at all cos well it does not matter with movies like this. I Kept watching it till the end to see if there will be redemption at some point but in vain. If this movie was intended to be cheesy and clich\u00e9 with budget, it served its purpose. Someone said quentin put his name to it so he must've seen something, so please somebody tell what it was lol. I don't think he was involved artistically with this movie at all ."

The actor, Director and music from the Wu Tang Clan, who also provided the soundtrack is worthy but just does not suit the flashy but hollow visuals."

I think the RZA and Roth started out with something good on paper. However, some things got lost in translation.\n\nYou'd think that a martial arts flick with classic Wu-tang tracks would be a hit, but it fails to connect. You might think you're walking into a movie that pays homage to the old school fight flicks, but you're getting a new film, with decent cinematography, bad music supervision and a concept that did not materialize correctly.\n\nSo even if someone else beside the RZA had directed this, it still would have been average at best, simply because the story doesn't work.\n\nThe other item, is the RZA. His character didn't really work, but the back story on him should have been more developed and been the focus of the film.\n\nThis was the RZA's demo tape. He'll be back with a hit next time around."

I think he did what he set out to do.\n\nThere aren't many martial arts films like this that get cinematic airtime anymore and it was good to go to a theater and see this type of movie. The fight scenes are choreographed to perfection and the cast was just incredible. Russell Crowe just blew that out of the water. And being a big Bautista fan, I was very impressed with the Brass Body character a lot. He brought a very interesting dynamic to the movie. I look forward to seeing more from RZA.\n\nMy only issues with the film were some of the functionality with some of the weapons the characters used. That's all I'll say on that, though."

The Monkey King facial hair, having random Chinese characters (language) written here and there, but everyone speaking English... \"Jungle Village\"?! Are you serious? Blossom, Lion, Silk... We're just missing a Jade and a Dragon and we've got the whole set.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I'm a creative action-with-a-twist fan (I see a lot of reviews here referencing QT)... but this is just messy with a lot of dead-pan, wooden acting.

The gangs of interest were the Lion Clan, the Hyena Clan, and the Gemini Clan. I'm not going to go into detail, just know that some gold had to get somewhere and the Lion Clan wanted to steal it. Somewhere in there the blacksmith, Thadeus Henry Smith (RZA), got his arms cut off and became the man with the iron fists. Lucy Liu was in there doing some \"Kill Bill\" stuff, Russell Crowe even had a role, and there was a Dave Bautista sighting.\n\nI could hardly follow the plot it was that stale. And then there was the acting. The known actors did their part, yet they still looked inept because of the abysmal script. The unknowns were so bad that public high schools wouldn't even use them as extras in a play. I can tell that there was an attempt to recapture the 70's and 80's style of kung-fu movies, but this was done in 2012. Stop it. I'd like to say, \"Nice try RZA,\" but it wasn't."

Sure a movie directed by the RZA and presented by Quentin Tarantino sounds like it would be an awesome film but it simply falls short of expectations. It seemed like the RZA tried to combine the run of a brink Kung Fu movie with the Exploitation genre all while trying to pay homage to Kill Bill. The story didn't make much sense, the fight choreography was not very good and the special effects were cheap. Now when I say the special effects were cheap I mean that the blood looked totally fake and that many of the fighting moves were completely ridiculous, especially the final blow in the final fight. On the upside the acting was halfway decent, the weapons were creative and some of the characters were somewhat likeable. The story basically follows a Blacksmith, an Emissary, some prostitutes and various clans that constantly battle each other for reasons that aren't entirely clear. Fighting ensues, people die and you can probably figure out the rest. Overall, if you're expecting Tarantino quality you'll be sorely disappointed and if you're a fan of Martial Arts films you still won't be very impressed. I would only recommend this film to fans of the Martial Arts genre. Even then I recommend waiting for this one to come out on home video."

Russell Crowe looks way too out of shape to be doing a fight scene, but he at least can act. Occasionally the film starts to pick up steam, only to lose it by introducing another plot line or segueing to a lengthy flashback.\n\nThere are a few fun moments to be had, mostly courtesy of Lucy Liu and her brothel, and some of the weapons are interesting, but they overdo that also. The set designs are very good and the costuming is a standout. Other than that, there's just no reason to watch this film, unless you need to see every homage to kung fu movies ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had some reservations about this movie, but still gave it a go. And I will say that the movie was entertaining, but certain parts about it was really not in my taste or liking.\n\nFor starters, then having RZA in one of the lead roles, seriously? It was just one of those Things that didn't Work well with me. And also, I was wondering why the Chinese people were speaking English. It just didn't make any sense, but of course it appeals to people scared of foreign films and easier to keep it in English. And the movie did have too much of a Westernized touch to it. I guess that is what you get when non-Chinese attempt at making a Chinese action martial arts movie.\n\nThe martial arts and fighting sequences were quite good, but of course why wouldn't it be with Cory Yuen behind the choreography? And the entire scenery, sets and atmosphere was good. It is hard not to get taken in by the impressive work that went into the production of the movie and the details; ranging from the costumes to the buildings.\n\nI will say that the characters were colorful and well-chiseled out. I enjoyed how much detail and story that went into each character. And they were nicely brought to life on the screen by the actors and actresses, but also by the costumes and props.\n\n\"The Man With the Iron Fists\" has an impressive cast list, especially amongst the Asian cast. If you are familiar with Asian cinema, then you will find yourself in for a treat when you see who is in this movie.\n\nThe ultimately downside to this movie was the choice of music. Wow, are you kidding me? The music in the movie was bloody awful, and it was so out of tune with the entire movie. The music was so bad that I was wishing for an 'exclude the music score' button on the remote control.\n\nBut all in all, aside from some eye- and ear-sore flaws, then \"The Man With the Iron Fists\" was entertaining and full of fighting and action. It is well worth sitting down to watch."

I know I do. It's this gleeful lack of regard for realism from writer-director-composer-star RZA \u2013 a renowned martial arts enthusiast \u2013 that frees up TMWTIF to be exactly what it aims for: silly, unhinged entertainment to sate the genre fanatics. The cracking old-school opening credits sequence sets the tone early and from there RZA rarely lets the pace slip; if not presenting a well-choreographed, often ultra-violent scrap, he's allowing his eclectic cast (Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, Byron Mann) to sprout Tarantino-esque dialogue at each other with venomous joy. Special mention to the anachronistic soundtrack too, it's a sublime blend of modern gangster hip-hop and an over-the-top 70's eastern score, giving the chop-socky action a perfect accompanying beat. It's unashamedly all style over substance, but who cares \u2013 not me! \u2013 this is a coolly-constructed, suitably frenetic homage to the kung fu genre, from a fan for the fans."

And does alright in a supporting role. Russell Crowe who I was really surprise to see here, I mean a great actor like that in a martial arts film, but none the less he looks like he is having a blast. Lucy Liu is also good playing a character similar to the part she played in Kill Bill. Rick Yune best remembered from The Fast and The Furious(2001) and Die Another Day(2002), has some pretty good action scenes as well.\n\nNow did I like this movie, I was entertained, but was it great, no but I don't think it was meant to be a great film, but an entertaining one. And it does have some pretty good fight scenes. But if you did not like Kill Bill: Vol 1 and 2, then you probably won't like this movie, but if did like the Kill Bills then give this film a try."

The fantasy fragments are right, and putted on the right place, close to reality, perfect, but the historical events, are not in place, there's a hole in the story because of the timeline. You can't understand what time in the past this event was taken place and It's confusing. I give 7, because like I said, I like the idea, but the movie is too short to fit all this epicness."

We understand that main stream media will not promote this as the best movie out, However, if you wanted to see a long drawn out vampire movie because thats whats popular, then go right ahead. RZA made a movie that is exactly the theme, style, of a Kung Fu- movie, while keeping the authentic movement that he did with music. This is a Kung-fu flick.\n\nOne of my favorite movies is Buddha Fist, but after watching the 8 diagrams, i will never forget the movie 18 Bronzemen, and if you never seen any of these, Then you should!!!

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS': Four Stars (Out of Five)\n\nRap artist RZA directed, co-wrote (with horror director Eli Roth) and stars in this homage to classic B Kung Fu films. The film co-stars the likes of Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, Rick Yune, Chung Le, Byron Mann, Dave Bautista and Jamie Chung. The story revolves around a blacksmith (played by RZA) who teams with a rogue British soldier and a Chinese warrior out for revenge to defend his village from a vicious clan of traitors. The movie is a great homage to B Kung Fu movies; it's got lots of stylish and campy fight scenes, sex and gore and should more than please most fans of the genre.\n\nThe film is set in 19th century China in the town of Jungle Village. RZA plays a freed slave turned loner blacksmith who is called on to make deadly weapons for most of the townsfolk. Crowe plays a British soldier named Jack Knife, who's named after his special weapon, and is visiting the town's brothel ran by Madam Blossom (Liu). When the Lion Clan, lead by Silver Lion (Mann) and Bronze Lion (Le), kill their former leader and threaten the village the Blacksmith teams with Jack Knife and a lone warrior out to avenge his father's death, known as The X-Blade (Yune), to defend the townsfolk. Chaos and violence ensues.\n\nQuentin Tarantino lent his name to the film (in a 'presented by' credit) but served no other purpose in the production. RZA did learn a lot by watching him on the set of 'KILL BILL' though (while he was doing the soundtrack for that film) and it shows. The film is produced in a style most would call Tarantino-esque and RZA does show a lot of talent as an action film director. He and Roth's script is decent as well but RZA is no actor. He says little in the film but his presence as the lead still brings the film's quality down a bit. The rest of the cast is more than adequate though and they do help make up for RZA's poor performance. Like I said there's plenty of great martial arts action, gore and sex to please any hardcore genre fan and the women are very beautiful to look at as well (I've been a big fan of Liu's for a while). It's a fun B Kung Fu movie that serves it's purpose well.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UjpH_VEK1U"

There's many movies who deserve a lot more like (Pearl Harbor or the most movies from Tyler Perry, and much more). But enough with this. Now my review for \"The Man With The Iron Fist\"\n\nQUENTIN Tarantino: FirsT of all, I know why Quentin Tarantino presents this movie. Hes a personal friend with RZA, but when you look a little bit at the writing, the amount of imagination and the music, you will find some Tarantino in it.\n\nTHE IDEA: Its a good idea. RZA & Eli Roth did a good writing job, but the directing was not the best: sometimes to much, sometimes predictable, sometimes it needs more...\n\nACTING: Russell Crowe is an amazing actor like always. Lucy Liu is a very good actor and a beautiful woman - she did a great job in this. There are much good and bad actors in this movie. I have to say that the worst in this movie that you will find is the acting from RZA and Dave Bautista.\n\nME: Its not the best movie ever, but its a watchable movie. There are great fights, a good story and the effects are good - its definitely something for \"The eye\".\n\nI give it an 8 because it deserves maybe a 6.5"

Its a ridiculous and fun kung fu movie with some funny one liners and impressive fight sequences. Is it acurate? No! I mean,come on, it takes place in China yet everyone is speaking English. The story is kind of all over the place. Lucy Liu is basicly playing the same character she did in \"Kill Bill\". And Russell Crowe, i don't even know what to say about him. One minute he's a horndog pulling beads out of a lady's vajayjay with his teeth and the next he's having an \"intellectual\" conversation. And you know they have all the hookers bathing together to appeal to the male audience.\n\nYou will enjoy it more if you don't read too much into a movie like this. Just take it at face value. It's kung fu meets Eli Roth gore. And it is gore thats so exagerated it makes me laugh. So much hard work must have been done to choregraph all the fights that you got to appreciate it. Is RZA the best actor? No. But, in my opinion, you don't have to be if you are in a movie like this because there isn't much depth to the characters. As long as the story, even a laughable one, is told then that's all that matters.\n\nI've been a movie junkie since I was a kid and when I see something in one that i've never seen before, i enjoy it even more. Example, until this movie i had never seen a knife that cuts people in half like giant scissors until I saw the one Crowe has.\n\nOscar worthy? It is not. A watchable wild ride? It is. The best part is watching the women kick major ass!"

While I can named at lest 100+ movies I saw in 2011/2010 off the top of my head. So far this year I have gone out to see. John Carter, Battleship, Safe house, Prometheus, The Hunger Games, The Expendables, The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises\n\nOh yeah the 3D Titanic- Wife Agroo.\n\nSo while not seeing much in the way of movies this year. It seems likes it takes a lot just to get up and go see any movie adventure this year or maybe we have been spoiled by the 2 big movies. Who knows. The Man With the Iron Fists\n\nThe movie starts off like all Martial Arts movies do intruding all the main players however you not sure who the bad guy is until it visually shown on screen which in turn gives us the setting or the idea where we don't know who the bad guys or who the good guys are as we meet them. The first half of the movie is narrated by the Blacksmith/THE RZA at which point he becomes the main character of the film. a few character feel out of place like the X-Blade/Rick Yune where hes only played a bad guys in films so you assume the same here. Jack knife/Russell Crowe is the comic relief but with attitude. he basically get all the good lines and steels the show. Madam Blossom/Lucy Liu is the brothel Madam whose brothel is where the whole movie takes place. Lucy Liu give one of her better performances in this movie and I say this because She is the only movie character I have seen in a long time where I not sure if I am supposed to love her or hate her. Every fight seen the movie is well choreographed and equally as brutal, The Directer takes a few liberties with cinematography which most cases work well. There are a few spots mostly when dealing with Brass Body where the CGI is just horrible but the parts are few and I give it up to being a low budget movie and The RZA first time in Directors seat. The movie has many sexually references but no nudity and mostly uses this as humor which works well in the film. Despite it taking place in a brothel there only one scene which may depict women in a derogatory way but this has meaning and is revealed a short time later in the film while also making me unsure of where or not to love or hate Lucy Liu in the movie.\n\nMy only issue in the movie is the final fight scenes at no point did it seem like the good guys were gonna lose. The Bruce lee homage with the room of mirrors what cut 99% away to save time in the movie and/or make room for the other 2 final fight scene.\n\nAll in all the movie is amazing and I give it a 85/100 The movie lost 10 points for the Bruce Lee \"Enter the Dragon\" room of mirrors abomination."

Also with such a small budget I think director has done justification to the overall look and action sequences in the movie. Visually movie is a treat and way much better than numerous, tasteless, big budget Hollywood movies of 2012. I recommend people to watch its trailer first and if you enjoy its trailer, then movie is definitely going to woo you since it has much more to offer and you will not regret. As for the performances of various actors is concerned I liked silver lion's role most and as usual Russell Crowe's screen presence is phenomenal. Lead actor in the title role is a huge let down but this is what I had expected even before I started watching this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the best documentary about RZA and his struggles of being a black man in feudal China. Anyone who has ever followed the Wu Tang Clan from the beginning to current times, knows this documentary is the shiz-nitz. This reenactment is down right surreal. The power they gain is out of this world, and it can't be beat. The acting is phenomenal from everyone. How this movie hasn't won so many awards, beats the hell out of me? Get ready to lower expectations cause this is cinematic gold, no it's cinematic platinum. There's even an amazing sequel to this documentary. Hands down worth the watch. Wu Tang!"

        "review_detailed_main": "First I have to say that I feel this movie is somewhat undervalued, since the statistics show that it didn't have much acceptance, but I think it deserves some mention, since it was made as a tribute to the classic martial arts movies of Chinese cinema. Also, it has a good cast, also good action scenes and gore scenes that were developed by Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger. Nor can we leave out the soundtrack that has good songs and a score composed by RZA himself. For me it was a good movie at the time and I like to think that movies of this type are an excellent example of how to make a live action adaptation of an anime. I give it a 10/10."
