        "review_detailed_main": "Although the effort of the director and the talent of the actors, the movie lacks the charm of the Guillermo del Toro duology. The movie is way more faithful to the comics but it also tries to be faithful to the previous movies (which every reboot should try to be) but it just becomes a mess of attempts. The CGI is overused- WHEN WILL STUDIOS LEARN!- and although the creatures design is very interesting, pretty much every character lacks the dept the old duology provided. At the end of the day Hellboy(2019) is just another failed reboot that tries to be it's own thing while respecting the previous movies. My rating? 5 out of 10, but I do agree with the 61% rating on rotten tomatoes because the movie isn't all crap, there's a charm to it but it's not enough to make you overlook it's flaws. Just watch the Guillermo del Toro duology, it's a far superior franchise, and I would of loved to see the third movie if the studios didn't cancelled it. If you are interested in the director Neill Marshall (which despite the failed attempt of rebooting Hellboy is a damn good director) go watch Dog Soldiers which is criminally underrated. See you next time at the movies, Ruben the Critic"

        "review_detailed_main": "517 A.D.: King Arthur defeats the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) with the help of his trusty magical sword Excalibur, chopping her into pieces and burying her still-living body parts in the far reaches of the land. 1500 years later, changeling Gruagach (voiced by Stephen Graham) pieces the queen back together so that she can destroy mankind and rule the Earth with monsters as her loyal subjects. Hellboy (David Harbour) is given the job of preventing this from happening.\n\nThe majority of fans and critics gave this film hell on its release. So what did it do to deserve such damnation?\n\nFor many, the simple fact that it wasn't directed by Guillermo Del Toro and didn't star Ron Perlman was enough to demonise the movie, but even overlooking the change of director and leading man, there is still plenty to dislike: the creature-filled action scenes are over-reliant on unrealistic CGI; the comedy frequently mis-fires; Daniel Dae Kim and Sasha Lane are lousy as Hellboy's sidekicks; and the plot is rather scattershot. Oh, and there's a REALLY bad ectoplasmic Ian McShane.\n\nHaving said that, there is also quite a lot to enjoy: the R-Rating allows for plenty of graphic gore (although, sadly, much of it is also digital); there are some delightfully absurd moments (Hellboy's encounter with hideous witch Baba Yaga, who lives in a house on giant chicken legs, is excellent, and Eastenders fans will enjoy seeing Mo Harris brandishing a machine gun); the links to Arthurian legend are fun, and apparently make the film more faithful to the comics than Del Toro's movies; and director Neil Marshall occasionally shows us what he is really capable of (the single-shot fight scene in a Siberian complex at the end of the film is wonderful).\n\nAll in all, a very mixed bag of a movie: not the completely hellish experience that I had heard it was, but far from great."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching this, it feels like a twelve-year-old wrote the screenplay by tacking together scenes that might look cool without giving any thought to what the dialog would sound like when spoken out loud by human beings. Ian McShane does his best to sound convincing, while some of the other actors don't seem to see the point in even doing that and it's hard to blame them. There are plot holes throughout and segments that make little-to-no sense and add nothing to the story, although would maybe look neat if the effects were any good. The whole thing generally feels like someone slapped together at least four or five stories and tried to turn them into a coherent whole, which wouldn't surprise me, although I don't know enough about the comics to say for certain.\n\nI'm not sure where to place the blame for the awful pacing, but the movie is just unrelenting. There are times when things should wind down, but then it's just more noisy stuff happening. For example, at one point a character is in need of specialized medical attention and they find out it'll be a fairly-long and \"treacherous\" trek to get it. The character is then cured within 1-2 minutes of runtime, the trek portion being a few seconds of that, then we jump straight into some exposition, then we jump straight back to what we were doing before, presumably after a long and treacherous trek back that also happens instantaneously. To get an idea of how jarring this feels, imagine if Gandalf told Frodo about what it would take to destroy the ring and the next scene was at Mount Doom.\n\nThe direction is mostly just odd, and I have no idea if it's because the director couldn't figure out what was happening in the script or because someone was meddling with his work.\n\nFinally, the CGI monsters look terrible. There are some impressive uses of practical effects, but the transitions between those and their CGI counterparts are blatant."

And while the actors are quite nice and the R-rating was secured (something fan boys really wished for), it did not make nearly as much money as it was supposed to. Or rather as much as the producers and the studio hoped for overall.\n\nAnd while this is layed out to warrant sequels, this probably won't happen. And it's almost a shame, because it isn't at all bad. The effects are good, the new Hellboy managed to stay afloat (which is quite an achievement if you think about the shoes he had to fill - or is it the horns?) - the story made sense too. But I guess there is a comic book fatigue to a degree. There are so many movies out there, that people pick and choose. Maybe there were other reasons too, but in the end it doesn't really matter ... speaking of endings: there is one mid credit scene and one after credit scene. So if you watch it, watch it proper"

There's nothing I can think of to defend this cinematographic abomination. This extremely ugly shot cosplay version of Mike Mignola's Hellboy comic does not even attempt to tell a coherent story. The soundtrack consists of some out of place rock songs that are stuck in random places in the film. Unlike Del Toro's films, there is no way of feeling any sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The endless stream of silly one-liners and aimless quips make you realize that these annoyingly unpleasant characters have nothing to tell us over the course of two (!) excruciating hours. The movie simply jumps from exposition piece to action scene and back again. And where Guillermo Del Toro created a tactile world with a balanced combination of practical effects work and sparingly used CGI, we are now saddled with special effects that look like the deleted scenes from a Playstation 3 game. It's incomprehensible that Mignola believes that this soulless version is closer to the comics. I think the claim that the a fan of the source material would be at peace with this terrible movie is an insult."

Directed by Neil Marshal, who has worked on Game of thrones and West World, this is not the Neil Marshall who gave us the horror masterpiece that is The Decent. This is the Neil Marshal who gave us Dog Soldiers and Doomsday. Silly, gory, surprising and does not give a **** about embracing it absurd concept to the full. David Harbor knocks it out of the park as Hellboy, and one thing he has over Ron Perlman's performance is a sense of threat; that he really could be evil of pushed too far. The whole film moves at a fast pace and has a feel of a video game, but here it works, with a mix of Devil May Cry and God of War, especially in the combat and design of some creatures. Maybe I was in a forgiving mood but the Bebop like villain Gruagach had me in stiches with his sweary mouth and English northern accent. Go see it if you want some outrageous fantasy violence and a few laughs."

This is a very different take on these iconic characters and the world they inhabit and it is the most fun version that I've seen so far. Don't get me wrong, I loved GDT's films, the man crafts beautiful modern fairly tales and this film was smart no to try and replicate that. Instead, this movie has more in common with #SamRaimi's #ArmyOfDarkness, over the top violence and Gore, not for those with a weak stomach, and frequent profanity. #DavidHarbour does an excellent job and plays the role very differently than Perlman did and it has the potential to propel him from TV into a full time movie star. #IanMcShane brings his usual gravitas and presence to the role previously embodied by the late great #JohnHurt, again being smart to not emulate that performance and make this role entirely his own.\n\nI feel like this movie is suffering from the same disconnect and out of touch effect that critics had with last year's #Venom. Critics almost universally panned that film while audiences similarly loved it. Every negative review I've read for this so far continually compares it unfavorably to the previous films and many also take issues with the excessive use of violence, Gore and adult language. What did you expect, this is an R Rated film and is thoroughly advertised as such.\n\nI hope positive word of mouth from fans makes this successful as they set up some very cool stuff for a potential sequel.\n\nIf you love these characters like I do, if you love balls to the wall, over the top action horror, please see this film."

But it doesn't have the spit and polish that Guillermo del Toro put into his film duo. One the good side Neil Marshall and the writers stayed true to the story Hellboy. The role of the big bad was beautifully played by Milla Jovovich (fair warning on this part I have been nursing a 20 + year crush on her). Daniel Dae Kim and Sasha Lane were great in their roles of Domino and Alice. They add a little more depth to help flesh on the new world created for the film. And the adding of Church as Lobster Johnson was great. On a whole it was a solid film. If you like modern fantasy, and want to move away from the Marvel/DC fight of which is the better superheroes. You could do worse than Hellboy."

The writing is bad and feels like a Jr. High boy's creative writing assignment, full of fantastic concepts that have all been done before. There's a lot of explaining about past events and scene setup that should come from situations and dialog, but instead is given to us in a \"Oh yeah, forgot to tell you...\" fashion. Then there was the editing... Scenes were mishmashed together to tell the story loosely. I'm not an editor, but I even noticed scenes that would have been better left out or rearranged in a different order. Halfway through the movie, I left."

Every time he moves or falls or rolls over, you see his body-suit unnaturally bending out. He sharpens his horn, and it wiggles around, because obviously it isn't growing out of his skull.\n\nThen there's just the character. He is stupid and clueless from the first seconds, not a savvy agent who's done this his whole life.\n\nI could go on and on, and I only endured a quarter of the movie.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and don't even do that. Just watch del Toro's vastly-better movies. The people involved in this one clearly have no clue what made them as good as they are...unless they deliberately set out to do the opposite."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hellboy 2019 is the very definition of a sloppy script with terrible special effects brought to life with terrible execution. This movie has one of the most convoluted stories I've ever seen, so much so that the best way to describe it would be thus: Five episodes of a TV show crammed together in the format of a two hour long film, with episodes one and three missing.\n\nThere were times when I wondered whether this was a sequel to a movie that I had not seen. That would explain how the film expects you to know all the characters, and constantly references to past events. Maybe if you were a hardcore fan of the comics you might understand. But that narrows down the target audience significantly, because I doubt that many people read Hellboy comics. If you were a casual movie goer who simply wished to watch a fun summer blockbuster, then you would understand this film as much as a person who has not seen any marvel movies understand Avengers Endgame.\n\nThe characters jump from one location to another every five minutes. At times it feels like a stage show. New scene, new location, new characters for a certain amount of time and then it jumps to the next scene. The two side characters are introduced halfway through the film, and are so insignificant at first that you don't realize they're integral to the plot until much later.\n\nThe villain's backstory is explained in the first five minutes by a terrible expedition dump. It's never a good sign when your story starts with a narrator who explains the plot. The story tries to have elements of King Arthur and the Dark Ages, ancient monsters and giants, and the modern day world. It would have been preferable if it took place in the ancient medieval days, because the modern setting really takes away from the atmosphere and mood.\n\nYou feel no emotional attachment to any character in the entire film, because there is nothing relatable or likable about them. Hellboy is mostly indifferent to everything that happens. He doesn't seem to care about the plot, which begs the question: Why should we? Hellboy's father is a huge jerk for most of the story as well and for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Even the villan is generic and forgetable.\n\nThe film jumps from one subplot to another, never giving the watcher time to process anything that's happening. Initially, I thought that it was going to be about a McGuffin subplot, but it completely skips over that and moves on to another McGuffin subplot. See what I mean by the story being needlessly complicated?\n\nAt least the practical effects are good, but they don't blend well with the CGI at all. The action is pretty entertaining, if you can understand what's going on. And the movie is pretty unique in terms of story. And by unique I mean it's structured in the most bizarre way possible. Watch this movie if you want a headache when it's over."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off I haven't read any of the source material or seen the pearlman films in years so my knowledge of the source material is limited. However I can comment that the script is just so bad, with very cliche lines and moments. The acting from a lot of the supporting cast is quite poor as well with a noticeably poor English accent from Daniel Dae Kim. The comedy missed more than it hit and felt like it was trying to hard. There was a ridiculous amount of exposition that just bored me that kept coming from characters (particularly Ian mcshane, was probably 80% of his script). There was a hell of a lot of violence, I expected that and it was quite fun to watch but perhaps a bit too excessive and unnecessary at times. I give it a 5 because it isn't all bad, David harbour as hellboy was absolutely brilliant and carried the rest of the cast as well as I there was some nice action set pieces and choreography throughout (I particularly liked a one-shot like scene at the end). The cgi was a mixed bag, with some scenes looking good but some scenes at the end particularly laughably bad. Overall this film is quite poor and I don't recommend you see it in cinemas and spend money, perhaps wait till your drunk at home with some friends and watch it on tv or Netflix or whatever. That'll be more of a appropriate viewing experience"

        "review_detailed_main": "A new remake made with nice panache based on the known comicbook , here the central figure is a grouchy, ironical, gun-toting half-human devil with a giant right arm and woman problems, being caught up between the worlds of the human race and supernatural . A thinking person's creature graced with incredible force and irony. Hellboy : David Balfour, is son of a fallen angel who came to our world in 1944 as a result of a mythical and magical ritual presided by Rasputin, the famous Russian monk . As our bouncing friend crawled into this world from another dimension during WWII. As the occultists of the third Reich invoked the demon from the hell, but then he fell into the claws of the American military. As Hellboy began to serve them by protecting the world from horrible and weird threats. Heartful horror is Neil Marshall's stock in trade with lots of noisy action, battles, thrills, chills and abundant special effects. There Hellboy is assigned to a dangerous mission, being sent to Great Bretain and fighting an eternal evil that currently manifiests itself in the form of Merlin's wife, Nimue : Milla Jovovich .As Hellboy meets face to face the heinous magician woman carrying out a lethal confrontation. Along the way Hellboy is supported by other colleagues from the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense and friends, such as Alice Monaghan : Sasha Lane, Major Ben Daimio : Daniel Dae Kim, Lady Hatton : Sophie Okanedo and his doctor, adopted father Ian McShane .As they battle an ominous witch who awakes from ancient times.\n\nStars David Harbour as Hellboy whose interpretation is similar the former ones played by Ron Perlman. David plays him as an anti-hero, a blue-collar guy, happier eating and joking that fighting evil. This wisecracking, cigar-chomping hunk role results to be a crossover among Humphrey Bogart, Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood. The film rips through an opening prologue explaining his origin. Relishing absurdities and incoherences, filmmaker get on with the business of fast and furious amusement, racking up sequences with breathtaking set pieces against elaborate, urban-occult backdrops. This is third retelling , former ones directed by Guillermo del Toro : \"Hellboy\" 2004 with Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, John Hurt, Karl Roden, Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor, Doug Jones and \"Hellboy, The Golden Army\" 2008 with Perlman, Selma Blair, Luke Goss, James Dodd, John Alexander , Seth McFarlane.\n\nDirector Marshall fuses the fabulous imagination by means of several monsters and the irreverent wit and comicbook action of Hellboy. As this great red-skinned, trenchcoated hero is pitched into a class between adopted human world and an underworld of trolls, fairies, witches and all of them fighting againt a giant warhog, and a witch bent on vengeance .There is also a heartful plea for bio and cultural diversity.\n\nIt contains a colorful and glimmer cinematography by Lorenzo Senatore. As well as moving and thrilling musical score by Benjamin Wallfisch. The motion picture produced by Milennium Films was well directed by Neil Marshall, though it has some flaws and gaps, being justly inferior to two previous renditions. Marshall is good Brit craftsman, expert on action, sci-fi and terror movies as Dog soldiers, The descent, Doomsday, Tales of Halloween, The reckoning. And he has directed episodes of notorious series as Constantine, Game of thrones, Timeless, Hannibal, Westworld, Lost in space. Rating 5.5/10. Passable and acceptable recounting."

And goddamn send it back from wence it came. There is so much wrong here, its puzzling. From a pure story structure, the film is an absolute mess. Yeah, i understand you have to cover a lot of territory to introduce people not familiar with the rich universe created by Mike Mignolia but christ, not like this. Don't rush Hellboys origins through a quick 2 minute flashback. It requires its own fleshed out scene or you know, just don't include it in."

The weird giant monsters were one of the best parts, but I feel like there should have been more time dedicated to this.\n\nI would have given a higher score but I didn't really like the blood and gore so much, and there was a lot of it towards the end. Also, some of the graphics were a bit unconvincing at times. I also think they could have reduced the overall time to an hour and a half because it was a bit slow in the beginning.\n\nWe also got to know Hell Boy's origin which was interesting. I came into this thinking it was a sequel but it was really a prequel. But, overall the acting was superb and the monsters and creatures were creepy as hell, pardon the pun.

Don't get me wrong, this is not an entirely bad film, in fact, if the Del Toro movies didn't exist, I would have probably rated this film a lot higher. But they do, and this is lacking in comparison. I quite enjoyed the fact most of it was set in the UK, and didn't really find issue with the CGI, something a lot of people have criticised. But it has to be said that some of the acting was terrible and hammy. The character development was almost none existent. And Ian McShane was just soooooo camp, as was Milla Jovovich.\n\nThe bottom-line is, yeah this is an ok film, but nowhere near as good as the Del Toro movies. I'm not sure if this was the setup for a Netflix etc, type TV series, which actually could work a lot better than a movie. Oh well. 6 stars and I'm being generous with that score."

Forget Ron Perlman (I know it hurts but bear with me)\nMake some pop corn, or get any other preferred snacks on hand.\nSwitch your brains off. No, no deep thinking.\nSit back, relax and enjoy the movie, like you'd read a comic book.\n\n\nDavid Harbour does an excellent job playing Hellboy. He gives the character the new kind of depth which greatly differs from Perlman's work, BUT as I suggested earlier, forget Perlman - and watch as Harbour breathes life to new Hellboy.\n\nOther good things in this film; acting, puns (which, thank Gods, are dry as heck, but still fresher than your standard Hollywood jokes), nicely done characters - extending to the monsters - and music.\n\nWhat could've been better? CGI, definitely. And sound mixing - I mean, come on, you got the main battle going, and mixer isn't going all out with the bass and boom?\n\nSo. A cool action movie, maybe not for those seeking the award-winning story line, but for us who settle for a fun movie night with friends and/or family."

Due to preposterous plot, half cooked character development and lackluster acting by most of the characters this movie is a dull despite of lots of violence and gore.\n\nThe movie starts with an interesting flashback and gives you a glimpse that you going to witness another funfilled joyride but the expectations starts crashing as the movie progress. The movie had some interesting sub plots which starts igniting the interest in the movie but as soon as you interest starts developing you gets served with action.\n\nThe acting department is saved only by Harbour and McShane and they were atmost loyal and dedicated with their job. Jovovich in the role of a menacing queen is major disappointing. There were lots of expectations from her character but doesn't quite brings it. Dim and Lane were also average.\n\nScreenplay of the movie is uneven and despite of lots of violence and gore the movie the movie can't keep you hold for long. Background music was good and VFX were good.\n\nIt seems that the main agenda of Marshall was to serve you with lots of action, violence, blood and gore and if it was the sole agenda then he is quite successful but if we talk about movie as a whole then this movie is majorly disappointing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hellboy has come in for a lot of flack, rumours of production problems, on set arguments and rewrites during filming. It has also been lambasted by fans of the two earlier movies who wanted the (at that point) 69 year old Ron Perlman to return to the role with original director Guillermo del Toro. Anyone who has watched the first two honestly, must agree that they aren't masterpieces. The first was a stylish hot mess and the second, while much better, wasn't perfect either. This third outing for the Dark Horse comic book character is a reboot and the character is supposed to be younger, angrier and less sure of his heroic path. He takes on an ancient evil, the witch Nimue, who is intent on bringing the demons and monsters forced into hiding by mankind back into the light. It's fun, the plot moves as breakneck pace, exploring the world of Hellboy through the BRPD agency tasked with protecting the world, regular, blissfully unaware humans, monsters living just outside their view and arrogant, rich white men who see monster hunting as modern day fox hunting. It's all entertaining, the language is coarse and the action is bloody. It's also bloody fun, better than Hellboy's first outing and at least as good as Golden Army. It's not going to win any awards but it's worth your time if you like violent comic book fare. David Harbour is good as Hellboy, Ian McShane and Milla Jovovich always offer solid performances. Sasha Lane and Daniel Dae Kim are solid supporting characters."

As a casual fan of the comic books, I enjoyed the movie overall. I far preferred it to the Ron Perlman version, though I didn't hate those either. David Harbour is far better suited to play Hellboy, and his acting really helps carry the film. Visually, most of it looked great. There were a couple of moments that featured poor looking cgi, like a short shot of baby Hellboy and the creepily erotic Cheetah. Other than that, visuals were pretty fantastic. The violence was over the top and heavily featured, but that's what I expected from a proper R rated take on the comic. The scores were well suited for the scenes they accompanied. All in all I had a lot of fun watching this rendition of the franchise, and I hope David Harbour has the opportunity to reprise his role again in the future."

I guess it just felt like less than a decade.\n\nI was sceptical for sure, but when I finally saw it, I found myself surprisingly well entertained. Even dispite having some, or many aesthetic dissentments with it's odd style of choice.\n\nIt's hard to understand for instance the director's tasteless fetish for compulsive repetition of eye-poking graphics and the cheap-ugly makeup effects for the baddies. You find yourself guessing if he'd been watching early Evil Dead's and some old, campy Stephen King-adaptations with a bit too serious fandom, or something. And if so, how's it supposed to fit here?\n\nHaving said that, there turned out to be still plenty of good action, a multitude of funny creatures drawn from history of fiction, combined with quite intriguing story developement (that would sadly turn out to be build up for nothing, since this was clearly meant to be just a first episode in a series that finally didn't happen) and enjoyable acting, at least.\n\nThere's been a lot to handle for the director as there is for the viewer (in terms of story material with all the possible sidetracks etc.) and it seemed somewhere in the halfway like the pruduction value, or maybe the director's interest in the tale was getting a bit stale. (The scene in the Merlin's tomb, to be exact, seemed to be visually from a different scale of production; it looked like TV.) Nevertheless, the pace got it's drive back after that.\n\nWhen the expectations were no more than for action, creatures and a joke or two, I think I got what I wanted.\n\nAnd the action was somewhat inventive, the creatures really well made (the one's that were'nt just bad cosplay-makeup), and the jokes were in line with the already established spirit of the Hellboy-character (perhaps this time underlining more of the character's juvenile nature and playing with it intentionally) And I would've watched the sequal too, if there was one."

Even then I think they could have just continued on the series but a reboot it was with Neil Marshall at the helm. Marshall made waves with The Descent but hasn't really done a lot of note since then. While I don't think this film is as bad as people have been saying, its still not very good and pales in comparison to its predecessors which were able to do it better.\n\nThe film shows our favorite half demon, hornless superhero fighting forces of the underworld. An ancient sorceress returns and wrecks havoc after being locked away and Hellboy recruits a team of companions to stop her before the world is taken over by her forces of evil. Ian McShane who is ever excellent also co stars. My favorite part is the inclusion of Sasha Lane who I loved in American Honey. I hope to see her in much more in the future.\n\nThe film looks nice most of the times. Its much more bloody than its earlier entries which may please fans. Some of the monsters, especially the ones towards the end have nice unique designs and feel and look terrifying in all honesty. Then again we have the morphing into a CGI jaguar which looks appallingly bad. I'd say overall the design for characters is good but sometimes the effects are bad. I don't mind the comic relief or David Harbour as Hellboy but the story has too many set pieces which causes a loss of interest.\n\nThe film lacks the magic and mysticism of the universe that del Toro created. The film feels soulless at times and doesn't excel at making an impact. I also have King Arthur/Excalibur fatigue, especially because Kid Who Would Be King just came out. Overall, I can see the effort made by Marshall but this reboot may not have been necessary. I don't know the comics or this universe well enough to understand what the post credit scenes meant as well.\n\n6/10"

Seemingly a sad ending for a character and universe that had a lot more still yet to give.\n\n2 mute monks out of 5"

The guy was mostly okay, but the girl was terrible. It was also FULL of those little things that I tend to notice which take me out of a movie, such as an extra who is supposed to be cheering, but looks more like they are lifting invisible 10 lb. weights in each hand, or the other extra who is looking right into the camera. HOW could the people responsible for editing these films, or anyone involved who watched the full cut not care enough to catch things like that?

        "review_title": "Fun, Dark, Comic Book Film",
        "review_detailed_main": "I was intrigued to check this film out as I enjoyed the Guillermo Del Toro version and though it was fun. When I heard this one was going to be hard R, I figured they would be able to ramp up the horror more which is something I'm always down for. I was also interested when I heard that David Harbour would be playing Hellboy, as I'm a fan of him from Stranger Things. The synopsis is Hellboy is caught between the worlds of the supernatural and the human, battles an ancient sorceress bent on revenge.\n\nWe kick off back in the dark ages in England. It is stated that King Arthur (Mark Stanley) was real. The armies of man are fighting against the supernatural. With him is Merlin (Brian Gleeson), his wizard, as they go against its queen, Nimue (Milla Jovovich) the Blood Queen. She is defeated and her body is cut into pieces. They are sealed in boxes that only a priest can open and hidden around the United Kingdom.\n\nIt then shifts to the present. We are in Tijuana where Hellboy is looking for a colleague. We hear his father, Professor Broom (Ian McShane) telling him to forget about the agent and to come home. Hellboy was friends with him and wants him back. It turns out though that the vampires Esteban Ruiz (Mario de la Rosa) was investigating got to him.\n\nWhen Hellboy returns to their base, he learns of his next mission. He is going to England to help out an order as they hunt giants. Things aren't really as they seem though. They reveal Hellboy's past and how he came to be with Professor Broom. They also tell him the legend of Nimue. Along the way, behind the scenes, a creature is collecting her pieces to bring her back. The creature wants his revenge against Hellboy, but Nimue has other plans for him. It involves waking up his true nature and revealing the truth of his past.\n\nNow I will admit, coming into this film I heard mixed things about it. Some liked it and others were complaining about it. This film was exactly what I thought it was going to be. It feels like an R rated, big budget, horror, comic book film, which is exactly what Hellboy is. There were some things that I really liked that they did with it too.\n\nThe first thing for me was that I liked that they incorporated the myth of King Arthur into this. Now I've never read any of the comics so I don't know if they have it in there or it was just used for this film. I think this is really interesting though, because it gives perspective to certain things that could happen. Going from that, we really get the concept of self-fulfilling prophecies. No matter what people in this film say or try to do, they could be pushing Hellboy to fulfill his prophecy. It makes you wonder if he still would or you are not giving him enough credit to do the right thing. I dig this idea.\n\nSomething else with this film is the reason that Nimue wants to destroy humanity. Part of it is for revenge for what happened to her. That is completely understandable. She is angered though when she is watching television to see what we have become. I'm partially guilty as I love some bad reality television every now and then. It really boils down to humans are trash and we need to be wiped out. As horrible as it sounds, I can't really argue against her logic here.\n\nI really liked that in this version, they did away with the sappy love story. I get that we all want to find our one person, which is great. It really makes Hellboy whiney and I'm glad that it was gone. I actually think for this film, it tightens it up without it. Now Nimue has a plan for Hellboy, which is fine, but it is for much different reasons. I also liked that they briefly give us how Hellboy came into this world like in the previous version, which includes the Nazis, Grigori Rasputin (Markos Rounthwaite) and my favorite character, Von Krupt (Joel Harlow).\n\nThis brings me to the pacing of the film, which I think is good. The film for being 2 hours, didn't really feel like it. We keep getting action and things happening which I'm a big fan of. The only issue I had is that there is something like three flashbacks to fill in back-story. I think it is good to show us things and not tell us, but it did get to be a bit much. This being a reimagining of the graphic novels, I understand why it was done to get us to speed with the lore. I thought the ending was good, it really reveals the character and nature of Hellboy. It does set itself up for a sequel if they want with some mid and post credits scenes.\n\nTo the acting, I think that Harbour is solid as Hellboy. In the previous version and its sequel, I liked Ron Perlman. When I heard Harbour would take over the role, I wasn't worried. He shows enough of the sarcasm that you need for the character from Stranger Things and it played well. He did a fine job in this role. Jovovich was also solid as the villain. She seems menacing and it is an interesting role for her. It is not physically demanding like a lot of ones she's taken in the past. I thought that Sasha Lane who plays Alice Monaghan and Daniel Dae Kim as Major Ben Daimio were both solid. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well, with a special shout out to Stephen Graham who voices Grugach.\n\nNow to something I've been waiting to cover even while I was sitting in the theater. The effects of this film are mostly CGI. For those who know me, I love practical effects. We do get some of that. I thought the look of Hellboy was good and even the Hell King version was solid. There is a lot of CGI though. Some of it is really good, I will give it that. There were some really bad aspects to it as well. A good bit of this came from blood for sure where it wasn't good. There is just so much CGI in this. I came to expect it for sure. I will say that the film is shot really well though.\n\nThe last thing to cover before wrapping this up would be the soundtrack of the film. It is used in some pretty creative ways actually. From the Rock you Like a Hurricane in Spanish to some other rock music used during fight scenes. I think it was used pretty well and I actually thought it helped out the film to match the feeling of the scenes.\n\nNow with that said, I had fun with this film. Do I think it is great? Not by any stretch. It actually has some deeper feelings in it that I wasn't expecting and I liked that. The story has some interesting concepts to it and the acting I thought was solid. The pacing of the film really moves along at a good clip with a solid ending. I don't think we needed as many flashbacks as we got though. There are a lot of effects, some good and some that are bad. The soundtrack of the film was solid as well. I don't think everyone will like this. If you like comic book films, I think you'll enjoy this as it really feels like a film like that. This just incorporates a lot more horror elements for sure. I do think this is a good film and it really is just fun."

The only two positive things I can give this movie was David Harbor as Hellboy even though he wasn't nearly as great as Ron Perlman was from the two previous Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy films and the Baba Yaga scene. Otherwise this film is a complete misfire. The fact that we got this pointless and bad Reboot instead of Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy 3 with Ron Perlman is really depressing. Shame on you Lionsgate and Millennium Films, SHAME ON YOU!!!\n\nIt gets a 3 out of 10 from me."

It doesn't work too well as a reboot or as new \"origin story\" nor is it a satisfying adaptation of any one single Hellboy book(or storyline). It manages to have so many different things from Hellboy mythos in it, but mixes them up and generally doesn't stay too true to the source material(some aspects are more intact than others!) so it's a very mixed bag.. that is amplified by the fact that the movie itself feels more like a combination of scenes and set pieces rather a coherent story. Sometimes the jumps from scene to scene are very abrupt and fast, meaning it's hard to get invested or at times even truly follow the story! This also means there is no downtime, and no real buildup to scenes that should have it. The jokes are very hit and miss, but retain that Hellboy feel so it's okay. It could and should have been better, but it can be enjoyed as a fun \"B-Movie\" and in a way that's what Hellboy is supposed to be.. anyway it's very hard to see this getting a sequel, both cause it's not all that good and also cause they kinda threw everything at us and there is not much room for upping the stakes!"

I love the actor that play Hellboy.I recommend this movie.Dont listen all these critics.

After seeing it and now looking upon all the negative score this movie got received already i can say - movie was not bad at all. I mean i did not expected anything from it to be honest, but it did surprised me (kinda in a positive way) that it was bloody and was definitely rated R - this i didn't knew as well. The movie was very fast paced - there is barely a second to breath and there were some very original ideas with creatures in it - like Baba Yaga and some other i won't spoil.\n\nOverall, i kinda enjoyed \"Hellboy\" on a dumb Friday evening tonight in a movie theater. What i'm a bit surprised of how negative it appears this movie score everywhere. Maybe we saw a different movie, but without any expectations i was pretty entertained by this new, bloody, gory and pretty brutal flick."

        "review_detailed_main": "This reboot was a long-awaited project for many longtime Hellboy fans, especially those like me, middle-aged people who have followed the comics since the beginning and couldn't wait to finally see the true-to-canon experience that Hellboy creator Mike Mignola promised to deliver.\n\nAnd deliver he does, for the most part. A number of characters important to the series and loved by fans receive a good amount of screen time. The practical effects are plentiful and extravagant, a sure treat for admirers of the craft. Virtual fountains of blood and gore interspersed with wisecracked comments and sprinkles of absurd humor, hallmarks of the comics and Mignola's style in general, are abundant throughout the film. While all these things seem to be really shaping the film up to be a hit, it unfortunately falls short in some respects.\n\nDavid Harbour's Hellboy, though a very well done performance overall, lacks the broodiness of the comics and Guillermo del Toro's adaptation and gives the impression of a frat boy looking for the next good time. On the flip side, Ron Perlman's depiction in del Toro's films, while somewhat emotionally mature, still knows he has a job to do and a dedication to it. Harbour's Hellboy largely comes off like he simply goes unwillingly where he is sent, and there's no real heart in his work.\n\nIan McShane, though underrated as an actor, fails to capture the audience as Professor Broom, or even a fatherly figure. This seems to be partly due to the fact that the dialogue scenes with McShane and Harbour together are fairly superficial, and also partly because there doesn't seem to be a tangible chemistry between the two in their on-screen presence. In kind, Milla Jovovich as Nimue doesn't convey the same menace as Nimue in the comics. For a 5th century witch bent on revenge, she seems rather tired of it all, a little bit too demure in actions and voice to really convince the viewer that she's as much of a threat as the characters are telling us the whole way through. Even when she's actively melting people's faces off it seems casual. These lackluster impressions may not be a consequence of the actors' abilities, but due to the script and direction. Thankfully, Daniel Dae-Kim and Troy Jones & Emma Tate as Ben Daimio and Baba Yaga respectively, make up for these shortfalls with performances that satisfyingly capture the spirit of their characters.\n\nThe soundtrack had a chance to be a perfect compliment to the visual effects, but it felt somewhat inconsistent. With orchestral pieces in one scene and hair metal in the next, it didn't have a good flow and as a result ended up dulling scenes that could have been enjoyed more.\n\nFinally, some of the character introductions were very rushed and seemed to follow a pattern of a character practically being pushed into a scene, dialogue that served as an obvious segue into a short backstory, and then quickly back to the present scene with them running off to fight monsters. For those acquainted with the comics, this isn't much of an issue but for newcomers to the Hellboy franchise these hurried introductions will leave them a bit confused and wondering exactly why some of these people are so important and how it is that they seem to have become such fast friends with the other protagonists.\n\nWhile the decadent visuals scratch the itch for fans who have been anticipating the reboot, the shortcomings cripple the film and keep it from reaching its full potential."

The audience wAnted to see diversity and Helboy delivered. A pretty epic story. I don't know if it's actually based on one of the Helboy comics but I have to say I loved the imagery. Del Turo's Helboy brought Mike Mignola's pages to life, this new director, bought in his own artist and it was good. Very comic book and at the same time very Heavy Metal, so that works for me.

Absolutely no redeeming qualities that this movie possesses. I saw people walk out of the theatre. I wanted to do so myself, but I have a personal rule, that if I walk out of a movie, I lose all rights to talk trash about it and I really wanted to warn everyone about this one without breaking my personal rule.\n\nSo, there you have it.

Even Gremlins has a 2 second feature. It's a feast of badly presented and incoherent fanfare that is only useful for fanboys with no sense of cinematic value. It was fun to watch while I was cooking and reading a book on the side. Maybe if I was 12 it could have been better.

David Harbour does a fine job all things considered. And there may have been a moment or two where it did sort of work. I'll give props to this movie for at least trying to go in a different direction that Del Toro's previous films. This one goes for that R rating, tries to go for a more Horror focused route. But ironically, the Del Toro films (unsurprisingly) show more maturity and dark moments than this movie. At the end of the day, this movie is a mess that isn't worth the watch."

You have obviously never seen a really bad movie and do not understand what one looks like.\n\nHere's what a real review looks like. The story itself is what you would expect from a retelling of an origin story, but feels rushed at times. I would have like to have seen more meaningful action and had some scenes cut and replaced with extended scenes of the more main story. The main story overall is good though. The dialogue does leave something to be desired, but is really not all bad. A few cringeworthy jokes mixed with a handful of truly funny moments.\n\nWhile I do miss Ron as Hellboy, David Harbour does a very serviceable job in the role. Honestly, after the first 20 minutes, he becomes the new Hellboy in my eyes. The rest of the character's acting are all above average but I wish that they would have cast a different actor for Alice. The effects are nicely done but there is a disparity between the practical and digital effects. The practical effects are amazing, while the cgi is still above average.\n\nSee, that's how you write a review. Simple, huh? You're welcome to disagree with me on these points, but rating this film a 1 is ridiculous. 'I paid money to watch this movie and it didn't quite live up to my expectations so I'm rating it a 1' isn't a review, it's just whining from a \"mentally capable person\" with their head in \"the clouds\" whose never seen an honestly bad movie in their life."

Marshall has a credible backround when it comes to gory, gritty, rated R films, but this one was a miss on every level - it really felt like one big issue. There was no set story, everything felt so cluttered, jammed together, and improvised.\n\nThe screenplay by Andrew Crosby wasn't very intriguing, or funny. This movie was gifted the R rating for the gore, and language, and they did not capitalize on that! All they gave us was some corny, inconsistent humor.\n\nI genuinely feel bad for David Harbour because he does try his best, but Ron Perlman trademarked the Hellboy character - Harbour even said himself that he didn't even want to do the part at first because there's nothing wrong with it. The only real issue I had with him, is that sometimes his dialogue was muffled, and tough to make out. I wasn't a fan of what they did with Professor Broom. His character is sincere and intelligent, and in this film, he's kind of arrogant. For the rest of the supportive cast, I particularly didn't care for anyone's preformance - they were all mediocre at best. These characters lacked the Del Toro feel and style.\n\nThe action was very big, gritty, and gory. Some scenes were fun, but there was a lot of inconsistencies to say the least, with Hellboy's strength and power, and not for nothing, whoever designed Hellboy's rock hand, should be fired immediately.\n\nOverall, I can see where Marshall was trying to go with this, but it was very messy and a lot to take in. I'm very upset to say I really didn't enjoy this film."

Though I'm not sure if it was the first, it was certainly the first in my book that I saw an awesome combination of fantasy and the superhero genre. I didn't see the first movie. I think it had to do with my original perception that the idea was just too weird. I'm not sure what got me to see this (it might have been Comic Con or something else), but enjoyed the excellent special effects, the feeling that the fantasy elements fit in well, and Ron Perlman's perfect casting as the big red boy himself.\n\nI'm aware he's based off a Dark Horse comic and that it's been running for a while. I also heard that director Guillermo del Toro had wanted to get another sequel made, but it got canceled. It would make sense that another production company would want to come in and try rebooting it. While I've been an advocate in getting more original content in Hollywood, I am open to new interpretations. So let's see if the new reboot of Hellboy can spark that same fire.\n\nHellboy (played by David Harbour) goes to Mexico to find a friend, only to find him a vampire, and being forced to kill him. Though told the world will end, Hellboy dismisses this and returns to B.P.R.D. headquarters where his adoptive father Trevor Bruttenholm (played by Ian McShane) assigns him to England. This turns out to be a Hunting Club who need his assistance in going after three giants as part of a tradition. Though he's ambushed by the hunters, he escapes and defeats the giants. He's saved by his father, but it's revealed that while gone, someone had stolen remains of an ancient witch named Nimue.\n\nNimue (played by Mila Jovovich) is resurrected and seeks to use Hellboy to start the apocalypse. In order to find her, he's introduced to a young woman Alice (played by Sasha Lane), who has magical abilities, and an agent Ben (played by Daniel Dae Kim), who can turn into a jaguar. They attempt to capture Nimue, but fail to do so when she appeals to his frustrations on his own humanity and struggle being a part demon. Though Hellboy gets a chance to understand both Alice and Ben, he knows that he's vulnerable and fighting Nimue will take a lot of will power to stop her magic.\n\nAs much as I hoped this movie would be fun, Hellboy feels like a product that wasn't finished before release. It has acting problems, story problems, editing problems, and even special effects problems. It's not a complete failure as there are some really good things here. One such is David Harbour as Hellboy. Though I'll miss Ron Pearlman, Harbour does a great job playing his crass and unforgiving personality that I rarely see from screen heroes. He seems like a guy you'd want to hear stories from at the bar he drinks from.\n\nNone of that would have shined through without the makeup work, which also looked good. I'm sure the production was more tempted to use digital effects (I'll get to that), but it's nice to see that good old-fashioned prosthetics and time that brings this character back to life. Now only if he was in a better movie.\n\nThe rest of the material ranges from okay to poor. The other actors, even Ian McShane and Mila Jovovich, aren't given much to do beyond yelling or looking intimidating. I can't blame this on them as they, along with a lot of characters, have little personality or development. Even when them movie forces this (they'll be moments where they just met and then their close in the next scene), it feels like either something was lost in the script or the editing bay. I'm guessing it was cut to try to emphasize the action and effects. The action itself is serviceable, but the R rating doesn't add much. It's one of those things where I forgot what I saw after I saw it. The effects, which are mostly digital, have a tendency to look fake or not rendered in time. Because of this, it feels like Hellboy is fighting a bunch of video game characters, similar to the climax of Justice League.\n\nI'll give this four Hellboy comics out of ten. At best, it'll service those that want some okay action and a good Hellboy himself. At worst, it lacks anything that memorable that can't compete with Del Toro's movies. Throw this into Hell and watch the originals."

We need more of this.\n\nAs far as the action sequences go - it's very full on with plenty of gore and blood and flying body parts.\n\nIf I'd paid attention to the critics, I wouldn't have gone to see this and I would have missed out.\n\nIf I could meet the people that made this, I'd give them a hug and say \"thanks\"!

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a lot of angry people giving this 1/10. It's not that bad. A few give it 9/10, it's not that good. I'd say between 5-7 depending on what you like. It's darker in tone, closer to the comics in its violence and profanity and has more of a b-movie feel than the BDT versions. With better execution I feel this would have made it a better film than the others. With a little script work HB would be an improvement over his sanitised BDT incarnation. It is let down in too many places for that - becoming a film best watched with friends who enjoy the b-movie schtick, and can laugh at the bad bits. While you won't be sending prizes, you probably won't begrudge the time watching it. Some of the FX are very good, some are terrible - the \"giant fight\" is some of the worst CGI/choreography I've seen in years. Yet on balance there's enough to keep you going. Equally, some of the acting is very weak, but mainly it's good enough with the odd strong moment. The dialogue is predictable and basic. It is fairly constant action, and little character, aside from some rather clunky expositional backstory. But it hangs together. It isn't incomprehensible as some reviews claim. The narrative is basic \"oh no, evil is rising\", and the hero sets off to fix it. In two places we snap forward rather abruptly - one where a journey takes place over the character telling HB where to go, the other on his return. It's a little jarring but the journey would have been dull and pointless to watch. There are one or two 'side-stories', which tie into the main narrative. But again, it's not a \"mash up of various tales\", it's easy enough to follow and coherent. They clearly want a sequel, as it builds to that - which alas is where another weakness lies - as one of the main characters 'develops' in a horribly unconvincing way. They'll need plenty of acting and choreography training if there's ever a sequel. I'd recommend being a bit squiffy or fairly bored - it's not a film you'll watch again, nor love I doubt - but it doesn't deserve all the hate."

        "review_detailed_main": "Critics banished it, audiences failed to connect with it and production was apparently a nightmare. Some may say this unnecessary reboot was doomed from the start. But you know what? I went in with an open mind. I wanted everyone to be wrong. The feeling of being proved totally incorrect is an overwhelming sensation. Yet, unfortunately, this film is a bloody travesty. Shambolic as soon as McShane started slurring his narration as if he was inebriated. I shall endeavour to find some positives however. Just bare with me. The blood queen has been dismembered to which a hog-like fairy scours England finding the boxes to which her limbs are stored in. It's up to Hellboy to stop this from happening whilst also not touching Excalibur and something to do with a wild hunt.\n\nTo put it simply, a catastrophic mess. I mean, where to even begin with this? I suppose the main culprit is the script, considering it acts as the nervous system for the film's entirety. Cosby's screenplay draws inspiration from various comics that Hellboy originated from, yet presents them as nods for fanboys as opposed to integrating them into a cohesive story. 'Hellboy in Mexico' lasts for about two minutes whereas 'The Wild Hunt' never seems to end. All of these sub-plots acting as distractions from the primary storyline which, firstly acts as uninspired fan service, and secondly loses all focus from the \"my name is Queen Nimue, and I worked for the underworld\" (subtle Jovovich reference...) central plot. It's acceptable to appeal to hardcore fans of a source material, but without any integral structure or engaging dialogue it will lose its accessibility, consequently attracting no one.\n\nSpeaking of dialogue, some of those lines were like having a stake to the heart. \"Google translate that for me\". Oh hunny, no one says that and no one has ever said that. Zero jokes/quips landed. A big fat zero. And apparently everyone in England shouts expletives in every frickin' sentence. I don't know what they frickin' mean, we don't frickin' swear constantly...! Frick! Characters, like Lobster Johnson, jump into the story for one second (with no introduction) and then never mentioned again. Even going as far as recreating Hellboy's origin story to which we saw in Del Toro's superior adaptation. Unfavourably comparing adaptations is something I try to avoid, especially when neither are masterpieces. But damn, watching this makes Del Toro's seem like the 'Citizen Kane' of Hellboy films. Atleast he understood the characters and the intricate relationships between them all.\n\nMarshall went for spectacle and unsurprisingly backfired big time. The visual effects were not up to standard, despite some excessive gore which did grant a minuscule amount of charm. The soundtrack was obnoxious. And the editing was haphazard, especially during the Baba Yaga fight sequence. Wait, who or what even is she!?\n\nSurely the acting can save this disastrous flick? Ehh. Wrong again. Harbour has good intentions, but is directed poorly by Marshall. His physical prowess suits the character of Hellboy perfectly, but when he acts as a juvenile teenager (just so that he differs from Perlman's interpretation) and literally shouts every word, he loses the essence of the titular character. Absent of any emotion, this film takes a major step back for the hero, yet Harbour isn't the worst actor. Jovovich, my sweet sweet Milla, is given nothing and instantly becomes a forgettable villain. Dae Kim was putting on a British accent I think? I don't even think he knows. But the worst performance has to go to Monaghan who was insufferably irritating. Just get rid of her. I will however appreciate Big Mo from 'Eastenders' and the chip shop \"Codswallop\". But that's it. That's where I draw the line for positives.\n\nOh, and bring a notepad. Because the amount of exposition and heavy-handed storytelling is ludicrous. In fact, practically every line is used to further plot and not the characters. An R-rated Hellboy reboot sounds good on paper, and I wanted to love it. Yet when a story is so incomprehensibly boring, bolstered by shoddy performances, writing and editing, it's very difficult to find any redeeming qualities. Had this been the first adaptation and released in the mid naughties, it still would've been received poorly. A bad film is a bad film and Hellboy is just that. The fire has gone and the underworld of Hollywood has claimed its next intellectual property, which coincidentally is this year's worst film thus far. Great!"

        "review_detailed_main": "In Director Neil Marshall's spirited action fantasy \"Hellboy\", adoptive Father Professor Broom, played with whimsical gravitas by Ian McShane tells his Son, \"I wanted you to be the best you...\" David Harbour's Hellboy, the hulking prosthetically horned, red skinned beast, acknowledges his Father's love in tears. No spoilers here. After all, Dad is human. Hellboy, well he's some other distinction.\n\nThe dramatic arc resonates genuine poignancy. Yet, seems so out of context, like much of \"Hellboy\". \"Hellboy\" often gets lost in the narrative abyss. Based on Mike Mignola's source material - Dark Horse Comic Book \"Hellboy\", Neil and Screenwriter Andrew Cosby reboot the beloved 2004 movie starring Ron Perlman as a narrative quandary. David Harbour embodies irreverent sense of humor and charisma in wonderful homage to Ron Perlman's Hero beast.\n\nBut like I told my buddy Ron, after we both watched the movie, \"That was all over the place.\" Euphemistically, \"Hellboy\" is an unfocused mess. WTF? Too bad. Not just for us, but also for the cast. Beautiful commanding Milla Jovovich is beguiling evil as The Blood Queen, Nimue. Hers along with David's Hellboy inspire strong performances from feeble material.\n\nIn the prologue set in 1540 or so: Omniscient sorceress Nimue prepares to unleash her deadly plague on the world; thus, ending humankind forever. However, she's vanquished by stalwart King Arthur, played by Mark Stanley, and sorcerer Merlin, played by Brian Gleeson. To dissipate her immense power they literally chop Nimue into pieces, foreshadowing Neil's macabre resurrection visual, and bury her parts at the ends of the Earth.\n\nHellboy works for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) fighting the \"dark forces\" like Giants. He's a superhero of sorts. He has great speed, strength, and fighting skills. He also possesses a huge mysterious metallic right hand.\n\nProfessor Broom and Hellboy work together at the BPRD. He virtually raised his son there. Returning from a mission, Broom gently grooms the horns on his son's brow. As corny as that looks, it's sublime. Regardless of blood, they're family. They love each other unconditionally. That is the singular saving grace of \"Hellboy\".\n\nEventually, conspiracy consumes. Predictably, the evil Nimue returns from wherever, and seeks revenge. Surprisingly, she seeks Hellboy as well. Although, handsome is not Hellboy's strong suit, Nimue is passionately drawn to the muscular red beast. Perhaps, it's his wry sense of humor? Maybe, it's Hellboy's lineage according to eerie villain Lady Huttom, who reprises Hellboy's origins and discovery by Professor Broom.\n\nMeanwhile, to save the world from Nimue's apocalyptic intentions, Hellboy joins forces with Alice, played by young spirited Sasha Lane, and soldier Major Ben Daimio, played by calm strong Daniel Dae Kim. It's on!\n\nThe bond of Hellboy and Nimue make \"Hellboy\" watchable, which isn't saying all that much. David and Milla have engaging chemistry. They're both strong, resilient, and don't take themselves too seriously. On the other hand, \"Hellboy\" does. Rather at times Neil Marshall doesn't have a clue what kind of story he wants to tell.\n\nThe visual effects in \"Hellboy\" are spectacular. Gruesome images of shredded and exploding flesh populate the screen. Then there are whimsical visuals of the Nimue's limbs sown back together or some vicious Giant swatting Hellboy like an insect.\n\n\"Hellboy\" occurs as a funny, bloody narrative mess. Not in a good way. Again, too bad for David Harbour and Milla Jovovich. Really, too bad for us."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Hellboy (2019)' is actually worse than I could have ever imagined. It's a real mess. Its plot is poorly constructed and its filmmaking is ill conceived. Worse still, it isn't even entertaining... like, at all. I mean, there's a brief, almost miraculous window where a few, but only a few, of the movie's many plot-threads somehow manage to come together in a relatively satisfying way. This climax is perhaps the only part of the picture that actually resembles a competent piece of story-telling, though. I do only mean \"competent\", too. It's not like the thing suddenly turns into Shakespeare. Even so, the opening stands in stark contrast to this, as it's perhaps - no joke - one of the worst things I've seen in the cinema in quite sometime. It sets the tone for a clunky, clumsy and curious experience that keeps getting worse and worse (until it somehow gets slightly better). Seriously, it's strange how bad it is. Pretty much everyone involved is capable of so much better and, as evidenced by the Del Toro efforts (which I won't compare this with), it's not like the source material is unsalvageable. To be fair, David Arbour is doing a really good job with what he has, standing out as the flick's best aspect. The other actors are doing just fine, too - even if some of them can't quite pull off the accents they're attempting. The other departments are almost all slacking, however. At least, that's how it seems in the final product which, of course, could all be down to a sloppy, maybe studio-meddled, final edit. The editing is one of the weaker aspects, feeling generally choppy in the moment and bizarrely unstructured as a whole. Several scenes happen which ought to be game-changing, but they're just forgotten about pretty much as quickly as they're introduced. Others take a long time to tell a short story, shall we say, and are often left unresolved. You'll wonder why both of these types were included in the first place. Don't even get me started on the flashbacks. Throughout it all, there's a ton of noticeable ADR - which signals some post-production fiddling. Even though it's often used to repeat unnecessary, ham-fisted exposition (yes, I said \"repeat\"), it doesn't fulfil its traditional purpose and change, or clarify, the narrative in any meaningful way. Still, I can't help but feel like what's on-screen isn't all that close to what was - originally, at least - on the page. There are enough signs, and seams, to point to this, if not quite prove it. Either way, the film doesn't feel like it's about anything - and I'm talking narrative here, never-mind theme. It meanders about, taking far too much time to linger on its hefty amounts of meaningless gore, until it sort of gets into gear towards the end. Here, not only does it have a relatively clear, beat-to-beat story, but it also gives its hero a bit of an arc. By this point, though, it's too little too late. 4/10"

I went with a friend to watch it and we both almost leave the theater after the first 15 minutes of the movie, we only stayed because we were hoping that something good happened at some moment, but we saw our hopes crushed with every minute that passed. The movie looks like a low budget fan made film (heck, I've seen fan made films way better than this), directed by someone who never saw a movie and written by someone who only read children books... and don't get me start to talk about the poor acting, the horrible CGI and the incoherent music... honestly, I don't have anything good to say about this movie. They should have made Hellboy 3, with Perlman and Del Toro instead of this monstruosity... the last movie I remember I wanted to leave the theater before the movie finished was Shyamalan's The Last Air Bender... and I would rather watch that movie again a thousand times before having to watch this movie one more time, I can't understand how that movie has a lower score than this one..."

Absolutely not but David Harbour does a compelling interpretation of Hell Boy. Solid supporting cast, flow, soundtrack and directing. Weakest part is they over complicated the story, went in to many directions and thus lost a lot of the films substance. As good as Ron Perlman's Hellboy films? Not a chance.

The trademark Hellboy sass is weak. Why the hell doesn't he ever use his awesome arm? Lameboy. Also, some of the music is just not right.\n\nThe weird: Daniel Dae Kim shouldn't pretend to have a British accent. It was cool to see him in a big movie and his acting is fine but why not just let him be himself?\n\nScenes have little to do with each other. The witch/Arthur plague throughline is scattershot. Again though: some of the scenes are really memorable but the fun is missing. There was an R rated opportunity to really go dark humor but it is just flat. Example: Baba Yaga disgustingly makes out with him and he didn't respond at all. Such weird decisions. He should have vomited on her or slapped her or done *anything*. The lack of Hellboyishness is really the throughline.\n\nThis movie had such potential. There are some sequences that are solid 10s but there are some choices that are so ADHD that it makes it really bad. I should give it 4 or 5 stars but I will give it a 6 for the genuinely awesome work intermixed in the morass."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hellboy (2019): In a pre-credits we visit Pendle Hill in 517 CE as KIng Arthur pulls a fast one on Nimue the evil Blood Queen (Mila Jovovich) and chops her into pieces ala Monty Python, her head still venting spleen as it is sealed in a casket. Her body parts are then dispersed. In the present day Hellboy (David Harbour) goes to Mexico in search of Agent Ruiz who disappeared whilst hunting Vampires. Sadly Ruiz has been turned and morphs into a Werebat style Vampire. Recalled to the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) HQ by it's Director, his adoptive father Trevor Bruttenholm (Ian McShane) he is sent to England to assist the Osiris Club, a group which performs similar functions to the BPRD. They are hunting Giants which have been raised from the earth. Meanwhile a Werehog Fairy, Gruagach (Stephen Graham) is gathering the parts of Nimue, intent on reassembling her and reactivating her powers. Nothing goes quite to plan for anyone and Hellboy soon joins up with a Psychic, Alice (Sasha Lane), whom he had saved from the Fairies as a child and Major Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim) of M11 to battle Gruagach and Nimue.\n\nThis is a reboot of Hellboy based on the comic books Darkness Calls, The Wild Hunt, The Storm and the Fury, and Hellboy in Mexico. A vein of dark humour runs through the film but it is also replete with bleak scenes. People are dismembered, decapitated, eaten by giants. Gruagach slays monks and rips out the tongue and voice box of one to use to chant a phrase. Ectoplasmic representations of the dead are summoned up by Alice, emanating from her mouth. The Osiris Clu is based in a country mansion, with panelled, book lined walls which naturally have secret doors. The M11 HQ hides behind a Fish and Chip shop front. Hellboy discovers some secrets which his father has kept from him and muses over how monsters are treated. There are many good scenes in the film but it all seems episodic and the whole is less than the sum of it's parts. Good fun and director Neil Marshall has delivered an interesting interpretation of Hellboy but not as good as the Del Toro version. 6.5/10."

I love David harbor and I had high hopes going in, but this simply not a good movie. The plot was awful, the script was worse. The wrist thing really for me is just how bad hellboy himself is, he couldn't beat up a baby, he was so feeble in this film and the comedy was sorely lacking.\n\nGuillermo del Toros version was hardly a masterpiece of cinema, but it was lightyears ahead of this mess.\n\nPeople are scoring this film a 10 out of 10, really? The film is below average at best and although there are some entertaining sequences in there, on the whole I left feeling very disappointed.\n\nThis should have and could have been amazing, but simply isn't. And all the people fooling themselves by saying it was, you're selling yourself short.\n\nThe CGI is awful too. There's a Scouse pig. I don't think I need to say anymore.\n\nWith all films the experience is very subjective, so you may love it and if you do, then I'm glad, but for me this movie fell flat on its face."

        "review_detailed_main": "The reason I wanted to watch this was seeing Hellboy with full horns, and Milla Jovovich playing evil. Apart from that, they should have let Guillermo del Toro do Hellboy 3 instead of rebooting it. While David Harbour brought a new interpretation of Hellboy, the story is much less impactful. The only good thing about the movie besides the action is Harbour's acting. The rest of the cast is bland. I am disappointed with Jovovich's villain. She was not menacing or tough at all, though she had the right look for an evil queen. Daniel Dae Kim's British accent was jarring, and Ian McShane's Professor Broom was nowhere as endearing as John Hurt's version. In short, I still prefer Guillermo del Toro's version of Hellboy, the characters are more relatable and you care for all of them: Ron Perlman's Hellboy, Selma Blair's Liz Sherman, and Doug Jones' Abe Sapien. Even the antagonists were interesting. In short, this reboot should not have happened, and even if it was a fun movie, and David Harbour was great, it did not surpass the del Toro version."

        "review_detailed_main": "Did I enjoy the 2019 version of 'Hellboy?' Er, I guess the answer is, 'It was okay.' It had all the things I looked for in a film (I don't have high standards!) and ticked all the right boxes. In that way, I can say it at least entertained me for an hour and a half. However, I already own the first two 'Hellboy' films on DVD and the main thing I came away with was wondering why I didn't just put one of them on?\n\nIf you don't know, 'Hellboy' is a comic book adaptation of a lesser-known superhero (or maybe 'anti-hero' may be a better description) where a demon is summoned into our world by those wishing to use it to conquer the world, however the forces of good stopped them and brought the child up to be a force for good - albeit a large, red, grumpy demonic-looking one.\n\nThis film's main problem is that it's just kind of pointless really. Yes, it brings a few things into the mix that are slightly different (like the origin is slightly changed if you compare the two versions), but it's not enough to warrant a remake, especially when the original was so fresh in people's minds.\n\nNow, I should point out that the original two 'Hellboy' films were not as profitable as the studio behind them would have liked, but they did have a very dedicated fanbase - a fanbase which objected to the movie that they liked being remade so soon after it had originally been conceived.\n\nSo, without the primary audience backing this version and not really having the mass market appeal like a superhero like Batman or Spiderman would, this incarnation was destined to fail - no matter how good or bad it is.\n\nI liked it, but I can't say it will leave any lasting impression on me like the first two did. I would have preferred a third instalment into the original saga than this, plus the effects were less practical make-up and creative and more just computer-generated fight scenes which were blatantly so. If you're bored and fancy a supernatural action movie then this is fine. If you're really looking to get into 'Hellboy' on screen then the first two films are the way to go."

Had the producers hired a seasoned screenwriter to help/review Cosby's final draft, this film would have been much better. It was just a convoluted mess with redundant, unnecessary, or overly long scenes. The 2 hour length felt like 3+ hours.\n\nThe humor was as lame and cliched as it gets. The constant annoying Heavy Metal/Punk music was atrocious. The vocals where so overbearing, I could barely make out the dialogue. It should have been mainly instrumental and in smaller doses. The directing was ok I guess, considering the script Neil Marshall had to work with. The acting was ok, especially from 'John Wick's' Ian McShane, but I wasn't impressed with Milla Jovovich's performance and/or character.\n\nSure the CGI wasn't the best, and I'm ok with that, as budget determines that quality, but to fail this film on a terrible script and cheese-ball music, is a shame.\n\nGuillermo del Toro's 2004 version with Ron Perlman was 1000x better - and funnier. This film is another example of \"if it ain't broken, don't fix it\". If you're going to try anyway, you better make sure you fix it much better and shinier than its predecessor.\n\nIt's a very generous 6/10 from me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Comic book movies remain the big fashion of the era, utilizing big budgets to bring the world of literature to life in ways the fanbase never imagined. With DC and Marvel combatting for supremacy, the independent studios are still trying to work their way in and get some publicity themselves. The first two installments of this movie held their own charms, but are a little outdated and thus comes this weekend's flick in the form of a modern update of the dark, mercenary comic. Robbie K back with another review as we look at:\n\nMovie: Hellboy (2019)\n\nDirector: Neil Marshall Writers: Andrew Cosby (screenplay by), Mike Mignola (based on the Dark Horse Comic Book \"Hellboy\" created by) Stars: David Harbour, Milla Jovovich, Ian McShane\n\nLIKES:\n\nMost of the Acting Comedy Action Pace Costumes Music\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nHellboy requires some people ready to go in the darker parts of the superhero world, and the cast did a good job for the most part. David Harbour brings some new life to the role, bringing the sarcasm of Hellboy with some broader emotion than Perlman did a while back. Ian McShane does his work in the executive director role, playing that tough father figure that is always the guiding light to the demon's moral compass quite well. My favorite though was Sasha Lane, who took the complex role of Alice and unleashed it to its full potential of the awkward time in awkward circumstances. The chemistry between Harbour and the group is astounding, fun and much of the light in this wave of darkness. Other factors that I enjoyed include comedy that is fun, well delivered lines and some semi-slapstick that left me impressed with the wit that was behind it. The laughs were used well, balanced in the grand scheme of the story without becoming the central focus, which I applaud. The action components also use the comedy to make for some more engaging fights, and Hellboy makes the effort to help keep action scenes dynamic and different. My favorite fight was the end battle, which held more of the adrenaline-fueled insanity that makes me fist pump in excitement. This action leads to a pace that works well in comic book movies, and Hellboy does not drag too long like some of the other super flicks have hit sometimes. In addition, the musical score manages to support and life to the mix as well, with both orchestral and regular songs to spice things up in their high energy fashion. Yet, the biggest positive for me is the costumes and settings of the world. The makeup artists and CGI guys accomplished the goals of bringing 2-D images to life, crafting devilish monsters, nightmare inducing creatures, and savage creations that fit quite well in the hellion universe. Hellboy's cast of interesting characters are equipped to look the part, and while not consistent, they for the most part hold the attributes needed to make the world of Hellboy come to life. The various organizations and fortresses are crafted to represent the world as well, props, uniforms, and various other components that mirror the worlds crafted by the Dark Horse Comics authors and illustrators.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nMila Jovovich's character Overdramatic Flair The Story The Lack of Focus The Loudness The Aggressive Graphicness\n\nSummary:\n\nThe acting was fine for the most part and Jovovich does a fine job acting as she always does. However, this character they crafted was not quite the same denizen of darkness I love in this series. This blood queen had some scarring moments, but she was not quite the threatening image I wanted to see unleashed in the film. Her direction was more overdramatic delivery and singular speeches rather than a well-built character for us to either love or hate. The result was a weaker antagonist to stand against for the nearly 2 hour run time. It's that overdramatic flair at other components that takes precipice, which takes away from the overall movie rather than add, the grandiose nature a little annoying at times. In regards to the story, Hellboy is trying to cram a lot of arcs into a small run time, trying to take the mini-series approach without the mini-series time table. This rendition holds a lot of introductions into the world of the big armed demon, including father introduction, friend introductions, prophecies, rivalry establishment, and more. All these factors are rapidly developed, giving little time, obstacles, or suspense that these stories requires, leading to flat storytelling that held such promise. It's the lack of focus in these things that makes the movie okay, but not truly great. Finally, the aggressive visuals and sounds may also be quite overwhelming given the preference of the audience. In regards to sounds, this movie is very loud, and those with sensitive ears will need to brings some barriers to reduce the impact of the cacophony of sounds that rush in to avoid ears ringing. Visual wise, again the movie's CGI group has applied their skills in the way fitting of a dark comic book series like this. However, they may have done too good of a job as the blood, gore, and sinew dribbles like rain in this movie. Hellboy's focus is very much geared towards filling the silver screen with as much maiming as possible, bringing some disturbing imagery to embed itself into your memory. Sometimes, this worked for me very well, but other times it was unnecessary, merely blatant attempts to raise the shock factor another few notches. If that's the kind of visuals you want in this kind of film, then you will want to flock to the theaters and catch it in high definition goodness.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nOverall, Hellboy is not a bad movie as many have said, but it didn't deliver on the potential crafted in the trailers. Some good visuals, comedy, and fast paced action were good starts in terms of getting the comic vibe up, but the movie itself just doesn't have all the finesse it needed like the bigger studios have done in the past. We needed some focus on the story, some bigger suspense added to the mix, and more importantly finding that balance to extend the movie into a series rather than in one movie. Perhaps a series would be the next step to better presentations, but for now, this movie has a lot of special effects to make a theater visit worthy, but with other super hero films coming or still in theaters, you are best left to waiting or attending these.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nAction/Adventure/Fantasy: 6.5 Movie Overall:: 5.5"

Fortunately, the film itself is so objectively terrible, such a staggering misfire, writing the review was easy.\n\nHellboy (David Harbour) is sent to the U.K. to assist hunting giants. He stumbles into a plot to resurrect Nimue (Mila Jovovich) and ancient witch dismembered by King Arthur centuries before.\n\nIt's a very tiresome film, leaping around madly from scene to scenes desperately extending its thin plot to make the run time. It's also, and this is the real killer both charmless and witless. It's action scenes are terrible, consequence free violence with bad CGI. Hellboy has no particular skill in these fights either, he's just capable of taking untold amounts of damage and does so until his opponent is stopped by something else.\n\nBut if the story is a mishmash of half an ideas here and there (which if the producer interference stories are to be believed, is the case) it's nothing compared to the awful script. There isn't one likeable character in the film, this unfortunately includes the titular one. There's no underlying warmth to Harbours performance. Maybe it's the prosthetics (that are much worse than in Del Toro's version, despite a decade of technology improvements) but it's also what's written for him. His lines, and the whole film, are entirely without humour and none of the relationships between any of the characters is the least bit warm or empathetic. I also didn't care for any of the supporting characters, even the one's played by actors I enjoy in other things, like Ian McShane.\n\nThere's one other massively jarring element of the film, the music. Generic bland metal that crashes in and drags you out of the scene.\n\nI did quite enjoy the scenes of mass graphic destruction that make up the climax of the film but that precious little in a film that palpably feels like it was made of absolutely the lowest possible cost and still be passable. A target they still missed by some margin."

        "review_detailed_main": "So I just saw the new Hellboy at the theater. I really enjoyed the previous versions of the film, but I was willing to give the director Neil Marshall a shot. Unfortunately this movie was just all around bad on every possible level. It may be a contender for worst reboot and all around one of the worst films of 2019.\n\nThe plot of the movie saw Hellboy and his ragtag group of allies try to stop an evil witch from bringing on the apocalypse. Of course as the film progressed the world expanded in a number of not so interesting directions. It was a world filled with one dimensional characters, poor dialogue, subpar CGI, juvenile gore, and all around bad action scenes. It just wasn't a fun experience and the source material deserved better.\n\nSo of course the plot was terrible. It was a thrown together cliche ridden example of how to kill a reboot on film number one. I was so bored the entire time with this film. There was just absolutely nothing intriguing about the plot of the film on any level. There was a central conflict, but it was so shallow it just could not hold my attention. The sad attempt at humor and horror were also all around insulting. On top of all of that the pacing was terrible. Everything was just a mess.\n\nSo with a watered down plot you would expect there at least to be some great action and world building to keep the audience entertained on some level? Unfortunately the film made the odd choice of adding very little actual action to the film. The action sequences we did see were just not good and felt like something out of a TV movie. The additional gore just felt silly and really added nothing to the film of any merit. The same goes for the world building. With such a rich and interesting amount of lore this film really didn't care about making an interesting experience. Who exactly was this film made for? Who was even asking for it to be made?\n\nI am genuinely confused with the directors choices for this film. It was as if Neil Marshall wanted to set out to burn the franchise into the ground. All of the interesting components that made Guillermo del Toro's version so fun have been stripped away and instead we were left with a sad and generic reboot. Hellboy deserved better.\n\nThe same goes for the poor CGI in this film that just further made the poor screenplay seem even worse. There was nothing unique about the visual choices, which is a shame considering the original Hellboy. Gone are the practical effects of the original and in their place we get some truly cheesey and generic set pieces. It all felt so heartless.\n\nThe acting in the movie really didn't work either. I'm a bit biased because Ron Perlman was perfect, but David Harbour just didn't have the screen presence required for this role. It certainly didn't help that near all of his dialogue was just bad. Not B movie fun bad, but simply bad. The same goes for all of the secondary characters. Everyone was just sleepwalking through the poor script particularly Milla Jovovich who just needs to stop acting at this point.\n\nOverall Hellboy was a great example of how not to make a reboot. There just wasn't anything in the film that worked. It wasn't interesting or entertaining. In every way it was a step down from the original 2004 film. This is what happens when you have people make movie that just don't care about the core content. You make me sad Hollywood. A 2.27 out of 10."

In modern day London, Hellboy (David Harbour), the half human/half demon superhero, is burned out after a mission went wrong in Mexico, but is dispatched by Professor Broom (Ian McShane), his father figure, to the headquarters of the Cult of Osiris, plunging him into a hell for leather battle, involving Arthur's sword and the resurrection of the Blood Queen, who's planning a dreadful fate for the modern world.\n\nIt's a very uncomfortable reminder of just how old you're getting, when you can remember when the original version of a film that's become the latest to have a 'reboot', in popular modern parlance, came out fifteen years ago. Unlike Guillermo Del Toro's visual sculpture fantasy (which spawned a sequel of fairly equal quality) however, this present day adaptation of the comic book, from decorated Brit director Neil Marshall, has been ushered out with reasonable publicity, but no press screenings. Always pretty indicative of a disaster, and sadly this mess is certainly no surprise.\n\nFrom the offset, it's clearly aiming for a more edgy but light hearted vibe, with a voiceover describing the historical pretext for the films plot using foul language, and this is a tone it maintains throughout. Unfortunately, it doesn't guide it in any way where you end up with characters to root for, or a plot to care about. It may be a horror/action film, but by anyone's standards, Marshall really pounds the baseline with an overly loud heavy metal soundtrack that's totally disconcerting, although nothing more so like this than one of the main characters being a big, grotesque warthog with a scouse accent (who we later learn is voiced by Stephen Graham!), who in one incomprehensible scene transforms into a fake baby, before turning into a minature version of itself, scurrying away and going on about child abuse! As if it wasn't all visually disturbing enough!\n\nThe special effects, visuals and some of the action may be quite impressive, but with such an incoherent and uninvolving story, with such unengaging characters, they all fall by the by. Del Toro's 00s versions are still quite fresh in the mind, and despite being far from masterpieces themselves, will still create a much better impression than this witless, charmless, sprawling farrago, with a much better Hellboy in Ron Perlman to boot. *"

There's more of a sense of threat, both to and from him: He sometimes gets seriously hurt in fights where it makes sense for him to. And you feel that he might actually embrace his evil nature, rejecting the \"nurturing\" meant to keep him from doing so) questions his place in the world, as he fights creatures that hide in the shadows, wondering what, if anything, makes him any different from them. Professor Broom(McShane, his \"tough love\" step dad), and others, repeatedly(somewhere between 3 and 5 times. Seriously. It gets pretty old) tell him to man up. After all, someone is working on restoring Nimue(Jovovich, absolutely perfect casting, just as many had figured she would be) to her full strength, at which point she intends to unleash a plague on the entire planet, as well as an army of nightmarish beasts, including a few that literally rise from the netherworld, and look like they stepped right out of a Silent Hill game. They're amazing. Honestly all of the designs of beings in this are truly inspired. Fortunately he will not have to fight them alone. He's joined by psychic Alice(Lane, charming) and special forces member Ben(Dae Kim, prepared to do what's necessary to save us all). And a third of the way in, once they start directly interacting with the plot(before that point it's only themes for them. The bad guys get both right from the start), which comes across as over-complicated even though it's in reality straightforward(not saying that that, by itself, is a negative), they're a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThere's a lot to love here. Many individual pieces of greatness, that, believe me, I'm very sorry to say, ultimately do not completely congeal into a satisfying whole. This has an R rating in part because Deadpool did so well. So this tries too hard to go for some of the same things, especially the humour(wisely avoiding 4th wall breaking, which works for that but wouldn't for this), full of modern references. Trust me, it will get tiring even if only near the very end of it, when it did for me. CGI's hit and miss. The action is immensely entertaining. I'm not sure I agree with those who say that the tones don't mix well, and I can emphatically say that they nail the individual ones. This includes the chilling horror, which brings us the utterly terrifying Baba Yaga.\n\nThis contains a lot of bloody, gory(while I have a very high tolerance for that, I have to admit, it probably is excessive) violence, as well as harsh swearing. 6/10"

It seems like they wanted to appeal too much to the hardcore fans or that you needed a certain familiarity with the comics (which I don't). Scenes and characters are just thrown out there without growing into them so they don't have much weight. And Nimue was neither a convincing nor interesting enough villain despite the hype of the destruction she would bring. All this leads up to an unsatisfying conclusion just when the brown stuff appears to hit the fan.\n\nThough I haven't read the original comics, consensus says this is a more faithful adaptation. But what I like about the previous movies was the whimsy. This one has a more serious tone, which makes the injected humor feel forced and awkward. Needless to say, I didn't find it completely funny most of the time.\n\nOverall, though, it's not necessarily bad but didn't live up to its potential."

This \"Hellboy\" reboot seems to have stirred a considerable amount of nostalgia for Guillermo del Toro's prior two Hellboy movies, but I never liked them. They were as full of clich\u00e9s (remember the swooshing-and-whooshing blade twirling nonsense?) and references that went nowhere (de Toro was especially fond of clocks and puppets, for whatever reasons, as well as trying to associate his pictures with classic Universal monster movies). And, so, with this \"Hellboy\" reboot, we get the swaying camera, long-take fight sequences, to rock music, instead, and a slew of references to seemingly-irrelevant material: to Lewis Carroll's book \"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Saw There,\" to the King Arthur and Merlin mythology as remembered through other movies, to Leni Riefenstahl filming the Nazi scene we've already seen another version of 15 years ago, and a Jekyll-and-Hyde type creature (he even injects drugs) who is an utter bore. Some horror-film gore is added, too, for an R-rating rather than the absurdity of bloodless PG-13 violence in the prior installments, as well as in most comic-book superhero fare. It's an obnoxious hodgepodge of horrific fairytale creatures nonetheless.\n\nThis \"Hellboy\" is sorely overloaded with backstories, subplots and set-ups for sequels that will never happen, including stupid mid and after-credits scenes. The origins story is basically the same as the 2004 version, too, so you'd think they could've cut more of it out. Adding Riefenstahl there to film Hellboy's arrival to Earth was a nice self-reflexive touch, but the rest of the movie doesn't follow through on it. Likewise, the Alice and Jekyll/Hyde characters straddle two worlds, as did Lewis Carroll and Robert Louis Stevenson's protagonists, but that's the extent of the references. With Hellboy seen reading Carroll's book in one scene and another where Alice recites the Jabberwocky poem, I especially expected more of a connection there. I've recently read the Alice books, too, as well as having read Stevenson's years ago, so this was disappointing for me. On the other hand, that the picture does go through with a firmer through-line to the King Arthur stuff is eye-rollingly bad. It's as though someone wanted to remake \"Hellboy\" as a slasher film with a slight Gothic-horror allusion, while another wanted to imitate the MCU but with long takes instead of rapid cuts, while still another filmmaker had just seen two of Disney's lesser feature-length cartoons and so threw in the Alice and Arthur stuff, with the result being a plot that rapidly jumps around too much to be much about anything. It's disorganized and unengaging."

This was a question I've been asking myself, where just by co incidence, in the last week, I've come across his name a few times, either by starting credits off a movie, the back page of a script in book form, etc. I looked him up, and clearly, I remember his face vividly, as one of the sicko killers, in 2014's A Walk Among The Tombstones. After seeing him in Hellboy, he's the only actor, I've been blessed, and holy relived to see in that role, although the prize stealing performance has to go to Milla Jovavich, as the evil nemesis, and still she's so f.ckin' gorgeous. Honestly, she blew me away, in an acting feat, I never thought her capable of. It's hard to rate Hellboy on a 1 to 10. It's a great night at the movies, sure, something totally different in a R 18+ movie, which I did expect much more go, as in frequency. It dishes out quite a good serve. A lot of the scenes though, for me, are like ones out of other kinds of movies like this, of past, where we walk cliched paths. It's the simple, limited plotting of story, and premise, that's the main, and patent problem here. Again cliche'd. That repellent pig character reminded me of a baby 1984 Deathstalker. Basically. Hellboy is a much unloved monster, who works among us humans for this agency. Called back, in the wake of a accidental tragedy, involving his prior assignment, to hunt down a deserter, his new operative is, you guessed it, isJovavich's character, and her timeless beauty just sizzles up the screen, it's such a waste to annihilate someone this hot. She's like a imprint in my brain. The reason, she has to be destroyed of course, is she has diabolical plans, to wipe out ole London, and then some. I really loved the generous combination of humour in this film, where mean faced Harbour could only deliver the lines so comically serious, but again, as I said it was Jovavich's striking female fetale performance, that jumped out a me, while Ian Mcshane, who even showed up in a preview of another film, before the lights went down, and the big feature started, did us solid, as Hellboy's father. The film has killer lines, and the casting is in variety of brilliance, and the film impresses and dazzles, either with vivid photography, and heavy blood gushing violence, but it just feels like many parts of other medi-evil movies, particularly story, and cliched premise, which is the film's main problem. One too, wonders why it didn't come out in 3D."

Two puns even made me LOL.\n\nThis is the most fun I've had at the movies since chuldhood. Mostly because I grew and gotten more mature and can now handle a lot more R rated stuff and actually enjoy it. The gore in the movie was by no mens exagerated.\n\nThe movie has a brilliant pace and it actually pains me to think that the director and crew belive they made a great movie but for some unbelievable reason all the reviews are terrible.\n\nSomething wrong with people these days. Maybe thats because The studio didnt pay them for good reviews and at the same timy Disney payed the reviewers to diss this movie!\n\nThis is one of those movies you have to go and see on the big screen!"

Even with a good cast (Milla!!) this movie is shoddily written, disjointed, lacking in wit or any genuine character development, weirdly bad CGI, and a huge let down. And it just isn't Hellboy. Im very confused with all the cast /media comments that it's meant to be different from Del Toro's films, truer to the comics, and darker..... It copied SO MUCH from the 2004 film, but not in a good way. And I feel that Del Toros films were actually much more of a darker, monster-movie tone than this reboot (despite the R rating). Ive never felt so disappointed by a movie. Despite Mignola's input, this movie somehow feels nothing like how Hellboy should make an audience feel."

To separate itself from the original 2 films as it needed to, it ramped up the violence and gore and had plenty of swearing in it, hence the 15 certificate. Would I go see and even welcome a sequel? If it keeps the same darker adult tone, yes.\n\nNow, compared to Del Toro's 2 films, the only real comparison is that David Harbour played the character of Hellboy pretty much the same as Ron Perlman did, as the character should be played. Everything else was different, because let's face it, Del Toro's visual style is stunning. The production, set, and costume design is his trademark. Overall, they are both better films than this reboot."

I feel sorry for David Harbour receiving all these negative reviews as he is a good actor. He does not have a strong enough on screen personality to portray Hellboy, and he made the character into a whiney, irritating persona which is the complete opposite of the Hellboy we know.\n\nOut of respect and love for the original movies I forced myself to watch it till the very end, with of course the hope that the movie gets better as it goes on.

As far as action, the blood and gore seemed a bit gratuitous to the point that it was comparable to that of a DOOM game or a old school horror flick, it was cheesy to say nonetheless. Since the movie moved so fast to cover a bunch of nonsense in its runtime of 121 minutes, every scene lacked a certain depth that could've made the film slightly better. As a fan of Hellboy comics, I'd say this reboot of the original Hellboy movies gave us nothing to take home. I'd rather watch Ron Pearlman's Hellboy for the nostalgia, better flow and overall a better movie watching experience."

And here, both of us viewing this mess from opposite ends, is one of those times.\n\nI like David Harbour so much, it was particularly sad to see him in this - not a line worth saying, and swaddled in so much make-up he couldn't make a face, there was no way for him to rise above the surrounding schlock. I hope Mignola got a LOT of money for this, because if he signed off on this disaster for less, it would be a shame."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am not sure why the studio tried to reboot this franchise. Del Toro's films are really beloved but didn't really do well at the box office. I think it would have been better to cancel the whole thing once Del Toro walked. Regardless, the final film is a mess. There was no less than 3 clunky exposition sequences for the origins of various plot points. Several character motivations are underdeveloped or do not makes sense. Worse the film's bloodletting stands at odds with the dark whimsy that the film seems to be going for. (Likewise, the random vulgarity in the language is off-putting). I don't think the film is fully understandable if you haven't seen the Del Toro films. There is still a major character who I have *no idea* where she (I think a she) comes from.\n\nOn its own this wouldn't be so bad as the film has a lot of visually striking and narrative inventiveness. That character I don't understand at least looks cool and her sequences are effective. The problem is the studio *clearly* recycled some of the Del Toro concept work. Del Toro has design thing about eyes where eyes are in the wrong place or being damaged in crude ways is a common motif in his work (i.e. The Pale Man in Pan's...). The motif is present here. Likewise, many of the creatures' otherness looks like something Del Toro would do. Add in some narrative bits of shorthand the film uses from the first two films and this film does not have a separate existence. The thing is the new director is not Del Toro and he doesn't do a good job copying. It feels closer to parody than anything else, but unintentional and not funny. The studio should have insisted a greater break from the other films.\n\nStrangely enough Hellboy the character is the best part of the film. He is written exactly right and while Perlman is a better fit the new guy is more than able substitute."

        "review_detailed_main": "My first intro to the Dark Horse character Hellboy was with the 2004 film by Guillermo del Toro. While not the first hell-spawned hero, he stood out from the rest, largely due to Ron Perlman's performance and the world he inhabits. It spawned a sequel as well as two animated features, all solid watches. It's a shame a third for each series was never made because this time we were given the first reboot directed by Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers). Needless to say, it left me and plenty of others begging for the OG Hellboy's continuation.\n\nPlot: Hellboy (David Harbour), a demon turned paranormal agent, begins to question his place in the world and his relationship with his adopted father Professor Broom. This internal conflict escalates when he is tasked with tracking down the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich), who takes a special interest in him for her diabolical ambitions. Together, Hellboy and his band of supernatural misfits must battle their way through all sorts of things that go bump in the night in order to stop the evil witch.\n\nThe film adds more stuff from the comics as well as blood + gore to stand out from previous films, a valiant attempt that feels wasted. When I saw the trailer to this reboot, I could tell that it was damned from the start. In fairness, the action is pretty good, the creature designs and visuals are cool, there are a few clever lines/jokes, and there are decent performances (Harbour is OK, just not Perlman). I daresay the story had a potential, challenging Hellboy's beliefs of whether or not he's just a weapon and if monsters really deserve to die. However, it's one thing to have the ingredients, knowing how to properly mix them is another. There are many pointless elements like the fight with the giants and Hellboy's stone right hand. The attempt at moral ambiguity and existentialism isn't resolved in a satiating way and exposition gets repetitive. Much of the humor is flatter than paper and the constant swearing gets old fast as if a thirteen year old wrote this. The quality of the CGI ranges from adequate to downright awful (like late 90s bad), opposed by practical effects that are more consistent. Did I forget to mention that this film loves flashbacks because, holy crap, there's a lot of them, and their scattered use messes up the pacing. Don't even get me started on the blatant sequel-baiting finale and end credit scenes.\n\nIf there's such a thing as purgatory, then it looks more like a pleasant day off compared to this. Not the worst superhero ever made (*cough* Catwoman), but Hellboy 2019 is a mediocre film at best. Back to the drawing board."

He was fiery, passionate, funny, cool, creepy, and a bit relatable. He was a bit conflicted, and you felt his alienation from society, which bothered him, but the story wasn't centered around him too much, but rather, a simple but interesting plot.\n\nThose who do not understand that the hero and villain signify might not enjoy this film. It's a film for Hellboy fans and fans of the paranormal in general. Theologians, mythology heads, occultists, you get the drift. If you are not into that stuff then there is no way you would enjoy this film, which is a bit esoteric for casuals.\n\nIt wasn't the most complicated plot, or a film that will make you cry, it was a funny, artistic campy action popcorn film and that is about it. I laughed, cheered, and loved Harbour in every scene. He is the coolest thing I've seen in a long time but it could have been a much more powerful film.\n\nAs a Hellboy fan, I wanted more but still felt somewhat satisfied in the end because the movie had some really memorable moments. It's an absolutely beautiful B movie, a B movie that I wished would have been an A movie."

But overall, it's only about the level of the \"made of TV\" movies you find on SiFi and such. Nothing too special, but a fair enough way to waste an afternoon.\n\nThe main issue is, the original Hellboy movies did everything this one did, but did it all so much better. The writing was vastly superior, as was Perlman's acting. The story was more engaging, and actually had a sense of urgency. In this one, they're given a deadline to save the world... but then it turns out something else has to happen too... and then something else has to happen too... it basically destroys any feeling of consequence. The heroes can screw up as much as they want because there's always something else that needs to happen, so who cares? You never feel like there's any real tension.\n\nThe special effects were okay. Far too reliant on CG unfortunately. The original again did a far better job with relying on prosthetic and makeup effects. Movie makers need to learn that less is more. Unless your entire movie is animated, then use as little CG as possible otherwise you just make everything look fake as hell.\n\nIf the movie's on TV and you get a chance, maybe sit down and check it out.

        "review_detailed_main": "Alright, buckle up, folks. I was skeptical going into this movie because of all of the harsh reviews floating around online. Afterwards, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and so did my boyfriend. Cons: The plot was very busy. There was a lot going on and wasn't *particularly* strong- BUT, I was never lost or confused during the movie like some others said. If it were me, I would have cut some of the side plots. Not a huge issue, but noticeable. The dialogue. The villain dialogue needed some serious work. It seemed like the writers were trying too hard to create some deep, emotional, evil character by giving them brooding and emotion-packed dialogue. This was my biggest issue with the movie. Especially Milla Jovovich's character. She's a great actress, I've seen her in a lot, but the dialogue made her performance less than what I think she is capable of. Some people say the acting was bad, but I think it was just the dialogue writing. Pros: David Harbour was excellent as Hellboy. No complaints there whatsoever. There was a LOT of practical special effects. They did really stunning SFX makeup on many of the monsters/Hellboy himself. I really appreciated this! It made it more realistic to me, and I can appreciate the hard physical work that went into it. There was a TON of gore. I mean, a TON. I find gore entertaining in movies, so I suppose this could be a con for some people. I enjoyed it and it made for some very visually entertaining scenes. Hellboy's co-stars were people of color. Loved it. The soundtrack was great and fit well with the movie. While the pace was a bit fast, the actual length of the movie wasn't too long either. I thought it was a very entertaining movie and it seemed like a lot of people put serious work into it. I'd recommend it :)"

There were parts that didn't quite make sense and had alot of plot holes plus the script was nothing special.

        "review_detailed_main": "I really liked the new \"Hellboy\" as director Neil Marshall has created a much more gruesome & more horrific HellBoy movie. I still prefer the Del Toro movies & i still much prefer the excellent Ron Perlman as Hellboy but this new version is still very good & David Harbour was actually good as a new version of Hellboy himself, there was still humour but i did long for Perlmans iconic voice & mannerisms, but harbour done a good job, just not as great as Perlman but that being said i still got into this Hellboy. David Harbour is a quality actor as we've all seen with his fantastic performance as Cheif Hopper in the Amazing series STRANGER THINGS, I'm a Harbour fan now & he definitely done a good job here as Hellboy & really enjoyed the movie & it's a darker take on the Hellboy character & his world.\n\nNo one could ever replace or better Ron Perlman as Hellboy though, his performance was fantastic as he became Red & he became the type of guy/demon you wanted to hang out with, Ron was hilarious & ridiculously convincing as the big Red that Hellboy became Ron Perlman & Ron Perlman became Hellboy lol it was one of those greatest Casting bits that become the stuff of Hollywood legend like Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, that type of casting perfection.\n\nThis version DEFINITELY was more on the Horror side as Del Toro's films were more fantasy, i loved the darker & more blood soaked style & it's more sinister tone as it separated it from the previous films as it should, as this is Neil Marshall's Hellboy.\n\nThe monsters look Amazing, i mean of course there's c.g.i overload just like every comic book film but there's still alot of old school practical FX too & some of the creatures designs are fantastic & scary. The sets & production design is absolutely stunning & some or similar to Del Toro's but that was fine as it felt familiar but the standout set for me was the beautiful old fashioned trophy heads room, it looks amazing with so much rich detail. The cinematography is very good & very sharp as everything is richly textured on screen, some great scenes looked like a twisted nightmare it was great. I like Neil Marshall, he's made some excellent films such as Dog Soldiers, Doomsday & The Descent, he knows Horror & Gore well & seems to create a really interesting & scary Horror world in his films.\n\nTake this like i did the new \"Ghostbusters\" which i genuinely loved, this is just a new vision of the characters & franchise, so let it stand on it's own as it is a wild & bloody monster movie full of fantasy & Horror!!! Great Fun & alot better than you think it's going to be."

I'm not really sure what happened here, I've heard good things about Neil Marshall, David Harbour is a great actor and can definitely portray the sassy, sarcastic attitiude of Hellboy and on top of all that the storyline is ripped right out of the comics and it's a great story! But this is just horrible, the script is ATROCIOUS, the acting is mediocre at best, the plot is jumbled and the whole Baba Yaga thing is the most tacked on character/subplot I've EVER seen! Sadly something that could have been amazing turned out to be yet another crappy 2010s reboot of a great movie (that didn't even need to be made, the producers were just too stubborn to let Guillermo do his own thing, if they had been more leniant then we could've had Ron Perlman back too for an awesome and long overdue Hellboy III) that will go down in history as probably my least favourite movie ever.\n\nP.S: I know some people love this movie and see it as just a fun, silly, dumb action movie but I just can't get over how dumb it is (and I even liked Bad Boys II).

        "review_detailed_main": "Hellboy 2019 is a dark fantasy film based on the comic book series of the same name by Mike Mignola. Starring Stranger Things' David Harbour in the title role and directed by Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers), it stands among the ranks of 2015's Fantastic Four as one of the worst reboots ever made.\n\nAfter being summoned into the world from a Nazi ritual during World War II, Hellboy (David Harbour), a demonic creature from the depths of Hell, is raised by his adoptive human father Trevor Bruttenholm (Ian McShane) to protect the Earth from paranormal threats. One day, Hellboy learns that an ancient sorceress known as the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) has returned to wage war on the human race and create a new world fit for supernatural beings to inhabit. With time running out, Hellboy hurries to stop the Blood Queen while also questioning his own otherworldly origins in the process.\n\nBland, flat, and pointless, Hellboy 2019 has no real reason to exist other than to fulfill some contractually obligated clause to renew the series licence. Even when no comparisons are drawn to Guillermo del Toro's films, this one still fails to distinguish itself as its own original entity. The entire time I was wishing this was the third entry instead of some cash-grab reboot as there was at least some potential to be found somewhere in all of this.\n\nThe inconsistent choppy editing wavers the film's tone as it lurches from in-depth expositional scenes to awkward unfunny moments of comic relief, and in doing so, it is near impossible to feel involved in the story. Unlike the two preceding films, this one piles on the blood and gore significantly, as bodies are ripped apart and skin is flayed from bones. Instead of making the film seem more \"mature\" it does the exact opposite and comes across as a desperate attempt to look edgy to modern audiences. In addition to this, the CGI looks terrible, with some characters looking like they were conceived with PlayStation 2 era graphics. This will age the film horribly in a matter of years, unlike del Toro's films which still look fairly good even after more than fifteen years.\n\nDavid Harbour does his best with the material given to him in the lead role as Hellboy, not quite matching the charm of Ron Perlman before him but enough to at least have something interesting to guide us through this mess. However, the same cannot be said for every other supporting character as they all felt underdeveloped and one dimensional, in particular Milla Jovovich's Blood Queen, who is yet another boring world domination-seeking villain.\n\nTo top everything off, the filmmakers have the nerve to sequel-bait its audience as though they're confident anyone would bother sitting through something like this again. Do yourself a favour and watch del Toro's films instead. Some parts may seem a little dated by today's standards but they're still way more entertaining than anything else this has to offer.\n\nI rate it 2.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Hot take: the Del Toro films aren't really significantly better than this. In fact, the second one is distinctly worse than this. Del Toro is a talented visual artist, and his films certainly have more of a distinct aesthetic than this version, but he's not always the greatest writer. I can't say this film is exactly Shakespeare either, of course, but the script was adequate for the type of film it was.\n\nMy other controversial opinion is that David Harbour is probably a better Hellboy than Perlman. Don't get me wrong, I love Ron, and it's probably down to the script more than the acting, but Harbour was pretty good here and definitely elevated the film (as he usually does).\n\nThis is definitely a darker film than Del Toro's. His vision was more fantasy and wonder, as he usually does. This leans much more horror. There are a few scenes of legitimately disturbing violence, especially in the final act. Many people will probably miss the \"charm\" of the other films, but I'm not sure that Hellboy is supposed to be charming. I've never read any of the source material but I somehow gather that this is probably closer to it in tone.\n\nJovovich works reasonably well as the villain. It was nice to see her doing something a little different for a change. If anything I wish that she had had more screen time. McShane is also good, as usual, but again, underutilized. The rest of the supporting cast, however, leaves something to be desired. Abe Sapien's was a stand-out support from the Del Toro films, and this is definitely missing a role of that significance.\n\nAll in all, not a terrible way to spend a couple hours if you need to scratch that Hellboy itch."

The supporting cast is okay, but their characters lack depth and are most of them turn out to be plain CGI caricatures. If you are gullible enough to not have seen Del Toro's versions, chances are, you might find this gore/slug/goo/eye-popper fest marginally entertaining.\n\nVerdict: Hellboy? Hell NO!"

They're big shoes to fill (and an even bigger \"Right Hand of Doom\"), but Harbour does a decent job; less successful is director Marshall replacing Guillermo del Toro, whose giddy touches of fascination, imagination, romance and humor are often absent here (or smothered by all the frenetic dumping of exposition and spraying of special effects). Plot is a bunch of swirling nonsense involving a nasty blood queen (Jovovich) from the era of King Arthur--even the narration pauses for a \"no, really, we're doing this\" nudge at this revelation--and is amazingly incomprehensible considering that it doesn't seem to be a script-by-committee (only one writer is credited, Andrew Cosby). Lots of CGI-assisted blood and guts, even more head-scratching claptrap; design gets the occasional inventive spark, but those moments are hard to appreciate when the restless pace keeps lurching from one bloated set-piece to the next. McShane's wry, grounding presence is always welcome, at least.\n\n34/100"

I prefer Harbour's Hellboy over Perlman's for sure. They pulled off the look on Hellboy too. Loved the scruffiness.\n\nThe storytelling and scripting weren't great though. I was still entertained throughout the entire movie however. Lots of solid action, and despite the lackluster script, the humor was for the most part on point as well and the R rating really shined through with lots of gore.\n\nAs for the acting, as mentioned, Harbour did an excellent job whereas the rest of the cast performed at a supbar level. Especially Milla Jovotich delivered a not so convincing portrayal of Nimue The Blood Queen. The poorly written script with lots of questionable dialog didn't help much either.\n\nAlso wish they had toned down the character Gruagach a bit. Given him less screen time perhaps. He just really wasn't a very convincing character with a less convincing agenda.\n\nI felt the movie worked well creating the scene for a Hellboy franchise. A dark and gritty world with lots of potential. But I do hope for massive improvements in a potential sequel. Better storytelling and hopefully a much more solid cast helped along with a script that justifies the actors and actresses.\n\nTo sum it all up. I had hoped for more but was entertained throughout the film."

The character was very well written off, the relationships with all the other characters were well-written and interesting, the plot was good and the antagonist had a clear motive for her doings. The movie overall was very entertaining and funny, although an important note would be that it includes a lot of graphic content. Surely recommended!"

David Harbour from \"Stranger Things\" fame takes up the role of Hellboy with Milla Jovovich as the main antagonist. You are certainly going to miss Del Toro's writing and direction, but not Ron Perlman, the original Hellboy. David did a fair job portraying the titular character. You will enjoy the movie if you are OK watching an R-rated, fast-paced, gory action sequences misfiring every aspect of the original Hellboy and sucking in every left-over folklore nightmare creature, loosely connected due to a weak storyline - it's just too much of undetailed and scattered imaginations. Besides, I believe a large part of the negative reviews are due to its obvious comparison with the Del Toro's original work, but then it's a reboot with a different director, writer, and a mint cast. I would give it 6 out of 10 and suggest you enjoy the flick keeping your minds off the original one, for the most part, the movie will give you the desired thrills but when compared seems nothing but a doltish cloggy ride."

As a big fan of the comics, the idea of a more serious adult take that skewed closer to the source material sounded amazing to me and almost worth sacrificing Del Toro's 3rd part for... sadly, now that I see what we got instead, I gotta admit I'd have preferred one last Del Toro film.\n\nThat said, this isn't as bad as the critical dog-pile would have you believe. I'm glad I read the reviews before seeing this as my expectations were lowered to such a degree that it couldn't help but exceed them. Yes it was bloated, cheesy, poorly written, unnecessarily gratuitous, and had very uneven special effects, but it had a certain pulpy charm to it and there were some very fun moments peppered throughout. I was definitely entertained the whole time. You can't really top Perlman, but Harbour was a great Hellboy (despite that horrible makeup and those atrocious one-liners), and even if everyone else in the film was horribly mis-cast, they do a good job anyway. As a comic fan it was fun seeing so many moments from the comics woven into the film, but claims that this was a more faithful adaptation of the source material may have been somewhat exaggerated.\n\nAnyone who's a fan of the comics should give this a watch just for the hell of it, and you might actually even like it if you're a fan of b-movies, gory action-comedy and/or everything-and-the-kitchen-sink fantasy films. Anyone else should probably stay away though."

This time around is from the director of 'Doomsday' and 'The Descent', so it has much more of a horror/gore/supernatural leaning than the other films. To ensure the R-rating, on top of the all the blood and violence, there's also plenty of (often needless) swearing.\n\nPlot is somehow linked to King Arthur, Merlin and the Blood Queen (Jovovich), an ancient witch who's resurrected to wreck havoc. Hellboy has to team up with Daimio (Dae Kim) from M11 and Alice (Lane), an old friend and clairvoyant, to stop \"Nimue\". There's giants, vampires, ghouls and all sorts of weird stuff, but the hardest to go along with is Gruagach (Graham), who is basically just Bebop from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. McShane as Prof Bloom is good, but under-used, and Lane is solid, but the rest of the cast don't really bring too much and go through the motions.\n\nThere's some great CGI, but also some creatures and shots that are a bit too gratuitous and don't really add to the story, particularly in the final scenes. Harbour is OK as Hellboy, but is missing some of Pearlman's charm. In general, the film lacks the heart and humour of the original films - and sorely misses Liz & Abe Sapien."

It makes for a messy script with massive pacing issues and way too many side characters. There's also a fair amount of gore and attempts at humor but due to the poor pacing neither have the desired effect.\n\nLet's go to the acting. For some reason they chose two American actors to play British characters (Lane and Kim) and they both deliver their lines with an English accent that's only slightly less ridiculous than Dick Van Dyke's in Mary Poppins. David Harbour does an admirable job as Hellboy but fails to bring the same depth to it as Perlman although he's not exactly being helped by the rather poor dialogue he gets handed to him. McShane and Jovovich are McShane and Jovovich. Not bad but nothing to get excited about either.\n\nThe last part is about the CGI. It's 2019. Some of them are really not acceptable anymore with the current technology. There are youtube channels that make more convincing effects."

While far more gruesome and profane than Guillermo del Toro's 2004 take on the story, the film lacks the charm and humour of the earlier picture. David Harbour is fine as the titular dehorned hero but the rest of the cast (including the usually reliable Ian McShane) is as underwhelming as are their trite characters (especially Sasha Lane, who adds nothing beyond an obvious attempt to pull in another viewer demographic). The special effects are very good (but that is to be expected these days) and the final confrontation in London is spectacular and imaginative, but otherwise the film doesn't have much going for it. Feel free to skip the last scene and the post-credits sequence, they are simply setting up a sequel that, given the film's critical and box-office failure, is unlikely to be conjured up."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here we go again! This week we have Hellboy and what a doozy this was. Let's begin with this film having a hard time being made in the first place. Stories of it initially being a sequel to the original installments fell through and led to this reboot. Either way, the movie was completed and off to the theaters people go. DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE ANYTHING LIKE THE FIRST TWO MOVIES. DEFINITELY R-RATED.\n\nLet's start with the good. Visually, at times, the monsters and demons displayed were absolutely amazing. Sickening but amazing. Truly creative and sick minds brought the words of the graphic novel to life. If anything saves this movie, that is it. These creatures are very cool and I would say pretty awesome to see on a big screen. This movie also plays better/closer to a horror/gore movie than the first installments. There are a couple good action sequences. I can see how people will enjoy that. HOWEVER...\n\nIt's time for the bad and the ugly. Granted I never read the graphic novels, this movie's plot was the definition of discombobulated. The team that produced this throw everything, except the holy bible, at this movie. The producers of this movie are presumptuous that all viewers have full knowledge of Hellboy, and that isn't the case. The writing, was pretty awful and didn't help make anything better. This movie has you learning five different storylines that weren't really that important to give you minor details that don't really affect the larger story, in this particular movie. They seem to be setting up a second next movie that in my estimation may never come. Hellboy (the character) doesn't look that great (visually) and not as relatable or fun as the first installment. The other main characters are also weak, at best.\n\nWith, that said Hellboy graphic novel fans... this movie isn't great but I can definitely understand you all wanting to see this and the creatures created... at best do a matinee. EVERYONE ELSE, wait for this to be on netflix and save your duckets. It would be cool to see the creatures on the big screen but not worth the money or time. Just check it out for free at home."

But if it's rollicking popcorn entertainment, with a poke at pompous pretence - and a hot, heavy slab of gore thrown on top - then you're in the right place. Yes, it's sketchy in some areas, but there is a certain license for that here - your suspense of disbelief will be required on all sorts of levels. The film has its surprises & most importantly, it doesn't take itself too seriously (unlike some critics, it seems!). It's looseness IS its sincerity. Whilst it doesn't quite go down the B-movie shlock route, it gives a similar thrill of guilty pleasure. Whilst I find myself increasingly disenchanted with much of the dross that pours out of the silver screen these days; I feel these guys were robbed at the box office with this Hellboy reboot - having personally disliked the Perlman incarnation. A lot of critics draw parallels to other films/works, but I say: forget all that. Leave your expectations behind & make up your own minds."

You don't go into a Godzilla movie looking for Oscar nominated writing and acting. You go for monsters and action. The same could be said for Hellboy 2019. It's just a fun action movie. There are some pretty good one liners. The scenery and creature design are great. If all your Hellboy knowledge comes from Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy 1 and 2, you might want to skip this one. If you're a fan of the comics and enjoy a bit of ultra-violence, give it a shot. I thought David Harbour's portrayal was great and true to the source material. My biggest gripe is that the CGI could've been better during certain scenes. Rent it, wait for it to be streaming on whatever you stream with. They leave it open for a sequel and I'm fine with that. I'll likely check it out if and when it becomes available for rent."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's always a delight when a film inspires such a visceral negative reaction in me, that I have to pause and ponder hard on the proper words to describe it. And that's definitely the case with 2019's ill-advised and utterly unnecessary reboot \"Hellboy,\" based of course on the comics created by Mike Mignola. It isn't enough to call this film simple phrases like \"poor\" or \"bad.\" No, this movie almost necessitates the use of more colorful language. Words like \"cockamamie\" and \"nonsensical\" come to mind. As do words like \"asinine\" and \"abhorrent.\" And most definitely \"abominable.\"\n\nBut, to keep it simple and put it in more tangible terms, yeah... it was pretty darned dreadful. Suffering an aimless narrative, a sloppy execution and a complete lack of the charm and artistry that defined the comics and prior film adaptations, this new take on the classic cult-character is a fundamentally broken mess of frustration and failed potential. And it can go straight to... well, you know where.\n\nHellboy (David Harbour), a demon that was raised by humans to help fight supernatural threats, is called into action when the ancient and deadly Blood Queen Vivian Nimue (Milla Jovovich) is resurrected. Along with his surrogate father (Ian McShane), a woman from his past named Alice (Sasha Lane), and shape-shifting fellow agent Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim), Hellboy must stop the vile mistress from bringing about the end of the world. Along the way... a bunch of random, inconsequential stuff happens involving grouchy giants, vengeful pig-men, multiple secret organizations, a Mexican wrestling ring and a rather randy witch who evidently has a hairy tongue. But none of it really contributes much to the proceedings.\n\nPart of the great tragedy of this new take on the source material is that it had so much potential. Yes, we all know about the quite excellent prior film adaptations by cinematic maestro Guillermo del Toro. And everyone of course knows that the long-proposed third film was dropped in favor of this new adaptation. (And to this day, I will admit I am still a bit heartbroken over this.) But I was willing to give this movie a fair chance, because I love the character. And on the surface, the elements are all there. Director Neil Marshall has a great track record when it comes to the strange and the bizarre. The cast is oft-electrifying. And the visuals are frequently interesting. But it just does not work as a coherent film, to the point it becomes frustrating to watch. Everything about this movie just feels misjudged and mishandled.\n\nThe writing is one of the chief offenders. There's no clear goal or logical flow to the story or characters. It's a slapdash amalgamation of disconnected and disparate components that don't fit together at all. A writhing mass of seemingly random subplots lazily peppered in around a \"central story\" that really only takes up about thirty minutes of the two-hour runtime. At times, it almost feels like multiple different scripts were somehow mixed together accidentally. Characters are often established, then immediately written out, leaving them pointless. Plotlines come and go on a whim. And the movie frequently writes itself into ridiculous corners that it quickly and lazily solves with contrived deus-ex-machinas, giving little satisfaction. And as a result of this aimless structure, even important facets of the story like the main villain (played well by the incredibly likable Jovovich) feel completely disconnected from the narrative! I'm sorry, but the writing is just nonsensical and it does not work.\n\nAdding to that is a general feeling of unease in the production. As I said before, the visuals are frequently quite fascinating to look at thanks to the wild world established by Mignola's comics. But that's not enough to save what is otherwise an incredibly shaky execution. It almost feels like director Marshall didn't know what to do with the material from day to day. It all feels very patchy and inconsistent. Some scenes are rushed to the point they become hard to follow and you miss out on key exposition, while others grind the story to a screeching and jarring halt, giving you a strange sort-of whiplash effect. At times the camerawork is wild and creative- see an early sequence involving Hellboy fighting off three giants which is arguably the film's best sequence... while other scenes are really amateurish and basic with poor framing and lazy setups. Much like the script felt like multiple screenplays that had been mixed together, the visual direction feels at times like it was handled by different people with very different styles. And combined with patchy editing and mixed-bag visual effects, this strangely inconsistent execution makes it hard to keep yourself invested.\n\nAnd to top off the trinity of troubles with this new \"Hellboy\"... the movie just isn't anywhere near as creative or as charming as it ought be. The cast is great- particularly David Harbour, who makes the character of Hellboy his own. But the character isn't likable or interesting this time around. He's just a brash guy who occasionally makes bad one-liners. The same can be said for the other characters- nobody stands out, as everyone is just a bland, broad archetype. And despite the visual flourishes no doubt crafted by dozens (if not hundreds) of designers and technicians... it all just begins to look ugly and uninspired after a while. Gone are the beautiful minimalistic visuals of the comic. Gone are the exquisite and intricate designs of del Toro's films. This new \"Hellboy\" is just bland and ugly... inside and out.\n\n\"Hellboy\" barely claws its way to a miserable 2 out of 10. It's a messy, unlikable slog. If you want to spend some quality time with the character, do yourself a favor and either pick up a few issues of the comic or revisit the excellent prior films instead. Because take it from this \"Hellboy\" fan... this movie is one hell of a disappointment."

        "review_detailed_main": "At first, the 2019 Hellboy reboot looked woesomely generic, but I enjoyed the visual direction and monster designs of later trailers. However, the look of said ads also made me wonder why Lionsgate just couldn't give in and let Guillermo Del Toro direct his Hellboy 3 as he'd always wanted. What we have here is essentially a Del Toro film without the magic that truly makes it work.\n\nThe Del Toro flare is not the only thing missing in this particular Hellboy, though. The digital effects are astoundingly bad - not always made up for by the interesting action sequences or morbidly clever gore shots - and the characters only briefly show hints of likability, without ever really going there. It also throws in Marvel-brand quips here and there because, really, what film doesn't?\n\nDavid Harbour of Stranger Things fame plays Hellboy, or \"Red\", not looking too different from the Hellboy we already have, only he seems to have had a few too many packets of Winston and just generally forgot how to look after himself. He's a giant bore with intervals of inept comic relief and his sidekicks (Sasha Lane and Daniel Dae Kim) aren't much to write Satan about either.\n\nThe head of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense this time around is Ian McShane, also Hellboy's adoptive pep-pep, and the main threat is an evil queen (Milla Jovovich), brought back by a vengeful pig-man. Her scenes are some of the more visually memorable of the film. I like how her red dress sticks out from the charred landscape in one scene. Also of semi-importance are Thomas Haden Church in a cameo that may please Dark Horse comics fans, and Brian Gleeson as Merlin. Yes, THE Merlin. Even Russian folklore celebrity Baba Yaga gets a role.\n\nThe inclusion of magical and occult elements, be they from the comics or real-world superstition, of course makes sense. What we lack is an audience surrogate like FBI Agent Myers in the first ever Hellboy film - a normal guy reacting to the otherwordly sights. Still, it can be exciting to simply enter a supernatural world and observe its inhabitants, all of them used to what they themselves see and hear every day. Alas, that works better when the characters are more interesting than what we're given here.\n\nOne significant plus, in my mind, is the R-rating, which is a better fit for the world of Hellboy than the PG-13 one. It elevates the film ever so slightly, as we're now allowed to see some amusingly executed gore. Del Toro's movies felt a little lame in that regard. Fights between hellbeasts, monsters, and other ancient forces should produce more blood than what little we got in The Golden Army, for instance.\n\nSo this is by some measure a fun movie, yes, but it is also miserable. This is the final result of no-one listening to Del Toro and instead trying to cash in on his style, now with a dash of MCU; just not the dash that gives us enjoyable characters or well-rendered visuals. Was it worth it? Here's a hint: nope.\n\nFun fact: Hellboy belongs to Dark Horse Comics, whose only other famous comic character is Big Head, whom you may know better as the being played by Jim Carrey in 1994's The Mask. Considering the state of modern movies and how everything everywhere has to be the same, I don't doubt we'll see a reboot of The Mask where Harbour reprises Hellboy in a post-credit scene. The Cinematic Horse Universe - get to it! You know you wanna."

I really hoped for a third and final entry in the series where Perlman will portray Hellboy meeting his destiny as foretold by the Death. Especially with Hellboy was to have twins and for us to finally to see his true form on how is to bring Armageddon. Instead we have a new storyline. Okay to be honest, I didn't mind the film. It isn't anything comparable to Guillermo del Toro's vision but I really didn't mind it.\n\nThe great Ron Perlman casts a long shadow of the title character and the new leading man, Stranger Things alum, David Harbour, does well but really pales in comparison as the new man in red. What this film lacks in is creativity like the first two flick. Yes it is heavy with special effects, so much CGI which makes you miss the set pieces from the original two flicks. But you still have creatures from the dark lore such as Baba Yaga, Lucha Libre Vampires, Giants, Demons and a foul talking fairy known as Gruagach. That's another difference with this film is the constant swearing which really misses out on the magic and charm that was felt in the first two. Another key addition to this film is the blood and gore which takes me back to the CGI... the CGI is overused and although the blood, gore and even the design of the creatures are all very interesting, it takes away the actual story and doesn't provide the character depth in comparison to del Toro's flicks. The story and character were a great idea but lacked execution as it only touched the surface. Plus why give us past event explanations towards the end of the flick which instead it should been setup from key situations and dialog from key characters?? And why give us the Lobster character when we hardly see him?? I would have been soooo happy to see more of Thomas Haden Church as this unique character!\n\nBack to Harbour's performance, the guy did alright, his version of the character is more whiny, young and emotive while trying to be a wise trash talking hero. Again, Perlman will always be the big red guy to me. Having said that Harbour realty carries the film which doesn't do well for him considering the direction of the flick misses great opportunities to capitalise this new iteration of Hellboy. This new film story follows Nimue played by Resident Evil alum Milla Jovovich, a blood witch that was destroyed long time ago by no other than King Arthur. Jovovich hardly has a real evil presence and her character feels recycled. Even her climatic fight with Hellboy was brief and disappointing!! She got betrayed at the start of the film and after a millennium of being locked away she hardly make a stand off fight with the protagonist? Comonnnnnn!! There were some cool new surprises of characters such as Alice who really learns her abilities throughout the movie. And we have Daimio a military guy who can transform into a jaguar beast, which again is heavily dependent on CGI. The CGI is extremely bad in a few scenes where one of Alice's talents include communicating with the dead by creating a psychic link where a ghoulish looking version of the deceased extends from her throat out of her mouth - now this is creative but it appears that no money whatsoever went into making the effect come across as interesting. As mentioned, the flick does deliver a lot of bloody action sequences, but rather than creativity and unique, this film has similarities to a gory video game. For instance the action shots of Hellboy battling three giants is so similar to a video game as the scenes are surrounded by a number of swirling camera movements. Props to the filmmakers providing a great rock soundtrack during a few of the action sequences. Heaps of limbs getting torn off from people, heaps of guts and gore but the movie lacks real creativity, it was great having a reference to Excalibur and Merlin but the tone of the film felt cartoonish and a PS4 game rather than the uniqueness I was used to, overall 6/10."

What made this more frustrating was that they had a good script and ideas, but the excitation just kept coming up short.\n\nPoor English accent, no chemistry between any of the actor's, almost like no one knew which way the movie was meant to go, was it Cheese? Serious? Gripping? Comedy? It was like watching a movie that changed directors every scene.\n\nI really wanted this to work but your gotta get a better director and commit to a direction and cut out the poor scrip choices with bad language to try and get a laugh.\n\nReally had a massive opportunity to make something special.\n\nEasy guide for next movie. Go dark and commit. We gotta care about a character before we care what happens to them. Build the relationship, don't just throw people together in a rush. Dark humour works. Pick a direction and commit. Get good actors."

I sat down to watch how the film was going to pan out post marvel era and boy was I disappointed. Hellboy character wasn't too bad but the supporting cast of plumy accented English people. I'm from the UK which has a wealth of accents even in London there is a huge variation of them, so why does everyone in this film sound like the come from royalty. Even the girl who grew up in various low rent flats sounded like she had been through the My Fair Lady treatment. Hollywood needs to learn that not everyone in the UK sounds like that just the same as everyone in the US doesn't sound like a cowboy. The plot and dialog were also really bad but for me the accents of my fellow homies was the most annoying part of this movie."

There's a lot to like here, it just seems that some movies are destined to be met with an wave of positivity or negativity upon release that they never shake. Hellboy falls firmly into this category, with the negative reaction being completely over the top.\n\nThe biggest issue is the dialogue. It's really poor. Really uncreative, with lines that would have come across as cliched 25 years ago, never mind in 2019. It's really lazy writing, and the fact that the plot itself is actually very good, is likely down to the fact that it has such a wealth of great source material to draw from; it takes so much from the Mignola books that the movie never gets boring because there is so much happening.\n\nThe direction, effects and look of the movie are superb. Marshall has done what he can here with a poor script. Hellboy looks great, particularly with his transformation. A two hour blockbuster is normally a slog for me to get through these days, but this is such a relentless romp that I never got bored. It's also very difficult not to feel for Hellboy, so beyond the relentless action, they have done well to achieve an emotional layer in such a short space of time in a movie that also needs to devote a lot of run time to action and horror scenes. Credit to Harbour as well for bringing this into his performance underneath all the make up and prosthetics.\n\nAs usual you'll see a lot of extreme views on IMDB, ratings flipping between 1 and 10. In truth this is neither a great film or a terrible one, but one worth your time if you enjoy this sort of thing."

The majority of this one takes place in England, being British myself I loved this. King Arthur and Merlin make appearances and the film features the famous Pendle HIll, known for its association with witchcraft. Even Rasputin has a minor part! Milla Jovovich plays an evil witch and looks utterly stunning as always. This movie features a plenty of violence, gore and some strong swearing, not really a film for young kids. Hellboy is a supernatural hero and the film combines action, horror, fantasy and comedy. I am not a great lover of CGI but the special effects were pretty good. Plot wise it isn't up to much, this is definitely a popcorn movie, it won't tax the brain, just sit back and enjoy the visual onslaught.\n\nNB there are two post end scenes, one mid credits and one at the very end. Sequel? I hope so!"

Hellboy started life as a fun and exciting franchise which didn't feel the need for needless gore and guts. The new version of Hellboy looks like he's had a stroke with the lips of Herman Munster. Ian McShane, a legend also fails miserably in this film. A total bore fest which does not grow on the audience. All we can hope for is this new franchise dies quietly without any sequels so that it can be forgotten about."

I loved the previous two Hellboy movies, directed by Guillermo del Toro and featuring Ron Perlman and Selma Blair, whose character was seriously cool. In addition to being fun action flicks they were visual feasts. This film, directed by Neil Marshall (nominated for an Emmy for the second-to-last Game of Thrones episode), not so much. Don't get me wrong, there are some really cool visual moments...and there's some really disgusting stuff, I watched quite a few segments with my hands over my eyes.\n\nWHAT TO KEEP IN MIND I have to thank the reviewer (I believe it was lantzstumpp) who compared this one to a Sam Raimi horror flick, it put me in the right frame of mind to watch and truly enjoy this.\n\nTHE ACTORS I wish they'd given Milla Jovovich a bit more to work with, I'd say she's underutilized here. Loved Sasha Lane as Alice, especially at the end (in the early end credits scene), though some of her lines seem written for someone not quite so posh-sounding. Daniel Dae Kim's character seems like it's going to be very one-note at the start, but there's more development as the film goes on, so give it a chance.\n\nDO YOU EVEN LIKE HORROR? I generally avoid scary films but there are some that are so good--comedic or otherwise--that I do have a list of favorites, including Scream and The Sixth Sense. If you're the same then you may well enjoy this film.\n\nWHY DID SO MANY RATE THIS 1-STAR? These days you really have to sort through reviews, find the honest ones (hint- they're almost never the ones featuring one- or ten-star ratings) and splice together your own idea to figure out whether or not you'll enjoy a film. There are SO MANY TROLLS giving out 1-star ratings for (sometimes obvious, sometimes obscure) reasons. I don't know that there were any major political issues with this film or the folks behind it so my rating is based purely on entertainment value. The plot isn't terribly imaginative (some aspects I found simplistic and as one critic pointed out, it's a whole lotta lore packed into one movie) but, bottom line, it's a thoroughly engrossing blockbuster film."
