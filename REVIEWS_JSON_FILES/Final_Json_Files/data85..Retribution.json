        "review_detailed_main": "Some films are so bad they're good. Tommy Wiseau's 'The Room', or Claudio Fragasso's 'Troll 2,' are hilarious because of their ineptness, and are therefore really entertaining. Others are less enjoyable, but have redeeming qualities, such as the striking visuals in Alex Proyas' overblown 'Gods of Egypt,' for instance. Then, there are films that are just awful, with nothing to offer the viewing audience beyond boredom and disappointment.\n\nNimr\u00f3d Antal's 'Retribution' is one of the latter. An unoriginal slog, the film follows Matt Turner, a financier and family man. One day, while driving his children to school, he notices a strange phone ringing beside him, and answers it. The caller turns out to be an anonymous fiend, who tells Turner he has placed a bomb under his seat that is triggered by pressure plates and a radio frequency. The caller demands that Turner follow his instructions to the letter, otherwise the bomb will be detonated; sending Turner and his children on an explosive ride through the streets of Berlin.\n\nIt is, essentially, 'Phone Booth' meets 'Speed,' with a dash of Steven Knight's 'Locke,' but is no way as fun as that combination sounds. A dull remake of a much better film, Dani de la Torre's 'El desconocido,' Antal and screenwriter Chris Salmanpour fail to make the venture exciting, thrilling or in any way engaging. Salmanpour's dialogue is so stilted and full of exposition it makes that heard in Robert Lorenz's 'The Marksman' sound like Shakespeare. The narrative is predictable, featuring a twist so obvious it may make your eyes actually roll.\n\nFurthermore, the characters involved are all stereotypes with little to no personality. Turner is a wet-blanket, who is difficult to root for, while his children are breathing cliches. Secondary characters are no better, and everyone involved acts without logic or common sense. How the film was greenlit for production, considering it is so boring as to be qualifiable as a sedative, is astounding. It plays like a cheap TV movie from the 90's or early 00's: forgettable, monotonous and hardly worth the time one has to invest in watching it.\n\nIt is an unexceptional, tiresome picture in every regard, featuring passionless cinematography from Flavio Mart\u00ednez Labiano, which does nothing to aid proceedings. He makes Berlin- a notoriously interesting location- look flat and dreary, while his utilisation of shots and angles is conventional and uninspired. Similarly, composer Harry Gregson-Williams seems to be just going through the motions: his bland score reflects a lack of interest in the subject matter.\n\nMoreover, Steve Mirkovich's editing is mediocre, if not downright poor. Mirkovich has cut some films brilliantly in the past: his work on 'Con Air' created tension and momentum, as it did on 'Big Trouble in Little China' and other projects. Here, though, he fails to generate the fast pace required for a thriller to work. The film plods along at a pace that would irritate a snail, going glumly from scene to scene with little to no energy or drive.\n\nIn fact, the only half-decent aspect of the film is star Liam Neeson's performance. Neeson does solid work, but Turner is a role that requires nothing from him, and he appears as bored as his audience at times. In the last few years, he has been making dodgy career choices, seemingly lured by big paycheques and nothing more. Although one can't fault him for wanting to make a bundle for relatively easy work; this might mark the nadir of his career thus far, and might actually hurt his bankability.\n\nHe should have avoided it like the plague, as should prospective viewers. Alongside Neeson, Jack Champion and Lilly Aspell, starring as his children, do forgettable work, while Noma Dumezweni does the bare minimum as a Europol agent on Turner's tail. Also, slumming it in a thankfully small role, is Matthew Modine, who is over the top when he isn't wooden, and seems embarrassed to be associated with the project at all.\n\nAt the end of the day, Nimr\u00f3d Antal's 'Retribution' is a boring waste of time. Based on an exciting film from Dani de la Torre, something was lost in translation when screenwriter Chris Salmanpour penned his adaptation, as there are no thrills, tension or entertainment value whatsoever in the finished product. Although Liam Neeson does solid work, this may be one of the most mundane, unexciting films he's appeared in- and in the last few years, he's been in a lot. Featuring nonstop nonsense and nothing more; this film is so forgettable, you might actually forget it as you're watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Of course there was no doubt about me having to sit down and watch this 2023 action crime thriller as it had Liam Neeson on the cast list. Sure, I had never even heard about the movie prior to watching it, not that it really mattered, as it was a Liam Neeson movie.\n\nThe storyline in \"Retribution\", as written by Alberto Marini and Christopher Salmanpour, sort of was very similar to the 1994 movie \"Speed\", except that it was lacking the high speed and adrenaline. It was watchable, for sure, but it was not a top notch movie for Liam Neeson. The storyline was a bit too much of a copy and paste of \"Speed\", except it was in a SUV and had a slightly different plot.\n\nThe acting performances in the movie were good, and while Liam Neeson didn't have a particular set of skills in \"Retribution\", then he still carried the movie well enough to make it a watchable movie. There are a couple of other familiar faces on the cast list, with the likes of Embeth Davidtz, Matthew Modine, and Jack Champion.\n\nI found \"Retribution\" to be somewhat lacking in thrills and excitement, and the movie's plot and storyline was a tad too linear and predictable for my liking. Plus, the fact that if you've already seen \"Speed\", then you have essentially also already seen director Nimr\u00f3d Antal's \"Retribution\".\n\nWatchable for what it was, \"Retribution\" didn't impress me, nor did it revolutionize the action crime thriller genre. In fact, it didn't bring anything new at all to the genre. And on that account, my rating of director Nimr\u00f3d Antal's \"Retribution\" lands on a bland five out of ten stars."

Ever snice That trilogy I've been running to the theatres to watch Neeson flicks and this is the Frist time I actually said to myself why (which i now found surprising).\n\nNot to say this was a bad movie, but it really seemed unnecessary. Wild thing, it feels like a similar plot to a better Neeson movie the Commuter. The movies may seem polarizingly deferent but if you seen The Commuter you'll notice the same plot devices creating the same loop holes in both, but the Commuter is worth seeing while i could have skipped Retribution altogether."

The film is some what clich\u00e9 but like I said you wouldn't watch this for it's realism and there are enough twists, turns and explosions to keep you interested.\n\nClocking in at 90 minutes in not a major investment in time either.\n\nFor the genre I give it a 7/10."

So, please just listen to every ignored request made by different party's appearing in the film. The director seems to have made everyone do everything wrong...deliberately!\n\nThere is just no logical sensibility about any of this film especially with the numb-nut Interpol female police boss; she is given a load of case solving relevant information but refuses to listen or believe any of it. The film is just totally and stupidly pointless annoying trash.\n\nThe film is in English but set in Germany and nobody bothered to include the subtitles for the German speaking lines/parts.

The first two acts where actually impressive and with hardly any flaws, and full of constant tension and suspense. But the third act certainly had some plot and technical issues, as well as some logic defying actions and decisions. Casting and performances were excellent throughout, as was the pacing, cinematography and score. Had the third act been better, this would've easily been a solid 8, but as the writers seemed to lose steam and creativity in the third act, it's down to a 7/10 from me."

Complicating things still further , the police pursues him and surrounding his car and then happenings go awry . Liam Neeson stars in this high-voltage thriller called Retribution about a matter of life and death containing action, revenge and redemption, in which he receives a bomb threat while driving his children to school that his car will explode if they stop and get out. In a race against time, Matt will have to do the impossible to save his family. This Summer, all roads lead to the truth !.\n\nThis is a top-notch thriller about a high-powered banker submitted to weird circumstances surrounding him , that's just the starting point for him , and a bit later on , things get even worse . A film in similar quality other Hollywood blockbusters . As this film results to be a crossover from other benchmarking successes as well as grossing American films , such as : \u00a8Locke\u00a8 by Steven Knight (2013) with Tom Hardy , \"Speed\" (1994) directed by Jan de Bont with Keanu Reeves , and \"Phone Booth\" (2002) Joel Schumacher with Colin Farrell . This thrilling movie has a lot of action images , including pursuits , car crashes , explosion , and anything else . The plot can not be very realistic ; however, displaying several scenes have you on the edge of your seat . The picture increases the relentless tension as well as the flick progresses on screen . Thrilling and nail-biting film with a lot of scenes of drama , tension , emotion and action , all of them at equal parts . This is a highly suspenseful and cerebral thriller , filled with plot twists , including an unexpected denouement in its final part . Hitchcock style psychological thriller , being surprisingly good and stunningly directed . The picture is pretty well , though sometimes stagy , as developing into the car , and it has a lot of turns . However , being very entertaining for its continuous suspense . The original as well entertaining premise is overspread across the movie adding some brief conventional pitfalls . The well assembled cast is frankly good , including masterful direction of players by filmmaker Nimr\u00f3d Antal, such as: Matthew Modine (Full Metal Jacket, The Stranger Things), the young Jack Champion (Avatar) and Embeth Davidtz qho long time ago starred along with Liam Neeson 'Schindler List' . In this remake of the Spanish film \" El Desconocido (The Unknown)\", Neeson plays Matt Turner, an American living in Berlin who receives a phone call while taking his children to school, as a mysterious voice tells him that the car is loaded with explosives that will detonate unless he does what it says.\n\nThis is third remake of Spain's \u00a8El desconocido\u00a8 (2015) by Danny de La Orden with Luis Tosar after Germany's \u00a8Steig. Nicht. Aus!\u00a8 (Don't. Get. Out!) (2018) by Christian Alvart with Wotan Wilke M\u00f6hring and South Korea's \u00a8Balsinjehan\u00a8 (2021) but the first to use the original's English title.\n\nFurthermore , displaying a colorful and luxurious cinematography by Flabio Martinez Labiano, as well as a stirring and pulsing score Harry Gregson-Williams . This increasingly potent thriller was compellingly produced Jaume Collet-Serra, Mercedes Gamero, Juan Sola. The motion picture was well directed by Nimr\u00f3d Antal. He is best known for writing and directing the Hungarian-language film Kontroll (2003), which won numerous awards, including the Award of the Youth at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival and the Golden Hugo at the Chicago International Film Festival, as well as a European Film Award nomination for Best film . Antal's first American feature movie , Vacancy (2007), starring Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson, was released on April 20, 2007 getting sucess enough. His second American film, Armored (2009), was released in December 2009 and with American star-studded cast. Nimr\u00f3d Antal was hired for \u00a8Armored\u00a8because producers enjoyed Antal's earlier films \u00a8Kontroll\u00a8 and \u00a8Vacancy\u00a8 and subsequenly filming a nice sequel : \u00a8Predators\u00a8. This remarkable and decent action film will appeal to thriller buffs and fans of the big stars appearing here and there. Well worth watching. So it's worth seeing , specially for the Liam Neeson fans."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think I hate this movie primarily due to two reasons: my love for Liam Neeson and the stark disparity between the film's promised premise and its actual execution. It was going for less action and more a gripping, high-stakes thriller but sadly, even in that aspect, it falls short. While I wouldn't go as far as labeling it horrendous, it's not worth a trip to the cinema, despite having done so myself lol. It's reminiscent of the kind of film you might casually watch on daytime TV to pass time in a hotel room. It reminds me of Dstv in Africa, when we were traveling or on holiday and the hotel/motel tv only had like 10 channels all with poor signal... this is the kinda thing you'd find playing on the movie channel.\n\nBlink and you might miss it, but the opening credits show it's based on another film \"Retribution El Desconocido,\" which excited me even though I haven't watched the original, but because the comparison with \"The Departed\" and \"Infernal Affairs\" crossed my mind, assuming that if the original movie warranted a remake, it must have been great, suggesting the remake had potential, I thought. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. I didn't really know anything about the movie other Liam Neeson is in it, plus it was a Regal mystery movie too.\n\nThe film is really just a deterrent of raising kids later in life. I always say that your kid's potentially having their rebellious teenage phase at while you're 60 would suck ass. While it's not universally true, Zach, the son in the movie, really resembles kids from my high school days who had similar behavior due to having older parents, which made disciplining hard. That's what stood out to me in the entire movie.\n\nI didn't like that the the most unsubtle hints were being dropped with all the TVs on the news channels at the start. The hints couldn't have been less subtle, yet the characters somehow managed to ignore them completely.\n\nThe explosions were cool, probably the only thing I enjoyed about the movie. They reminded me action sequences from movies from the 2010s. However, the movie heavily relied on Liam Neeson, even though he didn't have much to work with, so not even he could save this. If you've watched any of Neeson's other movies, this one might leave you feeling deceived, as it hints at possibly following the familiar pattern of his iconic \"I will find you, and I will kill you\" action flicks, but takes a different direction instead, despite him delivering similar threats.\n\nNothing about the movie was convincing. Even during the most tense moments, the emotions failed to translate properly, leaving me disengaged from the plot, it lacked that tense, suspenseful, edge of the seat vibe. The actors' performances lacked conviction, and the unoriginal dialogue in the script only exaggerated the issue. The plot itself wasn't believable, heavily relying on characters making illogical choices. Particularly the police, they could've asked questions, but they were way too easily and quickly convinced he was the villain not the villain. The car chases were whack as well, expecting us to believe that dozens police cars were incapable of stopping a single SUV. The entire execution appeared sloppily put together. The decision to involve his unsupervised wife as he was a suspect seemed questionable too. The police investigator seemed perpetually befuddled and uncertain, displaying some of the weakest negotiation skills and poker face I've seen in a movie. The kid was frustrating, something I hate about a character is when, despite others risking their lives to save them, adamantly refuse the help they're being given. The only potentially convincing twist that could have saved the movie for me would have been if it was revealed that that the lead detective was actually complicit and working for the opposing side.\n\nAnyway, as I said earlier it's not as horrendous as I'm making it out to be but I still think it's less than mediocre and not worth a trip to the cinema."

In my view, this 1-hour 30-minute cinematic experience was nothing short of enjoyable from start to finish. The relentless cascade of events held my attention captive throughout, leaving no room for even a moment's boredom. What struck me particularly was the way the film delicately delved into the realm of drama, shining a poignant spotlight on the far-reaching consequences of divorce, particularly when it comes to its impact on innocent children.\n\nAs someone who values the emotional resonance of a movie, I found that this narrative hit the mark. The characters' struggles felt real and relatable, allowing me to connect with their journeys on a personal level. When I emerged from the theater, a sense of contentment enveloped me, confirming that this film had succeeded in its mission to captivate and entertain. While opinions on films can certainly be subjective, I believe it's essential to recognize the merit of a production that manages to leave its audience not only entertained but also contemplative about the nuances of life."

The editing was actually pretty good but there are lots of gaps that have you wondering \"what's taking so long?\". I think this could have been 2-3 stars better with some decent writing and less predictability with many of the characters. It was just very shallow and Liam deserves a lot better."

The film follows Matt Turner (Neeson), a financier who is threatened by a mysterious bomber while driving his son and daughter to school.\n\nThe film is watchable, but it feels like a remake of a Korean movie I've seen before. The plot is almost identical, and the acting is typical Liam Neeson.\n\nNeeson is a good actor, but he's been playing the same role in the same type of movie for over a decade now. It's starting to get a bit stale.\n\nThe supporting cast is also decent, but they don't have much to do. The film is all about Neeson's character, and everyone else is just window dressing.\n\nThe action sequences are well-choreographed and exciting, but they're also very predictable. If you've seen one Liam Neeson action movie, you've seen them all.\n\nOverall, Retribution is a watchable but unoriginal film. It's perfect for a rainy day rental, but it's not something I would recommend going to the theater to see."

Nothing new, something of a mashup of Speed,Crank, and Phone. Booth. Really.\n\nSecond, and much worse, is the development towards the end - and the end itself. When the movie reaches its final sequences, there are plenty of moments when Liam Neeson's character could escape the situation, but he doesn't. The police response makes no sense at all. And worse, MUCH worse, is the ending, where essentially they forget all about how gravity works - the idea that it pulls you down, not sideways, and produce a completely unsatisfying end that leaves you with that feeling that you've just thrown 90 min of your life away (the worst thing is: this could be easily avoided, the director just decided to add a minute of tension, while making Newton and Galileo shake in their graves)."

In the vein of Commuter or Non-Stop, Neeson is once again embroiled into the centre of a mystery that has him pegged as the villain by an unknown assailant threatening his life and other innocents around him. However, the former films had better characters, pacing, action, execution and above all else....an intriguing and well guided story. Retribution just seems lazy in the acting department aside from the daughter who was the most believable and least annoying. Everyone else just seemed to be saying their lines or even phoning them in. The story was just too weak with no twists or any big reveals. The female characters for the most part were so infuriating while the rest were just dumb. There was no outsmarting or witty actions taken by the protagonists, there was no real struggle in the back and forth department to make me think that any of the main characters posed any sort of threat or challenge. The villain himself was not intimidating nor menacing at all and essentially just a voice. That and a lack of action or any real suspense left this feeling like a mediocre attempt at a thriller that didn't feel believable. The only saving grace for this movie was that it was compacted into 90 minutes so everything happens quite quickly and the ball just kept rolling after that with no real down time. The explosions were also very well done, realistic and well captured. All in all I didn't feel that invested aside from just wanting to see how it unfolded which is something but not much else."

This deadly bomb will explode if they stop & get out of the car.\n\nRetribution is a mind-blowing film. It doesn't deserve all the negative reviews. Director Nimrod Antal has given us a movie that strays from the typical ingredients of the classic Liam Neeson action project, the likes of which we've seen, since the iconic Taken(2008). Don't expect tons of hand-to-hand combat sequences. The majority of Retribution takes place in the car. The set pieces are fantastic. The suspense is maintained brilliantly, throughout the course of its runtime. Liam Neeson is spectacular as Matt Turner. Neeson portrays a wide range of emotions, with ease & panache. Lilly Aspell is phenomenal as Emily Turner. Aspell keeps going from strength to strength as a young actress & has a long & bright future ahead of her, in Hollywood. Jack Champion is outstanding as Zach Turner. Noma Dumezweni is great as Angela Brickman. Embeth Davidtz is awesome as Heather Turner. Matthew Modine is excellent as Anders Muller. The supporting cast is perfect. Retribution is a must watch for Liam Neeson fans. Go in with an open mind about what to expect & you will have a blast!"

This could have been a lot better but I think Neeson is just on the money train now and like Mel Gibson and Nicholas Cage, they will show up in any old shite. Cinematography is dreadful too. This is a B movie at best. It takes a much better story line to pull off the single venue/scene type movie. It needed to be filled out a lot more."

The dialogue is horrible with people asking questions that don't need to be asked and having conflicts when there are bigger issues.

But the only real attraction here is Neeson as the ultimate dad. In terms of age and experience, he's probably the world's toughest grandpa. Returning to this film, firstly, the plot revolves around the same premise mentioned in the trailer: there's a bomb in the car, and they can't get out. Secondly, the targets of the explosion are people who have a deep friendship with Neeson. Thirdly, all the tension and struggle involve children on the same car. What makes it somewhat different is that in Neeson's previous movies, there was always that powerful line, 'I will find you,' and the endings were about him punishing the bad guys. Unfortunately, this film lacks that heroism and doesn't have the emotional depth of Korean star 'Woo-jin Jo."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I really liked it and I was so hyped about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I really enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious. Sadly, the storyline wasn't very well written, nor well-explained (especially, the ending) and it was kinda simple. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and kinda likeable. Also, the casting of the movie was nice and their acting was descent. Gladly, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and there were too many epic car chase scenes. The killcount of the movie wasn't bloody, at all and most death scenes were done off-screen, so nothing explicit was shown. Moreover, the killer reveal was kinda unpredictable, but it wasn't very well-explained, so I didn't really enjoyed it. Overall, \"Retribution\" was an enjoyable action film, adventurous, fast-paced and I would definitely recommend it to my friends."

The film is a remake of a Spanish movie El Desconocido, which itself was seemingly inspired by Speed.\n\nLiam Neeson stars as Matt Turner. A hedge fund manager in Germany which is in serious trouble.\n\nWhile taking his annoying kids to school, Turner gets a phone call from an unknown caller telling him there's a bomb in his car. He needs to keep driving and follow a set of instructions or else his car will be blown up.\n\nTurner acquiesces but his annoying kids are slow on the uptake. Turner knows that he is being set up and the unknown person is after the millions he has stashed in a secret bank account in Dubai.\n\nRetribution is an absurd movie. The cops think Turner is the villain behind it all. There is no shock in the reveal. It is dumb and Neeson makes it better than it should be."

The acting is sub-par, the villain is ridiculously dumb, and the ending is abrupt.\n\nYou can clearly tell that this movie was done by old men because the kids' characters were stereotypical and stupid. The edgy rebellious teen and the young naive girl roles are put there just so that they have a longer cast. You could take them out of the movie and it would be exactly the same. Basically every character in this movie was some sort of stereotype, with little to no character building or arc whatsoever.\n\nThe bad guy was just ridiculous, just another stereotypical overly arrogant guy with a voice changer. Some of his lines had me cringing and wondering if it was satire before realizing that it was supposed to be a genuine line. No one who was trying to hold people hostage would do the things and say the things that this guy said.\n\nI will say that while the acting from Liam Neeson and Matthew Modine wasn't terrible, it definitely felt half hearted. The twist near the end wasn't too bad either, and I was tense for a couple rare moments in the movie.\n\nOverall, a boring movie that had me scrolling IMDb and being more interested in the question \"what do I know them from\" than the actual movie and actors themselves, thereby ruining the point of this movie: to be suspenseful and to pull you in. Don't waste your money and just go see something else. If you really wanna watch it, wait for it to come out on a streaming site or some random pirate site, so that you waste your time at home instead of out at a pricey theater."

The characters of the children are not horrible brats, as are in so many films now. The wife is pretty much only a sketch, but the important characteristics of all the characters are filled in enough, at the beginning of the film, to satisfy any need for back story.\n\nIt's an action-filled adventure, that drives quickly to its resolution. Some have commented that the \"third part\" seemed flat. I do wonder what movie they might have been watching - not this one.\n\nI have a theory. I've noticed with movies made in Europe, lately, that there are a *lot* of bad ratings. I figure it's because some people can't wrap their heads around a European setting and vibe. I also consider that perhaps to some people, all European movies must be like the Bourne series in order to satisfy them. *shrug* I did notice in the credits that there is shared production with some Canadian, Quebecois organizations. To some people, this will automatically deduct another couple of points from their rating.\n\nI try to understand why accomplished, really enjoyable films like this get so much hate. I suspect trolls here, as in so many social media interactions, now.\n\nIf a film gets high ratings and the review seems reasonable, give the film a shot and find out for yourself."

I'm not sure if this film is a precursor to what we can expect for the balance of 2023 and into 2024. One reviewer went as far as to suggest this screenplay was written by Chat GPT. It seems the exception when we watch something that is unique and well written. Are we so discerning and in need of escape that we have come to accept re-releases, versions 3,4 and 5 .... true stories that have been adapted, rather than creative, thought provocative and unique new writing that was apparent in the film releases of the 80's, 90's and 2000?

Neeson plays Matt Turner, a bank executive who receives a bomb threat while driving his children to school. The caller tells him that his car will explode if he stops or gets out.\n\nTurner is forced to follow the caller's instructions and drive around the city while trying to figure out who is behind the threat and how to save his family. The film is mostly set inside the car, which creates a sense of claustrophobia and suspense.\n\nNeeson gives a solid performance as Turner, but the supporting cast is less developed. The plot is also somewhat predictable, and there are a few plot holes. However, the film does have some exciting action sequences, and the suspense is maintained throughout.\n\nOverall, Retribution is a decent action thriller that is worth watching if you are a fan of Liam Neeson or the genre. However, it is not without its flaws, and it is unlikely to stick with you long after the credits have rolled.\n\nRecommended for: fans of Liam Neeson and action thrillers\n\nNot recommended for: viewers looking for a film with a complex plot or well-developed characters."

It's bad.\n\nIt's a strange kind of bad that really does feel like this screenplay was generated by ChatGPT. Nearly all of the dialogue is stilted and generic, and the story moves kind of haphazardly, as though a machine were calculating what was the next appropriate action movie plot point to throw in next.\n\nI guess it's better than many of the other beige action flicks Neeson has churned out over the years, but it's still far from good."

He does a good job with this, although the script doesn't give him a lot to work with. It played like it was written by ChatGPT.

He does none of that in this film.\n\nThis is the kind of thriller you'll probably only watch once.\n\nThe film is suspenseful, yet frustrating at the same time because Liam Leeson's character doesn't communicate well with other characters and doesn't try to figure out how to outmaneuver the phone caller.\n\nThe dialogue is terrible.\n\nThere are some serious holes in how the villain was able to actually do what was done.\n\nThe kids in the movie are annoying with their constant bickering that it's hard to feel endeared to them or anyone in the film, really.\n\nI was surprised by how wooden some of the acting was.\n\nThe title of the movie doesn't match the content of the movie other than to serve as a red herring.\n\nNo humor to balance the serious drama.\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS: Some German is spoken with English subtitles in only a few scenes.\n\nBombs explode in cars, killing people.\n\nSome profanity."

I made a mistake and this a warning to all of you., even if you don't have anything clever to do, and you want to watch this @#%. DON'T!!!! It is better to watch grass grow. Way more interesting!!!!\n\nRetribution\" is a film that completely lost itself in its ambitions and turned into a catastrophe that will remain etched in the memories of viewers, but not for its artistic merits. This feature-length failure, with its unrealistic plot, clumsy direction, and a lack of any profound meaning, deserves nothing but harsh criticism.\n\nOne of the main problems with the film \"Retribution\" is its entirely unconvincing plot. The film attempts to deal with the serious theme of revenge but quickly gets lost in a multitude of disconnected events and plot twists that are simply senseless. Viewers will wonder why the main characters make the decisions they do because their behavior lacks any sense and does not follow pre-established motives or character traits. This inconsistency in characterization and storytelling makes the film nearly impossible to follow.\n\nThe direction of this film also deserves sharp criticism. The camera often wanders without a clear focus, and the editing is incomprehensible, often leaving viewers confused and disoriented. The director seems to have tried to achieve some kind of visual originality, but instead, it achieves only chaos and an inability to follow the film's plot. Additionally, the use of special effects is unconvincing and often comical, further contributing to the film's poor quality.\n\nThe performances in \"Retribution\" are far from impressive as well. The lead actors fail to convey deep emotions or build any authentic connection with the audience. The dialogue is often unnatural and dull, making it difficult for viewers to connect with the characters and their fates. Furthermore, several supporting characters appear without any reason or purpose, further complicating an already confusing story.\n\nApart from the poor execution, \"Retribution\" also suffers from a lack of originality. The film relies on well-worn revenge tropes and clich\u00e9s, offering nothing new or fresh. The plot feels like it's pieced together from parts of other films, without any authentic contribution or creativity. Viewers will feel like they've seen this story many times before, and often in better renditions.\n\nThe lack of deep meaning or thematic richness also leaves \"Retribution\" feeling empty and unsatisfying. The film tries to convey some sort of moral message or profound meaning but remains shallow and unconvincing. Revenge is depicted as an empty and meaningless act but without any deep exploration or critical analysis of this theme. As a result, the film leaves no lasting impression on the audience and is quickly forgotten once the cinema lights go out.\n\nIn conclusion, the film \"Retribution\" is an endlessly poor cinematic endeavor that gets lost in its ambitions and fails to deliver any meaningful or satisfying content. A weak plot, unconvincing direction, lack of originality, and a lack of deep meaning make this film an unnecessary addition to the world of cinema. Viewers should avoid this film like the plague and instead seek something that will provide a genuine cinematic experience. \"Retribution\" is an empty and unsuccessful attempt at art that will be quickly forgotten, and unfortunately, that's all this film deserves.\n\nSo DONT!!!!"

        "review_title": "An Honest Remake, But Too Soft",
        "review_detailed_main": "Retribution (2023) : Movie Review -\n\nRetribution Movie Review: Nimr\u00f3d Antal's action thriller Retribution sees Liam Neeson take the lead role. Based on the Spanish flick \"El desconocido\" (2015), Retribution restores all the original elements but seems too soft for today's audiences. Actually, remaking a 2015 flick that hasn't gotten a high repeat value or universal acclaim wasn't a good idea in the first place, but technically it was a safe bet. The script did not demand a huge budget, long hours, or any transformations, so it sums things up quickly. That's easy, but somebody has said the right thing: \"Easy is boring\". You need something exciting and thrilling just to add one more layer to your decent watch, and the product should land safely. Retribution gets to that decent point, but not to that one extra layer.\n\nRetribution revolves around bank financier Matt Turner (Liam Neeson), who is more busy at work than his family. He thinks everything's alright with his wife, son, and daughter, but it isn't. One day, Matt is off to leave his children at school in a car, and he receives an anonymous call on a cellphone that has been left inside and is told that a bomb has been placed under each of the car's seats, set to explode if any of them leaves their seated position. The unknown caller asks Matt to do everything he says, and as we all know, he wouldn't give easy tasks. From money scams to murder, framing, and destroying one's identity, Matt's life is turned upside down. Can he get it back and save his children?\n\nRetribution is a wannabe revenge drama that hardly has any sensible revenge theories. On the positive side, it is a very engaging hostage drama. You might have seen hostess dramas set in a godown, room, or house, but never inside a car. Retribution scores high in those attributes. One can feel the pressure that's built inside the vehicle and the way those three characters and one horrible voice behave. What goes wrong is the shortening process. The best thing about Retribution is that it's pacy and short, and the worst thing is that it's too short for a complete feature film experience. Predictability is caused by the remake factor, but it wouldn't be there for first-timers. The script has completeness intellectually but is incomplete as a thrilling ride. A little bit of extension to the storyline would have made a good difference.\n\nTalking about performances, Retribution is all about Liam Neeson's acting finesse. This man suits the age, look, and personality of the character, but more than that, it's his own charisma that makes it look better. \"I can't,\" says Matt, dropping his gun. Watch out for Neeson's expression and the situational brilliance provided by him. Noma Dumezweni shines in that one particular scene when she has a conversation with Matt, aka Liam. Matthew Modine will surprise you, despite limited screen space, while Embeth Davidtz underperforms, unexpectedly. The supporting roles of Lilly Aspell, Jack Champion, Arian Moayed, and others are somewhat noticeable.\n\nRetribution's strength lies in its screenplay, even though the storyline is a bit pulpy. El desconocido showed the protagonist in a bad light as a dishonest person, while Retribution is way too mild in presenting the hero. It derives a lot from the sympathetic image of the hero, as we see his children and even the cops being too supportive towards him. It's generous and lovable occasionally-not fully, though. The technical aspects are okay, with a special mention to the background score. Flavio Labiano's camerawork is fine, and Steven Mirkovich's editing doesn't let you have a nap. Nimr\u00f3d Antal's return to the movies after 7 years may be alright, but I still prefer that aggressive Antal from Predators (2010). Moviemaking is far different now, so he must update himself. It's mandatory when you are remaking a so-so one-time film. Retribution is a one-time watch too, but how many people prefer that nowadays?\n\nRATING - 5/10*"

        "review_detailed_main": "For me, the movie was enjoyable even after all the flaws. The story was simple old fashioned car bomb thriller, the screenplay was good as you don't feel bored, the direction could have been little bit more tight but overall director did a good work, the performances could have been a little bit more better as you fail to connect with the characters that much. The parents relationship felt half baked as you don't connect with their emotions. The ending was also abruptly ended with nothing to know what happened next.\n\nYes, the movie was not perfect and easily forgettable but it doesn't deserve so much negativity. You should give this movie a try, you will enjoy it keeping in mind no expectations."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's funny how almost all Liam Neeson action movies are pretty much the same thing. In Retribution, Liam Neeson is a hedge fund executive who when tasked with the unusual job of driving his kids to school, gets a phone call from an anonymous man who informs them of a bomb in their car. What his demands are and how they get out of this situation are what Retribution is all about.\n\nSo, all fine and dandy. That sounds like a fun premise. You check the trailer out, that looks pretty fun too. But that's where the \"fun\" ends. This movie ends up being probably the weakest version of the concept imaginable. It wasn't very exciting, and while yes, it did manage to keep our attention throughout, it felt like nothing worthwhile came of it. With bizarrely amateur cinematic choices; from poorly written dialogue, to characters being wholly irrational, to predictable twists and forced sentiments... The movie feels like it's missing out on a lot of potential.\n\nTo think that if only a little bit more care and thought had gone into the writing, it would have at least been a decent enough action thriller. But what ends up being, is an almost passable action movie that feels worn out by the end of it."

The film is certainly better than Liam Neeson's previous films (Blacklight, Memory) to that date and there was some deceit though thrills as the story hasn't too far fetched. Arguably the strongest Neeson has acted in a while as he does seem more motivated in this role.\n\nNow the story isn't exactly original but it is certainly watchable and there is a certain charm in watching Neeson being hostaged and held captive. As others have pointed out, the film is somewhat like Speed (1994) but set in a car. Also reminded of Phone Booth (2002). However both those films are easily superiors. Although that doesn't mean this film isn't worth the watch. Don't expect too much, it's solid enough."

I I understand Liam has been through a horrendous period of his life with the loss of his wife and so is probably trying to just take part in any film to occupy his time, but that does not make the film, or Liam any better. You can almost see he's give up on acting, which is quite sad for an actor of his calibre. In general, unfortunately a rubbish film, and that's being kind."

        "review_title": "Liam Neeson is Back!!!!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Liam Neeson has been producing generic programmers for the past decade, hoping to become a successful action hero like \"Taken.\" However, the release of Neil Jordan's \"Marlowe\" this year suggested Neeson was tired of his current filmography and wanted to do something different. Despite the lack of success, Neeson was trying to do something worthy of his talents. His latest project, \"Retribution,\" snubbed out any effort in \"Marlowe,\" leaving it devoid of thrills, excitement, or purpose. The film seems to have been designed to play in empty multiplexes during the last weeks of summer. The film's lack of thrills and excitement makes it seem like it was designed to be played in empty multiplexes. \"Retribution\" is a remake of a Spanish thriller, \"El desconocido,\" which was first released in 2015. It is the third remake of the Spanish thriller since its debut in 2015. The screenplay by Chris Salmanpour is formulaic and lacks distinction, with no interesting or likable characters. The kids are annoying and the action beats are excitement-free, with even the big twist in the final scenes being obvious to most audience members. The screenplay resembles a version of Mad Libs for writers seeking formulaic scripts. The characters are not particularly interesting or likable, and the director, Nimr\u00f3d Antal, handles the action beats in a resoundingly excitement-free manner. Liam Neeson's Retribution is a suspenseful film that follows Matt Turner, a Berlin-based hedge-fund manager, who is in a dangerous situation with a bomb under his seat. Neeson's jurisdiction is limited to the driver's seat of a Mercedes, and he soon finds himself barking threats and solving mysteries from a golf cart. Matt's children, a moody teenager (Jack Champion) and a button-cute grade-schooler (Lilly Aspell), are in the backseat, and the culprit is on the phone. Matt is a workaholic who prioritizes his clients over his family, but he remains a Liam Neeson character, as he slugs a boxing bag before leaving the car. The film showcases Neeson's unique skills in AARP ass-kicking and his ability to control various forms of transportation. Retribution is a Spanish thriller directed by Nimr\u00f3d Antal, a no-frills genre journeyman known for his work on Vacancy, Armored, and Predators. The film follows actor Ryan Reynolds as he navigates a real-time, single-vehicle scenario, focusing on the protagonist's phone calls and the situation surrounding his family. The film resembles the 90s classic Speed, with its plot breaking its villain's rules throughout. The suspense peaks when Neeson's family man must pry his kids' smart phones away without frightening them with the truth of the hostage situation. The film also features a climactic battle against the odds, with Matt, the hero, ignoring his phone calls for minutes on end. The film's premise resembles Speed, but with a more casual and casual approach to the plot."

The little Emily girl was soo pretty and adorable, her scared reactions were so cute and heartrending... Liam Neeson once again is sooo good in the action thriller genre. Solid 7.5 out of 10, could've had a less flatter ending but the way he finally got out was smart and well executed. Really gripping, relentlessly thrilling movie.

No person would react like that and you ca tell the writers are artificially holding the story to create false tension rather than thinking how it would naturally evolve. He fails to explain to everyone important why the problem exists. They make his character inconsistent - he's successful because of his ability to communicate but then he doesn't say the things someone like that would say. Unnatural portrayal of relationships and of kids' behaviors'. The most important conversations people would have in a situation like that (including with his kids) and he fails to say the obvious things anyone would say and fails to do many of the obvious things people would do.

The cinematography is good and manages to have daring camera movements. The performances are excellent, Liam Neeson and Embeth Davidtz show their great acting skills, for his part Jack Champion shows that he is no longer a young film promise, he has already fully established himself as an actor with three films released in less than a year and where he demonstrates his talent, and Lilly Aspell at her young age gives an incredible performance. It's good to see Neeson again in a quality movie like \"Retribution.\""

Nobody answers a single question, noone reacts to what is being said, noone tries to explain to the police what is going on. And what is being said is totally unnatural, as if written by some drunk AI. And, once again - listen, film makers everywhere: There are no Interpol or Europol agents. Those are administrative organizations, set up to simplify collaboration between national police forces. Only German police would be allowed to carry guns in Germany.\n\nLiam Neeson is, normally, a really good actor, but it is sad to see him accept such dysmal roles just to make some more money. Surely he has enough saved up by now to be able to turn down awful projects like this. Time to quit while you're ahead, Liam."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. Fully deserving of a tip of the cap is Liam Neeson, who used the popularity of TAKEN (18 years ago) to create a new sub-genre: the annual Liam Neeson action film where he gets to be the hero. This latest is from director Nimrod Antal (PREDATORS, 2010) with Christopher Salmanpour adapting the screenplay from Alberto Marini's 2015 original, EL DESCONOCIDO (Spain). This is actually the third remake of that film, including those from Germany and South Korea.\n\nAn artful assembling of a bomb takes place over the opening credits, and then we cut to Matt Turner (Neeson) getting his morning workout on the boxing bag hanging in his loft. Other than fast-driving, that's the biggest action-hero moment Liam gets in the film, although he is in the middle of plenty of other explosive moments. We quickly recognize Matt Turner as a successful Financial executive living in Berlin who is too consumed with work to be an attentive husband to his wife (an underused Embeth Davidtz) or involved father to his kids, Zack (Jack Champion, AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER) and Emily (Lilly Aspell, played young Diana in the two Wonder Woman movies). Of course, everyone recognizes his there-not-there approach except him.\n\nGuilted into the rare task of taking the kids to school one morning, Matt takes a call from an \"unknown caller\" on an unrecognized cell phone located in the console of his car. The disguised voice informs Matt that there is a bomb in his car that will detonate if he gets out, and there is a remote device that will allow the bomb to be set off if Matt doesn't do exactly what the caller says. The plan revolves around big money, and Matt's kids begin to question if their father has cheated people. Matt's awkward behavior doesn't put them at ease. This ordeal involves other people as well, and soon a Europol detective (Noma Dumezweni, THE LITTLE MERMAID, 2023) is involved and assuming Matt is the real threat.\n\nWith no apologies, the film borrows heavily from SPEED (1994) and PHONE BOOTH (2002), as time becomes a crucial element, along with following precise instructions. As viewers, we are right there with the kids - trying to figure out what's happening, why it's happening, and who is behind it. Most of the time is spent in Matt's Mercedes, and we see two other luxury vehicles (Maserati, Tesla) on the wrong end of bombs. There are some holes in how the story progresses, as well as some inconsistencies in the look of the vehicle - clean, dirty, damaged, undamaged - although the weakest point is Matt's absurd call with a client early on. This was obviously written by someone with very little business acumen. Matthew Modine has a supporting role and one of the film's producers is Jaume Collet-Serra, a frequent collaborator on the many Liam action-movies. This one should work for those who enjoy the thrill of the moment before moving on to the next one.\n\nOpening in theaters on August 25, 2023."

        "review_detailed_main": "Set in Berlin, Hedge Fund manager Matt Turner (Liam Neeson) reluctantly drives his children Zach (Jack Champion) and Emily (Lilly Aspell) to school as his wife Heather has a prior engagement while Matt has an important business meeting. After getting in the car, Matt hears an unfamiliar ringtone and after picking it up is informed by a voice on the phone that pressure sensitive triggers in the seats of the car have been activated and will be trigger if he or his children leave the car or remotely detonated if he deviates from the caller's instructions.\n\nRetribution is the third remake of the Spanish action-thriller El desconocido following the 2018 German version Don't. Get. Out! And the 2021 Korean version Hard Hit. The film began development in 2017 and like many of Neeson's recent works is an international co-production where the modest budget is played for reduced risk among the various financiers with the film typically making a profit through pre-sales and down the line revenues even if it's theatrical or critical reception is middling at best. Retribution is a hollow remake of the Spanish original and is a generic rendition of prior takes on this material with nothing to really add besides Neeson's name.\n\nMuch like the Korean film Hard Hit, director Nimrod Antal I feel deflates the tension by having the camera often travel outside the confines of the car in order to get more \"dynamic\" shots of the car chases rather than experience them in a more on the ground fashion of the Spanish original. At least it keeps the flow more focused by not introducing the police characters by cutting away to them too early, so that's a slight point in the film's favor. While initially it seems like Neeson is trying to play against the growling revenge seeking anti-hero he's been typecast with post taken, around the halfway point the movie does away with that and leans into it including changing the original context of why this is happening in the first place and changing the more simple motivations of the original or Korean remake and replacing it with a convoluted plan that's filled with so many potential missteps it's baffling trying to listen to it justify itself during the requisite \"talking villain\" moment.\n\nRetribution is the kind of middle of the road product that's tailor made for watching on streaming services or redbox where it belongs. It's well-made enough, but it also stands in the shadow of superior versions that are readily available and while international viewers can experience the premise in English it's in a less impressive form."

The characters lacked depth, making it challenging to connect with them.\n\nIn terms of direction and cinematography, there were some visually appealing shots, but they couldn't fully compensate for the weak storyline. The action sequences, while present, didn't manage to capture the excitement one would expect from an action film.\n\nThe script and dialogue left a lot to be desired, with none memorable lines or moments. As for the acting, it's safe to say that it fell short of expectations. There were instances of subpar performances that detracted from the overall experience.\n\nIn summary, 'Retribution 2023' had potential, but it suffered from a weak directing, underdeveloped characters, and lackluster acting. While it might still find an audience among die-hard action movie fans, I would recommend it with reservations to those who are less forgiving of these shortcomings."

Movie is essentially Speed (1994) but without the speed limit and worse.\n\nThe movie tries to be an intelligent and intense thriller but falls flat on both ends, the performances are dreadful, the child actors made me cringe when they spoke and Neeson sounds oddly tired. Theres this opening scene where a car explodes for no reason. Soundtrack was nothing of note, characters weren't fleshed out enough for me to care, there's too many plot holes that irritated me while watching, action scenes that were bland and a twist that was so predictable that it genuinely made me groan.\n\nI'd say that there's some nice explosions here and there but that's basically it. Overall, not a great time and I really don't recommend this to anyone, even Liam Neeson fans. If you want a better movie with a similar premise, watch Speed instead."

There isn't much of the usual Action tropes of blood and explosions. What you'll get are intense dialogues and bracing scenes.

        "review_detailed_main": "Liam Neeson seems to be the perfect Joe in these type of suspense movies. I hope he does a few more before he retires, this movie has a few good twists and keeps you guessing if he's a really bad guy or someone being very intelligently set up to take a huge fall. His family is a total mess at the beginning and gives the impression that he's not who he seems to be, well written, I saw a few flaws that could have easily been fixed, but under the stress of his situation, it's quite likely he never had the time to consider them at all. No questionable content whatsoever, no nudity or other un family shots, a bit violent at times and the action is non stop. A very believable story and one that could easily be a real life event for some unfortunate person. Great to see Liam again in another suspense!!! Can't wait for the next one!!! Keep them coming!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Here is my unbiased review of the movie Retribution. Matt Turner, a financier, has absolutely no time for his family. But one fine day, he decides to become a good dad and drive his kids to school. However, he picked the wrong day. Why? Because that day, an unknown man planted a bomb beneath his seat and threatened to blow up the car. In #Retribution directed by Nimr\u00f3d Antal, Liam Neeson convincingly portrays a father who would stop at nothing to safeguard his children. The film has some watchable moments, but the climax is a bummer. I expected more tension and some brutal action. Rating 2.5/5."

The cast was fine. The story was just hard to follow, to actually know what was going on and the action sequences weren't all that exciting. In fact why am I even saying action sequences? There was barely any action in here. Nothing really but him driving around the whole time with his kids in the car and trying to figure out a solution to the bomb under the seat. The writing, if I can describe it at best, is just simply boring. It's nothing exciting or new or different in the slightest. If only they had given Liam at least a few stunts to do in this, but they gave him nothing to do at all unfortunately. I know for a fact they could've somehow incorporated a couple of stunts in here that he could've done. 1hr and 30 runtime? It felt like more than 2 hours of a drag to me. If you're looking for something to watch Liam Neeson in, it's definitely not Retribution. I'll tell ya that! He has a ton of other better movies out there! Please pass on this one. You're not missing anything..."

We didn't know the marital situation until part of the way through the movie when we find out his wife isn't where she is supposed to be.

In fairness, Liam has become another great figure for action movies in recent years. Him starring in this version of El Desconocido might add up, but the point is that it feels like the other films Liam has starred in. The story is similar to the original film, but with some changes. The motivations of the individual giving directions to Liam are different. The roles of the children are also reversed, placing the son as the eldest and the daughter as the youngest. The film does have tension and intrigue, but when compared to the original film, the intrigue here is a little softer. The story is much simpler and even somewhat short. It's not that it's a bad movie, here they wanted to make a simple thriller like the ones Hollywood usually makes and it manages to achieve that. Every version of this movie that exists simply adapts the story to its own setting. Retribution is an enjoyable film with exciting and tense moments. Its only flaw is having a level of intrigue that is below the original film. My rating for this movie is a 9/10."

When he answers, he hears a mysterious voice telling him that there is a hidden bomb under his car seat.\n\nIf Matt doesn't do exactly what the voice asks him to do, the person threatens to detonate the bomb. To protect his children, Matt does what is asked of him.\n\nSince the film Predators 13 years ago, Nimr\u00f3d Antal has not really directed an action film. He also has to work with a screenplay written by novice writer Christopher Salmanour. Unfortunately, the fact that this screenplay writer is still a novice is reflected in the final film. It sometimes seems as if he was continuing to write his screenplay while filming. There are many unclear choices and decisions that the criminal and his victim Matt make. Many ill-considered actions occur, the details of which are not always correct or are missing. In addition, moments are often repetitive.\n\nThe visual effects of explosions, for example, also do not seem very believable. As a result, the film also loses some of its tension level.\n\nLiam Neeson tries to give a good performance as the lead of the film, but thanks to the poor screenplay he gets few opportunities to do so. He also sometimes seems a bit unsure about what his characters should do next, because the screenplay still seems to have been written at that moment. Jack Champion and Lilly Aspell, who play his son and daughter in the film, have acted in better films in their nascent acting careers. Jack had a better role in Avatar: The Way of Water. Lilly Aspell also played the young version of Wonder Woman in the Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman films. Hopefully they will be cast in better films in their future acting careers."

And so Matt was being set-up by the mysterious caller so Matt could transfer the funds to a designated account. But along the way there were quite number of plot flaws. The twist reveal also offered more questions than answers, and didn't make sense considering what the characters went through.

Sure, Liam Neeson is a veteran by now (at portraying similar characters) but he actually looked tired in this movie having to portray yet another dad in peril, as if he, too, believed it was deja vu, deja vu... In all fairness, Liam Neeson is 71 years old already, so I have to commend him for still taking on physical roles in action thrillers.\n\nDespite the flaws, 'Retribution' was nevertheless still an exciting enough movie to keep me interested. It did feel more like a TV film than a mainstream movie, but it still provided a few thrills."

But it is only one and a half hour of what I consider to be a decent execution of a tense premise with lives on the line. Sadly, I thought that the story deflates after a point and it just tries to end itself in the only way people can expect. There are no action scenes at all and the \"car chases\" are pretty generic. No role or line was charming or memorable. And some developments are questionable.\n\nI'm having a hard time trying to come up with positives aside from \"it doesn't suck, even if it is somewhat boring and forgettable\".

He has become distant to his family, focusing more on his work and thus, he finds himself trapped in his own car, with a bomb under his seat. With the children in the backseat and a bomb that can be remotely triggered as well, he is at the mercy of a mysterious caller who tries to frame Matt Turner and steal the big money. How Matt finds a way to save his kids and reveal this mystery bomber, forms rest of the story.\n\nHaving watched the Spanish original and the Korean remake, I wasn't too keen on watching this remake, set in Berlin yet the location hardly has any impact on the narrative. Like the previous versions, this too almost succeeds with the captivating narrative. The problem with the original was the impact went down the moment the protagonist gets surrounded by the cops and the subsequent reveal was underwhelming. In this remake, the entire third act is changed.\n\nSadly, the changes made completely derails the film for taking easy route, skipping the melodrama. Unlike the original, the episode involving Matt's car being surrounded by cops is short. But what follows later, made me appreciate the Spanish and Korean versions better. Liam Neeson asusual carries the film, bringing in enough vulnerability before giving into his \"I will find you\" act. I am still going with a lenient rating because it's just fun to watch Liam Neeson on screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Retribution is already the third remake of the Spanish original El desconocido from 2015. In 2018, the German Steig. Nicht. Aus! And in 2021 the South Koreans came with Balsinjehan. Then of course the United States cannot be left behind with their version of the story and then of course you immediately use heavy artillery and cast none other than Liam Neeson. Why a simple story like this has no less than 4 versions from four different countries is a big mystery. The story is just very simple and thirteen in a dozen. The film has played a bit of a loan neighbor at Speed, but well more films do and it's not a one-on-one takeover of the story. Well, I have to admit that I haven't seen the three predecessors, so I don't have any comparison material and will only be able to judge Retribution as a film in itself. Neeson (who plays the role of Matt Turner in the film) needs no introduction of course. Next to Neeson, we see Matthew Modine playing as Matt Turner's friend and partner. Modine vaguely knows people as 'Dad' from Stranger Things, but of course you will also be able to recognize him from Full Metal Jacket and the recently published Oppenheimer.\n\nThe film is pretty standard and Liam Neeson does his thing very duly. He seems almost uninspired, as if he really didn't feel like making this movie at all. That is of course a shame, because it is mainly Neeson who has to make this film, because the story is really so terribly standard that you can't expect it to save the film. When Matt Turner gets in his car with his daughter, he puts the bomb in his car on edge. Later he also lets his son board and then the company is complete. You can't get off, because the bomb goes off as soon as the weight of the seats goes off. So far so good. Then Turner is called by a phone that has been placed in his car in advance and he has to go from place to place throughout Berlin to carry out assignments. I won't say I immediately realized how the fork was in the stem, but it didn't take me very long, because after about half an hour it's clear why it's all going. That may not even be such a big problem, but let the story run in such a way that you can still look at each other in the end: okay, that was quite well put together. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen and in addition to Liam Neeson's dutiful performance, the film also ingles in a predictable work.\n\nAfter running from hot to her for a while, the film reaches the climax that his friend's car is blown up. No, this is not a spoiler, because this is already shown in the trailer. Everything looks like Turner is to blame, when he doesn't even know what he did. Only my son and daughter know how it all works and if Matt also finds out that his wife wants to divorce him, there are plenty of motives for Matt of course. By the way, the film doesn't get really believable either. People are already looking for someone who places bombs in cars, so why would Matt put them in his own car, where his children are also in? When Matt is eventually trapped by police, who want to get the bomb out of his car, the Explosive Clearance Service stands next to it with bomb suits and they even let a robot drive to the car, because you have to be careful of course.\n\nAfter running from hot to her for a while, the film reaches the climax that his friend's car is blown up.

That just turned out not to apply to the detective who is just standing next to it in her Sunday clap. I mean of course you don't have to make realism, but this is just stupid and sloppy and completely unbelievable.\n\nRetribution has become a mediocre work, where in terms of acting it seems that Liam Neeson really didn't feel like it at all. He really does his job extremely duty and with a simple story like this, that is of course the death knell for such a film. After half an hour the surprise is over and you know how it all works and then it all becomes a race against time. That sounds like it's getting exciting, but unfortunately it won't. There are also a lot of stupid sloppiness in the film. If you expect Neeson to make a movie like Taken or one of the other cool movies in which he stole the absolute show, you will be disappointed. Incidentally, you see that the years are going to count nicely with Neeson and then you should actually no longer want to make these kinds of films in principle, although this is a dangerous statement from me as a great Sylvester Stallone enthusiast. Let's just keep in mind that it didn't work in this movie and it's to be hoped that Neeson really manages to bang his next movie again, because Retribution is just a moderately disappointing job."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't believe any of the positive reviews for this film; it is a terrible production in every way and giving it three stars is actually generous. Liam Neeson plays a successful business person who gets \"trapped\" inside his Mercedes with his children by a mysterious caller who has placed a bomb under the seat of the vehicle. Neeson is told to follow instructions and not leave his seat or the bomb will blow; absurdity ensues. One example is sufficient to convey the ludicrous nature of the plot. The cops refuse to believe Neeson after he desperately tells them there is a bomb under his seat, despite the fact his own kids are in the back of the vehicle and there were already multiple car bombs in the city that very day! What does it take for a guy to get any credibility with the cops? What would be his motivation in lying? Therein lies another problem with the film: The motivation of any of the characters is lacking; we don't know why anyone does what they do and the filmmakers seem to think this doesn't matter.\n\nThe holes in the plot and lack of character development could be overlooked if the movie was actually entertaining. This, however, was too much to ask. Neeson spends the whole movie planted on his butt behind the wheel of the car. A skilled production team might still make this situation tense and worthy, but that's not the case here. There's no action and the script fails to produce the tension we'd expect in a suspense film. The actors also seem to be disinterested; however, lousy scripts often lead to wooden acting.\n\nIf you're looking for a good suspense film, just rewatch one you've already seen. It's a guarantee you'll be better off than watching this mess for the first time."

It's a classic single location set up, essentially SPEED inside a car rather than a bus, but our ageing hero seems to be phoning in his performance and the action sequences are so outlandish as to be ridiculous.

It has a clear idea, but as time goes by it loses credibility. The characters lose reality in their roles and the story becomes monotonous, although at least it is dynamic.\n\nLiam Neeson may not seem to be at his best in this film, but the fault does not really lie with him, nor with the fact that he is older, but with the script and the lack of originality. There are many empty scenes and some absurd ones where, although Liam acts ten, you don't get to enjoy his essence. It's a shame because I think this actor is brilliant, and he has few films left.

If they had a bugger budget, more realistic dialogue and a better director they may have been able to make it more like Neesons previously typical quiet macho man revenge plot films. This one sadly just does not match up. Maybe time for Liam to retire from this genre now? I know he has become very typecast in this sort of role, but apart from the original Taken, the Irishman dies not suit this type of role naturally as other leading actors have. This film looks, feels and plays out as a quick, cheap, straight to stream film created on a spreadsheet to make a certain figure in return. Very poor fair for Neesons wooden skills and a small part for Modine who is hot off last year's Stranger Things.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Matt\" (Liam Neeson) is the high flying hedge fund partner who is taking his kids to school one morning when he gets a strange phone call from a strange phone. The voice at the end of the call warns him that he is sitting atop a weight-controlled bomb and that his family are in great danger should he not do as he is told. Just to reiterate that threat, he is to rendezvous with his colleague \"Sylvain\" (Arian Moayed) who is soon no long a concern! To add to the poor man's woes, when he tries to contact his wife he discovers that she is off meeting a lawyer! Can he salvage anything from this perilous, meticulously planned, scenario before they are all chum? For a while, here, Nimr\u00f3d Antal sustains a degree of menace as the mystery unfolds, but sadly - once it does, it's pretty obvious whom the protagonist actually is and the proceeding car chases make the art of simple urban road-blocking by the German police look just a little amateurish! The last twenty minutes are especially disappointing with a denouement that's not short on pyrotechnics but is short on just about everything else. It's a very derivative television movie that if you enjoy the genre, you probably won't hate - the pace sees to that. You won't remember it for long afterwards, though."

A half a$$ed attempt at robbing every cliche from every rubbish movie ever. Nope. Not even that bad. Worse. The plot holes, lack of ingenuity, low budget and complete lack of any substance makes this the worst movie I saw this year. I hate reality TV but think I would have preferred to watch Love Island. Liam should hang his head in shame because even an intellectually challenged chimpanzee could see this is a shocker.\n\nI'm off Liam. If he thinks a movie like this was worth making then I wish him the best in his retirement. Soo fricken bad....."

It made me want to watch Taken all over again to appreciate when a film was made solid. I don't really want to endear that again but it looks like Citizen Kane compared to this bon garbage. It started out looking promising that was the part that got me. This is maybe why I give it 3 or just because Liam Neison is in it. Otherwise avoid this stinker."

Neeson therefore drives around town trying to figure out how to get out of the situation whilst receiving various instructions from the bomber.\n\nThis largely unremarkable film is riddled with plot holes and a occasionally a rather sloppy script. It does in its favour have Neeson though who does have sufficient acting nous and overall star quality to just about keep you interested plus the last half hour, whilst unlikely, does get quite exciting enough for you forget the holes.\n\nPS - not wholly sure why it's called Retribution."

In my opinion, the SOLEMNLY SWEAR plot, and the awesome ending, are much better than this film, and they should make that book into a movie! The main character witnesses a car accident of a Mafia Don, and his wife, resulting the wife dying, is it murder? The driver receives threats not to testify.

The one thing this movie constantly makes you aware of is the fact that in real everyday life, people just don't listen! So, please just listen to every plea ignored by the various parties in the video. The director seems to have done everything wrong... on purpose!\n\nThere's no logical sensibility about anything in this movie, especially about Interpol's callous female police chief. He is given a ton of cases to solve with relevant information, but refuses to listen or believe any of them. This movie is just completely stupid annoying garbage.\n\nThis is Liam's most bad movie in a row, so we can only hope he's back to his good self in his next outing!"

The finale puts a point in the mediocrity of this picture.\n\nThe movie is also packed with clich\u00e9s - it is all over the place. However, it is still an action movie of some sort. Stupid, pointless, but a little bit exciting and in some places unexpected.\n\n3/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The storyline of Retribution revolves around Matt Turner (played by Neeson), a bank executive who receives a phone call from an attacker claiming there is a bomb in his car. Turner's scepticism fades when the bomb detonates in the trunk of his vehicle, leaving him with no choice but to comply with the assailant's instructions. This leads Turner on a chase through the city, where he must engage in perilous actions to ensure his and his family's survival.\n\nRetribution is a run-of-the-mill and predictable thriller that contains a few action sequences and an absurd twist ending. Liam Neeson delivers the only decent performance in the movie, although his character lacks depth, and his motivations remain unclear. The supporting characters are mostly forgettable. While the direction is competent, it lacks inspiration.\n\nRetribution's plot is riddled with inconsistencies and unresolved questions. For instance, it remains unclear why Turner has been targeted by this assailant or their intentions towards him. And, considering his age, Turner still manages to accomplish feats, like leaping out of a moving car or outpacing individuals.\n\nThe action scenes in the movie are well executed. But they don't leave a lasting impression. We've seen it all before - and done better. The twist ending is more silly than shocking and raises more questions than answers.\n\nThe direction of Retribution is competent yet lacking inspiration. Antal handles the action scenes okay but fails to bring any flair to the film. The soundtrack is forgettable and generic, while the cinematography is unremarkable.\n\nAfter watching Retribution I felt frustrated. Let down. I had hoped for a more suspenseful thriller. Instead, I got an unoriginal action movie with predictable twists. I wouldn't recommend Retribution to anyone because it falls short of being a worthwhile action flick. If you're seeking a gripping thriller, there are better choices available."

It's a decent premise along the lines of SPEED or PHONE BOOTH, but this movie is dullsville. Neeson is such a good actor he makes the film almost watchable, but that's about it. Do yourself a favor and skip this Liam Neeson outing, where his main set of skills seems to be talking on the phone and telling his kids in the back seat to mind him."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Retribution (2023)\", directed by Nimr\u00f3d Antal, promised to be an exciting race against time through the streets of Berlin, but instead, it turns out to be a disappointing journey into uncertain narrative territory lacking bite. The film follows Matt Turner (played by Liam Neeson), a high-finance broker who suddenly finds himself caught up in a dangerous game of cat and mouse. A bomb has been planted in his car, and under threat, he must carry out a series of commands to save his family. However, what could have been a gripping plot soon turns into a succession of clich\u00e9s and predictable scenes. Nimr\u00f3d Antal, an experienced director with a respectable filmography, seems to lose his way in this production, unable to capitalise on the potential of the source material. While some initial sequences suggest a certain originality, with inventive shots and an intriguing setting, the film soon loses itself in a labyrinth of poorly crafted narrative twists and uneven pacing. Liam Neeson, despite possessing undeniable gravitas, feels out of place in a role that doesn't allow him to shine. His performance, though solid, fails to lift the film from anonymity, becoming one of its weak points. The lack of emotional connection with the audience is crucial in maintaining interest, and its absence is keenly felt. Further exacerbating the film's flatness and lack of relevance is the lack of character development. The protagonists remain two-dimensional and uninteresting, unable to evoke empathy or engagement from the viewer. Even the villain, a fundamental element in this type of action thriller, comes across as flat and unthreatening. The director's technical choices, likely constrained by a limited budget, only serve to highlight the production's shortcomings. Sequences that could be adrenaline-fuelled are spoiled by uninspired direction and unconvincing special effects.\"Retribution (2023)\" proves to be a disappointment for fans of the action thriller genre. Despite its intriguing premise and talented cast, the film misses the mark, offering little more than a series of clich\u00e9s and an inconsistent plot. Anyone seeking an engaging and thrilling cinematic experience should look elsewhere."
