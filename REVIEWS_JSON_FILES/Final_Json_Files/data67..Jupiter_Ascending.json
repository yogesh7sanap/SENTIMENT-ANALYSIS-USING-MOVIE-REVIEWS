        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure how to start this review so I'll just get right into it: This movie isn't good. It makes no sense. There is no room to get immersed in this world because there is no story to relate to. It's all just stuff happening; fluff. Beautiful, well made fluff mind you, but at its core this movie is a steaming hot mess.\n\nHere's the plot from what I gathered: Mila Kunis is suddenly the majesty of the Earth and has to protect it from a bunch of rich douchebags that live in Jupiter's atmosphere who want to use it for harvesting grounds or something. It's a dumb plot, and every scene that tries to move the plot forward is a scene wasted. The only interesting parts of this movie are the visuals and Channing Tatum's character, but even he is given absolutely no character development. He's just a badass space agent, or something. I don't even remember.\n\nThe characters end up the same way they began - there was no journey to redemption or revelation for anyone. It was just do this, do that, stop this, go home, the end. And they try to include multiple stories, like Mila Kunis' relationship with her family (boooring); Caine (Tatum) and Stinger's (Sean Bean) history (wholly underdeveloped), the whole villain arc...\n\nThe villains in this movie are spoiled brats. Seriously. They're not scary, they're not intimidating, there was no point in the movie where I was like \"oh man sh*t is about to go down\"; there was just no intrigue. Their motives were all over the place. It's not worth trying to piece together every plot point they throw into the movie because it will just lead to confusion and disappointment, and eventually frustration when you realize how much potential was wasted in creating this massive universe. The lizards looked really cool. Why not have more of them? Oh we're just going to focus on the playboy brat now, okay.\n\nI really wanted to care about this universe. It has a Star Wars vibe in parts, like the \"royal\" wedding scene and the space battles, but there were no good characters to experience this adventure with. You're just watching things happen with no consequences, or at least none you cared about.\n\nThe acting was fine in this movie. Channing Tatum and Sean Bean in particular gave great performances, and Eddie Redmayne as the primary antagonist was decent as well. Yeah, he's an Academy Award winner, and as much as I hate to say it I have not seen The Theory of Everything yet but I loved him in Les Mis so I was really hoping he would save this movie. Unfortunately the material he's given is absolute garbage, so in an effort to make the character stand out, Redmayne give him a weird, eerie, whisper voice that was akin to a hundred year old man trying to force words out from the back of his throat. But hey, I think it worked. The guy is completely unlikeable so might as well give him a unique trait to remember him by. Good on Mr. Redmayne because he succeeded. The only things I will remember about this movie are the cool visuals, the wasted potential, and his creepy voice.\n\nDon't see this movie. Unless you want to see some really great CGI for a couple hours, which can be found in much better places by the way, you won't find anything worth salvaging from Jupiter Ascending. It was a nice effort but ultimately a swing and a miss."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll be upfront and warn those contemplating watching Jupiter Ascending that you need to go in with low expectations to enjoy the film. Unless your idea of what makes a film good is huge explosions, pretty characters prancing around in elaborate costumes and beautiful visuals. After all, who cares about plot, lines and pacing right?\n\nJupiter Ascending is really very much a visual feast but nothing more than that. The action sequences are generally well paced and I applaud the fact that CGI for the actions were kept minimal. The costumes are stunning (as are the actors).\n\nWhich is a great pity because, on paper, Jupiter Ascending really had potential.\n\nFor a start, like all sci-fi films, Jupiter Ascending is ambitious in its storytelling. An entirely different reality of an alternative universe with its own ecosystem, species and history is created. There are soldiers spliced with animal DNAs such as Caine (Channing Tatum) who has some wolf in him and Stinger (Sean Bean) who has some bee in him (guess where they got their names from?). There was potential to explore and mine all that richness for more stories but this is undermined by the weak delivery of the first film in what the studios were probably hoping would be a new franchise.\n\nWhile the plot of Jupiter Ascending was hackneyed, it had pretty interesting characters whose backstories would have been fun for the audience to explore. I could have seen the many fanfiction pieces that fans would have spun off from the story of Caine, Jupiter and the Abrasax family. Let's be honest, the basic plot line of The Matrix, the film franchise that the Wachowskis are renowned for, was pretty clich\u00e9 too \u2013 the story of a Chosen One who comes out of nowhere and whose destiny is to save the world. It was the treatment of this plot premise (as well as really cool action sequences and visuals) that made The Matrix such a groundbreaking series. Jupiter Ascending's basic plot premise was this too but the treatment was a complete letdown.\n\nThe cast is also one that is renowned for not just their good looks but also their ability to act. Somehow though, the directors succeeded in not tapping on that ability. I can't help but wonder what kind of directions Andy and Lana Wachowskis gave Eddie Radmayne for me to give such an exaggerated and overly affected performance as Balem. It reminds me somewhat chillingly of how Natalie Portman almost killed her career with her expressionless and emotionless turn as Amidala in the Stars Wars prequel trilogy. At least Radmayne has The Theory of Everything that is out in the same season and that can probably help cushion the fallout from Jupiter Ascending.\n\nTo the Wachowskis' credit, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum have some chemistry. While their performances are not going to garner them any Oscars, they put in decent performances to, I think, ward off any Razzie nominations. It also helps that they are pretty easy on the eye. Apart from these three actors, it is hard to discern the performances put in by the rest of the cast as their characters do not appear to add to the story. It makes it difficult for one to give a fair critique of their performances hence I'll refrain from that here.\n\nJupiter Ascending could also have been one of the few female-led action films that could have been a successful film franchise, showing that when female-led action films succeed, it's not necessarily a quirk. This would have been helpful in Hollywood's evolution (if you haven't figured out from my name, yes, I'm female).\n\nIt also could have been the film that would have move the Wachowskis' career out of its current state where the siblings are now more renowned for the visual flash and bang in their films rather than the creative storytelling and treatment that was showcased in The Matrix."

There is nothing substantial in this movie, nothing that can teach us something new about ourselves or the world around us, which is quite odd for the science fiction movie. True the cinematography of the movie is first class, but it only saddens me that it is used on such bad material. In the end don't get fooled by this movie. Its only purpose is to take your money with bright lights and a false promise, but it will leave you with a mouth full of ash, wondering why you wasted your time."

And unlike most of the films right now, the action keeps up the pace throughout the movie, it doesn't just have a few cool scenes that end up in the trailer.\n\nIs it a smart story that makes one philosophical question the meaning of life? No. It is a puerile story of intergalactic feudal royalty of human origins that controls the entire universe, of girls that wash toilets and find out they are princesses, of loyal knights that love and protect them and of evil men with no scruples that try to kill them. Yes, it is a fairy tale. But a visually stunning one, with beautiful actors and amazing special effects.\n\nBottom line: forever remembered as the movie in which Sean Bean doesn't die, Jupiter Ascending is a science fiction upgrade of a standard princesses and knights fairy tale. Once one realizes that, one can fully enjoy the good special effects and the fast pace. It lasts for two hours, but it never lets up the action."

Wachowski's always make great visuals, so I jumped into it because of the 3D, but with very low expectations regarding the movie To my complete surprise, it turned out the movie was very good, in the sense it was highly entertaining The story has it's flaws, like any regular movie, but it's not a complete nonsense like some people try to sell you Can't understand how rubbish movies like Fast&Furious 7 and Iron Man 3 make millions at the box office and have such good ratings, where this one flopped and has such poor ones I mean even complete trash like Godzilla, Robocop (2014), John Carter and San Andreas have a higher score than Jupiter Ascending!!!

A lot of small rolls and cameos from big stars. And I wish Doona Bae had a larger role, as she stole the show in Cloud Atlas.I can see, why this movie cost 175 million dollars. The sets were brilliant and very imaginative. The 3d was also cool. If you are looking for something which isn't your boiler plate science fiction, give this film a day in court."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Jupiter Ascending' is not a complete disaster, but it is one of the biggest wastes of potential personally seen in recent memory. There are some very interesting ideas here and there is some ambitious scope, so 'Jupiter Ascending' had real potential to be great, but these ideas are practically lost in space.\n\nStarting with a few good things, much of 'Jupiter Ascending' looks great. The special effects are out of this world good, the film is beautifully shot and the production design has much colour, atmosphere and astonishing realism, successfully at first allowing the viewer to be immersed in and captivated by the world the characters inhabit. The music is rousing, haunting and lusciously as well as thrillingly bombastically orchestrated. 'Jupiter Ascending' also boasts one good performance, that of an effortlessly cool and sincere Sean Bean.\n\nChanning Tatum is not that awful an actor but he can do nothing with his worthless material, here he's very wooden and displays little involvement and charisma. Worse is Mila Kunis, who shows the emotional range of a zombie. Their chemistry is so cold and clinical, one can be forgiven for thinking that it's non-existent. On the other side of the acting spectrum, Eddie Redmayne tries far too hard as the villain and comes over as more very bizarre than threatening. With the sole exception of Bean, all the cast do a lousy job.\n\nThey are disadvantaged by the listless direction by the Wachowskis, very sketchily written characters and a script that is clunky in structure and with such toe curlingly bad dialogue, some of the worst of any big-budget film since 'Pearl Harbor'. While 'Jupiter Ascending' is mostly fine visually, there is an overload of special effects that it comes at the expense of any sense and soul and some of the editing is both sloppy and choppy. The action is a mixed bag, some of it is diverting and other parts lack fun, tension and most of all cohesion.\n\nIf there is one element where 'Jupiter Ascending' falls down most heavily, it is the story. The story had a great ambitious concept with some equally great ideas, but explores the concept and ideas very little, barely even, and its themes are only lightly touched upon. Structurally and dramatically the film is a badly disorganised mess, some parts don't even make much sense, indicating that the film was intended to be like at least twenty minutes longer but had to be cut down. There is a distinct lack of suspense, tension and soul, some effort was clearly made but it was like people's hearts weren't properly in it. Pacing is all over the place, the actual story feels rushed, indicating that the film would have worked better at least twenty minutes longer as a film or as a mini-series, but because the experience is so emotionally and dramatically empty it feels dull too.\n\nOverall, a very messy but good looking film. To be admired more for its ambition, which promised much, than its execution, which is quite poor in several big areas. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

But it was never advertised to be that kind of film--it's a solid blockbuster movie (with plenty of room for sequels and/or prequels). I'd see it again!\n\nIf you're considering watching this film, but hesitate after reading the same scathing reviews that I came across, just consider what interests you about the movie: if you're looking a movie with a complex plot and lots of underlying messages, this might not be the best choice.

The individual elements are swamped by awful storytelling, weird and incomplete world building, and a far overcrowded narrative that ends up feeling like an entire trilogy in one.\n\nOne top of all that are either flat or bizarre performances from literally every actor. People talk about Eddie Redmayne's alternatively whispered and shouted performance, but the one performance that's most sadly flat is Channing Tatum's. As you can see through the pair of 21 Jump Street movies, the man has a certain charisma, charm, and humor about him, but as the half-wolf ex-Space Cop who wants wings, he's a non-entity. It's been obvious that the Wachowskis haven't known how to direct actors since The Matrix, but to see them fail to develop this element of their toolbox as filmmakers over 20 years is disappointing.\n\nSure, the movie looks good. There's quality special effects almost throughout and some striking visual compositions with, apparently, some kind of innovative method to filming an aerial chase over Chicago, but the story is just a confusing mess.\n\nJupiter, our main character, is a happenstantial perfect genetic duplicate of a space queen who's already died. The Space Queen had three children, who are fighting over the inheritance of planets used for harvesting the populations. It's really just poorly conceived and executed Marxist pablum (complete with dialogue about capitalism shitting on the little people). And, on top of all of this, which gets dolled out in droning tones of pure exposition, we have just a plethora of images that never really tie the world together cohesively. We're thrown into the deep end from the beginning, which is an interesting contrast to The Matrix where the strange new world got fed to the audience in palatable chunks that made the reveal intriguing.\n\nProbably the most frustrating part of the film is the structure, or what could be called structure. It's quite literally exposition, action scene, exposition, action scene, exposition, Kafkaesque bureaucracy (the single best part of the movie complete with Brazil references and Terry Gilliam), exposition, action scenes to the end. There's not a character that feels alive. There's not a character that feels like they're driving the action, in particular Jupiter who just follows from beginning to end.\n\nThe idea that some independent producer with a lot of money read the screenplay and said, \"Sure, I'll give you $175 million for this\" is mind-boggling. Where is this person? I have much better ways they can spend that kind of money."

I enjoyed it. Not a classic of the genre but very entertaining - although I can understand some people getting upset at not being able to follow the somewhat demanding, fast paced, multi-level story, whispered dialogue, and unconventional narrative. I especially liked the neat blend of science fiction and fantasy and the nice fairy tale vibe. I loved those dragons. I enjoyed it about as much as I enjoyed Blade Runner and The Fifth Element. It certainly does not deserve some of the ridiculously negative reviews that I have seen. Which just goes to show it is all a question of personal taste I suppose."

        "review_detailed_main": "So..yes, this isn't the best sci-fi movie in existence, but I don't think it's half as bad as everyone is saying. Let's start by the visuals. The visuals are AMAZING and are what makes this movie worth seeing on the big screen. The universe the brothers created is huge,which gives room for a lot of breath-taking scenes. This however, is one of the drawbacks of the film. The fact that the universe is so big and that it is a 2 hour film, makes the story a little sloppy. There are a lot of things left unexplained which is a pity,and too much time filled with love scenes. Moreover,the characters are either good or bad, there's not much depth to them. Despite all this, the movie is good, I decided on 7 instead of 6.5 mainly because of the visuals. You need to consider this movie as a sci-fi flick, taking into account that you don't see many original sci-fi movies around,and that the plot isn't that bad,it's just not mind blowing, I'd encourage you to see it for yourself, grab some popcorn and enjoy the movie for what it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "JUPITER ASCENDING's strength comes chiefly from its visually extravagant presentation of a mammoth romantic cosmic tale. Its promise of an engaging story soars at the start, but from the heights it reached within its complex and ever expanding universe, it descends rapidly and falls flat with its poor and brow-arching narrative. The film's biggest mistake is that it focuses heavily on decorating its worlds and everything in them, that it leaves its script poorly delivered and blandly executed. Its story, following an ordinary woman deemed to be \"the Chosen One\", rolls and branches out from one world to another now and then, but often gets derailed from its spine, and thus gets left unresolved. It gets further dragged by uninteresting and underdeveloped characters you would rather laugh about and love if they weren't in the scene.\n\nJUPITER ASCENDING fails to carry out a glorious astral ascent. In spite of its jaw-dropping visual prestige, it misfires and never soars past its cinematographic grandeur. A thrilling visual presentation utterly bereft of narrative eloquence, JUPITER ASCENDING is another huge cinematic mishap, best appreciated by audience that are only after feeding the eyes. I give this movie 5/10 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's sad to see an interesting, even thoughtful space-opera like Jupiter Ascending with an IMDb rating of 5.6, while brainless drivel like Gravity scores 7.9, and a confused mess like Interstellar gets a ridiculous 8.7.\n\nThat's not to say that Jupiter Ascending is a work of genius. But it's a film that achieves more or less what it sets out to accomplish. It's got a story that makes sense (within its own rules), and it even works on more than one level. Unlike Gravity, it doesn't flout the laws of Newtonian physics in every shot. And unlike Interstellar, it doesn't pretend to be deep, while actually making very little sense at all.\n\nUnderneath all the flashy CG, Jupiter Ascending is a very simple little film. I don't want to spoil the plot, even to make a point, because my point is that this film is worth seeing, as long as you approach it the right way. Suffice to say that the plot is straightforward, if not immediately apparent at the start. The characters are simple, B-movie style, but their internal logic holds up.\n\nAnd there's a pretty interesting moral to the whole story. This film asks whether human society must always be a pyramid, in which billions at the base have nothing so that a handful at the peak can achieve a life of almost unimaginable luxury. This question isn't worked out in any great detail, but it does give the film a surprisingly strong foundation. There are some big ideas here - no more credible than George Lucas 'force' philosophy, perhaps, but no less so either.\n\nBeyond that, some of the imagery is genuinely original - though I did wish the frenetic action sequences hadn't been confusingly shot in close-up, where medium or long shots would have been more effective. Jupiter Ascending isn't as successful as the Wachowsky's previous Cloud Atlas (which truly is a brilliant film), but it's far more effective than their greatest misfire, Speed Racer. (Which somehow manages a 6.1 on IMDb.)\n\nIf you like fast-paced space opera in the Star Wars mold, Jupiter Ascending is definitely worth a look."

They dangle and dangle, but she doesn't look scared a bit, because there is nothing to be scared of in front of the green screen. Seriously, do these directors really think I am waiting for a talking reptile? Or transparent piggies that rescue any situation like guardian angels do?

As my late father use to tell people, \"Just watch the movie and shut up\".\n\nNow. Jupe (Jupiter). I love her. I love her more as a female action hero because she's more down to Earth...get it? Down to Earth? Anyway, most action heroines are either super strong, super smart, super fast, etc. Jupe is just human. She ain't got none of that. She makes stupid human mistakes. She's a smartass like a regular human. She defiant. She can't really fight, but she can slap around a bad guy who can't fight either. She's smart enough to duck when somebody is shooting laser beams at her. She's not taking heels when she should be taking sneakers. And most of all, she knows where to put her knee when a guy puts her in a choke hold. That's awesome.\n\nCaine. Caine is hunky. The end. He's half man, half wolf and has prosthetic wings. He can kick butt, too. What the heck do you have to think about?\n\nHer Earthly family is hilarious. Her Reoccurrence family is hilarious too, just in a \"they're all nutcases\" sort of way.\n\nI like the action. I like the storyline.

While I found the special effects and most action scenes used effectively (and particularly nice in IMAX 3D), it fails across the board in terms of acting, story and music.\n\nThe top failure is the story as presented in the film. While I am sure than the Wachowskis thought out a detailed universe, the movie appears as an uncoordinated mess which jumps from A to B with no apparent connection between the two. There is literally no reason presented for more than half of the plot items used in the movie, appearing as a string of \"deus ex machina\" elements (in particular the mandatory love story which appears out of nowhere at it's so forced on the audience that it made me physically sick).\n\nThe acting is flat. Mila fails to render any emotion whatsoever, a baffling feat given her proved talents but in the context of the movie, with a script that gives her no chance whatsoever, it starts to make sense.\n\nI see no reason why a talent like Mila was paired with your everyday cheap action hero Channing Tatum. They have no chemistry, he has no talent and both their characters are squeezed into a romance so unnatural that the first \"hints\" come from other characters explicitly saying the two have the hots for each other.\n\nBad guy Douglas Booth was charged with providing the mild attempt at providing something unexpected, a titanic task given the flat and utterly predictable (bed time?) story. To his credit, he does play the playboy decently to the degree that the ridiculous writing allowed and overall he seems to have made the best of a bad situation.\n\nThe other bad boy, Eddie Redmayne, is brought to memory by better roles (Hawking in \"The theory of everything\" and Jack in \"The pillars of the Earth\"). His appearance is more baffling than Mila's given the absolute ridiculousness of his character that is not only cardboard flat, but he is neither the \"action-movie\" bad guy that takes on the opposing action hero, but rather ends up fighting a girl hand-to-hand, a battle we know he's gonna lose from the beginning of the movie, despite the fact that Mila's only combat training comes from wielding toilet brushes.\n\nThe music shows that the movie takes itself way too seriously for a flat action movie (the comic relief moments hardly have any comedy in them) as the score tries to enhance a non-existing drama.\n\nThe Wachowski's seems to have gone out of their way to ensure it is utterly impossible to feel or root for any of the characters (good or bad). Believe it or not, that's saying something on my part as I tend to invest something even in apparently nonsensical movies such as Schwarzenegger action types.\n\nThis movie deserves to bomb and teach actors like Mila and Redmayne that it's not worth tarnishing a reputation for money."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well I enjoyed it! I read the negative reviews, saw the slightly-under-6 IMDb rating (to date) and almost wrote it off but luckily, I'm a fan of both lead actors (Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis) and I love Sci Fi so I gave it a chance.\n\nFirst off, the Sci Fi element is fantastic. The new technology, gadgets and aliens are brilliant. One species in particular reminded me of the Scarrans in Farscape. I wish they'd had a bigger presence, in the film but also in the film's fictional society as once again, despite Channing's character explaining how arrogant we are for assuming we're the only sentient beings in this vast universe, it appears that humans, with all our limitations, still managed to become the rulers of the universe.\n\nThe effects and chase sequences, especially one extended chase early on, were outstanding.\n\nIn terms of dialogue, character development, story progression etc. I'd place the maturity and intellect somewhere along the lines of Divergent (2014), The Hunger Games (2012) and at times, hints of Twilight (2008). This is definitely pure fantasy fodder for young people but like John Carter (2012), there are some genuinely hilarious and insightful moments that pull you back in at times when your post-pubescent brain may be wandering. Bonus: Sean Bean pops up part way through which is always a nice surprise.\n\nI thought there could have been better direction because almost everyone mumbles their lines at one point or multiple and Eddie Redmayne basically whispers all the way through.\n\nDepending on your mood, the reviews you've read (i.e. your expectations), your age and so on, you will either consider this an entertaining bit of fantasy fluff or, you will cringe at the predictability and resume your game of scrabble.\n\nI switched off my brain for a couple of hours and thoroughly enjoyed it so it's 7/10 for me."

The dialogue is farcically generic/clich\u00e9, the story is preposterous, the acting is...fine, for what they were given (everyone does their job) and the effects are...totally inconsequential. Many years ago, I gave \"Avatar\" two stars, but one of them was for the effects. But SFX are there now - we have the ability to make pretty much anything we can imagine come to life on the big screen. So - no more extra points for SFX. Compare a bloated toad like this film to a low budget gem like \"Moon\" - it's story and character that matter. Now granted, I am not a 13-year-old suburban girl, so maybe I am not the intended audience for this screenplay, and so missed something. But when a film full of action sequences (which are actually boring, if you can imagine it), makes me wish I was watching one of the Twilight films instead, you something has gone terribly wrong. I am considering invoicing the Wachowskis for the time I wasted watching this drivel.\n\nOn the plus side, the state of the art for SFX means that all sorts of good stories might finally make it to the big screen, things that were thought to be unfilmable before. So, I look forward to them.\n\nBut do NOT go see this movie. Do anything - even go to the dentist - rather than sit through this."

This film has NO story, It is so convoluted and filled egocentric directing. Clearly the Wachowski brother and sister team are just living off the Matrix. There is no chemistry to the main characters and the acting is MONOTONED throughout. There are so many plot holes which all movies of this nature have, but so many that it is no longer even followable, if that is a word. i won't give spoilers but, lets just say that there is not one shred of continuity within the story that makes it make sense. The characters, especially Tatums was not ever challenged, never did I say he won't make it, or get there or do this or that, you just knew he would and it was ALWAYS easy. Kunis as well as the rest of the cast looked like cardboard cutouts, for a moment I though George Lucas directed it..\n\nIts just bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie goes a different route with the anime The Wachowskis have proved to love with their most iconic film the Matrix, I think I spotted influences of neon genesis, Gundam and other mech anime.\n\nThe action sequences were really good and there was a lot of them from beginning to end. Just wall to wall popcorn eating action. The siblings do action well too. It gave the feeling of a live action anime. It goes to show how much progress visual effects have had since the late 90s.\n\nI will say this. This movie seemed very dumb down from what the sibs usually like to spin. Though we see some philosophy on how the human race is not alone, it does not compare to what they gave us with the Matrix or even their last movie, Cloud Atlas. This is truly their mainstream breakout made mostly to be a money making blockbuster (that's how it feels anyway)\n\nIt does this well with its amazing visual effects, and high octane space opera style adventure. Highly enjoyable.\n\nThe movie seems fit Mila Kunis, yet I was not impressed with her or Channing Tatum, but this could be my on personal vice over the fact that they were picked to sell tickets.\n\nMila's Character was real, or rather a fresh take on something that has been done many times before, but I felt Tatum had more of a hard on for Jonah Hill in the Jump Street franchise (To Hill's credit, maybe Tatum likes funny people) I did like how his dashing hero type did not over shadow Mila's character, who was not a typical damsel in distress, but could have used a few action scenes.\n\nI get the feeling that like M. Night Shyamalan with After Earth, The Wachowskis are playing the Hollywood game here and like with After Earth, producing so-so results that loosely resemble what got them to the big time in the first place.\n\nBut overall The story's OK and it has a lot of effects driven action sequences. Not a bad way to spend two hours."

A lot of the elements of the world the Wachowskis created seemed like they were created with some kind of Sci-Fi/Fantasy magnetic poetry set. I love Mila Kunis and like Channing Tatum, but they were not fit for these roles. It's like they casted super popular people in a super geek movie and it just wasn't a fit. Plus they had no chemistry. The worst part was Eddie Redmayne's overacting. How does this guy have an acting career? Is it just because he's British? I think the failure of this film comes from the Wachowskis trying to put too many elements in. In a way the movie is almost a parody of Sci-fi/Fantasy films. Like The Wachowskis dumbed down the entire genre to try to bring in a new audience of jocks and princesses. It's not going to work. It will appeal to overweight, bearded, males who spend Saturday nights writing fan fiction in their parent's basements. Because this is something they could have written. Also - the movie was heavily laden with anti-feminism. Another failed attempt at having a strong female lead. Mila Kunis falls down a lot and needs Tatum to keep rescuing her. She doesn't scream a lot though. I liked that. Lengthy unnecessary action sequences, forced romance, lazy story....the movie is a clich\u00e9 wrapped in a parody dressed as a caricature of itself."

I will say it's budget and gross sales was a disaster, but if you just watch the movie, without expecting it just to be \"bad\" just because, then it could actually surprise you.

Her accomplice, always by her side, is a genetically enhanced human, half wolf of some galactic type, who comes from an ultra-enhanced-military-genetically centered-alien world, who comes to save her...for the bounty. She like him, gives way to the wolf centered side, which prevails over 'conservative' ritual and their induced mayhem. Well, as you can see, this is creative movie, to say the least.\n\nMuch is made of various factions dominating the universe, including mothers and their sons and their titles, along with genetic reincarnation. It all affects the earth and the quite fragile and vulnerable population.\n\nCreativity, loads of it, complexity within a universe of concern, is dominated by the love interest that develops with the human/wolf, something I have been a fan of, right here on earth, with wonderment, for years. This 'love interest' gives way towards the end, leaving me wondering what may 'come out' for the royal and 'enhanced', as depicted in the end, in any future installment!

Mila Kunis parades through two hours wearing a series of decidedly uncomfortable looking dresses, which she seems to don for no reason besides the required mandatory twenty- minute outfit change. She \"falls in love\" with her kidnapper/savior after having exchanged less than twenty lines of dialogue, because she \"falls only for guys she's not supposed to,\" whatever that means.

Unlike many actresses in such 'superhero' films, you always see them in tight clothes, killing people with a model face and walking away from explosions as though they are walking down a catwalk. But this wasn't like that at all, Jupiter was just a normal girl wearing jeans a flannel shirt for the first half of the movie (sure she had a couple of beautiful gowns later, but that was it) and she had laid back hair and average fighting skills but I enjoyed her very much. She was acting human, not some super human, and I could relate. The plot is the usual 'lets save the hero and protect her no matter what' kind of plot, but the 'how' and 'why' could have so much better, it was the key to making this movie a blockbuster. But instead the who and why of the plot was its downfall... There were way too many villains, each one confusing you even more about their intentions. I swear I couldn't keep up and just got confused. I still don't even know what really happened in the film. Channing Tatum was an okay choice but Mila was not. Maybe its not the right role for her, but she couldn't act at all, she basically just had three expressions in the film: happy, confused and distressed. Maybe another actress would have been a better choice or maybe Mila just needed more acting classes to be the perfect fit. The fighting sequences were so annoyingly long that you eventually just stop trying to keep up or even caring. Although, I will admit that they did have some great fighting scenes but they were the simple ones without all the gimmicks/props/explosions, just two people fighting each other hand on hand (and using a weapon or two lying around).\n\nThe only reason I am giving this movie a 7 and not the 5.5 it deserves is because of two reasons: The visual effects and Eddie Redmayne. The visuals were amazing, and you could see the incredible details in the space, planets, alien lands and spaceships. It was truly a delight to the eyes, especially if watched in 3D. And oh, Eddie. This is my first time watching this man act as I have never seen any of his movies before.. wow... He raised the bar soo high that he puts all the rest of the actors to shame and it made me think, were Mila and Channing really bad actors all along ? He was just so great and the costume only made him even more mysterious. His voice, my friend believed, was over the annoyingly unrealistic but I didn't mind because its not supposed to be real life kind of plot. But let me just say that the only one who could keep up was of course Sean Bean, great as always.\n\nIs this movie worth watching ? No\u0085 perhaps only if there is nothing else playing in the cinema."

The acting was horrible but im not sure if that was due to the actors being bad themselves or the crap roles they were given. The story is ridiculous as was the plot, as was the movie, as was the title, etc... I haven't seen a movie this bad with supposedly \"a list\" actors and actresses in a long time.

        "review_detailed_main": "-Jupiter Ascending (2015) movie review:\n\n-Jupiter Ascending is the latest, and probably final, big-budget sci-fi movie by The Wachowskis, creators of the Matrix. The film follows a normal girl who is made the target of the son of a powerful galactic dynasty. She is rescued by ex-space marine guy Channing Tatum, who tries to keep her safe for another member of the same family during the power struggle. Throughout the journey she starts to discover that she plays a much more important role than she thought\u0085.\n\n-Sounds messy? It is.\n\n-The story is really convoluted and jumps all over the place, making it hard to focus on anything really going on. Probably because it was written by The Wachowskis. AKA: writers of The Matrix Revolutions....\n\n-The pace was another problem the film had, as they just end up going from place to place to place like World War Z.\n\n-The acting was good. Everyone did fine and nobody was really bad.\n\n-The characters, and the dialogue, were pretty cheesy. And inconsistent. I thought it actually made Eddie Redmayne as the villain look bad in the film.\n\n-The music\u0085. Michael Giacchino was the star of the film for me. It was noticeable excellent! -The effects were a mixed bag. Some of the effects were Tron Legacy/Oscar good, while others reminded me of I, Frankenstein. Those two movies should not be in the same category. I did enjoy the majority of the vast effects and forgive the weaker ones. The Oscars won't, but I will.\n\n-The action was pretty sweet. The costume design was pretty sweet. The makeup/hairstyling was good. The practical effects were good. The alien-ish tech was cool. The aliens themselves were cool! However, literally everything I just listed has one or two moments that were really cheesy. A cheesy fight, a few cheesy costumes, etc.\n\n-I think one of the films biggest problems, and one that all of the others fall under, was that it did not know if it wanted to be serious or campy. Either say would have been better, but a blend of both did not work. Some funny scenes that did not fit the super-cool action, or an elephant alien among other human-ish cooler aliens. Also I see The Wachowskis went to the George Lucas school of making aliens.\n\n-All-in-all Jupiter Ascending was not all that good, but had some enjoyable things like the acting or space fights. Despite its flaws, I saw it for free and am glad I did, so I will say Jupiter Ascending is worth watching on Netflix. (When it inevitable comes to Nexflix)"

Usually in these stories, the chosen one turns out to be really special and have really special powers that they learn to master in a short time and save the world because they are so special. This wasn't the case with June. She was unremarkable at the start. She remains unremarkable through the story. She's unremarkable by the end. It really sounds like I'm making fun of her, but I'm really not. June is a nice girl with a decent heart. But she suffers from some self esteem issues, and she isn't the smartest. She also lacks the physicality to be the action star of this action movie. So she just stumbles through the plot, never magically overcoming her shortcomings, but trying to do the best she can given her limitations. Others around her do the rescuing. June is incredibly lucky. The tension in her story revolves around some ethical decisions she has to make. And well, that was refreshingly different enough to not make this a terrible movie in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is she \"the One\" again? Are human beings harvested for their energy once again? Will the One fall in love with whoever eyes match first? Will Eddie Redmayne ever top (or sink lower) than this? Good God, so many questions...\n\nThe Wachowskis - Andy and Lana - show with a film like Jupiter Ascending, as well as their others (even Speed Racer, yes I said it) that they're not hacks. At least, not hacks to the money-grubbing system of Hollywood. Or, well, they DO like making money, I suppose - two Matrix sequels speak to that - but they mostly speak to what they love, and as it just so happens Hollywood is usually down for what they do (Cloud Atlas even, up to a point, thanks to the cast, which was their most ambitious outing to date). This is a work by filmmakers who are given a budget so gigantic that they do make sure to put the money on the screen... and the script has enough words to match any descriptions of space and ships and planets and Eddie Redmayne's costume and Channing Tatum's fake teen-wolf jaw.\n\nThe plot of this flick is about the discovery of Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis, and why she has the last name 'Jones' and is the daughter of Russians, hey, why carp, I guess). Turns out, she's royalty in the universe, and what a giant universe it is: various 'Houses' are on planets throughout the system, and the House Abraxas has its eye on Jupiter Jones - turns out she is the reincarnation of the mother to the children of the throne (or something, I guess, far as I could follow), James D'Arcy, Tuppence Middleton, and Redmayne. But she's eyed to be killed for reasons that involve things with the Earth and populations and things that I shouldn't go into for too many useless spoilers.\n\nAll that you need to know is - she's \"The One\", if not AS 'The One' as Neo was in the Matrix, and the reasons for so many other outside-Earth-beings wanting a piece of Earth are also similar for the main conflict of The Matrix (human harvesting, in short). And also as soon as the \"Hunter\" Caine (Tatum) shows up and sweeps Jupiter off her feet through (legitimately) breathtaking chases through Chicago or across star systems, you should know what you're in for: a big mashed potato mix of a science fiction space opera blockbuster. Characters explain quite a lot, in the second act at least, about how the universe really works and yet, ultimately, it all comes down to elements familiar as we've seen in many other space operas: rigged marriages, fiendish power plays, blue-blood royalty, dogged male determinism, and some enjoyable hijinks.\n\nAnd yet the Wachowskis aren't doing a put-on, or even a wink-and-a-nod like we saw last year with Guardians of the Galaxy (which, if Warners had the gall to release it last summer would've surely had that awesome juggernaut to deal with). This isn't to say there aren't homages, oh heavens no - even down to an appearance by a wonderful iconoclast film director, and a reference to his own science fiction masterpiece come up pretty blatantly, albeit his appearance made me smile ear to ear for his full five minutes. And surely this guy/gal duo have read Dune, all of them, and sunk their teeth into Heavy Metal and Flash Gordon and, to their credit, they stick to their visions. This is hardcore sci-fi spectacle filmmaking, and they put clearly a great deal of love and thought with John Toll their DP and the special FX team. You do get your eyes worth here.\n\nAs far as substance? That'll depend on how much the viewer can take things like (I'm not kidding) telepathic, royalty-sympathetic bees, mind-wipes and easy-to-fix solutions for skyscrapers, and uh, well... Eddie Redmayne. I should let this go, but I can't. The nominee for best actor in a leading role this year also gives one of the most baffling, awful performances, and yet I'm not sure how it goes wrong. I can see why he was cast as this guy - he can pull off this snotty, fey royalty for sure, but trying to voice it like Lord Voldemort's kid doesn't do any favors. It's a glorious watch to see him act evil and conniving, and is surely on level with the most guilty-pleasure villain performances since... well, David Lynch's Dune, I suppose, or the more baffling Star Trek pictures. I almost recommend the picture just for him.\n\nAs for the actual leads, they're fine, far as it goes. Kunis is given kind of the short-shrift really with her character, basically a damsel in distress (mostly, she can defend herself if she has to), and Tatum does deliver some sincere work alongside the likes of Sean Bean. They seem to be trying, but with what? Jupiter Ascending is beautifully crafted fluff made by (I mean this in the most complementary way possible) grown-ass geeks who may have tapped out what they have left in the genre. It's a I-can't-recommend-it-but-I-won't-stop-you type of review here."

The storyline was laughable, with pretentious ideas continuously thrown in your face until boredom settles in. The characters, and acting, were a nuisance as well. The chemistry between Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum was shallow and forced. Individually, there was zero effort from both leads to bring new things to the table, as their chic flick method of acting was unfortunately prevalent. As for Eddie Redmayne, he brought THE effort, but with the un-energetic rest of cast, his became needlessly over the top... and \"shrieky\". More negatives can actually be said of this film, from the editing, the forsaken script and one dimensional directing, that ultimately, the visual spectacle that is Jupiter Ascending, has become an afterthought. Disappointing.\n\nThis is truly a misfire from the Wachowski's as the film clearly lacked substance, amidst the diamonds and gems it tried to fool us with."

The story is so mellow, slow and boring it's incredible WB wanted to spend 175m$ on it. The characters are disastrously 2 dimensional it's almost impossible to care for them. And the bad guy...my god, Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne plays a whispering (no really) queer old dork who is unbearable to watch. The dialogue is uninspired, simplistic and lame. The Matrix used contemporary Metal and Techno music in the coolest ways possible, to amp up the action to adrenaline pumping heights. Here all action seems so basic, slow and unspectacular. And the rather run of the mill orchestral music doesn't help either. The only good thing maybe is the visuals, the film looks good but the design seems weird, uneven and random. There is like a female character with these huge rat ears. wtf? These movie doesn't feel like it had strong directors with a vision behind the wheel. It's more like all departments did whatever they wanted and then they threw everything on a pile and the editor mashed it up into a movie of some sorts. I bet the suits at Warner p*ssed their pants when they saw what a stinker they had on their hand after the first screening. Washowski's, get your act together coz you won't be able to ride on the Matrix fame forever. Ask Shayamalan, things can go south pretty quickly career wise. There is a new scifi TV series 'Sense 8' coming out, I hope they can prove they still have it or they might have to start looking for other jobs."

Absolutely no coincidence that I'm posting this commentary exactly on the same day that DonJ Trump become your next president and most \"potent\" being of this planet... Possibly, the hate for this movie could be linked to the Wachowski siblings's origins... @Hollywood: You really need a major RESET... Back to our movie: Plot: excellent; Actors: excellent act; I'm actually considering why the heck not give it a full 10..."

Also the behavior of the people and aliens in this movie is not to be recognized with. People just starting to fight for no apparent reason, people to be hunted and killed for reasons unknown. It is quite hard to understand even a slightest bit of logic in the story in this movie. The visual quality of the effects however in this movie is good, but the creators should have a course in physics. Movement is quite unrealistic. I wonder if my kids should watch this. I think they might hurt themselves from trying to do the tricks that looks safe and easy in this movie. I actually like action movies and special effects (ie star wars), but this new action movie style should be more refined."

        "review_detailed_main": "In this review I will summarize of what I believe the movie did right and wrong. As with any review I will do, I watched the movie twice to confirm my opinions, and analyze the concepts I might have overlooked.\n\nThe Wachowski's are brilliant in their own right. The average viewer however, can not always appreciate their way of bringing screenplay to the Silver screen. All their past movies have been absolute favorites of mine. From Speed Racer, to Cloud Atlas to the famous Matrix Trilogy. It seems that the Wachowski's always want to try something new. And for this and many reasons more, they are my favorite set of Directors.\n\nJupiter Ascending however, is their most confusing entry yet. Not terrible in any way though, quite the contrary actually. Nevertheless, the movie has problems finding it's own identity. This film tries to be too many things simultaneously, and in my opinion this leads to a rather illogical story.\n\nThis movie has some terrific action, it starts of this way at least. After the first action sequence I wanted more and the movie kept at this pace until they go into outer space. This is where the film tries to explain how the Abrasax industry is part of a higher level of \"consumption\", and that harvesting planets(because more time is what everyone wants) is a normality. There are different alien types, from reptilians to the clich\u00e9 looking aliens(in crop circles) to humans with their DNA altered.\n\nThe scenes with Kick Gurry are just hilarious, as are the scenes where Jupiter is trying to register herself as queen where the Wachowski's are making fun of the government their work flow(just hilarious). The Wachowski's always incorporate smart clever humor that always brightens up a serious tone.\n\nI found it hard to get emotionally attached to any of the characters as they were either speaking the Metaphysics the Wachowski's are known for incorporating in their scripts, or about the Jupiter Ascending's universe it's background/information. The characters simply don't get enough screen time interacting with each other as it's always about the setting and visual effects. This leads me to believe this movie's script should have been simplified or made smaller.\n\nIt should have been either a 90 minute movie with Titus out of the picture(the way they got out of his ship was completely illogical as well), or a 3 hour movie with more character development and interaction. It is clear that this movie was set out to be produced as a stand alone title. With only 2 hours as the running time and with such a big universe that needs explaining, the sacrifices made to present this story within the given running time leads to unlovable characters. The cast fits in the aesthetics the film wants to achieve though.\n\nThe action scenes with it's special effects and Michael Giacchino's Score are such a treat that it makes this movie already worth seeing. This film is a complete work of art and I love it. Original craftsmanship from John Gaeta and team as always. Just like other reviewers have stated, this film is overly ambitious where the characters are just there to share their knowledge of their surrounding so it remains impossible to connect with them thus care for their actions.\n\nIt is not the Matrix(1), and this is the very reason viewers criticize their current latest work for it not being that film. It always overshadows the beauty their films actually do have. Cloud Atlas is the best spiritual movie to date, Speed Racer one of the most visually appealing and in my opinion the most powerful ending any movie has to date. The Matrix trilogy is still unmatched with it's Metaphysical/philosophical depth.\n\nWhere does that leave Jupiter Ascending? What is the statement of the Wachowski's with their latest film? I believe they wanted to make one of the most beautiful aesthetically appealing films of all time. And they succeeded. They have the right cast, the right visual effects and music. Overlook it's character's and story's flaws, and you will get one of the best Visual experiences in film. GO SEE THIS FILM for it's action and visual/musical presentation. Pure gold."

It's good but not as great as it could of been with a slightly easier to follow script that explained itself at the start so you didn't spend the entire film thinking \" I wonder what's going on \" or \" So that's what's going on \". It's by no means a stinker and is certainly worth watching, even if its for Mila Kunis."

From the beginning it devolved into a cheap SciFi novel about evil ruling families with cartoonish crocodile people as sidekicks, and festooned with ideas stolen from other movies.

        "review_title": "Major Movie Review: Jupiter Ascending",
        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Ascending, was my first big anticipated movie to come out this year and for good reason! Like I said, the Wachowskis are responsible for one of my favorite movies of all time in The Matrix and even their more recent movies, Cloud Atlas and even Speed Racer, were movies that I enjoyed, I even own the 2 on Blu-ray. I've also become quite the Channing Tatum supporter over the past few years and with starring roles in blockbusters like Jupiter Ascending and garnering award worthy praise for his performance in 2015 Best Picture nominee Foxcatcher, it seems like the man knows what he's doing. I was genuinely excited for this movie to come out, however this movie fell victim to delays in its release which is always a cause for alarm. But hey, this is the Wachowskis we're talking about! Maybe they needed more time to perfect their mind blowing epic story and perhaps give us movie buffs another classic. Well, I can tell you one thing for certain and that's that the visual effects artists did everything they can to make this one of the most visually appealing films of the year!\n\nI saw this movie in 3D. I'm a guy that can really enjoy watching an entire movie in 3D, so I can really tell when a movie's 3D is worth the extra dollars at the theater and folks, this is some of the best use of 3D that I've seen since Big Hero 6. The special effects were superb and the action scenes were breathtaking, there is this chase scene in the first half hour that has Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis flying through downtown Chicago with all sorts of destruction that melted my face off and that's gotta be my favorite thing about this movie. The Wachowskis have always made some very visually appealing looking action films, there's no doubt there, and what I loved in Jupiter Ascending was how well directed these action scenes were. Oh and on a side note, Channing Tatum's character rocks THE coolest movie shoes ever!\n\nNow while I did have a fun time watching the effects and seeing Channing Tatum crush little Grey men with his shield that looked the ones the Gungans used in Phantom Menace, this was a horribly underwhelming story that I thought almost killed this movie entirely. It's weird because the story of Jupiter Ascending, which has Mila Kunis' character discover her intergalactic royalty, is just like in The Matrix, except with Neo becoming \"The One\", so you'd think that the Wachowskis should be capable of creating this immerse movie world with a hugely epic story. But what I didn't like was how average the film's plot actually played out, with it's abundance of boring character conversations involving land ownership, I actually noticed myself getting impatient waiting for any and all dialog scenes to end and for the next action scene to come on. The dialog was almost cringe worthy to hear, especially whenever the forced romance came into play. I don't see why they had to turn to the Hollywood clich\u00e9 of having a romance between the main characters, I think the story would have benefited from having Tatum's Caine just be a solo bad ass and have Jupiter completely focus on her newly discovered royalty.\n\nThe only character to care about here I thought was Tatum's character. You learn how he's a modified hunter that has had his genes spliced with that of a wolf which leads to this guy growling like a wolf which made me laugh but, in a weird way, made him even more of an awesome character, as if all his awesome weapons and gadgets don't do that already. The always mighty, Sean Bean plays space hunter and acquaintance to Cain, Stinger and I really liked the back and forth that those two characters shared. It's just a damn shame that there isn't enough of their shared screen time together in the whole movie.\n\nOf course, a staple of any great sci-fi epic is to have an intimidating villain that you want to get taken down by the end and while I couldn't wait for this movie's villain to get his, I gotta say that Eddie Redmayne COMPLETELY misses the mark here. I could not contain my laughter every time this man spoke, I swear he sounded like Dumbledore from the first 2 Harry Potter movies! But other than Redmayne's surprisingly weak performance, his character didn't come off as a true threat at all, just incredibly whiny.\n\nThere's a lot of things that didn't work for Jupiter Ascending and kept if from being another Wachowski classic. Mila Kunis could have made for a capable lead, but unfortunately she was just this chick that kept getting separated from Tatum, only for him to burst in like the Kool-Aid Man to the rescue her, it kind of reminded me of classic Mario. In the end though, as much as I wanted to adore this movie, I was pretty disappointed with the finished product. I haven't lost my faith in the Wachowskis but this is one that could have been something special.\n\nJupiter Ascending, gets 5/10!\n\nWhat about you guys? What are your thoughts and opinions on Jupiter Ascending? What is your favorite Wachowski movie? PLEASE like and share this review if you enjoyed it, drop a comment, and LET'S TALK MOVIES!"

Now it's the time for Jupiter ascending. But i really liked it. Everyone hates the script, everyone hates the acting (I have to agree a little on that) everyone says it's meaningless and boring and long.\n\nBut that is just NOT my personal experience. I personally like the work done by the Wachowski Brothers so far. I like how they're trying to do something imaginative and interesting and new.\n\nOn a technical side, the film is proficient, the worlds created are beautiful and the fight scenes brilliantly executed. The script follows a good idea but unfortunately it's full of silly dialogs and situations. But then again, many, many sci-fi films suffer from that too. The acting is also not very good though i didn't hate it either, with the exception of the main villain. It's definitely overacted.\n\nIf i had to pick the worse thing about this film, it would be the length. Many things happen and though the film is quite long, it feels crammed and rushed sometimes. It should either be longer or better yet, a two part movie.\n\nI have read a few reviews and as always some people love one scene, some hate it. All i can say is this: I had a good time. I liked it a lot. I feel its biggest crime is to not be a matrix-like masterpiece. This film is no such thing (sorry Wachowski Brothers). But it is very entertaining and even better than many other sci-fi movies if you watch it without great expectations."

It is impressive how producers spend their money in a movie with top-notch CGI and cinematography but messy story and screenplay; inexistent direction; and awful acting. The plot begins \"throwing\" characters and situations on the screen without any reasonable development. The viewer sees a young woman living illegally in Chicago cleaning toilets and houses hunted down by aliens since she is the heiress of the universe. This premise might have been written by someone on drugs of mentally ill. Then the viewer sees the lead couple with maybe the worst chemistry in the cinema history: Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum. Mila Kunis is totally miscast and the imbecility of her actions is consistent with her background of loser. I saw the movie until the very end and it is impressive how stupid and senseless it is. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Destino de J\u00fapiter\" (\"The Fate of Jupiter\")"

Especially near the start of the film there is like a 20 minutes airborne chase scene I just begged to be finished.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty boring and predictable movie, and except visual effects nothing is good here.

        "review_detailed_main": "For all the complaining people do about remake/sequels they never seem to go out and see anything truly original. Well here you have it. Jupiter Ascending will not be my best movie of the year, but I'm really glad I saw it. I was never bored or confused of shaking my head at plot points, I had a really good time with it.\n\nFirst, the negatives to get them out the way: The Villain. I don't know what the actor was going for or what the directors told him but it's certainly a weird performance and ultimately he never comes across as a major threat. Although his Winged Devil/Bat/Crocodile Henchman more than makes up for this. Second: the first act. It's a little shaky and the pacing is kind of off. For some reason they decided to include scenes in these far off worlds and characters from the get go instead of letting the audience experience them with Mila Kunis' character. As a result you end up with scenes of characters talking about things that at the time have no baring on anything you're seeing.\n\nHowever, the rest is a great ride. The cast - apart from the villain - do very well with the material. Kunis comes across as likable and funny, suitably down to Earth but progressing toward strength and confidence as the film goes on. Sean Bean is a damn bad-ass when he's on screen and steels all the scenes he's given. But most surprising is Tatum. It seems after paying the bills with Jump Street and then flexing his real acting muscles with Foxcastcher he's finally found his true screen presence. He comes across as a very capable warrior with a good heart, but also very sympathetic at the same time.\n\nThe visuals are spectacular. The Wachowskis really blew me away with the scale of this universe they've created with highly imaginative worlds, technology and action sequences which are all very thrilling. If you like world building (like me) you'll be waiting for them to bring out the \"Art of the Film\" books to appreciate it even more. Combine all this with a brilliant score from Michael Giacchino to set the mood and you'll be fully transported to these incredible settings.\n\nAll in all it's a fun ride with a shaky first act and odd villain, but the cast will keep you interested and the spectacle will keep you in awe.\n\nIf you love sci-fi or pure adventure then don't give this a miss."

This all getting so tired so fast.\n\nI loved this film precisely because it was full of meaningless gloss, and bless the Matrix Guys for not making another self-referential piece of pablum. It's fun. It's stupid. It has nothing to tell us about the meaning of life.\n\nIt's not Deep, Portentous and Meaningful tripe like 'Avatar' and 'After Earth'. Thank goodness!\n\n'Jupiter Ascending' is A-grade Space Opera and let's just leave it at that.\n\nGet a life, critics."

        "review_detailed_main": "An Andy Wachowski film starring Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, and Sean Bean should have serious action flick potential, but in Jupiter Ascending, Mr. Matrix fails to deliver anything resembling a blockbuster. What he creates is a low-to-middling-interest but ultimately streamable sci-fi action film.\n\nThe best role and best performance trophies go to Mila Kunis. She is believable and magnetic as \"Jupiter,\" a semi-orphaned girl smart enough to do astronomy and tough enough to clean houses all day with her immigrant family.\n\nSean Bean is good as an old war buddy who wades in to helpfully shoot a bunch of people with Lite-Brite lasers. His screen time is limited, however, and this underuse relegates him down to an interesting ingredient in the film's overall soup.\n\nThen there is the matter of Channing Tatum. His super-action save-the-day male lead dude is assigned wolf ears.\n\nWolf ears. Ahhhh, and he wears them in a way not unlike the way in which Kevin Costner wore neck gills in Waterworld. Yep, the wolf ears are about that dumb looking.\n\nTatum acts well enough for the role, and has a foundling chemistry with Kunis as well as a plausible embrace de guerre with Bean, his mentor and old friend. But the wolf ears get in the way.\n\nAs does Eddie Redmayne's whispery, limpid, over-freckled portrayal of the co-villain. A rich space guy whose family needs Earth for, well, let's not spoil it. You might stream it."

Sadly the only opera here is in the hammy acting, with Tatum and Kunis leading the cast in befuddled looks whilst mumbling unintelligible exposition.\n\nVisually Jupiter regains some stars. The extensive world- (even galaxy-) building is highly impressive, but without a worthwhile population and purpose to fill it, this creation is left devastatingly empty.\n\nJupiter Ascending is several stars short of a constellation. An excess of imagination fails to result in entertainment or narrative cohesion; something went very wrong here.\n\nFirst published on One Room With A View http://oneroomwithaview.com/2015/02/03/jupiter-ascending-review/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite the special effects and pretty high quality CGI. There just isn't anything that makes this movie stand out. Mainly because the plot is just pretty weak. And seemed like something out of one of those teen romance books where some average chick is put in some sort of extravant and mystical situation with a handsome male lead. Or at least caught in the middle of it all because the chick is either special or comes from a certain bloodline or it's because of the situation. Which is something that has been done before, except this time it's with aliens and sci-fi elements. Now I don't really have a complaint with this types of movies, as long as there is some substance when it comes to the story and characters. Even the dialogue is as generic as it gets from some stereotypical Voldemort like villain saying some generic phrases. And his minions going \"yes, sire it will be done\". Which you won't find much of in this movie. Now this movie isn't entirely bad and it does have it's moments when it comes to certain action sequences and fist fights. I also somewhat liked the visual design of the world and technology. So this is a mix of sci-fi and fantasy elements clashed into one and it's a ambitious movie. But falters in many levels to the point it becomes forgetful. However I was at least relieved that there wasn't any strained or forced romance and it wasn't as awful as some critics claimed it to be. However I would rather watch \"John Carter\" again over watching this again though.\n\n6/10"

The pacing and character development as well as the relationship of the leads jumps from place to place that at the end it managed to do nothing for the story or the characters. I don't even see how they get to talk about loving someone when they didn't even show them getting close. There is just nothing behind the narrative.\n\nOn the good side, which is also the only reason I'm not rating this film lower than five is that it's a beautifully shot film. The visuals are really strong and there are beautifully made scenes from the production to the vfx they really did a good job. There were also well choreographed and flashy action scenes that I thought elevated the movie. It's the only reason I was kept awake and able to finish it.\n\nOverall Jupiter Ascending is very visually pleasing, yet very hollow in story telling."

I've heard worst (anyone heard the plot to the t.v show revolution?), and being a Wachowski brothers (well brother/sister) project, i figured \"why not?\", i mean these people brought us the matrix, they deserve a chance, right? well, wrong! everything about this movie is wrong: from horrible, and i mean HORRIBLE casting, to an over acting that haven't been seen since the first silent movie was shot. Eddie Redmayne leads the bunch, and for the life of me, i don't understand how someone like Channing Tatum, who lacks any kind of acting skills, manage to get an acting job. when you think about all the things that could have been done to make our world a better place with the budget that was thrown on this craporama, it makes me personally think that maybe, Hollywood as pushed it too far with big budget film. i would recommend anyone who wishes to watch this film, or even just has insomnia, and bump into this colossal failure while flipping the channels at night, to avoid it at all cost. its that bad, and it would be 127 min of a waste of your time that you'll never get back."

        "review_detailed_main": "So today, considering Lana Wachowski's recently released \"The Matrix: Resurrections\" - her new, divisive sequel to the original trilogy she co-wrote, produced & directed roughly 2 decades ago, I thought I'd re-visit one of her earlier, equally controversial works, \"Jupiter Ascending\" (available to stream on Amazon Prime in the UK) & despite the less than flattering memories I had of it (based upon my first viewing), I'm pleasantly surprised to admit that I thought the movie's actually 10x better than I initially remembered? Yes, it has its obvious faults but did I enjoy it, regardless? Yes, absolutely. Overall, the project's pure, whimsical, bold, ambitious, nonsensical, escapist fun, brimming with mesmerising, interesting & immersive alien environments (realised beautifully on screen in the sister's true, dependable fashion) & teeming with fascinatingly philosophical ideas - from which those fictional, technologically advanced societies / worlds are borne. Thus, it's an imperfect & yet intellectually & aesthetically stimulating culmination... Nothing less than what you'd expect from a pair of such esteemed, remarkable filmmakers.\n\nFor instance, in terms of the craftsmanship & the calibre of their combined efforts, the Chicago aerial fight / chase sequence is pure cinema - testament to their skill & sheer imagination behind the camera - holding up as one of the best set pieces they've ever constructed in their entire careers.\n\nNot an overstatement to say that the siblings deliver some truly jaw dropping moments of awe inspiring wonder & John Toll's cinematography is utterly astonishing throughout - elevating the standard even further.\n\nUnfortunately, I'll concede it does feel like a 3 / 4 hour film that's been mercilessly condensed in to 2 (incomplete narrative, lacking closure / development - definitely seeming like an optimistic part 1) & the majority of the roles were miscast.\n\nHowever, the world building's insanely masterful (unparalleled in its groundbreakingly inventive artistry) & just like with any other blockbuster helmed by Lily & Lana, the story actually has something unique to say, delivering a message via an original, inventive, sci-fi concept. Therefore, despite its clunkiness & debatable execution, I can't help but admire the bravery of attempting to shoot something so audacious & risky... Because there's an accomplishment in failing to satisfyingly build a franchise that's new & unconventional. Better to do that than succeed in rehashing stuff that's already been done before."

Perhaps a hummingbird could appreciate such fast motion! Seriouly Wachowskis, I had high esteem for the Matrix, but since then your movies have been going downhill and lacking any originality (Cloud Atlas was another bore). Please top throwing your money and wasting our time on stuff like this, and do something more intelligent. Adding too much CGI doesn't make a movie any better, because it's repetitive and boring. Unfortunately, many movies suffer from this syndrome, I wonder where Hollywood is going with that."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) hates her life as a maid working with her mother. Her father was killed by criminals back in Russia before her birth on the ship going over to America. She is selling her eggs when she is almost killed by aliens. She's rescued by genetically engineered hunter Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) who was hired by Titus Abrasax. Balem Abrasax (Eddie Redmayne) is the powerful emperor who owns Earth and wants Jupiter dead. With Kalique Abrasax, the three siblings are the heirs of the House of Abrasax. Caine brings Jupiter to former comrade Stinger Apini (Sean Bean) who discovers that she's royal.\n\nThis movie is overwhelmed by CGI and badly written as a story. The basic idea of a girl who discovers that she's actually royal is as old as fairy tales and as successful as the most iconic Disney movies. This has the ability to do just the same. Whenever it seem to be about to straighten itself out, the movie just turns dumb. There are attempts at comedy which fail. The story is messy. There is plenty of action which never feels completely visceral. Redmayne is doing something weird and less than threatening.\n\nIt would be nice to see a harvest and make it apocalyptic. They put in so much CGI that it seems silly not to energize the opening 5 minutes with a devastating harvest. Then Balem is portrayed as all powerful and yet he doesn't just bombard Earth. It doesn't feel like he send in his A team to kill Jupiter. Next it doesn't make sense that she would marry Titus. Titus is right that she's very gullible. While the old Disney princesses were successful, their days of waiting for Prince Charming are over. Jupiter cannot be that dumb. Another one is that she's really stupid to go to Balem in his ship rather than on the AEGIS. Again she's too dumb to be compelling as the heroine. There is too many times when Caine rides in to the rescue. She needs to be the modern princess where she's the hero."

        "review_title": "Subtley Brilliant, so Subtle Many have Missed it",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Dimensionless\", \"Unoriginal\", \"Terrible\". All of these words have been used, and many more, to describe Jupiter Ascending as a complete failure of a movie. And I have to tell you, they're wrong. They're not wholly wrong, but after reading 7+ reviews, I can honestly say I think they have missed the point. So here's what I would hope, would help someone to understand what they're looking at if they choose to give this film its worthy chance.\n\nFirst, the story is not bad, it's just missing screen time. That isn't to say that scenes have been cut (they may have) but that more time is spent blowing stuff up than saying important things. Instead, valuable and decisive moments are portrayed in the film, in an efficient and subtle way, leading to the most memorable aspects of the film - the action - to overshadow its brilliance. Reviews I've read have even gone as far as accusing the film of having left certain questions unanswered, while completely missing the fact that they were; the critics have either missed it, or forgot entirely. That isn't to say that the filmmaker is not responsible for that impression, but the dots were there, even if they were small.\n\nHere is the correct synopsis of the story the film tells, not the one written on the box:\n\nA Young Woman is born to a simple life, but quickly finds herself caught in an intergalactic business squabble, with dire consequences for her family and the world. Befriending an ex-military soldier, with a dishevelled past and an unusual ability to find people, together they fight in their own ways for what they truly want.\n\nThere is no dramatic reveal outside of a love interest, and there is no conspiracy; no horrible truth to discover. There is no attempt at making this an epic, if anything it introduces you to a world that has epic potential; the story doesn't deal with that and I think that had this movie been made by a different pair of directors, the hate-waggon would not have trampled it so badly in the press.\n\nVisually this film is stunning and in line with the greatest modern artwork in science fiction. It stretches from cosmic worlds and space stations, to an incredible refinery complex inside of a planet. This is where the film is at its strongest, in its depiction of a galaxy where humanity has grown beyond the stars. The political structure is larger than the movie, and has nods to the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy among other classic references. Some of the action feels like run of the mill TV, but for the most part the world is stunningly realized.\n\nThe female character is the focus of the plot, and she is quirky and sometimes even stupid. When she finally figures some things out, she is willing to sacrifice for what she believes. For the most part, this portrayal of a primary character is difficult to digest for mainstream audiences. She isn't strong, she's silly. She becomes infatuated at several points, with worthless things. Her relatives say as much when she asks for money, and her first meeting with Channing Tatum's character is in the midst of such a foolish decision. She is hard to like, because she doesn't exemplify good decisions or innocence and a struggles to see the larger picture. She is selfishly motivated looking for short term happiness and rushes things. She is contrasted against another character that doesn't know what he wants, but is unconsciously fighting for it the whole time.\n\nThe result is a quirky, somewhat confusing series of events that envelope around them, outside of their control, but the point is that those events don't make sense to the characters. Is this contrary to the popular mindset of films in an era dominated by Marvel sequels? Yes, and for my part, delightfully so. The number of stories being told today where the primary characters are not empowered, or the impetus behind events, who are not proactive but tragically reactive, are in short supply.\n\nConclusion: Subtle goodness lies beneath the visual spectacle, but you must be willing to let go of the omniscient perspective, and allow the world to be bigger than the story."

        "review_title": "One of the only mediocre films that needs our support",
        "review_detailed_main": "If \"Jupiter Ascending\" predictably bombs hard, or even struggles to barely break even, this could mean the future of big-budget, original science-fiction projects are a thing of the past. Over $200 million was invested into \"Jupiter Ascending,\" marketing costs included, and a return on investment of about $400 \u2013 $500 would deem the film a marginal success in Hollywood accounting terms. With that goal likely not being reached, studios are pragmatically more hesitant to release films boasting original content and will presumably continue to cling, perhaps more heavily, towards established franchises or work to reboot classics, like \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Indiana Jones.\" \"Jupiter Ascending\" is a thoroughly risky, questionable film; while it's not that great, it should still be supported for the sake of optimism in seeing more original content in Hollywood.\n\nThe film creates a world where Earth's inhabitants are unaware that a countless number of other planets have been claimed by wealthy aliens with the goal of harvesting evolved living creations upon reaching a state of perfection achieved by social Darwinism. This will produce a breed of youth serum that will effectively make them immortal. With the death of the matriarch of the House of Abrasax, one of the top alien dynasties to ever rule, her children Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth), and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) bicker for her inheritance, with Balem taking possession of a production complex on the planet Jupiter and Titus bearing his own plans to corrupt the plans for the youth serum.\n\nWith that, we focus on Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), conceived by astronomer Maximilian Jones (James D'Arcy) and Aleksa (Maria Doyle Kennedy) shortly after the death of Maximilian after a home invasion. In her adult years, despite believing she was destined for greatness, Jupiter is stuck as a janitor for wealthy people. In a desperate attempt for extra cash, Jupiter is nearly killed by doctors and nurses turning out to be agents sent by Balem to kill her when they discover her motivations to disrupt the social order of the planets. Jupiter is narrowly saved by Caine Wise (Channing Tatum), a genetically-engineered fighter, who vows to protect Jupiter during her mission of discovering her origin within a mythical and limitless world.\n\nIf this sounds confusing or perplexing, it's because it is; \"Jupiter Ascending\" is only two hours long, and for a film attempting to create its own world, compile it with rich, detailed backstory, and focus on a vast array of characters of varying motivations, that's a very short runtime. The Wachowski's have never had an issue with ambition, as all of their films are conducted on a grandscale, fearlessly operating with a sense of narrative immunity to convention. The issue is in detailing their central points, like their characters and the clarity of the film's plot. Large amounts of ambition and a vast scope can't mask the fact that \"Jupiter Ascending\"'s peculiar casting decisions and lack of character development/interest work against the quality of the final product.\n\nMila Kunis hasn't been an actress who has been able to take on a daring lead role with conviction, despite some success in \"Friends With Benefits.\" She has a woodenness to her that prohibits any kind of character sympathy. Meanwhile, Channing Tatum is like that shy guy at the party who you know is fun to be around, but when he's in the wrong social setting, as he is here, he shrivels up and becomes almost anemic and unrecognizably bland. Combine that with the entire feeling of emptiness in their characters and you have the strongest vessels of the screenplay unable to establish a connection to carry such a weighty project.\n\n\"Jupiter Ascending\"'s visuals, however, are stunning. The film is kaleidoscopic, boasting a wondrous palette of colors, vibrant textures, and boundless atmospheres, all of which Oscar-worthy or at least worthy of some recognition. The world that the Wachowski's and an army of special effects specialists create almost makes one forget what they're watching is a film that is middling on most other fronts besides visuals and art direction. Again, \"Jupiter Ascending\" is an interesting anomaly of a film; it's a film that isn't worthy of great praise outside of obvious visuals, but if we want originality and any hope for a future that is open to the possibility of new ideas, we must support this effort with our pocketbooks. The decision, as always, is up to you, consumer."

The plot was just absolute garbage and it made no sense and it was so confusing. I really was about to fall asleep, I didn't want to finish this movie because it was so boring and it made no sense, and the action was terrible. Also if you're going to see this movie for the action sequences, then just don't, because the action sequences aren't entertaining.

This movie reminds me of The chronicles of Riddick, a bit of Dune , a bit of the latest Matrix. The acting is rather poor and what's worse is the cutting or mixing of some scenes. The storyline is as said simple, almost Cinderella-kind and by God the good ones always are just in time to rescue Mila . Stopped counting how many times that happened. Then the villain is so pathetic that it made me laugh. The characters so stereotypic that I can't believe that this came from the same guys who gave us The Matrix. And being fare , The Matrix trilogy was also acting with special effects added later, but at least we had good acting. Mila is trying but it's not enough, and the scenes are so short that it is impossible for actors to give what they are supposed to do. Then there is this scene where she had to register. What was that all about ? Nicking Terry Gilliams Brazil ? In the end I can only rate this purely on what's good , the effects, images and dresses. And that's what this movie is : a dress with no substance in it. Sad."

I love the Wachowski's works since I saw (and understand) The Matrix for the first time, but to this day with Cloud Atlas in mind I was a little bit sceptical. In fact, they are able as always to deliver an appealing and interesting visual experience. The opening scene itself is mind-blowing, the score is fantastic and the special effects are awesome even if sometimes it feels very fake and entirely CGI/green screen inserted. Moreover, Channing Tatum is pretty good and functional in this movie but his BOOTS are far more interesting! Very good and original idea! Sean Bean is great as well. Unfortunately there's nothing more to say about the movie... It starts pretty strong and suddenly it becomes this two hours long story about who own the earth. Mila Kunis doesn't really embody the character and the level of emotion you can expect when all of sudden you're caught in the middle of all those incredible things. Depicting a very weak woman, who, in several scenes is about to sign her life and inheritance away basically. Then each time, Channing Tatum comes to save her when she thinks he's gone: the usual damsel in distress. She's not a strong character at all, a weak woman who can't care for herself. Plus her Earth family is not relevant at all, that's why when an ordinary person becomes a big thing they usually make this person orphan. Why? Because it's easier. I am a little disappointed by the script for this aspect and as well as the romantic dialogues are hilarious when their not supposed to be. Finally, Eddie Redmayne doesn't become relevant until the end of the movie. This guy is a very talented actor but as I was afraid of: whatever he was doing in this film... It doesn't work! It doesn't feel right at all! At last, this movie has incredibly breathtaking action scenes, it is visually very good but there's not enough substance behind it for a good movie. In the first act and then unfold on a long series of boring conversations with strange alien creatures and awful character design. Even the most dramatic and intense scenes are turned into hilarious moment (not only speaking of this weird elephant things). This film is mess that may be why it falls apart. It starts with impressive series of scenes then the script is not cohesive at all: things just happened (they go to space, they go here and there, talk to him and then to her, etc.).\n\nOverall Jupiter Ascending could have been so much more than just great mythology, concept and an amazingly grand scope. Dialogues and random scenes happening in the middle of more serious, political and emotional ones are taring the film down. At least it looks great and everybody did their part well enough."

        "review_title": "Jupiter Ascending Is A Modern Version Of Dune, For Better And For Worse",
        "review_detailed_main": "If there is one pair of directors who make films that I will always see no matter how good or bad they could possibly get, it would have to be the duo of Andy and Lana Wachowski. Ever since I first saw The Matrix (1999) when I was a kid, I have been fascinated with their films. In most cases, the Wachowskis have created films with interesting worlds and stories, breathtaking special effects and costume designs, beautiful music, intriguing (and sometimes admittedly terrible) acting performances, and an array of thought-provoking (and sometimes a bit pretentious) religious/social/economic/philosophical ideas.\n\nFor over a decade now, The Wachowskis have attempted to emulate the success that they achieved with The Matrix Trilogy, but despite their ambitious efforts, they have been unable to replicate that success. Speed Racer (2008) was visually intriguing but its story was muddled and confusing; I personally think that while Cloud Atlas (2012) was not as groundbreaking as The Matrix, I still thought it was a fantastic film with a great and thought-provoking story, amazing special effects, and some truly Oscar-worthy performances. Over time these films have been viewed more as cult classics, and in the case of Jupiter Ascending, it appears destined to also join that same category.\n\nUnfortunately, The Wachowskis' big-budget endeavors could very well come to a quick and painful close with the long-delayed release of Jupiter Ascending, a film that carries with it, for better and for worse, all the previously mentioned hallmarks of a Wachowski film, and as of this writing has been savaged by critics and appears to be another huge box-office flop in the making, which is a shame because despite its problems, I will say that Jupiter Ascending is without a doubt one of the most intriguing films I've seen in a long time, and I have to agree with some critics who are calling it a modern version of Dune (1984). The visuals, music, and world-building are incredible, but like Dune, the story is nothing short of a train wreck, and the acting is either really good or truly weird and a bit awful. Despite this, I still think Jupiter Ascending is an ambitious, though imperfect work of science fiction.\n\nWhen I mentioned that the story is a mess, that's because it is, but I will try to give a quick and spoiler-free synopsis. Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is a Russian immigrant and janitor living in Chicago, who believes her life is going nowhere. In reality, it turns out that her genes are an exact match of those of a deceased intergalactic royal leader, which makes Jupiter the rightful heir to the ownership of the planet Earth. Jupiter is then rescued from alien assassins by Caine (Channing Tatum) and Stinger (Sean Bean), two genetically spliced animal-human hybrids and former intergalactic soldiers. Throughout the rest of the film, Jupiter learns more about the Abrasax family, whose three principal heirs, Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth), and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) all have have their own ulterior motives for trying to eliminate Jupiter and take the possession of Earth for themselves. It's up to Caine and Stinger to protect Jupiter from these devious villains, and to help Jupiter accomplish her destiny to become a true intergalactic ruler.\n\nNow that plot sounds almost Star Wars or Edgar Rice Burroughs levels of simplistic, but in true fashion, the Wachowskis manage to make the plot incredibly convoluted. In almost every scene, Caine, Stinger, or the Abrasax siblings deliver incredibly complex exposition in an attempt to tell Jupiter (and the audience) about how humanity has existed for billions of years, Earth was created just so its population could be harvested in the name of intergalactic wealth, and countless discussions of destiny and talks of genetics that would make Charles Darwin proud. It almost feels like Jupiter Ascending should have had books or graphic novels released alongside it's cinematic release. The world the Wachowskis have built is grand and epic, but too confusing to navigate properly.\n\nWhenever this \"intellectual\" dialog is being delivered, many of the actors talk in ways that are actually funny rather than being serious, much like David Lynch's adaptation of Dune before it. Eddie Redmayne is unintentionally hilarious as Balem; most of the time he speaks in an almost inaudible whisper, and then will scream at the top of his lungs for no reason. It's really bizarre, and could very well earn him a Razzie nomination next year. Jupiter and Caine occasionally have romantic dialog that is cringe worthy, and while they are both good in their roles, they have no chemistry with one another.\n\nIn the end, Jupiter Ascending is all about style over substance, and the style of this film, much like Dune, is meticulous and jaw-droppingly beautiful. The action sequences are intense and exciting, the costumes and makeup effects are top-notch, and Michael Giancchino's gorgeous soundtrack is almost as good as that of Cloud Atlas. The effects used for the environments and creatures are incredible; it truly proves that what the Wachowskis lack in storytelling, they make up for it with a unique visual experience that should at least get some Oscar nominations for makeup, effects, sound design, and costumes.\n\nJupiter Ascending is almost destined to bomb at the box office and be hated by critics. The movie simply relies too much on its style and visuals, but for once I didn't care that the story and dialog was terrible. Ultimately, this is a visual experience, and as far as I'm concerned, the Wachowskis are still the masters of creating immersive worlds and groundbreaking special effects. Jupiter Ascending, like Dune 30 years ago, is a mess, but it's a beautiful and glorious one, and it still succeeded because it kept me intrigued all the way till the end of the credits, which is what is was destined to do.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10"

She lost her slipper, he found it, they lived happily ever after. Heard that story before? Well, here it is again, an inter-galactic space opera called Jupiter Ascending, only this time, Cindy has to sacrifice her eggs so that aliens can live forever. Or something like that.\n\nWelcome to the world of the Wachowskis where a simple story has to be convoluted, contrived, and copious, just to illustrate even simpler metaphors in life. Brainchild of the Matrix films and Cloud Atlas, films about other worldly existence echoing real world choices, the Wachowskis stuff Jupiter Ascending with nonsensical psychobabble that converge into its preachy messages \u2013 Aim for the stars and you might just land on the moon, and that time is a universal commodity. Problem is, Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), is a starry eyed dreamer, but without any aspirations of being anything other than a janitor. As a Russian immigrant living with her family in Chicago, Jupiter's nonexistent life changes the day she is abducted by alien humanoids. Apparently, her genetic structure makes her a threat to an alien enterprise known as the Abrasax, alien royalty led by the evil Balem (Eddie Redmayne) and his siblings Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton). Balem wants Jupiter dead but Titus and Kalique have their own agenda so they send Caine (Channing Tatum) to protect her. Caine is no prince charming, but as a half-wolf, half-human, half-albino, genetically modified warrior, who can smell foul play a galaxy away, Jupiter has half a chance of outwitting the Abrasax. And she loves dogs. Thus begins a razzle-dazzle, visually bombastic, non-stop action fairytale that goes on and on and on until you realise you've been had.\n\nSooner or later, and before the pyro-porn ending, you will also find yourself in increasing face-palm moments. For instance, by the time you look at your watch for the second time, Jupiter would have fallen from the skies several times, and each time she falls, Cain is there to rescue her. That's not just being tediously repetitive, it's downright bloatware filling up the running time. Neither are any of the actors worth mentioning, except that each is worse than the other. Kunis is definitely miscast and in over her head with nothing but dumb lines when her character isn't falling. Redmayne is perhaps the biggest disappointment as the villain, a role where he looks like Glenn Close from 101 Dalmatians and barely audible. It's a low blow considering his Oscar run in The Theory of Everything. As the only justifiable casting choice, Tatum has some inventive stunts during action scenes requiring Cain to fly around using jet propulsion boots. It's a nice touch and perhaps the only thing original in this film.\n\nIt won't take long for fans of the Wachowskis to accept that this film isn't about passion or a vision or anything resembling conventional storytelling. It's a film made for the heck of it where almost every bit of its $175 million production budget seems to favour visual effects that are frankly has-beens in a Michael Bay film. Add to that, ludicrous characters (a lizard henchman and an elephant that flies a spaceship?), an ill-conceived mythology alongside a struggling story and we are left with a colossal failure as large yet as insignificant as the titular planet. The Wachowskis on the other hand, have aimed for the stars but seem to have crash landed in a black hole. If only they had paid a little attention to Christopher Nolan."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Ascending marks the return to the silver screen for the Wachowski duo since 2011's Cloud Atlas and, much like that film, it boasts a talented set of hands behind the camera but fails to produce a shred of believable acting and good storytelling. Telling the story of Jupiter Jones, a housemaid living on Earth, as she is suddenly abducted by a genetically altered soldier, Cain, in hopes to fulfill her unknown destiny. This film wants more than anything to be taken seriously but in order to do that, the film would need to cut Channing Tatum's super elf ears and Mila Kunis' complete lack of interest to even be close to being a good film. The Wachowski duo are hell bent in creating worlds that seem as real as the room you're in but fail to create a story worth telling. By all traditional standards, Jupiter Ascending seems like a logline from a 12 year old's composition book and the film plays out very similar to that. Anyone with eyes can tell that Tatum and Kunis are counting down the hours until they can go home, they look completely disinterested in the story at hand. This makes for trouble especially when Jupiter becomes endangered. While these scenes do boast some clever action sequences, there isn't a sense of danger in this scenes. There's nothing white knuckle about it which leads to there being nothing remotely breath taking, all due to Tatum's and Kunis' urge to act as if they are sleep walking through their green screen sets. They are two really poor performances that serve as heavy disappointments considering how good we all know these two can be. The Wachowski duo's script is what seems to be in question here. There's no suspense to it and nothing remotely relate-able to any of these characters. While I do realize this is probably one of the most unrealistic sci-fi movies I could be saying that about, I do also come to terms with the fact that it is their jobs to make even being a long lost princess in a galaxy far and away to be sort of relate-able and she's not, not in the very least. Tatum plays Cain with a brutish efficiency but, in the end, I could have cared less if his character lived or died. The reason The Matrix was so good, besides having the best action sequences ever in it, was also because Keanu Reeves made the unrealistic realistic, he made us connect to him and made us want him to succeed, no matter how ridiculous the situation was. Unfortunately, Tatum and Kunis can't seem to elevate this dull script to being anything remotely enjoyable. The action sequences are brilliantly choreographed and expertly captured but nothing else in this film outside technical work is anything to rave about. If you are looking for the next Matrix, it looks like you'll have to wait for their next one because Jupiter Ascending is dull, boring, loud and obnoxious."

Yes, there were shades of the Matrix (lets replace \"Coppertop\" with \"Oil of OLay\"), and certainly more action than was necessary (Matrix Reloaded much?). However, the depth of complexity built into the universe was extraordinary.\n\nI want the prequel, I want the histories, I want the next episode, I want the further adventures of the characters we already have, and I want the Silmarillion. Because, this story had enough detail to support all of that and more.\n\nDon't watch this movie actually expecting a space opera; you'll be disappointed. Watch it expecting a mostly-okay acted sci-fi action romp, with a bit of a hasty romance, and a wonderfully complicated world - and you'll be in for a treat."

I don't agree with all their former products, but this is frankly speaking some horse apple that no one would have expected from them.\n\nWhat is so awful in this movie? - the character names (is this a kids movie?) - the acting (yes, you all want to cuddle with Mila, but having a sexy actress doesn't make movies good -except for porn flicks-, and at least I must say, Mila is not sexy at all in this movie) - CGI hell (line it up with Transformers, G.I. Joe and all that other nonsense). I don't say the CGI is badly executed, it is simply used in the wrong way. WAY TO MUCH. - almost everything is stolen from earlier movies, books, comics, computer games- style, technology, character types - the factions are a mess and the way this intergalactic society works is less than unclear, the explanations we get make it look totally unrealistic. -the dialogues are painful...the scene where Jupiter is asked to give up heir title is terrible, for example. It shows that the writers have no trust into the audience to understand even the slightest connections on their own. Everything has to be spoke out aloud...detailed and sloooowly... - the music (it had some music, I am sure. I just can't remember I heard something) - the story (yes, damsel in distress, hero knight, evil antagonist, that is quite OK and can't be original in itself. But unfortunately they didn't even try to enhance this simple concept by one iota to give it it's own colour or touch. You can repeat over and over again, that the hero is soooo tragic because he is looking for his wolf pack and yet must stay alone...it doesn't connect. Had they shown it at any time during the movie, in a flashback or by his behaviour/ticks/problems this could have been interesting. And by the way...how is Jupiter his wolf pack in the end? Oh I forgot, we aren't supposed to ask questions like that or remember anything that happened in the movie longer than 5 minutes ago.)\n\nIt's such a waste of money, time and talent (the CGI artists are talents). Can't help it, this is what most people think science fiction is about, but these people wouldn't be able to watch Odyssee 2001 to the end and would probably call that a bad movie because it \"doesn't make sense and the end is...weird\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Ascending, quite literally, is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The visual effects and CGI were top notch; nothing looked unfinished. Everything from explosions and action scenes, to space ships and settings, this movie had all the \"eye candy\" one could want. The fighting sequences were executed perfectly; each one thrilling in its own way. Each singular planet or world was so stunning and precisely crafted, that one could almost feel themselves in it. The Wachowskis have made a truly gorgeous universe in their latest movie.\n\nMichael Giacchino's music fits each scene very nicely whether it is a fast paced chase scene, or a quiet and thoughtful scene. It has a mysterious and almost hollow beauty to it, which fits this movie perfectly.\n\nAlas, not everything in this movie is as good as the visuals. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis give surprisingly good performances for the most part but some of their acting is just off. The other principal actors give good performances as well but all the acting could have been taken a notch higher.\n\nStory and Plot is where this movie is weakest though. It has so much ambition and intricacy that it is to much to fit in a two hour long movie. Even though two hours is a good length, the plot just wants to keep on going and therefor the loose ends are never quite tied up. The plot is never really explained to its entirety and while one can figure out the general idea, it is hard to go deep into it. It has huge potential but rather than using it, it discards it. I give it credit for being fairly original though, and not a sequel, reboot, or based of a graphic novel or book. Originality is a great thing and the Wachowskis do it best.\n\nOverall Jupiter Ascending lacked plot depth and great acting abilities, but it won it all back with groundbreaking visuals. Even though many more big movies are coming out in 2015, this one would be one of the best for all we know. It may not be everyone's piece of cake, but it sure is a fun sci-fi adventure that shouldn't be forgotten."

Uncomfortable dialog. Predictable and cringe-worthy, one can only describe it as the Nickelback of film. One that if aliens ever see this they will consider it as an act of hostility against them and no doubt will cause a politically fragile relationship with human beings.

This was really the only film that interested me, and, to be honest, it didn't interest me THAT much. The poor reviews are mostly correct. This just isn't very good. It's hardly torture, and the amazing visuals are enough to make it fairly watchable. But it's a mess. It feels like it was edited down from three hours. There's a ton going on, and it's all very sloppily thrown together. It's not exactly hard to follow, but that's mostly because the plot is cobbled together from science fiction and fantasy clich\u00e9s. Even if we had a longer version that spent more time developing the situation, it wouldn't have been any better. The two main heroes (played by Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis) are dull as dishwater. The villains are a little better. Eddie Redmayne has gotten a lot of guff for his hammy performance as an evil aristocrat, but whenever he's on screen it's a lot more fun. His two siblings (also evil), played by Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton, are also amusing. Tatum should really avoid these kinds of big action movies. They really bring out his worst side. Kunis isn't necessarily bad, but her character is woefully underdeveloped and she spends 90% of the movie as little more than a damsel in distress (she's clinging to Tatum for a good half the movie). I'd also complain that the action sequences are fairly bad. It's very hard to follow them. As much as I could complain about it, as I said earlier, it's a very good looking movie. The costumes in particular are just amazing."

I agree with other reviewers...it seems like they wrote this complex story in a complex world, and then gave us the condensed, rushed version in the movie.

No? Who cares.\n\nThe entire film is completely about special effects and scene after scene that shows elements ripped off directly from any one of the Star Wars films. It is clear the entire film was thought of from the perceptive of \"how could we get this cool scene in the film?\" with very little focus on a story that is chronologically and logistically ridiculous.\n\nCase in point: Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis, in the span of about 24 hours, finds out that aliens exist, that she is galactic royalty impervious to the sting of bees and survives the most ridiculously unlikely air-chase ever shown on screen without a seat belt\u0085.without even batting an eyelash or one moment of hyperventilating. I mean, I think most of us would freak out to actually meet an alien, first and foremost\u0085even a muscular, hot one in the form of Channing Tatum\u0085never mind the rest of what was thrown at her. Yet, she takes it in stride, like it is completely normal.\n\nAbsurd.\n\nTruly, the entire narrative rolls out like this\u0085with space, time and basic logic (and gravity) being completely ignored in the development of a story so completely ridiculous, Oscar-front-runner Eddie Redmayne must be crying himself to sleep for accepting to be a part of this and giving such a silly performance. In June 2014, when this film's release was pushed back by almost seven months from July 2014 to February 2015, what they should have done was rewritten the script.\n\nOn the upside, the film is visually stunning, and they certainly used 3D technology to their advantage, not to mention that Tatum's extended shirtless scene is, indeed, very entertaining while I don't think I have ever seen Mila Kunis look so beautiful. Unfortunately, she is at her best when she is dressed to the nines as a total rip off of Padm\u00e9."

Their critics are more concerned about turning out quips and smarty pants phrases than the substance of what they're supposed to be reviewing. Hell, Hamlet is the messiest longest most rambling plot of all. But that doesn't mean the Bard is all of a sudden going to be given 3/10 stars. Critics love to dig into what they hate without respect for the effort involved. And some movies are bad enough to be panned, because their bad faith is so loud and clear. Jupiter Ascending, like Lynch's maligned version of Dune, and Fincher's denigrated Alien 3, packs more cinematic punch in each scene than the whole of the childish and literal minded Star Wars opus. Some viewers look for linear narrative structures and literal plots, forgetting that film, as a predominantly audiovisual medium tells stories through images and sounds. Jupiter Ascending creates a fabulous universe visually. It is far more inventive and imaginative in this regard than many \"classics\" of the genre. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the whole time, for dear of missing some glorious imahe. Thank God we have streaming services these days, so we can go back and be stunned repeatedly with the images. The narrative premise of earthlings being farmed for the \"elixir of youth\" the aliens prize is no less valid and convincing than the Atreides/Harkonnen rivalry over the Arrakis spice in Dune or the Xenomorph/Engineers as the seeders of earth life in the Alien/Prometheus saga. We, humans, farm many species for resources we consider valuable; why would the planet wide farming premise of the movie be any more weird? It's just a matter of scale, not principle. The script is funny and tongue in cheek, and the two protagonists as well as the motley crew of villains are more than adequately sketched, Tatum, Kunis, Redmayne etc obviously having a ball playing them. Kunis has come a long way from the small screen, she's as good here as she was in Black Swan. The editing provides a crackling pace, even when the plot meanders into secondary story lines. It's an epic, FHS, have you everseen an epic from the Iliad to GOT without secondary storylines? Not even going to touch on the gender of the directors, critics who resort to such irrelevant approaches to crit show their true colours clearly enough. We never say \"male directors\" why should we say \"female directors\"? Does that somehow change the critical parameters for a work of art, any work of art? We, in the progressive, civilised West, have a long way to go here. 10 stars for a rollicking, crackling, fast-paced, fun, visually stunning sci-fi flick. Which, on top of all this parodies human values and foibles, like Star Trek's Vulcan greeting, \"live long and prosper\", that most human aspiration of all. Bravo to all involved."

The cast play their roles wonderfully, the special effects are, pun intended, out of this world and the story is actually pretty good.\n\nI raised an eyebrow at the main character's name \"Jupiter Jones\" but her back story was so compelling I eventually forgave it. Jupiter is an illegal Russian immigrant to the United States working as a house cleaner in Chicago. It's a dead-end job that gets her up at the crack of dawn and leaves her with little in the way of realizing her ambition. She plays the fish-out-of-water routine quite well, and her character development into the righteously angry avenger is evenly paced through the levels of court intrigue she is subjected to.\n\nChanning Tatum's character, Caine Wise, is not as well fleshed-out. In fact, we learn very little of him outside of his past. A disgraced soldier who takes on the job of tracking down Jupiter to redeem himself and his superior, who took the fall for his transgression, Caine eventually falls in love with Jupiter and becomes her guardian through the rest of the movie. That's really about it, not very much else in the way of development, but it works for Tatum and for the movie.\n\nThe villain of the piece is Eddie Redmayne's character, Balem. Again, this is a pretty meat and potatoes super-rich bad guy. But something about the millennia taking its toll on his sanity is very chilling, especially given the line of business he's in. A lot of his lines are delivered in a near-exhausted, whispering tone, as if he's running on nothing more than his own sinister ambition, punctuated by the occasional outburst that would make Gladiator's Commodus very proud. He's the primary antagonist, but not the only one. Brother Titus (Douglas Booth) and sister Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) add their own intrigue to the mix, and their supporting roles are well played and get the job done.\n\nSean Bean makes an appearance and one would groan at the inevitable spoiler alert this would normally induce, but I, in turn, will offer a spoiler of my own - he doesn't die. Amazing, I know. Ned Stark doesn't lose his head in this one. Sean's character, Stinger, is Caine's former Commanding Officer who joined him in disgrace. I don't like seeing Sean Bean relegated to a supporting role but he and Tatum do actually make a pretty good team in this film.\n\nThere's a plethora of minor characters to add to the mix as well. Terry Gilliam has a cameo as a aged heraldry adviser; Downton Abbey fans will be pleased to see Sarah Crowden and Jeremy Swift make an appearance; and as if Sean Bean wasn't enough, Game of Thrones fans can additionally get their fix with Owen Teale (Alliser Thorne) officiating Jupiter's wedding.\n\nThe story itself has two layers to it. On the surface, there's the Cinderella theme of a benighted young woman suddenly elevated to royalty, which is fair enough. Underneath, however, there's a murder plot and a theme exploring consumerism, and the more insidious elements of capitalism, which is present, but not so blatant as to make a Marxist viewer blush. There's a nice little reference in there to human beings reduced to the level of cattle, but I doubt it'll cause anyone to go vegan.\n\nThat's about it, really. The story is simple enough and easy to follow. Cinderella meets The Matrix is the easiest way to describe it, but there's nothing overly esoteric or interpretive to it. The backdrop is stunning, reminiscent of Asgard from the Thor movies, and there's a scene involving planetary bureaucracy that makes Jupiter bless the days she spent lined up at the DMV.\n\nIt's not, by any means, a masterpiece but it is a decent way to spend a Friday night."

I said to myself: \"this has got to be a great movie for the beginning of the year\". As days went by, the trailer was played in every commercial moments before the start of the movies I went to see. So, I was more and more attracted to it.\n\nYesterday was the big day. I went into the theater, grabbed some popcorn and sat comfortable to watch it. The start of the movie is lame. So is the next 30 mins. And so is the rest of it. Very poor acting by Mila Kunis. But it's not entirely her fault! Oh, no! The lines are so pathetic that I almost fell asleep. For everything that was happening she asked a stupid question, like she was 8 years old. \"Gosh, Mr. Badguy, you are going to kill me, aren't you?\" It's not out of the movie but is representative for her lines.\n\nThe action scenes are long, predictable and boring. Two of the characters disappear without us understanding where they went, or why they had such a short appearance.\n\nI gave it 3 stars for the visual effects witch are the only decent things in it.\n\nWell, I guess I can go on forever with my bad impressions, but I will finish this with an advice: Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your money on this pathetic, boring piece of s**t!\n\nI honestly regret watching it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Once again, the Wachowskis are taking us into a world - I willing followed them - and it did not disappoint, not really. They managed to expand the universe as we know it, while making it very close to what we know. Nothing is too foreign or weird for the mind to grasp. It's Earth plus :). They limited the complicated lingo and very clearly created a story about inheritance and how families can tear each other apart for it. The science fiction, space opera and fairy tale aspect of the story only takes it to another level.\n\nThe imagery and special effects in this movie are mesmerizing. It's aesthetic, futuristic, a bit weird but remains grounded. There is no doubt that Andy and Lana Wachowski can handle cinematography and special effects. The world they created for Jupiter Ascending is impressive and grand, clearly inspired by what we know and have on Earth while still feeling eerie and otherworldly. The action in the film is thrilling, whether Caine (Channing Tatum) is on foot or in a spaceship being chased or fighting hand-to-hand the action is breathtaking and easy to follow. It all makes the film entertaining to watch.\n\nBut the movie suffers from a few bumps, that are a bit of pace problem and some less than amazing acting performances. The pace is checkered, sporadic, every time you get anxious for Jupiter or Caine things die down before picking back up again. They also did a crappy job with the trailers because some of the trailers clearly give away too much away. As for some of the performances, they're not as bad as previously advertised. Mila Kunis is lovable and very much grounds the movie while Channing Tatum introduces us to the enormity of this world. Eddie Redmayne made some bold character choices for his portrayal of Balem, I'm not sure they were the best for this movie but they somehow kind of work.\n\nIn all Jupiter Ascending is a good movie, not great but good. It might be not worthy of what is expected from The Wachowskis, they can't always be groundbreaking, but they're good. They left the door open to possible sequel but I have the feeling that it won't be made."

Especially when following so close on the heels of Interstellar, which set the bar pretty high as far as science fiction is concerned. It's more than a little bit on the cheesy side...and the narrative, in addition to being ludicrously over-the-top, jumps around in a seemingly pointless and distracting manner. Visually, it's pretty, and the special effects work is excellent, but that is hardly enough to salvage what was essentially a joke of a story. The acting was surprisingly good for being contained with the vessel of this movie...even where Channing Tatum was concerned, though he definitely wouldn't earn any awards for his performance, and he looked ridiculous in the makeup for the role (imagine James Hetfield of Metallica as an elf in Lord of the Rings and you will be coming somewhat close). Not that anyone would ever expect Tatum to merit any sort of award for acting outside of Teen Choice or MTV Movie Award shows, unless he really kicks it up a notch. Ultimately, the movie was just fun enough to be worth watching, once you get past the abysmally cobbled together story. There are some fairly interesting and enjoyable action sequences as well as some rare instances when the script doesn't feel like it was written by an adolescent comic book fanatic with ADHD who happened to watch The Fifth Element and Battlefield Earth a few dozen times. I can't help but feel like there should have been some point where someone sat down with the Wachowski's and told them that the whole movie needed to be edited in a way that made it watchable, but if that happened, they declined...and the movie I just watched is what we get as a result. I really wanted to like this movie, after all, I love science fiction...but that love of science fiction may be the only thing that made this movie palatable for me. It isn't a great movie, it barely even qualifies as being good. If you have other things you've been dying to watch, I would say that you're safe to watch them instead of this, but for lack of anything else to watch, this one will do in a pinch. And if you happen to dig the whole unwilling, surprise messiah story that they already tackled (much better) in The Matrix, I guess I would say to go for it."

Jupiter is an alien, illegal that is, living in New York City with her family as a cleaning lady. Life is tiresome and routine and she secretly longs for more. Jupiter gets more than she bargained for when she finds out there is an intergalactic world out there \u2013 and she is a noble woman reincarnate. Exploring the universe entails finding her battling spatial creatures and dealing with her spoiled children.\n\nJupiter Ascending is so uninspired and poorly conceived it is genuinely comical. From the acting, directing and script to the lack of imagination and adventure, Jupiter Ascending is a failure from start to finish. All those involved in the picture would be better off had it never made it to the screen and no one had ever seen this piece of trash.\n\nChanning Tatum saunters about and pouts while donning an atrocious goatee. Mila Kunis says the words but does nothing to even attempt to salvage the movie with any excuse for acting. The worst by far is the gifted Eddie Redmayne, whose version of a bad guy is someone who whispers incessantly except when shouting. Though, admittedly, none of those involved were given much to work with.\n\nThe caliber of final product in Jupiter Ascending is not even worthy for a made for TV-movie. The plot is near worthless and there was no reason for the script to be made and waste of time for all parties, but especially the audience viewers unlucky enough to watch the film.\n\nPlease check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie reminds me of one of my favourite sci-fi movies of all time, The Fifth Element. Mostly, because when I saw it, I thought it was one of the most gorgeously shot movies I've ever seen. This was the same way. I keep remembering pictures from it, environments that I kind of wanted to melt into, and be in that scene. The space ships were majestic. The dresses that Jupiter wore, I want all of them. They were intricate, beautiful, and sleek. Kym Barrett is a goddess.\n\nThe concept of the world I liked. It was intricate, and well- thought-out. The way they meddled with genes and technology gave it a good variety, and also a great range to play with. Without spoiling the story, the Earth origin story was believable, and it gave a good explanation to what we saw.\n\nThe story itself was good. There were some humorous moments, like the bureaucracy. There wasn't much of a twist, the \"mystery\" element was quite obvious after the first about 30 minutes. The action was fast-paced, however, and looked great. The romance aspect was very minor, and a bit forced. It was obviously coming, but it didn't seem to actually play a role in the events, or in how the characters interacted with each other. If they had just been friends, I don't think it would have made much of a difference. Note to film-makers, there doesn't have to be a romantic aspect in every story.\n\nThe casting was also good. Mila did a great job as Jupiter. She was as confused about everything as can be expected, but at the end could harden her face and kick some ass. Channing is starting to be a bit overused as the resident muscled love interest. Not that he's not hot, or that he didn't growl appropriately, but I'm starting to feel bad for every other muscular male actor out there. I did feel, however, that his role was rather generic, and repetitive.\n\nSo the movie itself didn't blow me away in its complexity, just the pictures did. However, it is a fun sci-fi movie, and I would love to have a sequel, or even just books, because I want to know what happens to Jupiter in the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of haters out there! It is easy for reviewers to smugly sit back and criticize any movie for any reason. The major complaint is that the Jupiter Ascending (JA) lacked substance. PLEASE. Hollywood lacks substance. The purpose of all movies is to entertain, not enlighten. Roller coasters can not expand the mind when they are only made to thrill. Many reviewers said they walked into the theater expecting the worst, then why bother? Perhaps they would have been more entertained by Sponge Bob the Movie. It was an option at the time. The true sophisticates could have rented Out of Africa and gotten a belly full of character development. The legions of Star Wars fans line up to see movies with just as much depth, but you don't read reviewers bitching about George Lucas.\n\nNancy Blatch made the statement that millennia old advanced species would behave differently. If that were the case, there would be no flipping movie. Of course any advanced culture would have little in common with Earth's messed up primates. That's why we go to the movies, to escape.\n\nLet me break it down: 1) JA is first and foremost an action movie and if pleases the kids while not boring me, I'm in. Dynamic action sequences start to finish. 2) Special effects for Science Fiction is a given. Does this movie deliver? Yes 3) JA has unique and original elements. The seeding and harvesting of planets for their human crop is new. The merging of tech and biological beings is pretty cool. 4) The visuals are excellent and world crafting worth a deeper look. 5) Characterization is not the prime mover and may strike many as being superficial. Do you want backstory or a trip to an alien home-world. I vote home-world 6) The actors are engaging and accessible regardless of how many dimensions they express. Like our society is 3 dimensional.\n\nGo for the ride. Go for the visuals. Just watch and see for yourself. As for the haters they can rock back and forth droning, \"Look mommy I spread pooh all over the TV.\""

The movie must surely be the most vacuous, mega-budget Sci-Fi potboiler ever filmed, and it possesses a full cargo of bombastic baggage - ludicrous plot, pompous dialog, wooden acting, interminable action sequences, hammy heroes, black-hearted villains and a plucky heroine with royal DNA.\n\nThe story boils down to a fairy tale about a Russian-American called Jupiter who works as a humble toilet cleaner in Chicago. After messengers from space arrive to inform her she's actually galactic royalty, this princess encounters an oligarch who rules an interstellar civilization from his base inside the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. The evil scoundrel derives his power from harvesting human beings to distill an elixir for eternal youth, and the Chicagoan Cinderella is the only person who can thwart his diabolical schemes. Anyone who can endure such fantastical drivel should salute Mila Kunis for her brave attempts to keep a straight face as she speaks Jupiter's fatuous lines, while being addressed as \"Your Majesty\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I was a little girl, I often played at being a princess: I would be very beautiful, have lots of suitors and live in a gorgeous castle. I would also be very clever (I would often invent the elevator) and a good ruler for my subjects. I would then fall in love with a chivalrous young man who had faced a great danger for me, like dragons, evil sorcerers or highwaymen.\n\nI am a grown woman now, but somewhere inside me this little girl is still there. And she loved \"Jupiter Ascending\".\n\nThis isn't a movie to watch for its philosophical message (even if there is one) or for its social commentary (even if you could find one). This is a movie to watch and be immersed in a whole new world, be amazed by its beautiful landscapes, architecture, costumes, and by its cool gadgets (seriously, who wouldn't want flying boots like Caine's?) and spaceships. This is a film to watch and indulge in your craziest childhood fantasies, like flying, going to another planet, being queen of the universe, you name it, and to be entertained.\n\nIf this world created by the Wachowskis is so immersive, it's not only because it's well thought and beautifully designed, but also thanks to the cast. In this review, I would like to single out two performances.\n\nMila Kunis plays the lead, Jupiter Jones, an underprivileged girl who dreams of a better life. Kunis, with her good looks, could have seemed fake in this role, but no, she is credible and very relatable (and this is important, since she also is the audience surrogate). One common criticism of the film is that she's too passive. It isn't completely fair. Jupiter isn't an action hero, but an everywoman catapulted in a foreign world, forced to play a game without knowing all the rules. But she learns quickly and grows as a woman throughout the movie.\n\nThe most unfairly criticized performance from this movie is Eddie Redmayne's, playing the villainous Balem Abrasax. It's true that his performance is over-the-top, but this is because he plays an over- the-top character. Balem is a thousands-years-old power-mad psychopath who combines an unhinged mind with a complete lack of morals, and Redmayne portrays him very well.\n\nThe rest of the cast is great, too. Every character seems real, even the ones we don't know much about.\n\n\"Jupiter Ascending\" also has good moments of humor and knows when not to take itself too seriously. This is all \"make-believe\" after all.\n\nThe only regret I have towards this movie is that it's standalone. I would have loved to explore more of this universe and its characters in a sequel."

It's only because I like the Wachowskis that I even gave this a shot. The plot is equally convoluted as it is clich\u00e9d, throwing in everything from fairy tales, science-fiction and space opera. The back story on half of the characters would probably fill several graphic novels, if it weren't for the fact that instead of characters, there are just a bunch of archetypes/stereotypes that function as exposition machines in between visually stunning, but excessive, action sequences. Half the time I was in awe of what was accomplished through VFX/CG, but the other half was spent rolling my eyes and laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. If plot even needs to be addressed at all, Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) cleans houses for a living, but finds out that she's more important than she thought. There were moments of respite in between the action, and a few of these is where I thought that the film might be onto something. Then it would switch back to \"whiz, bang, pop\" mode. If there's anything to say in the film's favor, it has some of the best visual effects I've ever seen, and the performances weren't bad. Getting through this was like being beaten into submission at first, but at some point I just gave up and let the film take me on the ride it wanted to give me. No one's going to win any awards for this (except maybe the VFX team), although I see this getting nominated for a few Razzies. The story is just dumb. It's also a piece of history, because this is likely the last big budget that the Wachowskis will ever see. So, why 6/10? Well, I don't feel like putting down the Wachowskis too much since they seemed to have put a lot of work into this. It also can be an interesting watch insofar as you can laugh with your friends at how bonkers the story is. Beyond that, if you weren't already a fan of the Wachowskis or space opera in general, you're better spending your time and money elsewhere."

About the only thing Eddie Redmayne doesn't do is twirl his big black moustache and tie Mila Kunis to the rail road track.\n\nIt looks like every single dollar of its vast budget is up on the screen either blowing up or crashing down around you and if you turn off the need for characters with more than two dimensions and actual motivations and a plot rather than stuff that happens then you'll have a good time enjoying the eye candy.\n\nProbably ideal for those who find \"The Fifth Element\" a bit too intense and high brow."

Then of course there's \"Star Wars\" which 10 year-old (and those who think like them) find deeply profound and meaningful.\n\nPurely as escapist entertainment, \"Jupiter Ascending\" is awesome. Mila Kunis is superb. A week after watching it I still can't get it out of my mind. I plan to buy a copy of the DVD so I can watch it again."

Movie is visually stunning. It feels like Star Wars 1 meets Harry Potter. Channing Tatum is always worth to watch and there is something new in this story too. Of course some acts are extravagant and quite lame, but if you just want to relax and watch decent space action movie it really is worth to watch. If you want to tell something bad from this, then I can think few things. Film cutting is sometimes too fast and action scenes are mainly way too long. First I was going to watch this as 3D, but because of bad show times I was forced to watch it in 2D. When this will come out in BluRay, I might add my comments how 3D works on this. Many times these effect movies works well in 3D, I just have to wait to see it in home theatre. This movie is visually stunning although sometimes over acted with quite lame script. It is best to watch from big screen with lot of popcorn and soda and take it as a pure entertainment. Very well worth to watch if you can simply enjoy decent space soap opera."

        "review_title": "A beautifully-crafted world that's practically begging for sequels - but is unlikely to get them because the plot and characters are somewhat undercooked.",
        "review_detailed_main": "You can't fault the Wachowskis for ambition. Jupiter Ascending, their latest foray into the sci-fi/fantasy genre, is a triumph of world creation - the film grafts an astoundingly complex and layered fantasy universe onto our own that could easily support a clutch of films, a television series and spin-off novels galore. But it also suffers from a weak script - the Wachowskis appear to have extracted the fascinating details of their breathtaking world from the 600 pages of their first draft, but only remembered to ask their characters along for the ride as an afterthought.\n\nJupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) can't imagine much of a world beyond the tiny one she inhabits: she cleans toilets with her mother and covets a telescope so she can travel into the stars. That journey becomes quite a literal one, however, when the unique pattern of her DNA comes to the attention of the money-grabbing, galaxy-dominating Abrasax siblings: Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth), and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton). Suddenly, she is the focus of an intense (wo)manhunt that spans universes. Caine Wise, a genetically- spliced former soldier, fights off assassins and bounty-hunters alike to emerge with Jupiter by his side. But, as the two bond and Jupiter uncovers the truth about her place in the wider world, Caine starts to doubt whether he should surrender her to the Abrasax family after all.\n\nThe breadth and depth of the Wachowskis' new cinematic playground has to be seen to be believed. Like all good sci-fi/fantasy, it explodes the notions of time and space that we live with everyday, crafting a sprawling universe that you can easily believe exists alongside our own. Concepts we take for granted - mankind, evolution, history, capitalism and reincarnation - are turned on their heads. All of this is presented in a matter-of-fact, almost casually realistic way: Caine sports pointed ears as a hint to the strain of wolf in his genes, alien races subsist alongside space- faring humans, and the scientific notion of DNA is given an intriguing spiritual twist. It all adds up to a universe it'd be easy to get lost in - a fictional construct of such staggering complexity that revisiting it would be a pleasure.\n\nBut, for all the intricacies of their world-building, the Wachowskis don't manage to breathe quite enough life into their plot or characters. As Jupiter meets and invariably falls out with each member of the Abrasax clan, the narrative jerks speedily along in episodic chunks. The romance that inevitably springs up between Jupiter and Caine can also be frustrating in the extreme, partly because it feels like it comes out of nowhere - but also because it's just rather poorly-written. Even so, for all of Jupiter Ascending's plotting problems, it's easy to imagine a television series - allowed to unfold at a slower pace - realising the promise hidden within so many moments of the film.\n\nIt's also tough to warm up to most of the characters populating this world. The Abrasax siblings, in particular, are a frustrating bunch. It's annoying enough that they're written as one-note villains, drunk on vanity and longevity and locked into centuries of internecine warfare. What's even stranger is that they're so determinedly played as such. Booth and Middleton are both awkward and arch, barely able to suggest unseen layers when the script provides for them. An otherwise great actor, Redmayne, too, is reduced to a strange, low-pitched snarl of a character here; Balen radiates a static buzz of megalomania that becomes almost comical as the film wears on.\n\nAt least Jupiter Jones is a fun character to spend time with. She may be weighed down by a slightly soggy romance and a rather disturbing alter ego, but it's nice to have such a huge movie assembled around a female character as self-possessed and determined as she is. Jupiter holds true to her own ideals and family, even when she's confronted with the possibility that - in another lifetime - she might not have cared all that much about either. Kunis is rather charming, shaking up her trademark cocktail of innocence and world-weariness as Jupiter. There are a few enjoyable character beats for Caine, too, particularly when the film delves into his history with another decommissioned inter-galactic soldier, Stinger Apini (Sean Bean).\n\nIt's a rare movie that manages to inspire and disappoint at the same time. But that's precisely what Jupiter Ascending does. The Wachowskis present such an intoxicating vision of their universe (dinosaurs, bees and all) that the thought of spending more time in it is wonderfully appealing. It's a shame that the story they've chosen as the focus of the film is broken up into such awkward chunks, with its characters getting more than a little lost in the tumult of ideas."

        "review_detailed_main": "You could honestly live without seeing this movie. Since Larry's change into Lana, his work has seriously taken a turn for the serious, but, irrelevant. The opening sequence seems innocently enough as a romance between a mother of the daughter, who is getting impregnated. If it weren't for the hand (yes, the tell-tale right hand), suddenly, what was once a normal woman becomes a shocking... I will not say it. Then, as a segue way to the romancing of the pregnant mother, a line, \"It is more to not look on what is on the outside of the person but for the greater good inside the person.\" Morals? Since when did people drop moral values as one liners in movies?\n\nLater on, a picture of this mother appears on the daughter's cell-phone. She has some gnarly, freakish smile that just makes me guffaw in disgust. Is this some kind of sick joke played on the audience? We know that a Mila Kunis could not come from her but are we lead to believe?\n\nSo it's an action movie, no wait, it's a Cinderella movie. There's a huge ring that the bridge to be is to wear in exchange for saving the human race via sacrifice. Or, there's the other route, which is the cool explosive route, reminiscent of Matrix choreography. Yes, it's as if the sub-plot was far too unpacked and it doesn't complement the main plot. What exactly is the main plot though? Or are we just glorifying the idea of marriage too, now?\n\nWell, what is redeeming of this movie? I have to say, the art direction, the CGI (like when the ship is going through the clouds of Jupiter), the sets are all really cool. I'd say all of the actors did a really good job (except for that one I mentioned). The action is great but the sky-skating reminds me strongly of ice skating. And the glittery, whooshing, trails they make through out the sky is so Disney. More of that feminine bull crap being mixed in a masculine movie.\n\nHonestly, I think if the Wachowskis want to save their career, they need to split ways. Lana is now working to populate the world with her agenda based morals, while I think Andy is trying to keep it real."

That cognitively (I did or did not just make up that word.) challenged less-evolved humans ( Those whom are not right-brain dominant.) should NOT be allowed to write movie reviews or vote. Stupidity has a momentum all its own and can cause disasters of universal proportions. First of all, I am not an expert in movies. No one is. Just as there are no experts in poetry either. All anyone can do is offer informed and studied opinion and in my informed and studied opinion Jupiter Ascending is a gloriously fun and entertaining movie. Is it extraordinary? I don't feel so but since in my opinion I've only seen one that came close and that was Lawrence of Arabia. Peter O'toole is definitely in my top ten of greatest actors. Sorry, I digress. After reading hundreds of negative reviews about this movie the one consistent theme throughout all of them was that the reviewers wanted specific things from the movie before actually seeing it. They kept harping about how everything was so shallow and not fleshed out. It was as if they wanted a great movie without themselves having to work at making it a great movie. An audience brings a great movie to the theatre. Your imagination should be flying even before you get to the theatre. But obviously these reviewers left their imaginations at home (If they even possess one.) because to say this movie is lacking (in my opinion) in anything is ludicrous. The first time I watched this film I had no knowledge of it, hence no preconceived notions. Just the title and companion graphics peeked my interest enough to watch the trailer. I watched it immediately. I was still unaware of the backstory to this film even though I saw it for the first time in fall of 2017. I was amazed, truly amazed. As of this writing I've watched it dozens of times and every time my imagination fills in just a little more of the Universe that the W's created. This movie gives you just enough in all the right ways so YOU can CREATE an incredible story. Just a few more things and I'll leave you to watch this wonderful movie. After you do, then come back and read these reviews again and you will see some of their ideas on the film are completely wrong. The reviewers keep screaming about plot blanks. That the characters get from one point to another with no continuity. This is patently false. Not once did I ever lose the thread of what was taking place. Of course, I have an imagination so I don't need everything explained. But that's just me... If you're a voracious reader like myself you tend, or always perhaps, see the novel in movie form. With great attention to detail you fill in the blanks of the scene the author is describing. With movies, especially this movie, the directors have given you the most glorious visuals and as always the dialogue is there for context. It is up to you to create this stunning world you have been given a glimpse of. I wish you could see it the way I saw it, with an utter lack of reference but please do your best. Never take an opinion on faith, even if that opinion is accepted as fact by millions. Ones opinion can be a tragedy. Millions blindly following that same opinion can be an election.\n\n10/10"

Alas, whatever talent the Wachowski's promised in the art of storytelling is in no way present in either their next project \"Cloud Atlas\" nor \"Jupiter Ascending\". \"Cloud Atlas,\" which had as much potential as \"The Matrix,\" was ruined by DELIBERATELY unintelligible dialog in the exposition and episodes so short they seemed more like scenes from separate movies. On the other hand, \"Jupiter Ascending\" is ruined by the imposition of more characters (heck, more SPECIES) than a Russian novel, a villain who sounds as if he belongs in an iron lung and unintentionally funny technology (Channing Tatum, in his \"gravity boots\" reminds me of Wilie E. Coyote wearing a product from Acme)and ludicrous, unfunny social commentary on government red tape.

        "review_detailed_main": "It can be difficult for people from underdeveloped worlds to hear that their planet is not the only inhabited planet.\n\nIn terms of views and images, \"Jupiter Ascending\" is a spectacle with an impressive space footage, sometimes rousing action sequences and titillating extraterrestrial fantasies. But just as a book of Jack Vance, it really doesn't make any sense in the beginning. The difference is that while reading that book of Vance, the intended message becomes clear to you. With \"Jupiter Ascending\" it's still fairly muddled and incomprehensible in the end and you seem to sink into hotchpotch of futuristic ideas. An epic work that throws together different aspects from other SF classics such as \"Flash Gordon\", \"Star Wars\" and \"Battlestar Galactica\". The added Cinderella fairytale with someone living on earth whose DNA equals that of some space queen, makes it complete.\n\nJupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is of Russian descent and has to get up early every day to help her mother clean up rich people houses. Every day she plunges the toilet brush in dirty toilets, without realizing that she has identical genes as the deceased matriarch of the house of Abrasax and in that way she's the owner of planet Earth. The house of Abrasax is an alien royal family that owns several planets. These planets serve merely to be harvested so they can produce a youth serum. The remaining heirs Balem (Eddie Redmayne) Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth) only benefit from the disappearance of this earthling. And that's when Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) shows up. Caine, a former soldier, has been instructed to protect Jupiter.\n\nThe Wachowskis not only experienced a physical (at least one of the two) transformation, but there's also something missing when it comes to creativity because they seem to be unable to match the masterful and groundbreaking \"The Matrix\". Visually \"Jupiter Ascending\" is a masterpiece, but the story is a messy and chaotic whole. The release of the movie was delayed because of certain deficiencies and they still needed to adjust the visual character of the film. That wasn't a good omen in the first place. Especially the characters without depth, the ridiculous dialogues and a forced romantic story make this film pretty weak. I admit that the rescue operation at the beginning of the film in which Caine prevents Jupiter being abducted by alien \"Keepers\", while flying around on his jet-like roller skates, was a breathtaking part that lasted for ages. The flashy chase between the buildings is intense, exciting and masterfully portrayed. But that wasn't the last time he had to save her. The film seems like an endless rescue operation. And after a while those special skates aren't that special anymore.\n\nThe weakest point of this movie are the characters. Mila Kunis is better than expected but unfortunately it feels as if she's running around the whole movie screaming out loud, while showcasing her \"looks\". Channing has a tough appearance, but soon gets bogged down in an uninspired parody of himself, struggling with his own feelings. The duo eventually ends up as a kind of \"Danny and Sandy in space\" couple. A faint love story about two people from two different space systems. The Abrasax family is also a mishmash that didn't really convince. Tuppence Middleton plays no significant role at all. And Redmayne surprised me completely (after I've seen him shine in \"The theory of everything\") as the wily and cruel Balem who sounded fairly menacing with that whispering voice. Until he starts shouting out of anger and frustrations in a fit. I spontaneously started to chuckle. The only two actors who were convincing were Sean Bean and Douglas Booth. And let's not forget the Russian family sitting together at the dining table. These scenes achieved the highest grade of humorous content.\n\nDo you want to be lead away through the infinite universe where you'll experience one surprise after another and become completely bewildered by the brilliant computer graphics (and as I have been told the 3D version is unprecedented) ? Well, then you have to see this epic space story, full of strange creatures, aliens and exotic places. You also like some romantic posturing and a happy ending ? Than you shouldn't miss it either. But are you also wishing for a fascinating story filled with interesting characters, then this will be a huge disappointment. A better alternative is \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" where the mix of all these ingredients doesn't create a bitter aftertaste !\n\nMore reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

They have: 3 \"heirs-sibling\"issue, a \"parent-child\" issue, a true love story and self-overcome struggle. Trying to cover everyone/every bit, they did nothing well. The characters are thin as a piece of paper. Honestly Mila Kunis depicted as this ... nobody believes that.\n\nThe Scene production is fantastic despite I see too much other SF it. That makes it good fun but unfortunately the music did everything as it should and hence did not surprise. The Gowns and costumes are beautiful, a plus. One point: Eddie Redmayne is one of my fav bad-dark-side characters from now on. Good fun but don't expect something extraordinary"

It definitely seemed like should have been part of a much larger movie.\n\nIt was a pretty fun fast paced science fiction movie, pretty bonkers at parts for sure. There was some really unnecessary romance parts that did not seem to fit into the movie at all. A lot of explanation was quickly brushed over and didn't go into the detail it should have. Some of the characters were not explained at all and i have no idea why they were doing what they were doing even though they seemed to have kind of big roles.\n\nCast was great though. Channing Tatum did a good job playing the hero but I wished his back story was a little more explained. I thought Mila Kunis was outstanding even if the movie wasn't all that great her performance in it was good and I think she is a generally good actor. Eddie Redmayne can play a villain pretty well and I would really like to see him in that type of role more often, I was very impressed with him as a bad guy.\n\nOver all i would so sure go ahead and check it out. But it no big deal to have never seen it"

        "review_detailed_main": "Putting a space opera on the screen is a very difficult task. Usually, a space opera involves many worlds, a lot of exotic characters with complicated backstories and a number of plots and subplots with a significant amount of pages dedicated to world building. A typical space opera is more than 1000 pages long and one fantasy analogue - the Lord of the Rings took 3 3-hour long movies to be recreated properly.\n\nThe Wachowskis sisters made 1 2-hours long movie which is complete in itself (even though I certainly would love to see a continuation). To do that, they chose to dismiss a great deal of scientific realism, dialogue complexity and character development. And they decided to bet a lot on visual richness and emotional straight-forwardness. Which totally worked for me.\n\nIt is a truly entertaining story of modern Cinderella sucked in a galactic battle for power and well, more time. The movie combines conspiracy theories, romance and sci-fi. It has a very decent story line, a lot of impressive (even if not very realistic) action scenes and in the end, it even leaves a positive message to the viewer. It does everything a space opera is supposed to do in the 2 hours it plays.\n\nFor me this movie was seriously underrated and fell victim to a negative campaign led by people who were unprepared for the specifics of the genre. Space opera is not hard-core science fiction, it just has different premises. And the fact that it made 90% of its money outside of the USA and that it is constantly rotated on HBO demonstrates just how liked this movies is outside of the USA. And I'm extremely fed up with critics saying it failed to deliver. Failed to deliver what? It is fun, it has original story (something very rare nowadays), decent acting, great visuals and music, it has no blood and gore and its cruelty levels are in the range of what was considered normal before \"Game of Thrones\" numbed our senses. It is a good movie told a bit as a sparkling fairy tale.\n\nOn the negative side: I really wish the science in the movie was better thought of. Especially the part on Earth. In space, you can easily believe any unrealistic activities are due to technology upgrades or genetic mutations/splicing/whatever. But on Earth, there are no excuses. And some goofs are really annoying and shouldn't be allowed by serious script writers. Also, I'd love more character depth, just for the pinch of salt in the chocolate."

Tatum\n\nBut when it includes a dashing, handsome, solidly built half-wolf with Vulcan ears and roller-skate thrusters instead of shoes, perhaps that price isn't so bad. Soon enough she's blindly smitten by his looks alone, deleting any reluctance and awe for being catapulted into this extremely bizarre circumstance.\n\nIn the resilient protector role is Channing Tatum. His Caine Wise is a cross between Clint Eastwood's Spaghetti Western loner and Superman, which makes Jupiter an ideal Lois Lane. They even fly around together when he's not getting her out of close calls: Which is all JUPITER ASCENDING amounts to...\n\nWith a barrage of rambling exposition explaining the complicated star world run by an interstellar royal family pulling Jupiter... who happens to be their Queen... like a political wishbone, the action scenes are what you'll remember in this potentially epic science-fantasy that winds up merely filling time and space."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a nutshell, \"Jupiter Ascending\" is to \"Dune\" what \"Spaceballs\" is to \"Star Wars\": a spoof that makes you cringe rather than laugh. There even is a half man/half dog guy with funny ears in \"Jupiter Ascending\", just like in \"Spaceballs\". The problem is, \"Jupiter Ascending\" wasn't intended to be a comedy, but a meaningful, philosophical epic. Full of pathos and megalomania, it wants to tell you about galactic dynasties and their awe-inspiring powers, but what they show you for ruler of the universe is a whispering bloke who you wouldn't believe capable of managing a basketball team.\n\nEven reviewers who loved the movie admitted it's rather for the beautiful backgrounds and colorful explosions than for the story. A cleaning lady finds out she is queen of the galaxy, how many times does this kind of thing happen? The villain abducts her family to blackmail her like a small town gangster, although he has the power to destroy planets? The hero survives in space without a space-suit? Queen falls in love with hero after seeing him skate for a minute or two? The audience won't buy any of this, and with this severe lack of credibility, the 'epic' drags on and on.\n\nThe 'wrestling with bureaucracy' scene when Jupiter has to fill in a lot of forms, until finally her lawyer gives up and tries bribery, was the only time when I had some hope for a few funny moments at least, alas, it was only an interlude before they continued with talking dinosaur mutants and more explosions in space.\n\nEspecially Mila Kunis seems totally lost. Whether a bowl of soup is placed in front of her or the key to the kingdom, whether a guy suddenly unfolds huge wings on his back or an alien space-ship explodes - she keeps the same facial expression. If I ever had any doubt whether they are really just standing in front of a green screen all the time, now I know."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Wachowskis must be given kudos for their grand vision. True originality is a rare thing in cinema these days and should be celebrated. This, however, is a film that reminds me of the comments on my high school report cards: \"Plenty of potential. Easily distracted. Crippled by sexual frustration.\" Okay, that last sentence doesn't really apply here.\n\nI remember seeing the trailer for this on the big screen a couple months back. I came away from that thinking this would be the greatest sci-fi movie of all time. If there was an Academy Award for not living up to expectations the Wacky siblings would have another little gold statue to go with the four awarded to The Matrix in 2000.\n\nThis is not a bad movie. There are aspects of it that are excellent. I really like the general premise: The human race is millions of years old and spread throughout the galaxy. Our planet was 'seeded' a hundred thousand years ago and human life is farmed to provide eternal youth for the wealthy galactic elite. But, Earth is fast approaching it's optimum level where it will be harvested, to maximise profits, thus ending life on the planet.\n\nIt's one of the more visually spectacular movies I have seen. The special effects are outstanding, the costumes and make up are lavish and the battles look incredible. It also features the equally stunning Mila Kunis as the aptly named 'Jupiter Jones', who is the genetically reincarnated version of the mother of 'Balem Abrasax', an immensely wealthy and powerful galactic royal who happens to own Earth.\n\nMila could be used as a metaphor for the whole movie. Beautiful to look at, but sorely lacking in depth. The cast as a whole are OK, at best. Channing Tatum is Channing Tatum but with a goatie and wolf ears. I have to say, from an aesthetic point of view, if I was the Wachowskis I'd be a little disappointed with him. He is clearly a guy who can get women into theatres and in this he is shirtless for a good hour, yet he seriously looks like he's let himself go a little. Don't get me wrong, he still looks substantially better than I could ever hope to, but if I was handing over his pay cheque I'd insist he be carved up like Hugh Jackman as The Wolverine in X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\nSean Bean is solid as 'Space Ned Stark', while Eddie Redmayne, fresh from winning an Oscar for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything Movie, is just plain bad as Balem Abrasax. He is like a futuristic Voldemort with Tourettes syndrome. Worst villain ever.\n\nRedmayne would have a good case if he chose to blame the script for his sub-par performance. The dialogue is clunky at best. For any sci-fi movie to work you need to be able to suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours. That is nigh on impossible when you are regularly scoffing at the dribble being spewed forth.\n\nThis will go down in history as one of those movies that could've been an all-time classic, but just doesn't work. I like that the storyline is an analogy for how corporations rule our world and we are their unwitting slaves. It's a film that could convey an important message, but unfortunately, it gets lost in translation. 6/10\n\nSee all our reviews at www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews"

I was not all that excited about this going in, and I have to say this was pretty much what I expected. The movie really reminded me of the Star Wars prequels. By that I mean the movie was visually striking and fun to look at. On the other hand the plot became really complicated and jumbled and that takes people out of the story. Also, much like the prequels the dialog is laughably bad and no amount of Oscar nominated actors can save it. This was a pretty hard movie to get through, I'm sure some people will like it but for me it was a struggle. Overall, if you liked Cloud Atlas you will most likely like this as well. As for me, I wasn't a fan of either. I give this a C."

In 3-D, this movie is amazing. I knew it wouldn't be the same if I waited it to come out on DVD, so I watched it in the theater, and I was fully satisfied. Ships flying at me, debris coming out of nowhere, awesome fight scenes in the air, beautiful and colorful dresses on Kunis --- it was amazing. Even my mom stayed awake! So yes, I wanted more character development, too\u0085but I think that's because they introduced such interesting characters!! I'm just hoping they write a book so I can read more into the stories. You could do much more character development in a 600 page book than in a 2 hour movie. This story-line is along the caliber of J.R.R. Tolkien's novels, without the space to develop the plot. There were definitely Harry Potter-like scenes, and also areas that were reminiscent of Hunger Games as well, particularly with the elaborate clothing, bureaucracy and deceit tactics used by the upper echelon of the society. Anyways - the point is, I loved it and I wish that they would write a book or go into the back story of some of the individual characters a bit more."

        "review_detailed_main": "Andy and Lana Wachowski's adaptation of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas is a colorful and archaic sci-fi film that combines elements of Star Wars, Matrix, and Flash Gordon. The plot revolves around extraterrestrials who rule Earth from afar, but their plans to \"harvest\" its riches are confounded by the genetic resurgence of intergalactic royalty in the form of Mila Kunis. Channing Tatum stars as Clark Kent, playing Mila Kunis's Lois Lane. The film features starship dogfights, interplanetary shoot-em-ups, and endless stick-on ears. The film is overly overdressed with dialogue that would make George Lucas cringe. Eddie Redmayne, the evil space royal, delivers a breathy ennui with bouts of mummy's boy shrieking, all delivered with a \"petite-mort\" look that suggests he is being fellated by eternity itself. The film Jupiter Jones, originally set to release on July 25, 2014, has been delayed by over six months due to the production needing more time to finish its elaborate visual effects. Despite this, the studio has made little attempt to communicate the film's story, which is a fairy tale with a love story between Princess Jupiter Jones and Skyjacker Caine Wise. Jupiter is pursued across the galaxy by three greedy intergalactic royals, Balem, Kalique, and Titus. The trio is threatened by Caine's genetic identity, allowing her to claim control of interspace real estate.\n\nThe film's mythology suggests that Earthlings are entering the genetic age, while an elite clan of humans discovered a way to extend their lives almost indefinitely by extracting a glowing opalescent liquid from other humans. They plant it on conducive worlds and wait for millennia until overpopulation exceeds their planet's ability to sustain life. The Abrasax landlords harvest the entire species, but simple cloning doesn't work out well for them. The film also features several interesting genetic hybrids, such as Gugu Mbatha-Raw with rodent-like ears and Chating Tatum's character as a Lycantant, a crossbreed of a wolf and a man. Jupiter loves dogs, and Caine once had wings but has been clipped as punishment for some previous infractions. The film's marketing pitch is straightforward, but the studio has failed to effectively communicate the film's story and its unique plot."

And their Jupiter Ascending isn't just a failure, it's a grand symphony of failure. A spectacular, often dazzling failure. It totally misses its mark, but it aims so high that you're almost tempted to give it a pass for its sheer audacity. Almost.\n\nThere is so much here that deserves a \"Wow!\", but instead it tends to evoke a \"Huh?\". I was so impressed by its ambition that I found myself wanting to like it, but in the end I didn't. It just never comes together. Never clicks. It doesn't move you so much as assault you and leave you bleeding on the sidewalk.\n\nSo many of these kinds of overblown tent pole flicks ('Prince of Persia', '47 Ronin' or anything by Michael Bay) feel like the product of the Hollywood assembly line they are, but at least where the Wachowskis are concerned, such films manage to feel personal, and that at least is something."

The kids of the queen want her out of the way but bounty hunter Caine West (Channing Tatum) protects her with help from Stringer Apini (Sean Bean).\n\nThe plot doesn't make a lot of sense. The plot gets needlessly involved into characters and situations that add nothing to the story. There's also plot holes galore and the dialogue is unbelievably bad. Acting doesn't help. Kunis and Tatum (playing a half man half wolf) can be good but not here. Even worse is Eddie Redmayne playing the bad guy. Seriously--WHAT was he thinking? He whispers all his lines while occasionally screaming a line now and then. It's isn't scary or amusing...just annoying. Only Bean gives a good performance. Still, aside from all this I sort of enjoyed it. The visuals are incredible--there's always something to look at. The special effects are flawless and there's plenty of fast, furious action with PG-13 violence. So visually it's worth seeing but the lousy plot, dialogue and acting detract."

Why not compare Jupiter more to The Matrix or Jodorowsky's never made Dune, or something that's not just an uninspired comparison which was gonna be a Herculean task to actually achieve successfully in the first place?\n\nThe film as is, all its history aside, is dumb time-burning fun that has surely become an impressionable ten-year-old's favourite film of all time (who can tell when or whom these films strike a chord with?); and oh boy the screenplay is an inspired hot mess of flashy action and sci-fi reincarnation tropes mixed in with traces of ancient astronauts and pretty faces conveniently protected by fresh servings of deus ex machina and sci-fi pew-pew-pew all throughout its runtime.\n\nJupiter Ascending is a flashy guilty pleasure of a space opera; it prioritises vibe over story, and action over character development, and the cliches almost make the film out to be an ironic comedy for the ages rather than the deep drama it thought it was gonna be.\n\nThere is still an ever-evolving playbook for space-operas at the movies: and Jupiter Ascending is just one costly drop in that ever-growing stream of high-concept sci-fi flicks waiting to be consumed by hungry viewers.\n\nThis so-bad-it's-good blockbuster gets 5/10 IMDbs. 2.5/5 stars.

From such a plot description alone, 'Jupiter Ascending' might sound a tad absurd and the aliens on hand do not help matters; while the prosthetic special effects are remarkable, the creatures look ridiculous and more suited to a comic book with exaggerated, animalistic facial features. The plot is surprisingly lucid though, playing out as a mishmash of 'Harry Potter' and 'The Matrix' as our heroine finds out that she IS special and that it is up to her to save the world as we know it. The film also features some really good ideas -- namely that the dinosaur extinction was brought about by an alien race wishing to populate Earth with humans, and that crop circles and UFO sightings exist for a good reason -- and there is no flawing the visual effects or creative costumes. It is hard not to wonder though whether the film would have worked better at twice the length. The original script was, apparently, 600 pages long and a lot of exposition feels missing as the film plays out as battle after battle ad infinitum with only the occasional dialogue exchange. The film does a surprisingly decent job in the comic relief department though with the protagonist's bickering family and intergalactic crazy bureaucracy reminiscent of 'Brazil'; Terry Gilliam even makes a fun cameo in this section, barely recognisable under heavy facial hair."

Well to be honest they are now probably right. Movie goers flock in their hoardes to see the latest Iron Man or Avengers incarnation and will without doubt see the latest 3D Disney flick. However the second you put something they don't recognise on the billing they seem to be confused and scared by it. It is OK to try new things! If we never give movies like Jupiter Ascending a go are we to be watching Iron Man 25 in 10 years time? Will there still even be any other film franchises apart from the recognisable superheroes? Why must we insist on watching films we practically know the ending to?\n\nJupiter Ascending is a great Sci-Fi action flick. The story is good and the acting is fantastic from the films several big stars. It is not without its flaws though. It tends to borrow from other movies; Harry Potter, the hunger games and even Star Wars to name a few. The pacing is also a little off as there are more than a few scenes that I thought could have been cut altogether. Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed this film in the same way I would any other action movie. It definitely deserved to do better than it did at the box office. I just think people weren't willing to give it a chance. This may be sad for the U.S. Film industry as studios will no longer be willing to take the chance on something new and original and keep churning out products from the Marvel machine. All great characters had to start somewhere even Indiana Jones!"

Interesting and unusual sets, beautiful costumes, characters that are unique and fun. The CGI is good and believable. Yes, there are a few bad one liners, and Eddie Redmayne tries his best to be like Gary Oldman in The Fifth Element but falls very flat and comes off just ridiculous. But I can see what he was going for. And it's more fun to watch than the typical bad guy phoning it in saying the same bad lines with a grumpy look on his face.\n\nChanning did a great job (only complaint was that his beard and hair color were too light. Would have looked better with dark, almost black with grey streaks). Sean Bean was solid as always. Mila did exactly what she was meant to do which was be cute and stunning. The costumes on her were perfect, top notch! The captain of the Aegis was really good, as well as the robot helper when Mila was getting her license I think.

Did these reviewers see the same movie I had? What happened? Do they hate fun? Is Chris Pratt the only one allowed to have fun in Hollywood anymore? Is it the fact that Jupiter Ascending has a female protagonist and caters to a female gaze? Maybe it's not specifically aimed at the dudebros to whom the Hollywood business machine seems to be pandering mostly these days, but they can still enjoy it nevertheless? Did the Hollywood suits see the Wachowski's jab at the corporate oligarchy and feel personally threatened? Are they still bumhurt that the Matrix sequels didn't quite live up to the original? Did seeing shirtless Channing Tatum/shirtless Eddie Redmayne make them feel all funny inside? We may never know the answers to any of these questions, but one thing is clear; Jupiter Ascending is the fun space opera movie that you need in your life right now. Ignore the haters and see it!"

Even Uwe Boll's worst movie is better than this.\n\nI am still at a loss as to why this movie can be this awful, as Wachowski brother's \"Cloud Atlas\" is one of the best movie of the decade and many of the cast in Cloud Atlas joined cast in this movie. But somehow all we get is this stinking pile of garbage that will leave a bad after taste well after the movie is finished.\n\nDon't watch this trash. Trust me go watch paint dry is more fun and meaningful and fulfilling than this turd."

        "review_detailed_main": "After four minutes of nice impacting opening scene, this space opera enters an action frenzy. It seems a new The Matrix, with some Star Wars flavor. Just like my first impression in 1999 on the Wachowskis' cyberpunk milestone, Jupiter Ascending has quite impressive visual effects and a dystopian background supposedly deep in philosophical terms, however I just felt that it puts style over substance, and that all that complicated sci-fi theory of conspiracy was just an excuse for frantic action eye candy, at least in its first half. Indeed, it does seem more complicated than it actually is due the script strategy of making spectator confused with lots of strange elements and eventually explain part of them didactly and gradually (only part of them, as the feeling that it was sophisticated remains). Dialogues are mostly uninspired and there is the impression that you have already watched this before. Anyway, greed, which made human bein gs to place accumulation of resources over peace and respect for others' integrity from ancient ages to capitalism, is well explored in the script. That is how both capitalism and monarchy work, indeed. As a matter of fact, the movie improves as the Abrasax family appears for more time on screen. In the middle of the film, there is also a moment that emulates a little of Terry Gilliam's Brazil; while not as special or immersive as the dystopian marterpiece from the 80's, it was amusing anyway. Additionally, the wedding reminded me The Hunger Games. There are some nice sci-fi ideas too. To resume, the movie would have had a better outcome if its first half had a shorter cut."

But in 2015, they hardly don't know what they were doing.\n\nJupiter Ascending tells a story so predictable, i wouldn't even care following the plot. You know what, there are only three things I liked about this film. The visual effects, the scenery and the costume designs, while the rest of the film sucks. The script was poorly written and was trying to be smart and thought-provoking even if it's not. The fight scenes and the climax of the film were very lousy and uninteresting. Mila Kunis fails to deliver the goods as the film's lead. And the writers even put a predictable love story between Kunis and Tatum which, I think, has nothing to do with the plot. They just put it there so that some audiences will like/love this movie. On the other hand, Eddie Redmayne plays as a villain and obviously didn't know how to act one. Argh! I can't believe I just spent my money on this one.\n\nTo end this short review, Jupiter Ascending is terrible from start to finish. It's like watching a piece of garbage for 127 min. Seriously, avoid this movie at all cost."

So confusing! Why Jupiter called her majesty and if she is so special then she must have a unique power, but she is a normal woman from earth. Two villains from different universe captured her to kill, but every time Caine (Channing Tatum) come and help her, just the story! Not many subplots! Title obtaining and getting award after killing people are new imagination to future. Photography work is good, galaxies, planets, space journey and high tech technologies are attraction of the movie which are covering the weakness of an illogical story. In acting side Mill Kunis did her job well as a confused woman from earth. Sometimes she looks like after married Aishwarya Roy from bollywood. Tatum also perfect in his roughly roll. His flying shoes are a highlighted attraction. Rest are Okays. Background score is also well. Not much recommended. Only if you want to see a sci-fi without any burden on mind then watch this."

The trailer is really great and I love watching Mila Kunis, so I got hooked into watching this film again! I won't be pulled in a third time. I thought the initial premise was interesting, and I was definitely interested in following Mila on her journey. But things quickly turned into the ridiculous territory as one fight scene blended into another ridiculous fight scene. This movie reminded me of the endless fight scenes in the Transformer movies where Transformers just kept crashing into each other. The over the top music was just loud and extremely annoying. Whenever Mila had a quiet scene, I was drawn in again. She had a couple of funny lines here and there that helped keep me awake a little longer. Don't get drawn in by the trailer. I recommend people skip this one. (I just watched the trailer again. It had Sean Bean in it from Game of Thrones that drew me in even more. It's a great trailer! I couldn't help myself, but be warned...don't take the bait)"

From Channing Tatum's roller blades to one of the worst accents and voice mannerisms in recent memory - cheesy Star Wars-like aerial fight scenes that are so confusing only the geekiest of the geek would be able to make heads or tails out of who's who.

There are parallels drawn between the 1-billion old human civilization and our current one.\n\nThe characters falling in love are done in a symbolic way, but hey, this goes with the genre -- same as the princess Leia and Han Solo.

Yet, some intergalactic, powerful dynasty led by Eddie Redmayne who are all dressed in a mash up of Dynasty, Game of Thrones and Buck Rogers take an interest in this girl. Some want her alive, some want her killed. Caine (Channing Tatum) is some sort of wolf creature and is one of the ones sent to save her. Well, if that doesn't grab you - then don't give this movie a try because it just spirals out of control in to complete craziness with a convoluted story, too much incomprehensible action and dialogue that is so stilted. Holding it all together is Mila and Channing who strike some awkward chemistry that keeps you rooting for then both in this movie. Many may rate Jupiter Ascending a 5 or lower, but something that I can watch again and again is worthy of at least a 7."

        "review_title": "Pretty underrated, yet still unoriginal!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Science fiction is a very popular genre, especially in the 2010s decade. There were so many of them, that you could actually lose count just naming them. And this one in particular was created by the Wachowskis. Yes! The same people who created the late 90s hit called \"The Matrix\". However, \"Jupiter Ascending\" couldn't reach the stars and turned out to be a flop, both critically and financially. But does it deserve to be hated towards the movie community? Actually no!\n\nThe plot itself isn't the most original one, it's your typical \"you're the chosen one\" that was already done in other movies like the already mentioned Matrix. It tries to add some unique elements to stand out from similar films by adding interesting elements. Like the idea that the alien civilization uses the human energy to make themselves immortal. Honestly, it shows that despite our species being on a high level, we still haven't reached the absolute top and there is lot's of room to improve ourselves. Moving back to the story, it tells about a young woman named Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) who had a tough life. She always had to clean toilets to help her family. Until one day, during a not so good operation, Jones was rescued by a space hunter Caine Wise (Channing Tatum). Later, our heroine discovers that she's the queen of the Abrassax family (an alien supreme one), and that they want to kill her for their own needs.\n\nThe characters aren't too bad either. Starting with Jupiter Jones, she's the main character who quickly goes from rags to riches after a sudden discovery. Some may argue that she's not really a good protagonist, because she barely does anything and it feels like she's the typical damsel in distress. And sadly the acting from Mila Kunis isn't really great, she mostly emotionless during the movie. But if I have to say something good about her, is that, she's not egotistical. Without any spoilers, she still cares about her family and Caine Wise when they are in danger, and Jones tries her best to stand up in peril situations. Caine is Jupiter's love interest, and is also a hunter who previously argued with one of the members of the Abrassax's family, thus letting him to lose something valuable. You can actually feel sympathy for him, because he feels attached to Jupiter and doesn't want lose her, and also the fact that he had a bad past. Moving to the main antagonist of the film Balem (Eddie Redmayne), he's the owner of Earth that notices a lot of similarities between the female protagonist and his mother, and decides to marry and later murder her. Redmayne's acting is pretty funny at this point, when at first he talks quietly and then suddenly yells at his servants. Other characters like the Stinger (Sean Bean), Titus Abrassax (Douglas Booth) and others who try to explain the world of the movie more, and they are ok, but sadly there is nothing memorable about the latter. But the former one seems to have potential, because he has a deep connection to the bees and used to be one of Caine's friends, with whom he argues a lot.\n\nIf you look at the visual aspect of the movie, then it's definitely eye candy. The outer planets' worlds look interesting and you wish you could explore them. They are the combination of the medieval and futuristic space styles and it's notable in the ending. The alien creatures look unique too, some of them look like humans, but have special abilities and some look more like anthropomorphic animals, mostly reptiles. Even if the plot isn't really the best, you can't deny the fact that it's looks are great.\n\nIt's not as awful as critics are saying and I think you should watch it if you enjoy sci fi movies, especially the ones made by Wachowskis. But for casual movie goers it's not a bad choice either. It's mostly recommend to not take this movie too seriously and to turn off your brain for best experience. For those who think that it's not really special, it's better off to find another movie for the evening. I actually thought that it had lot's of great ideas and it was visually well done, but the story could've been less cliche and I wish Jupiter was more independent and strong. But otherwise, a good movie just to distract yourself from the routine and enter a brand new world!"

You get a feeling for the constructiveness of every bit of tension, and not in the good way. You are literally ripped out of the fiction. But the movie is not that bad. It is worse. The viewer gets bored by the visible intention to create a universe for a franchise by over-explaining the most uninteresting crap, tried to get relieved from this tension desert by foreseeable love and action jerk.\n\n176 Million Dollars to make THIS is embarrassing."

The CGI is flawless; the management of it is not.\n\nThe basic story is interesting but so full of plot holes and hard-to-swallow elements that it fails to achieve its potential. Really, with the basic story plot this could have been a classic if directed properly. It fails on that scope. But it does hold attention all the way through and has a few good dramatic elements. The last-minute saves are pretty much through the roof and highly predictable.\n\nIt does suffer greatly from \"professional assassins and soldiers can't hit the side of a barn\" syndrome. After this movie maybe they can get jobs as Storm Troopers.\n\nBut if one is looking for an action movie and isn't expecting cerebral fiction, it serves as a popcorn flick. Those who rated it 1 or 2 stars are too full of themselves, as usual. Those who rate it 10 stars... well, some people just love adrenaline. It's basically just a hard action sci fi flick heavy on the special effects."

I feel so embarrassed for the actors in this film who over acted to the point that I wasn't sure whether they were actually joking or not?!? The unintentional Kung-Pow of the Sci-Fi Genre, so awful that it makes you burst out laughing. What was Eddie Redmayne doing?!? He seemed to be trying to pull off a pompous Bane accent and just came out looking like a joke, I couldn't take him seriously at any point of the film whatsoever... The fact there are people on here rating this steaming turd pile higher than a 2 or a 4 makes me start questioning the validity of these \"critics.\" By his own admission, Channing Tatum isn't a good actor, so at the very least he could have gone to the gym to pull off his genetically-enhanced-bred-for-war wolf/human/angel-winged hybrid; but instead he looked like he spent his training hours on the couch eating Doritos with Jonah Hill. This Cinderella Story of the Galaxy is the skid mark on the panties of The Wachowskis career thus far."

        "review_detailed_main": "After charming the knickers off me with Cloud Atlas the Wachowski Brothers/Sisters/Cousins/Uncles/Aunts fall hard on their faces with this turgid, confusing mess. This is the movie equivalent of those manic, chaotic attempts at art drawn in crayon or charcoal on large sheets of paper found on the floor in abandoned insane asylums. This is not a compliment. I cannot possibly imagine what was going on in the heads of the writer/director team when they spewed out the words that formed the screenplay or how they could have approved the final cut as anything remotely resembling coherent. If you were to throw the movie into a shredder and have it come out the other end in a completely different order it would make just as much \"sense\" as the released version.\n\nBaby Jupiter is born in a container filled with illegals on a ship bound for the US. She is a girl without a country. She grows up to be Mila Kunis (30 at the time of filming, but looking about 40, somehow) and earns a living scrubbing the insides of toilet bowls. After a mix-up at a fertility clinic she's kidnapped by aliens who want her eggs and...sheesh, I really can't even recite the \"plot\" beyond this point as it made absolutely zero sense. Channing Tatum (back when Hollywood kept trying to make him a thing) shows up as a dog/man with no personality (John Candy he ain't!), some things happen, color and movement fill the screen, words are said, none of it adds up.\n\nEddie Redmayne (who looks like a human skeleton with wafer thin ham super-glued onto it) is the villain of the piece (of crap) and delivers the most mis-played performance in movie history. Tatum completely Seagals his performance and is so comatose he might as well have done is acting asleep while an off-camera team of puppeteers control him with rods and strings. His character is called Cain Wise, btw. Yeah, Cain Wise. Those words don't even go together! Tuppence Middleton appears and disappears. Something to do with bees and Sean Bean. Seriously...I don't have a clue what this movie is supposed to be and I'm a man of noble intelligence.\n\nThe Wachowskis seem to be under the impression that their action style from The Matrix is still passable or groundbreaking all these years later. It's not, and there's nothing exciting about the chaotic, physically impossible, and weightless action scenes that burn out our patience and kill any chance at further suspense. Though they are not the only ones guilty of this, as this style has continued into many of today's blockbusters and virtually every DCEU and MCU movie. I think that the time to return to real, in-camera action, practical, believable cinematography, and angles chosen for grounded, observable viewpoints is well overdue. From about the 30-minute mark, I could not tell what on Earth (or Jupiter) was going on or what I was looking at. I'm not joking or exaggerating. All I could make out was that Man-Dog repeatedly crashes his ships into things he doesn't like and is seemingly impervious to the vacuum of space.\n\nOh, and having the character called Jupiter and having her actually go to Jupiter is one helluva heavy-handed non-metaphor."

        "review_detailed_main": "'JUPITER ASCENDING': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nThe new big budget sci-fi epic from the Wachowski siblings. It stars Mila Kunis as a poor caretaker and Channing Tatum as a genetically engineered ex-military warrior, who team up to stop alien royalty from taking over the planet. Andy and Lana Wachowski wrote, co-produced and directed the movie; which also stars Eddie Redmayne, Sean Bean, Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton. If you grew up on 80s space opera, like I did, you're almost sure to love this movie (despite what the critics say).\n\nThe plot revolves around a rich alien family, called the 'House of Abrasax', who harvest people from other planets to create a youth serum; which allows them to live forever. When their mother dies, the Abrasax siblings fight over her inheritance; with Earth being the most prized possession. A poor housekeeper on Earth, named Jupiter Jones (Kunis), is destined to replace the Abrasax siblings, as Queen of Earth, due to her genetic structure. So she's targeted to be killed, by the powerful alien family, and it's up to a genetically engineered hunter, named Caine Wise (Tatum), to save her (and the planet).\n\nThe film is full of spectacular visuals, cleverly crafted space battles and intense chase sequences. I was most impressed with the very detailed, and elaborate, sci-fi universe; that the Wachowskis created for this movie. For me it's very nostalgic and highly reminiscent of the classic sci-fi action movies I grew up on (like 'STAR WARS' and 'THE LAST STARFIGHTER'); it's not quite up to par with George Lucas's original beloved trilogy, but it's at least in the same league as it's prequels. I know the movie is a bomb, financially speaking, but I really think it could become a popular cult classic and possibly spawn sequels, in the distant future, if enough fans demand it. I'd hate to see the Wachowskis stop getting financing for movies like this, because I think they're some of the best in the business at it!\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5es95jIdgR4"

Channing Tatum is just Channing Tatum, dumb and all the charisma of a piece of wet lettuce. Eddie Redmayne has gone from the acting master class of Theory of Everything to a mildly camp and whispering 'villain'. The script is ludicrous, you cannot gloss over it. It was a film that could have delivered a lot if managed correctly but they have shown that the original Matrix film was an anomaly as it is the only film of any note that actually delivered on all levels. I have seen some shoddy films in my time, Battle Los Angeles and the acting chin that is Aaron Eckhart springs to mind, and it is a battle between these two which gets my worst ever movie I have ever seen award.

Mila Kunis is terrible choice for the part, she's just not there during the whole movie. Eddie Redmayne is kinda terrible here as well, he's a very good actor, doing far from what he is capable of. Channing Tatum is like always, only this time he's some kind of dog / human hybrid - terrible part. The romantic part of the movie where they exchange lines like \"I'm more closer to a dog\" and \"I love dogs!\" are hilariously bad.\n\nOverall, \"Jupiter Ascending\" is a movie worth seeing if only there isn't absolutely anything to watch or do and not in a movie theater - save your money. Special effects are not special here at all, they are uninspiring. The movie drags, at running time 1h 58 min you will be watching at your clock more then one, simple because the story is all over the map and uninvolving."

The costume designer really messed up here, and a lot of the visual aesthetic that does work seems to have been lifted from the Riddick movies (which I'm sure lifted them from somewhere else, like Dune).\n\nNo pacing, a half-hearted script full of clunky exposition and childlike expressions of feeling and a crazy mix of tone, leaves you unsure if you're watching a flailing attempt at sci-fi epic or a cheap romantic comedy.

Make of that what you will. to me any movie that is original and not like any of the other weekend releases gives it a big jump ahead of its rivals. that is how I look at a movie if its a warmed over rehash of a story told often enough with the clich\u00e9s intact from the 30's and 40's why bother to see it ? unless its done well.\n\nJupiter Ascending is highly original and has that imagination I'm always looking for.\n\nJupiter Jones is a poor woman. born into a poor Russian family in the city of Chicago. Jupiter makes her living by doing housekeeping for rich people. cleaning the bathrooms and vacuuming the carpets at least gives her enough money for basic needs . When Her cousin has a idea for her to sell her Eggs to a fertility clinic. Jupiter agrees because she needs the money. But once at the clinic something happens that's life changing. a gang of aliens burst in as she is being tested. in a attempt to kill her and she is saved by a another Alien this time he's a former Legionaire doing bounty hunting jobs . His job is to find her and protect her . Why ? Because she is the last in line of the Royal Bloodline that makes her literally the Queen of the universe. And because of this she has enemies who want her dead at all costs.\n\nThe special Effects take center stage here. as does the story. The actors do a good job keeping up and delivering a solid performance.\n\nWhen people complain about the lack of originality in Hollywood and complain about too many remakes and reboots. They should look here. Because this movie has everything a true movie fan could ever want. and any fan of Sci-FI will love."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was excited about seeing this film although I do recall last year that the chatter about it was less than favorable. My thinking was, how bad could it be coming from the Wachowski's who had given us the The Matrix trilogy? Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) works in a domestic capacity and basically hates her life. I thought the opening backstory of her birth and life was a bit lengthy, however it did paint a drab picture so that you could understand her distaste for her circumstances. When things did get moving it seemed like chase scene after chase scene, out of which two important factors became known. I had always wondered why no one ever remembers when aliens destroy major cities and how they are rebuilt so quickly and finally the mystery of crop circles has been solved. I feel like it is getting redundant to complement first rate special effects, because that is becoming the new normal. If a film has poor special effects, then that is when I will have to go in. But here it is, the special effects were Tony the Tiger great. The acting was top shelf as well, I wasn't really familiar with Eddie Redmayne (Balem Abraxas) until recently during Award season with his best actor nod for The Theory of Everything, but this dude is off the chain. I will say this, if you don't like your life you should consider that you might end up taken to another world drawn into a power struggle for the planet earth, manipulated, lied to and on a galactic hit list. I actually liked the film, although there were times that it failed like how the civil bureaucracy run around almost put me to sleep. This was seriously a when worlds collide story, but for me it worked."

        "review_title": "Jupiter Ascending is a spectacular mess.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Never does a movie clearly try so hard and fail so miserably than the new space opera Jupiter Ascending. Those following its production were alarmed by a delayed opening from last July, summer's hottest weekend, to the historical box office trash heap that is an early February release. We critics endeavored to keep an open and optimistic mind, amidst wild gossip of test audiences exiting screenings rolling their eyes and thumbing their noses at the latest by writer/director sibs The Wachowskis. I remember early on hearing giggles during the movie's first trailer. Ladies and gentlemen, this flick cost more than 175 million to make. At least with the stunning production design and effects we can see where the money went. It is the script and lack of character development that sink this story like a stone, dropping it below even camp classic potential.\n\nFamilies of royal aliens own not only Earth but many other planets that have been seeded for harvesting their populations to create a youth serum. This substance allows the most powerful wealthy aliens to live forever. Three such royals, children in the House of Abrasax, Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth) are fighting over Earth's inheritance. When they discover human nobody Jupiter Jones (Mina Kunis) might be the reincarnation of their matriarch mom, she gets tossed into the middle of their squabble, a toy they manipulate for their gain, with only a genetically engineered ex-military hunter with albino/human/wolf DNA named Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) between her and certain death. Cut to lots of scenes with Jones falling through the sky only to be swooped up by Wise, whom she rides piggy back, as well as scenes where she forms attachment to him due perhaps not only to his willingness to risk his life for her, but his strong sense of smell, low growl, bulging pecs, stoicism, and sardonic smirks. He makes great use of a sort of impenetrable African shield and a pair of rocket-powered gravity defying boots. He can 'rollerblade through the air like he just don't care'.\n\nChanning Tatum, unbelievably, comes through this film not only unscathed, but builds a rather endearing character for us to get behind, and his ability to go all-in, to commit completely to his dog ears, supersonic rocket-boots, and perma-eyeliner, has the audience shrugging, saying, \"oh, what the hell...\", and going along with the fun. Unfortunately, momentum, and there are moments that build it in the film's favor, is dashed every time the absurd romance between he and 'his majesty\" Jones is brought into the story.\n\nMila Kunis as Jupiter Jones, repeatedly tells those she meets to call her \"Jupe\", which ironically means \"skirt\" in French. That is effectively what she is reduced to, a skirt. She is a woman without strong direction, constantly in need of rescue, and without any real defining or positive personality traits with which to connect with audiences. The fact that she cannot take control of her own situations, whether by the way the story is written, or by her character's lack of self awareness, becomes increasingly annoying. Even if she does find inner strength by the end of the film, by that time the audience won't care. We are also never made to believe why her family, for which we are supposed to believe she will give up not only her life but the eventual lives of all the people of Earth, mean so much to her. They are never shown as anything more than unpleasant, and there are no intimate moments that explain her love or passion to save them.\n\nBeyond the holes in the script that don't make Jones particularly sympathetic, there seems to be something missing in the lead. Kunis is lovely, and visually cleans up well into an ingenue space queen, but she lacks the star power to make up for her blank-slate resting face. Famed classic actress Greta Garbo could get away with an inscrutable expression. Kunis doesn't have the magnetism.\n\nThe three royals are entertaining diversions, although unquestionably Eddie Redmayne wins the Tim Curry Scenery Chewing Award of 2015, even though it's only February. No one this year will go farther over the top than this man playing the petulant oldest son given to quiet tantrums. He orders his lackeys gruesomely dispatched while barely moving his lips to speak. He is so camp he almost saves the whole movie. Almost.\n\n(If I don't win an Oscar for The Theory of Everything, I'll just get a job at Hot Topic with my goth look and my pompadour...)\n\nAs to visuals, building a world should always be in service to the story. It is a mighty struggle, gorgeous and breathtaking as the environments, visual effects, and production design are in Jupiter Ascending, they are not utilized to full effect in terms of connectedness to story. As those elements are far superior to any others in the film, it would have helped to find better ways of integrating them more into the proceedings. One standout is the way the diverse environments in which Balem, Kalique, and Titus live are so well matched to their personalities. The landing dock for Balem's ship is outfitted with enormous chandeliers and golden statues that bring Versailles to mind, whereas Titus's bedchamber looks like a mix of Rock Hudson's apartment after Doris Day got a hold of it in Pillow Talk, and the Playboy Mansion. Another exception to this is shown in some of the best minutes of the film, though they seem markedly out of place. I speak of the scenes of planetary bureaucracy, which seem a mash up of The 5th Element and Brazil, complete with a superstar director's surprise cameo. It is in these moments and in taking in these beautiful production designs that we are most disappointed with the rest of the movie. It could have been so much more, and could have been a great addition to the Wachowskis oeuvre. Sadly, the romance between Jupiter and Wise, her faithful pup, ehm...protector, is both ridiculous and too central to the story to be fixable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Ascending has the following positives:\n\n1) Pretty good story.\n\n2) Some impressive visuals (sometimes). There is an amazing battle (not because of the battle) that goes all around Chicago. I have no idea how they filmed it. I was in awe of the camera-work.\n\n3) Some good dialogue.\n\n4) Some good characters.\n\nHere are the cons:\n\n1) Action Sequences: You know how in the Star Wars prequels, the least interesting parts of the film were the space battles because they were all CGI. Here, the same rule applies. Every action scene has WAY too much CGI (and sometimes pathetic CGI) to the point that they are not interesting at all. Secondly, there are way too many action scenes. Had there been 1-3 action scenes, it would have made the film a little more enjoyable. Yet, there are maybe 10 actions scenes in this movie. Just like in a martial arts film like Ong Bak, the action scenes are of diminishing returns as the film goes on.\n\n2) Some Weird Aliens: Like the Star Wars prequels, this film also has ridiculous (and bad looking) CGI alien creatures that to me just made me want to skip each scene that had them. Also, they were generic characters too. It is understandable that when doing a sci-fi film, there will be some world-building elements of some other films. Yet, copying off of the Star Wars prequels is not a very good choice here. You literally have a Naboo rip-off and a Mustafar rip- off too as planets.\n\nSummary:\n\nHad the film featured less action scenes, I would have enjoyed the film much more. The most enjoyable parts to the film were where characters just spoke dialogue. I had no interest in anything else.\n\nThis is definitely a skip. Unlike The Wachowski's previous 4 films, I do not think there is much of a chance that you will like this film. Speed Racer was panned and Cloud Atlas got extremely bipolar reviews. Yet, both have fans who love them (including myself).\n\nI do not think this will be a cult-film unless there is maybe a director's cut that adds more drama scenes to it and cuts out some of the action sequences."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know what the problem is with the Wachowskis. Perhaps they are the type of directors who only have one really good idea, and they've been coasting on the popularity acquired from The Matrix for years, as they stumble through trying to recapture the magic. Then again, they could be the type of directors who simply can't create a good product after they had great success, because now no one is willing to tell them \"No.\" There's even a chance that their one big success was a fluke, and they really should be cinematographers or visual effects artists, and leave the writing/directing to someone else. Whatever the problem may be, Jupiter Ascending is another convoluted pile of ideas that don't congeal into a quality film. I wanted to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, and it does look good. There is a sumptuous quality to the visuals in this film, and even though the staging and script feel like a Star Wars prequel, the scenes still have a look like they were shot on real sets with a more sensible amount of visual effects. Sadly, that's about all the movie has going for it.\n\nI think the most frustrating thing about Jupiter Ascending is the protagonist played by Mila Kunis. She does the best with what she's given, but this is a thankless role. She is presented as the heroine of the movie and yet she only does three things for the entire runtime: 1) She is the exposition receiver. There are countless scenes where she simply stands there while the entire universe is mansplained to her by every other character in the film. 2) She is a human MacGuffin and/or damsel in distress. She gets shuffled around against her will between every other character in the film, and it is tedious. Sometimes she's actively resisting it, other times she willingly goes with the flow because she's also somewhat spineless. And, of course she has to fall down a lot so Channing Tatum can continue to rescue her. 3) She is a fashion model. I don't know the last time I saw a movie where a character changed outfits as often as Kunis does in this one. It's so odd to the point that she seems to have a new outfit for every single set piece.\n\nThe plot of Jupiter Ascending is beyond ridiculous. I'd like to say it didn't make any sense, but they spent so much of the film trying to explain it that eventually you can put the pieces together. Of course the whole genetic reincarnation thing seemed moronic to me, but I could at least comprehend what they were trying to say. The romance with Channing Tatum was awkward, particularly given how his character is described. I mean, we're basically supposed to root for a relationship based on bestiality. Tatum does his usual tough-guy performance with weird makeup and hair applied. Personally, I think he is more entertaining when he's allowed to be a bit humorous, rather than trying to be a serious enforcer all the time. Eddie Redmayne's performance is almost indescribably bad. However, he is one of the elements that made Jupiter Ascending somewhat enjoyable for me. This might be one of the strongest examples in recent cinema history of a movie that is so-bad-it's-good. I did have some fun laughing at this movie and all its insanity. I think that's what I would recommend, is that people who enjoy the so-bad-it's-good genre gather with their friends and watch Jupiter Ascending for some good laughs, because it will provide plenty of those."

This is a universe where corporations rule over various planets and the inhabitants of most of the planets are harvested in order to create a fountain of youth serum provided essentially to the ruling 1%. Earth can be sparred this horrific end only if Jupiter Jones prevails as the \"owner\" of Earth. You may not be so emotionally drawn into it but you do have reason to see Jupiter prevail, that is if you want the earth to survive. Along the way Jupiter Ascending weaves into it the notion of the purpose of alien grays and abductions along with a darker view of what a final harvest of the Earth means relative to many religious doctrines. The Christian version speaks of a final harvest where the great mass of people are cast into destruction except for a very few. This is consistent with the movie version except that in the movie the veneer of our religious version is cast aside for the harsh reality of the supposed real universe. This should be interesting for most inquisitive spiritual minds and those curious about the state of reality. In this sense the movie is in fact deep and thought provoking but certain critics just have no imagination to go there. Unless they haven't noticed 90 percent of the world's population is religious. You have got to love the Wachowskis desire to explore the possibilities of what is reality. That for me makes the movie extremely interesting. This movie is not only an exercise of the visual but also of the mind. It has it's detraction but the positive outweighs the negative. For that reason I give it a 7. Even if you don't find the movie interesting or profound you should have a lot of fun just watching it. That is worth the price of admission. For those that have the money to spare I would suggest the IMAX version at least once and get blown away. Enjoy!"

Sci-Fi is a very complicated and tricky genre. There is lots of science for a start (really?!). Obviously nowadays these types of movies are made for the meat market film goer with a large coke and a bucket of popcorn to munch on.

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this film in the Milton Keynes Cineworld 4DX Super screen with a 3D viewing...Wow factor set to out of this world.\n\nThe story is wonderfully imagined, set on many worlds with awesome space scenes showing beautiful star ships and galactic scale.\n\nThe Plot and character development is very familiar and really is a missed opportunity to add some intelligence to what is in many ways a thought provoking rags to riches tale, putting into perspective the value of life. Hopefully we'll get a follow up delving into that universe and it's limitless possibilities.\n\nNeedless to say I was impressed with what in my view makes for great movies. This film has immense repeat value because its simple and looks good while being exciting.\n\nMy friends and I opted to see the film in the new Cineworld 4DX super screen with 3D and it really did feel like we had gone on an American theme park ride. The seats moved in a very articulated manner complementing the motion of the screen and had jolts and impacts felt through the chair like getting hit in the back or landing on the floor. The weapons fire that missed could be felt whizzing past my head and the explosions enhanced by the bright flashes from the 4DX auditorium. When the action hits the river, splashes are felt with drops of water, I expected it, still surprising and effective. The fragrance element worked a treat too. Linking what you see with what you can smell like the flowers when a character walks through them or the smell of action - burning metal. Smoke or mist mirrored with smoke machines by the screen and around the seats creates a very immersed experience, like being in the film to a degree.\n\nJupiter Ascending was the best introduction to the 4DX technology. Clearly demonstrated a level of experience that is sure to become a major success with the right films. I was looking forward to this film last year and, it was worth the wait. The 4DX Super screen with 3D was quite expensive but, immersing and effective so it felt satisfying with such a visually stunning film.\n\nThis film is a great date movie, fun for families, perfect for sci-fi junkies, thought provoking and good looking.\n\nI can only hope you have at much fun as we all did."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Ascending is one visually stunning movie and not at all disappointing, considering how many bad reviews it has received. Basically, the movie revolves around Jupiter Jones, a human girl, born on Earth which is a small part in a bigger plot of one of ruling families in the universe. Jupiter is, through her genetic legacy, an heir to the aforementioned family and has to protect herself, as well as her planet, from other members of this family. The movie sports a huge variety of space travel and planets, all of which were amazingly done. All worlds, as well as their residents were depicted perfectly. Even more so, that you would feel, as if you were right there. The music was also unique and pleasant and fits perfectly to each scene. Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum have both portrayed their roles of Jupiter Jones and Caine Wise respectively quite good, even though there is a lot more space to improve on. Unlike them, Eddie Redmayne portrayed his role of a royal antagonist and a snob perfectly. The other actors I won't comment on because their roles and acting didn't really show that much in the movie. And that brings me to negative aspects of this movie. The story, although impressive and intriguing, lacks its ending and character development. There is much more ground for this story to build on but the movie left it somehow unfinished and that may be one of the main reasons why the movie wasn't so well accepted by the audience so far. Considering the Wachowskis are notorious for having good but long stories, the ending doesn't surprise me. All in all, a neat jewel for your eyes, if that is what defines your good movie but if you don't have a good imagination or like a more insightful story, then this is definitely not a movie for you."

        "review_title": "The worst cinematographic delusion of my life",
        "review_detailed_main": "I've been waiting for this film for ages, wondering what wonderful new universes the Wachowskis had created this time. I've been imaging breath-taking stories, like the Cloud Atlas ones, epic characters, like V and astonishing universes, such as in Matrix.\n\nAll I got was great special effects. Really great ones, I have to admit that, like when a whole planet is going to catch fire and it seems you can reach the flames. This is the only reason I would save the setting. And also the action scenes are worth to be remembered, even if sometimes they are just taken for granted.\n\nDespite this, I think this is going to be the worst cinematographic delusion of my life for a very long time.\n\nLet's start from the plot: a good idea, there are no doubts about it. What if human life didn't start on Earth but on another planet and developed to the point that it has conquered the universe and uses other planets as living factories? And what if an inhabitant of the Earth, that has never hoped for anything better than selling her ovules to buy a telescope, finds out that she is going to inherit a couple of planets? But once you have a good idea, you have to vehicle it in the right way, and above all, make people feel emotionally involved in it. In this case nothing of this has happened. The great emotional potential of Jupiter's and Caine's stories is wasted because of lame dialogs and a bit too many action scenes. And it's better to forget some quotes that led me to consider this the worst-built love-story I have ever seen. Moreover, what should probably be the main theme, the importance of time and how humans should deal with it, is not showed in an original way. All the movie is focused on the action so there is no space to develop the message properly, as it has been done in many other Wachowskis' films.\n\nThe lack of depth of the characters is a direct consequence of how the story is told. You just don't grow fond of them because you are not involved in their personal stories when you find them out. They are played on interesting feelings but badly conveyed. Maybe characters just don't have enough space in the whole movie to develop their personalities, but I would rather say that the space they are given is badly used.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are hoping to see great special effects you will probably be completely satisfied with this film. If you are expecting anything else just forget it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Ascending probably has one of the funniest scene so far in 2015 and that is the scene where a captain of this ship who's in a war battle and the captain says \"Full speed a head\", and it pans down to this elephant man like creature and it makes the funniest noise ever and of cause I laughed my head off.\n\nThe story is about Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), who was born under a night sky, with signs predicting she was destined for great things. Now grown, Jupiter dreams of the stars but wakes up to the cold reality of a job cleaning other people's houses and an endless run of bad breaks. Only when Caine (Channing Tatum), a genetically engineered ex- military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along-her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.\n\nI can't remember the time where the Wachowski made a good movie after the Matrix. Since then they made bad movie after bad movie and I don't know what to blame the writing or the directing, I think both since the Wachowski written and directed they movies and Jupiter Ascending is another one of they failures. Now I'm not the one who likes to bash some one who I know has great talent but I think some great talent forgot what made them so special in the first place.\n\nFor the positive: The first action scene in this movie I got to admit it was on the same level of spectacular has the Matrix. The hairs on my arm stood up, it was truly breathtaking and unique. The score by Michael G Keno was just fantastic to listen to and Channing Tatum and Sean Bean was okay in the film. For I split second I thought this movie was going to be good, but then I sawed the rest of it and it left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nNow for the bad and there's a lot: Mila Kunis in this movie pretty played the dumb damsel in distress that needs a man to save her ever 20 minutes and her character feels really miss cast and if they just cut her out of the movie it wouldn't make a difference, I mean really Wachowski? you could have done better than that I mean come on. Oh I almost forgot the dialogue in this movie was so bad it was Twilight dialogue bad.\n\nThe Visual Effect's as well looked pretty fake at times even if it's in the background or the CG creatures, it still looked fake.\n\nNow we all know by now that Eddie Redmayne is a good actor. We know he can deliver dialogue and make it feel real and serious like a person, but in this I had no idea what on earth what he was doing. Over the top, chewing up scenery after scenery, laughable bad and a weird voice that's sounds like Richard Harris Dumbledore mix with Nicolas Cage if he was drunk and high. His performance was Razzie worthy bad and I don't blame him for this, I blame the writing and the directors because there they telling him what to do so I won't blame him for it, but come on Eddie I know your a nice guy in real life but did you even think \"Wow this is pretty laughably bad I should ask the directors to change it\".\n\nOverall Jupiter Ascending is just a Sci-Fi smash together mess. The action scenes may have been the only enjoyable part of the movie, but even that couldn't save this uninspiring, bloated mess of a film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I sat through most of this dog and finally walked out after the nonsense overwhelmed me. The beginning of the movie makes no sense and offers nothing to the story. That would eliminate about 15 minutes. Then Jupiter shows up in Chicago as a toilet bowl cleaner while living with her mother and other Russian exiles. I don't know about you but I'll bet there aren't too many toilet bowl cleaners in the US that look like Mila. From there the chaos starts. A war above the city begins about what we know not with massive damage to the surroundings. Talk about editing! The editor must have been on vacation because the actions drones on and on for no apparent reason. One minute O'Neal can hit anything he aims at and the next he can't his his ass with either hand. The shooting and crashing goes on and on to no resolution. Then the scenes from \"John Carter\" begin. Not once during the movie does Kunis evoke any sympathy or warmth and O'Neal is just as wooden as he always is. The British actors speak as if they will upset the person sitting next to them at a funeral and if the viewer is eating popcorn cannot hear them. Once the movie moves to the other world it becomes totally incomprehensible. Huge spaces devoted to nothing and strange creatures that have no identity or personality overload the screen. The plot cannot be spoiled because I do not believe there was one. I do not know the ending but can only imagine it was written for the 10 to 12 year old who attended. Wait for this turd to come out as a comic book and save a bundle!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I like science-fiction, and by doing that I implicitly accept a certain degree of nonsense in movies. It is seldom that an SF-movie is on the spot throughout, there is usually a level of nonsense that you just have to buy in order to watch it. And usually, I don't mind. But when the degree of nonsense is so large that it blocks out everything else, we have a bit of a problem.\n\nJupiter Ascending starts feeling like the trailer of a proper movie. Characters are introduced very briefly, talk, cut, talk, cut. Spaceships, a man with boots that can fly, people start shooting at each other. Meanwhile, it's very unclear what is actually going on. I can imagine that this movie made about as much sense at a five-minute pitch as it does watching the whole thing. \"There are aliens close by, and they like have these noble houses, and they fight for power, and this cleaning lady is like a princess and, and...\". I almost immediately felt that this was \"by 12-year old's, for 12-year old's\". I can imagine kids having a lot of fun with this, maybe they don't mind the plot being one giant hole.\n\nA lot of the time watching this gives you the tiresome feeling of watching a video-game where you are not at the controls. The likeness to a video-game stops there though, they are usually a lot more well-written and cohesive.\n\nBy now I guess you've understood that I didn't enjoy this. Not one bit. Honestly, the Wachowski-siblings need to take a step back and think about what they're doing. They're all over the place, mixing really good movies with trash like this one. Not even the action-scenes are acceptable, and that feels a bit like their backyard. Honestly, spend your time with something else."

I thought Mila Kunis was good in it but I've never seen her in an unwatchable movie. I thought the special effects were not as great as I had hoped them to be. I thought the high level of detail in the special effects to only work sometimes-other times it was just too much to absorb causing me to lose interest in whatever film sequences they appeared in. The destruction of downtown wherever was not mind- blowing-it was mediocre due to an overabundance of special effects.

        "review_detailed_main": "When you get down to the world of science fiction, there are two distinct types of films about space. One are films like Gravity, Interstellar and The Black Hole that give off the size and scope of the universe while making it clear that the Earth is such a precious land that we humans take for granted. We rarely see these kinds of movies because these are visually boring stories, even if the characters are interesting and the philosophical ideas are groundbreaking. These don't seem to click with a mainstream audience the same way it probably would with Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nThe safer route of space, and being the second kind of space movie we see, shows the universe as full of life with planets full of many types of species and advancing technologies. This we see often with Star Wars, Flash Gordon and the recent favorite of mine, Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nThe more \"cosmic and awesome\" route is something that I've always preferred as the field is science fiction (emphasis on fiction). Entire franchises have evolved out of these notions, yet few remain iconic. The Wachowski siblings, the same team behind another famous series The Matrix, try to have lighting strike twice with Jupiter Ascending.\n\nWe open sometime in the past where a Russian couple, are about to give birth to a girl named Jupiter, though the father is killed in a home invasion when robbers shot him. We cut to the modern day where Jupiter (played by Mila Kunis) and her mother have immigrated to America along with the rest of their Russian family as they make a living cleaning homes. She's about to sell her eggs to buy a really nice telescope, but horrors as she realizes that the doctors operating turn out to be aliens trying to kill her. An ex military hunter barges in, gunning down the creatures and telling Jupiter that they need to leave.\n\nHe introduces himself as Caine Wise (played by Channing Tatum) and starts referring Jupiter as \"his majesty\". After an escape from Chicago, they go to a farm where they meet up with Caine's old friend Stinger (played by Sean Bean). They reveal that the Earth shall belong to Jupiter as she is an heir to space royalty. She's taken into the cosmos and is revealed that the queens children, Balem (played by Eddie Redmayne), Kalique (played by Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (played by Douglas Booth all have different ideas on the humans of earth and who the planet should belong to.\n\nJupiter Ascending has a lot ready to go here. The set design, costumes, and the visual effects all look great here. It all looks large and grand, matching the size of the universe. This is stuff that I could see ranking in the same grounds as Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy. But in order for all of that to become memorable, you need a great story along with some likable characters. This has none of that.\n\nThe journey that Jupiter goes on is a cross between Cinderella and Wizard of Oz\u0085in space. This is fine, but the screenplay is really bad here. Rather then becoming a fun road trip story, we get a lot of uninteresting dialogue that mostly consists of \"the great things Jupiter will do for Earth\" and \"what humanity is\". Much of it sounds forced and something that looks better on paper then film format.\n\nThe acting here is very stiff and wooden. It's ironic that given Eddie Radmayne is nominated for an academy award as his performance is like a cross of a bitter old man and a Doctor Who villain. If none of these humans or aliens ever become excited for fearful of something, then why should I care? It's just kind of boring that begs for better direction.\n\nI'll give this four sets of anti-gravity boots out of ten. Jupiter Ascending is a grand idea that's simply too large for one movie. It probably would have better played as a Game of Thrones style show on HBO or Netflix. Even so, the Wachowskis have revealed how their better at directing action then juicy dialogue. Unless their interested in making another Matrix movie, Jupiter Ascending shall only descend the duo further into career doom."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Ascending was marketed as an interplanetary adventure, but turned out to actually be a bureaucratic conflict over land\u0085 The visuals are stunning and many of the action scenes are spectacular and very fun to watch. Occasionally the action scenes can be a little shaky, but nothing to really gripe over. This movie is very original, but most of the original concepts were just Easter eggs or exposition, so they had nothing to really do with the plot. This is really all that is good about the film. Every character is very bland and one- dimensional (with a possible exception for the relationship between Channing Tatum's and Sean Bean's characters). Mila Kunis's character is very boring and emotionless, with her most emotional scenes involves her saying \"Holy crap\u0085\" calmly. The Russian family was unbearably difficult to watch. Much of this film is awkward and too cheesy. The romantic dialogue is laughably terrible. Many of the character designs for the aliens are also way too silly. The humor does not fit very well. While the comedic scenes are funny, in the context of the movie they just do not fit. The movie took a five minute break to tell a joke about bureaucratic processes. This film had a lot of potential but was too crowded, poorly told and it just a mess."

Just because you put 2 good-looking people in the lead roles doesn't mean it'll work. And what was with the make-up they put on Channing Tatum? Mila Kunis is still dam sexy so that at least took it from a 1/10 to a 2/10 for me. This really is a big disappointment from the Wakowskis.\n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."

That side of things is easily a 10 out of 10 and the costume designs were phenomenal. It's probably one of the best visuals to come out since Avatar but still, it's nothing close to that feat. However, the acting was just okay, and the character development for Jupiter really REALLY sucked. I can't believe that didn't cast her better. That was one thing could have made the movie so much better. There was some great acting by Eddie Redmayne as Balem Abrasax. I think that his character was by far the best and most precise and had he not been in the movie, I'd have only rated it a 2 out of 10. By the end of the movie, I was satisfied, but something was missing. Had the writers added another fifteen minutes at the beginning of the movie where Jupiter and the audience were explained what was happening more than they did in the actual movie, I would have given this movie a better rating. I guess I should also say that Jupiter was WAY too accepting of everything that was going on. Her lines were corny and stupid and the movie would have been way more of a thrill with better writing on that character's behalf.\n\nWell I think that's about it."

After 10 minutes,I got the impression everybody in the theatre knew exactly where this was going .Shockingly bad all round and Sean Bean should delete this of his C.V!Should be shown to all up and coming movie wannabees as a lesson in how not to make movies.I gave it a 2 because a lot of people probably worked hard to bring this to screen but thinking on it they got paid a vast amount of money.

        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Ascending has a lot going for it. It's written by the Wachowskis (Matrix trilogy, V for Vendetta, Cloud Atlas), it features a viable cast of actors and it promotes a seemingly interesting universe and mythos of its own. Unfortunately, though these things excited me pre-release they also pave the way for this movie to become generic...blegh.\n\nThe visuals are great in this movie. Which is probably no surprise seeing as it's the Wachowskis, they are nothing if not pioneers of stunning visuals in movies. It's just a shame they can't make the characters as interesting. OK I'm being harsh because they weren't terrible. In particular Sean Bean and Channing Tatum are the best parts of this movie in terms of acting. Mila Kunis however is to me like Helena Bonham Carter. They both made their careers through being close to popular successful guys in show business and end up starring in a lot of they're movies. And Eddie Redmayne...I know he's nominated for an Oscar but the less said about him the better.\n\nThis is a classic case of style over substance. The story is a blended, convoluted tale of Princess Diaries meets Phantom Menace. Mila Kunis is some space princess and she has to stop Eddie Redmayne (muffled laughter) from stealing it or something like that. I began to switch off after about half of this movie.\n\nIt's frustrating because this movie could have been more if not for some questionable acting, awful dialogue and confusing story. It had the potential to be so much more than it is. I kind of hope for a sequel so that they can improve as they go but honestly I'm not sure if I could sit through that. In the end this movie is meh. It just exists though I wouldn't recommend it at all and therefore it gains a 4/10.\n\nThanks for reading this review.

I especially liked the love story angle. This movie may not have been like Mary Poppins \"Practically perfect in every way\", however it fits into a category that is most certainly enjoyable. Without a doubt a good movie to take with you RVing for when it's raining. Also a good movie to put on in the back of the vehicle for the kids on long journey's. The movie is a very long one too and on a big screen it can be a huge adrenaline rush just to watch it. If you're looking for some simple fun with tons of action this is the movie to watch.

So Jupiter Ascending, where to begin.... pure style over substance, poor characters, terrible story arc that makes little to no sense on occasion, poor acting (Redmayne is possibly the worst culprit and his voice is just ridiculous) which is disappointing given some of the talent on offer here. Even the makeup and effects look poor. For some reason Tatum looks like a cross between Legolas and Metallica singer James Hetfield?!? It only avoids a 1 star review through benefit of some vaguely attractive cinematography. I will rarely bale out of a film halfway through but came very very close. If you want earth people out and confused in space then just watch Guardians of The Galaxy and leave this where it belongs."

My worst part of the film are the characters. Mila Kunis's character is so weak and uncharismatic. She honestly delivers the worse lines in the film, especially the romantic dialogue, that made we want to cringe. However she isn't the worst character in the film, Eddie Redmayne has that covered. He speaks in this quiet, mousy voice and out of nowhere he will completely explode. It felt like the writers were trying to create a unforgettable villain instead they gave us an \"Angel Boy\" impersonator. Than there's the Russian family who's sole purpose is to fill the Russian stereotype. The main plot of this film is ridiculous and superficial. To some it up its an intergalactic sibling rivalry. I guess one interesting point to this film is the lore however this is pretty weak compared to others in the sci-fi genre. Overall my recommendation is to skip this film."

The movie didn't even come out before people were scoffing at it down their noses. I'm kind of a fan of original sci fi films, and the cast, so I was stoked to check it out. This movie was awesome. I can't even imagine the ridiculous amount of creative work that went into designing such a multi faceted world, complete with interesting technology, styles, creature designs, characters, the works. It was beautiful to look at, and anyone that's a part of the film world should know that not a single pixel, prop, or thread of clothing makes it to set without passing under the eyes of tons of creative minds, so believe me when I tell you more original creative thought went into this movie then you'll have the attention to notice. The conflict is topical, complicated but not hard to follow, has high stakes, and is grounded in the reality of a capitalistic gain. The characters are fun, some will feel very familiar to fans of sci fi/fantasy worlds, and some are very fresh. The performances are great and interesting to watch, the action is extremely well choreographed, the plot is easy to follow, and the film is long enough that we get a full sense of the immensity of the world they created. As it is, in an age where everything that kills the box office is either a remake or based on a book/comic/cartoon, I think it's really cool to see an original sci fi film stand on its own two legs and tell an epic story.

I feel like they could have done a lot more with the story, and downplayed the random romance just a bit, or explained the relationships between characters a bit better. I am particularly interested in learning more about the Abrasax family, and the way that the interstellar politics work.

Conversely, the writing isn't strong enough to cover up Mila's deficiencies as an actress. I think if the Wachowskis are given another chance with a big-budget sci- fi/action flick, they will have to have somebody else write it.\n\nWhen this comes out on Blu-Ray, I'll probably add it to the collection because it's good eye-candy to have in the background while doing something else. However, I'll be waiting until it goes on sale before spending $$ on it. If you're a sci-fi buff and not in your teens, then I'd compare Jupiter Ascending to the first Star Wars prequel, only a notch or two below. Great visuals and an interesting world but science that makes little sense coupled with a lukewarm story and characters that never feel real at all."

Music charm me. According to Wikipedia, it was conducted by Michael Giacchino, the same after the soundtrack to the film version of \"Speed Racer\" (or Speed Racer, also made by the Wachowski). He know is epic in its moments.\n\nBut all else fails. Special effects, though it has many memorable moments, especially in the scenes in outer space, are generally irregular. For example, when using computer-generated funds are noticed kilometers computer and are in tune with the actors, or a \"bureaucratic office\" is too earthling to outer space.\n\nBut what was the story less convinced. Part of the Matrix premise: that the world we humans know is \"false\" which are smaller than we think, we are being \"manipulated\" by superior forces. Matrix change robots alien humans, and use us as batteries by harvesting humans, and have an idea. It might have been good story, but it looks like (for me) too seen on Matrix, takes too long to explain the context, there is too much discussion and little action for a plot that does not deserve it, since neither far is as complex as they try to put it, or could be as epic as Matrix or science fiction sagas such as Star Wars.\n\nIt is a film that I recommend if you go on television, used to hang out, but if you know the story of Matrix well, makes you think \"for something inspired by Matrix to regulate, for that see Matrix or hope its sequel\". I give it a 6/10."

Speaking of channing he did a amazing role and with mila kunis his role added a spark to the film the plot could have been much better the climax was not at all interesting but the vfx part was awesome.i didn't watch it in 3d which would have been awesome .

All we know to this point is that she hates her life, having to wake up at 4:45am and clean toilets. We don't know that she has hopes and dreams that are, quite literally, out of this world.\n\nJupiter is also not in the least bit surprised when strange things start happening. It's as if she has always known about people on other planets and incredible (to Earthlings) technology. She really just doesn't have any reaction to finding out about all this stuff going on. I guess seeing alien abductions, gravity boots, and spaceships is just normal for a cleaning lady.\n\nThere were some good parts as well, but you had to sit through a lot of things that didn't make much sense to get to them. The overall plot point of what the Earth really is was a nice touch, but not enough to overcome the gaping holes in the story to that point."

As far as a comprehensible plot, there have been worse sci fi movies. Nowadays understanding about 30 percent is considered good. So more or less I got what was going on but got lost now and then about who was fighting who about what. Something about harvesting the Earth by some battling outer space siblings. The story on Earth started off quite interesting with the Russian family but then things got too complicated with the aliens.\n\nMila managed to pull off the titular role with some cute charm as the cleaning maid turned space royalty. Channing Tatum as a wolf thing looked a bit overweight - needs to cut out the carbs. Eddie Redmayne was grotesque with his laryngitis voice and occasional outbursts. Even science fiction pretty Douglas Booth was better in his role. Couldn't get everything Sean Bean said.\n\nOverall it is watchable for the lead actors despite the partly incomprehensible plot."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was trying to think of a kind introduction to start, but there is just no two ways around it, this movie is terrible and is worsen by the fact that it is made by the people who brought us The Matrix and Cloud Atlas, the last of which I do not love but definitely enjoy and highly respect for ambitiousness. I actually had some kind of hope going in, but everything collapsed from frame one and never got back up.\n\nThere is nothing to get angry about here because nothing is trying to reach for a profound message or a high allegory, it is just trying to be fun, failing terribly at it, but never was I bored to the point of sleep or angry to the point of kicking the seat in front of me, so there isn't really a reason for a lower grade. And despite all the negatives in it, the score is kind of really good, Kunis and Tatum, of whom I am a big fan, are charismatic and decent enough to keep bore levels at an acceptable low value Sean Bean is as always illuminating on screen and some, and I repeat some, of the visuals are really eye-pleasing.\n\nBut enough of that, this film is a mess, it is so bloated, non-sense, out of nowhere and tonally all over the place I could not make heads or tails of why what was happening on screen was happening. It is really an example of how storytelling should not be done. I can't even start to process the thought that the same people who wrote the Matirx, wrote this total chaos. Things happen randomly on screen, characters are flat and unbelievable, the story never, ever makes sense and about a dozen story arcs are opened and never closed. This was a real atrocity to behold. Moreover the visuals were actually, for the majority lame! Yes the CGI was excellent and the design was partly wonderful, but the editing, the epileptic cuts the incomprehensible action and again the bloated scenes were even worse than the story's mess. I can see the brilliance of John Toll in some parts, but mostly it was erased by terrible editing. In my \"Theory of Everything\" review I said that after Les Miserables and the film itself, Eddie Redmayne could do no wrong...I eat my words, he was the worst performer of all, and believe me when I say that some performances are really terrible, I am so sorry for him.\n\nAh, this was just a waste of time, don't go see it in the theaters, don't rent it don't watch it, it is really bad and it hurts really bad to say that being a real fan of almost all of the filmmakers and actors involved."

The 1st part is an overblown retread of the Terminator where a pretty urban drudge is taken up by a super-soldier from the future/outer space and told of her immense importance and bewildering hyper active action ensues. the green screen whizzing about was tedious and uninvolving and made you long for the stripped down intensity of the terminator. I started to enjoy spot the influence when a big section of Dune hove into view followed by a silly Brazil section complete with Terry Gilliam cameo. After that it was off to outer space for lengthy Phantom Menace style exposition when I'm afraid I left so i suppose this review is a bit of a fraud. Sorry if the ending was moving, exciting and witty instead of plodding, overblown and derivative."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie reaches that mythical degree of bad that prompts a lifelong lurker to come out and actually review it in writing. \"Worst\" is not nearly enough a superlative to describe how bad this is. And that is precisely because of the bits that people found \"still pretty good\" in it. Those are only rubbing it in. In fact, those bits are completely detachable from the whole, because we're talking CGI exclusively. The rest is no more than appalling dead weight.\n\nI won't go into the world building in the movie, which is in itself a huge missed opportunity, by the way, because there's no point, really. The story and characters (you know, the two most freaking important and sine qua non facets of any narrative, ever) are less than amateurishly crafted, they are plain dumb to an amazing degree. As I watched this, the predominant sentiment was disbelief: How did this mess ever leave the My Documents folder of some talentless eleven year old, and made its way onto the desks of big Hollywood hotshots? I forced myself to watch it in full, and not only did it not improve, but it got so, so much worse.\n\nEverything (except the CGI, but that in isolation is for six-graders) is wrong with this humongous failure, besides those measly things that are story and characters. The pacing is jerky, the dialogue is absolutely idiotic and unbelievable at most times, and the acting, oh my God, the acting - the leads act so bad, to the point you can't actually understand what they're mumbling! The acting is littered with nauseating clich\u00e9s, from silly poses and stances to boring gestures and verbal utterances. It makes you wonder how the hell this movie got out of the studios in this sorry state. The whole impression is of an amateur crew's first draft of the film school graduation project, at best.\n\nEven the action/battle scenes become boring and repetitive very fast. Almost all action scenes are poorly directed, which translates into a blurry, flashy, borderline incomprehensible mess most of the time. A far cry from the superbly done Matrix fights.\n\nI see my awarding it one star as a sacred duty to the art of cinematography and to the idea of science-fiction. I hope the overall rating plummets under 5, so that this sorry production will become a timeless lesson in how not to make movies, even if you're already famous and have tons of money. May it also be a lesson to all movie makers of our days: The public is not as stupid as you think. In the end, CGI can only take you so far. Stop relying on its magic already! Truly bad movies cannot be salvaged by it, or marketing, or hype."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh Wachowski siblings. Your once promising career has all but ended thanks to this latest offering to the people of this much loved Earth. Such an unwelcome gift comes in the form of Jupiter Ascending, a film that can only be described as being this decades' Battlefield Earth, a statement that does not come lightly, whilst being a complete shame when remembering how brilliant The Matrix was when I first watched it. Now, in 2015, instead of The Matrix, we have a film with no soul, no depth, and seemingly not a care in the world, aside from one that has a massive bank note wrapped around it, with its' lead characters being almost as soul-crushingly dull as the film itself. Rant mode activated.\n\nI would attempt to give a brief synopsis of Jupiter Ascending, but the truth is, I really cannot be bothered. The plot is so ridiculously uninspiring and sleep-inducing that it's making me yawn even as I think about it now, whilst simultaneously making me cringe so hard, I feel like I am looking at early photos of my dress sense in the 1990's. So plot done with, what's next I hear you ask! Characters. Okay. Firstly, I have a fundamental problem with Mila Kunis as a bog cleaner. It just wouldn't happen. Also, being cursed with a name such as Jupiter Jones, surely she would have legally changed it by now? No sane human being would walk around 21st century society with a name so laughable being called Ben Dover is a step up. Unless that's the actual underlying point of the film, that she is actually so insane that she dreams of meeting a topless, roller skating, wonky eared, Channing Tatum and flying off to badly CGI'd planets, because whoever pitched the idea of Jupiter Ascending was clearly mad and needs to be heavily sedated and sectioned ASAP.\n\nAs for Channing Tatum, his reputation as a \"serious actor\" has been dealt a crippling blow. Why would he, after doing so well in Foxcatcher, want to be in this turkey of a movie? Surely he must have read the script? The same goes for Sean Bean, who throughout the entirety of his scenes in the film looks as bored as I did watching him, yet acting bored in a movie is better than acting as a humanised wooden plank, a feat which Ms. Kunis passes with flying colours. And now on to Eddie Redmayne. Oh Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. Your Oscar win is not as clear-cut as it might once have been. His portrayal as the villainous I-don't-care-what-his-name-is is exceedingly laughable and can only be described as the dull second- cousin of Gary Oldman's, Zorg, in The Fifth Element. His constant need to quietly whisper instructions to badly designed flying reptile things was bad enough, but when juxtaposed with sudden belts of screaming, it was like watching my 13 year old brother having a hissy-fit after not being allowed on the PlayStation. Sorry Eddie, but you were utter pants.\n\nIn conclusion, Jupiter Ascending, is complete tripe. The attempts at acting are terrible. The plot is ludicrous. Okay, it might look good and fancy, but fanciness cannot save Jupiter Ascending from being one of the most boring and pain-inducing sci-fi films I think I have ever sat through. I think it's time to watch The Matrix again.\n\nOverall Score: 3/10"

Aiming to be ambitious, it seems to be the prequel of the fifth story of Cloud Atlas, combining the elements of reincarnation, breeding, creating new lives as motive source and harvesting with their usual cinematography styles, but it turns out to be a bit complex for squeezing these daring ideas into a rushing two hours in which a number of unnecessarily silly parts should have been replaced to develop the whole universe in details. It has the nostalgic moments thanks to the amazing reconstruction of certain Cloud Atlas scores by Michael Giacchino, the performances from the cast however is a bit mixed - nothing surprise from Tatum and Kunis thanks to the cheesy dialogues, but Eddie Redmayne as the main antagonist role looks promising though with limited screen time. Overall, this new version of Star Wars space universe is still an enjoying formulaic blockbuster with its intense actions and eye popping visual effects even if the directors themselves ended up confused and misfiring ambitious at the wrong directions."

The production design and special effects are amazing and the score is epic. Its has also been said that there is no humour to it, but completely disagree with that too. There is a lot of exposition, but again there is also a lot of action. The Wachowski's tried something new and succeeded....even tho some of the animal spliced humans are a bit 60's star trek. Films like the Transformer series make millions and they are soulless cack.

Random out of place scenes and characters shoe horned in for no clear or discernible reason. The plot? Utterly no idea. It's clear this film has delusions of grandeur early on. It fancies itself as both a high concept sci-fi and blockbuster in one. It's neither. It's simply a mess held together loosely by some talented A list Hollywood leading actors directed poorly and who like the audience are not clear on what the whole thing is about. Rarely do films make me angry but this one does as I'm puzzled as to how this was ever green-lit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Quickie Review:\n\nJupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is an ordinary woman stuck being a maid, cleaning toilets for life. She is thrown into extraordinary circumstances when discovering that she is the heir to planet Earth. Soon, Jupiter is forced into a power struggle with the remaining chain of inheritance of the cosmos. Jupiter Ascending is the latest attempt by the Wachowskis to recapture the success they had with The Matrix trilogy. There is a lot to like about this movie, visually it is stunning and the universe that is built is rich in detail. However, the film gets so caught up in the details that as a whole the story gets unnecessarily convoluted. Nevertheless, Jupiter Ascending is a passable sci-fi fantasy to experience on the big screen.\n\nFull Review:\n\nOver the past decade the Wachowskis have had a lot of misses. It has caused many including myself to suspect that The Matrix may be the exception rather than the rule on their ability to make a great film. So I'll admit I had very low expectations for this one.\n\nThere is one thing that will be undisputed amongst everybody, visually Jupiter Ascending is gorgeous. The art design from planets, to ships, to costumes are beautifully crafted and unique from anything I've seen before. Then there are the action set pieces that were very well shot, delivering a lot of intensity to the chases and shoot outs. These were the scenes where I had the most fun, and watching it in IMAX was worth it for the immersion. I must say the universe created for the film, with the trade systems, species, and the worlds, is impressively diverse. You can tell there is a lot of backstory to how this universe functions. I wouldn't mind reading a book about even because of its depth, but this leads me to what doesn't work with the film.\n\nSimply put, there is a lot of exposition about the trading systems, bureaucracy, and politics. It gets to the point where there is a collections of scenes dedicated to showing Mila Kunis going from one office to another trying get her inheritance. Even when that's done, the supporting cast spend significant time explaining their involvement rather than just showing it. Another frustration I had with the film was the rinse and repeats of the same sequence of events three times: Jupiter is kidnapped, exposition by supporting character, Jupiter rescued by Caine (Channing Tatum). Three times! Finally, the biggest wasted potential of the movie, Eddie Redmayne. We know he is an incredible actor from Theory of Everything, but here he is reduced to a botox lipped generic villain with an absent middle to his mood spectrum. He will be whispering ever so lightly then he would explode into a raging scream in a millisecond. I'm sorry but that's laughable, not menacing.\n\nThere has been a lot of negativity online about this movie, and as you can see I haven't pulled back my punches on the negatives either. In the end, it is still a watchable movie with some entertaining set pieces and great visuals. Jupiter Ascending is not revolutionary, but it is also not a disaster. Best way to describe it is through my friend's first reaction, \"not as bad as I expected,\" yet that doesn't make it great.\n\nCheck out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "I really really tried to watch this movie. The flaws are legion. Not only is the story disjointed, the dialogue is awful, and the make up is laughable. Then there were the fake drinks in scenes- it was quite apparent there was nothing in any of the glasses that people were drinking from- who allowed this, the director? Did the editor even notice how bad it looked? Was all the editing focus on a special effect? There was plenty of bad acting to go around. Shame on everyone except the lizard monster guards- they have an excuse, they appeared to be animation of some sort. I only put this movie on because usually today's sci fi is more engaging and I am a fan of Ms.Kunis. There was nothing that saved this movie. The plot is not clever it is however old and the tone of the movie and the execution of the plot was beyond annoying. The special effects were not too bad but special effects a movie does not make. Bad plot, bad script, bad acting, that is what Jupiter Ascending is full of. Please save your time and money (thank goodness this was free for me). I wish I could give a .5 star but I didn't see how I could. Hopefully people will not fall for other reviews telling you to watch this dog of a movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't understand some stuff about reviews. Is it just me or some movies are really underrated? I don't really know.\n\nJupiter Jones was born under a night sky, with signs predicting that she was destined for great things. Now grown, Jupiter dreams of the stars but wakes up to the cold reality of a job cleaning other people's houses and an endless run of bad breaks. Only when Caine Wise, a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along - her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.\n\nAs I was saying at the beginning, Jupiter Ascending seem a bit underrated. The story and a whole plot seems pretty decent. Story is well made in this movie. I can tell same as directing, of course. The ending of this movie is pretty predictable, so don't wait for something not seen.\n\nActing in this movie is also not bad. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis gave their best. Also, Eddie Redmayne did great! I was impressed. After his Oscar winning role of Steve Hawking, this came perfect. It's, of course, not good as Hawking.\n\nSpecial effects are sometimes good, sometimes bad, I can't tell. I was impressed when I saw rising in a space ship. Wise's gravity boots are pretty decent made, but some explosions and some shooting are not done well.\n\nThere are some political interests in this movie, but they are boring and I think that they could remove them. They are just making a movie longer.\n\nSoundtracks are done well and they fit in as well.\n\nAt the end, this movie is really good, but I'm not recommending it to everybody. Sci-fi fans like me are going to like it, but others, I don't think so."

In recreating entirely new universe, the movie fails to engage the viewer with altogether new world. The concept is ok but the development of idea is poor. Acting is very average and I even didn't liked Eddie Redmayne fumbles here."

First off, I am a self admitted fan of sci-fi so a trio of us always take in the latest movie of the genre. The visuals are well worth the price. The homage to other movies of this kind are amazing. Yes, you got to go with in. It does seem chopped or cut to make it shorter BUT the ride is worth it for the 3 of us that saw it. I must admit I am a fan of the Wachowskis's work and admire their willingness to push the envelopes in the over the top aspects. Do you want cookie cutter Marvel movies out the gazoo? Go watch as a fun escape as a popcorn escapists movie to another world. And the other worlds they have created are visually stunning. Yes, the script could have used work, but they are covering much ground in one short movie. It would be interesting to know what ended up on the cutting room floor. I for one will be buying the 3D DVD when it comes out."

Legion: The guys having wings and then being taken away only to be returned again? Guardians of the Galaxy: \"Warhammers?\" The Hunger Games: Where else would you get those stupid outfits? Star Wars: Need I say more? Titan A.E: The weird characters. The Fifth Element: Bruce Willis did it better. Zorg was a better villain. To spare myself the horrible graphics, and acting, I could have watched all these movies again instead of this putrid bull. Fight scenes dragged on and on and on. Not enough story.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have always liked the Wachowskis, they are mad geniuses of of modern action science fiction films and always push the limit of what we can see on film. They have made great movies (Matrix still remains their biggest hit though) but when their last film Cloud Atlas was released, my like turned into genuine love for these sibling directors it was an unprecedented science fiction film likes of which may never be seen again. That being said I was really looking forward to Wachowskis' Jupiter Ascending even though word on the street was not very good.\n\nEarth and all other planets in the galaxy are ruled by a powerful family- Abrasax, Three Abrasax siblings rule a third of the galaxy each. All three are cunning, manipulative, power hungry and distrustful of one another. Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is of special interest to them all as she is the supposed reincarnation of their mother the undisputed galactic queen and may lead to disruption of power. Since Earth falls under the empire of the eldest sibling Balem (Eddie Redmayne) he serves as the main antagonist for the film, he'd see Jupiter dead and his brother and sister fall back in line. Caine (Channing Tatum) is Jupiter's protector and yes the unnecessary romantic interest. Revealing rest would spoil the movie. Jupiter Ascending's stage setting and sci-fi back story is amazing and a lot of work has gone into it and this makes the movie till the first half very interesting but once the second half hits and all the players and the backstory has been revealed the quality of the film takes a huge nosedive and it becomes cluttered with one too many action sequences. The action sequences themselves are well done and really pushes the medium of action scenes in science fiction even though it's very CGI heavy but that comes with the genre's territory. A very noteworthy point to be mentioned is that the film looks very futuristic, the technology looks centuries ahead of Star Trek and Guardians of Galaxy thus I think it would be great if Disney can get the Wachowskis for one of their Star Wars film they can do great stuff with in their world. The acting is surprisingly decent as well considering the leads. I hope to get a Directors Cut of Jupiter Ascending because some preliminary research has yielded that the studio butchered significant story sequences of the film to make it shorter. Why they cut story/lore building scenes and not action scenes is beyond me because Jupiter Ascending's world building is beautiful and great. However I am still waiting for the 4 Hour Director's Cut of Cloud Atlas first, Wachowskis have been teasing that for years. Jupiter Ascending's Director's Cut would make the film good and complete and dare I say even great.\n\nAll in all, Jupiter Ascending is a mixed bag, it has high concept and ideas, decently executed too and is visually stunning but the story within the setting is just terrible. But I will take Jupiter Ascending with all its flaws over a generic action film which may have a better but safe, serviceable corporate story which keeps the franchise running. Still rated it higher than it deserved simply because it's bold and there is potential for quality sequels."

Wow...unless this movie is aimed exclusively at 10 year olds this is complete and utter joke. Some spoilers ahead...though I don't think I can spoil anything.\n\nWhere do I begin... Acting - Mila Kunis, just please stop doing \"serious\" roles. She is walking, talking and interacting on the emotional level of a 16 year old girl shopping at a mall....I won't even mention the rest. Not worth mentioning. Story - other than the somewhat nice idea that earth was populated by a race of superior aliens in order to be harvested one day...that's a cool idea. The rest just doesn't make any kind of sense. The heroes motivations and actions are child like.\n\nSpecial effects which are supposed to be THE thing in this movie are just OK. For a movie of this budget? They could have done 20 times better.\n\nand finally...SOME FREAKING LOGIC. I know this is a sci fi movie, but for the love of goodness how can you think the audience is this stupid?\n\nCaine is thrown into the void at some point and struggles for some time until he finds a thingy that turns into a space suit and gives him air and stuff. AIR PRESSURE CHANGES!!! Hello?! He would die in a matter of seconds.\n\nCaine is fighting a dinosaur like monster. At some point they go shoulder to shoulder and the monster bites Caine...just enough for him to cringe from pain. A thing of this size with the jaws it had, could easily bite off his entire shoulder with next to no effort.\n\nThese two are the ones that come to mind right away, but things like this are all over the place.\n\nComplete and utter garbage. Why does Hollywood keep making these mindless, insulting films? Why make it at all? Just donate the money to some country in Africa."

They have watched it twice now and were rooting for the eponymous \"Jupe\" from start to finish. Although the bramble patch that doubled for a story kept my children asking questions all the way through...\n\nI mean, seriously... What the hell, Wachowskis? This was not your finest storytelling hour.\n\nFrom an Adult's standpoint, this film is a mess from start to finish... Whisking the viewer from stunning set-piece scene to stunning scene to a cottage in the countryside... To the centre of a maelstrom...\n\nSet against a grandiose and splendid background, the story comes across as irrevocably insipid and weak, all but overpowered by the looming shadows of the fabulously powerful galaxy the sisters created. Moreover, the \"plot\" moves on so quickly that the audience are unable to form connections with any of the characters or settings. Any characterisations that are there, are shallow and the outcome is pretty obvious from the get go.\n\nWhich is a crying shame since the sumptuous, no expenses spared sets and clearly well thought out Galactic milieu were tantalising us with its beauty and implied depth... It was crystal clear that the sisters had worked hard on building a galaxy with a deep, sordid history far too long and far too out of control and crowded for comfort... A backdrop that would have been perfect for an epic story to be set in.\n\nInstead, I have to ask... to what purpose did they create this? It just seems such an egregious waste of resources and effort for a story so simple as to be second rate.\n\nI can honestly only assume it was initially meant to be series but then something went wrong and the entire first season was compressed into a 2 hour mashup of sadly missed potential. Like the single \"filmisode\" versions of Shogun and V in the 80's. Impossible and pointless.\n\nThis easily had the opportunity of becoming something akin to Luc Besson's 5th Element or the rich tapestry of Star Wars or as I mentioned, a whole, new series.\n\nInstead we were offered a pedestrian plot with non stop, escalating fight scenes and a really cringeworthy \"love\" story... and a skating alien!!!\n\nMy daughters really want to watch it again!\n\nI give it a seven for effort but broken down as below:\n\nAdult: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Drunk Adult: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Kids: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606"

There are ideas and concepts in Lana and Andy's heads, I'm sure but they are being filtered for that blind desire to create a great box office success. The story, the characters and dialogues are a distressing banality. The direction becomes boring in the middle of so many digital Gothic settings and weird creatures. Lana and Andy, you need a good, solid and interesting story like the ones in Coen brothers movies, not a lot of boring ideas from the world of science fiction, please return to that minimalistic and dark universe of \"Matrix\", that was good and enough. Lana and Andy please watch \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" again and make me buy a DVD of one of you films even if I have watched it ten times before. Less noise and effects with better characters and storytelling could made a great movie from the prime idea of \"Jupiter Ascending\"."

If you like The Fifth Element, The 1980s Flash Gordon with a bit of Terry Gilliam thrown in (literally) you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. On the plus side the story was rich and textured and something I hadn't seen before. On the negative side, the actual dialogue was weak at part and some of the action seemed redundant; we get lots of the same type of action / suspense. Back to the Terry Gilliam angle, there was one sequence where I found myself saying this is so Terry Gilliam and last part of the sequence actually featured a cameo by Terry and in the very next scene Jupiter has a shout out line that no fan of Brazil would miss. If I could change anything I would make the film a full Gilliam film. That probably wouldn't help the box office but I would get it to the cult status faster and push it a bit more into satire which would have been fun. By the end of the film I did actually care for the character but if that had happened for me sooner, I would have found it more enjoyable. I think some reworking of the dialogue probably could have accomplished that. Over all I'm glad I saw it 7 out of 10."

Eddie Redmayne plays Balem Abrasax, the man who runs the industry. This film is directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski who directed the Matrix franchise. What was supposed to be an exciting sci-fi thrill ride ended up suffering from horrible miscasting, laughable script, and lack of originality.\n\nFirst off, Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum were by far not the right actors for a movie like this, especially as the main characters. Many have seen Kunis in mostly comedies, and she just doesn't seem right for science-fiction thriller. Channing Tatum didn't even good in this either. Secondly, this film borrows so many elements from the Star Wars movies. The worlds' designs looked so similar to what you would find in Star Wars. Even the way the characters are dressed are similar to what you would see in Star Wars. Furthermore, the acting and dialogue is terrible. Some scenes even had me laughing by their cheesy dialogue, one scene in particular where Jupiter nurses Caine's wound while he's driving. Then there were other scenes that were just boring and pointless. The visual effects which are supposed to be the best part of the film aren't even great. The final spaceship battle had countless explosions with fire that was so poorly animated and unrealistic.\n\nI have to say that Jupiter Ascending is one of the worst films I have seen this year. If you are looking for a good science-fiction thriller, you probably better looking elsewhere."

The fact that they writers/director even allowed the plot to go into that direction and allowed Mila Kunis' character to ponder that decision, is a travesty. No human should be shown to be so idiotically dull-minded, as to contemplate the destruction of the human race, just to protect themselves or their family.\n\nWith that massive flub of a plot hole out of the way; was the movie actually good?: Yeah it's a cool way to keep yourself entertained for 2hrs... I'd really compare it to the Valerian movie, as it's actually very similar. So if you liked the Valerian movie, then you'll probably like this movie as well. There's LOTS of good CGI and lots of action."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jupiter Ascending is directed by the Wachowski Brothers, the directors who brought you the Matrix; however, the Wachowski Brothers' eye catching visuals failed to save it of becoming a disastrous mess. First of all, as a whole, Jupiter Ascending looks like a tremendous feast filled with eye-popping special effects. And to be honest, the Wachowski Brothers once again succeeded on what they are always good at- the visuals. I have no reason to deny how well they managed on the special effects, the Jupiter atmosphere, Channing Tatum and his flying boots, and even the kingdoms, are all a pleasure of watching.\n\nBut the bad thing is that the story is a total mess. I have no idea what I was watching. It is disorganized which makes every fight scene which supposed to be exciting pointless. Though each scene tend to make the audience intense, by having Mila Kunis make some difficult decisions, then Channing Tatum will definitely pops out to save her. For the first few time, it works. But the same script is used too many times which leads to boredom.\n\nThere are also some very unbearable lines in the movie that is just ridiculous. Like every movie, Jupiter Ascending will definitely include some romance, but the lines are just so stupid that you keep face- palming. You'll know what I mean after watching it.\n\nSome of the actors did great in the movie. I like Sean Bean being the supporting actor; he's just very likable. Tatum and Kunis did okay, but I really hope the movie could develop more on their chemistry if they really mean it.\n\nJupiter Ascending can be passed on if you really miss the chance to watch it. It's fun to watch the special effects, but they can't save the entire movie. This movie could be better if they put as much effort on the plot as they put on the visuals."

The Plot would be like a(4/10) & Special Effects would be a (9.5/10). Overall, I would say it was a (6/10). The movie really had potential to be Top 10 feature film, but ended up being a Sci-Fi film with a savant syndrome.\n\nI did not see this movie on a big screen, rather, I streamed it on my laptop, so my viewpoint may be a bit biased, but I tried to be fair & honest with my review."

It's bombastic, wide, space opera. With homages to lots of other films. Only one bit I'd cut out. A very Brazil or HHGTTG like section. Also I'd shorten fight and action scenes. The music is fabulous. I'll be buying the soundtrack album. The acting is good. The visuals are stunning. Story as good as many other big Sci-fi films. I enjoyed it.\n\nI felt good after watching it.

With its eye-popping visuals that are mind-blowing to its mind-numbing script that is incoherent and more convoluted than needed, the film (as conceived by the team of writer / directors known as The Wachowskis, Andy and Lana of Matrix's fame) disappoints its intended audience.\n\nOverwhelming is the best word to describe this movie-going experience. Excessive is another. Perhaps, the term overkill is even better. The set design and CGI work is spectacular. The Waschowskis are experts are visceral joy and they create worlds that are imaginative and highly detailed. But their film is in vast need of rewrites. The script has characters change alliances without any provocation and they are introduced and then suddenly disappear, only to return later as mere plot devices to move the action along. It just never makes any sense. They are one-dimensional beings caught in a three-dimensional universe.\n\nThe belabored plot involves cosmic royalty, human egg harvesting, youth serums, and inter-galactic dominance. On another planet, all eyes are on the look-out for a genetic queen who somehow threatens their existence. Back on Earth, we meet the chosen one, our heroine, Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis. A woman of strong Russian stock and a helluva maid, Jupiter trudges through her day cleaning toilets and begrudgingly dreaming about a better life, kinda like Cinderella without the depth. That is, until one day she is rescued by a tall strapping alien soldier named Caine Wise (who isn't), played by Channing Tatum, who literally sweeps her off her feet with his anti-gravitational boots. (These boots were made for flying!)\n\nCaine is half-human, half canine, and Mr. Tatum, at least, gets it half right, delivering a dog of a performance. Apparently, Jupiter, though poor, is a Cosmic Queen in her former life and owns Earth, which is a huge dowry for any would-be bride and enough to make her a target for any alien suitor. Ms. Kunis' acting can't even convince us she is human let alone royalty. Both actors defy zero gravity and have zero chemistry to boot.\n\nThe action sequences are directed with style and a Saturday matin\u00e9e peril mindset. All of the supporting actors involved have done better work. Sean Bean, Douglas Booth, Gugu Mbatha- Raw, Maria Doyle Kennedy, and especially Eddie Redmayne as the evil Balem, who recites his lines in a low whisper that is more inaudible than menacing. All are wasting their talents in this dud.\n\nJupiter Ascending is a letdown, a film with some visual wonder to fixate upon as it wanders its parallel universes in search of a logical and compelling story to match its grandiose thinking. (Kudos to John Toll's photography and Hugh Bateup's impressive production design.) Alas, the film settles somewhere between ordinary (without the extra added) and just plain dull.\n\nVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com\n\nANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

Find more clich\u00e9s, if needed invent some new ones, and add them to the pile. Make sure to include something from every known historical period: the Jurassic period, the Roman empire, the Victorian era, and so on. 3. Blend it. Blend it like your life depends on it! Mix that Roman empire with dinosaurs, robots, space ships, and Victorian machinery! 4. Pour visual effects sauce over it. Keep doing this until every pixel of the screen is a visual effect. If 'The Chronicles of Riddick' looked baroque, this film must look baroque squared. 5. Find some shallow and simple story to tie all this together.\n\nThe result is entertaining in the same way as a roller-coaster ride: it is fun for the first five minutes, but when you keep on doing it for two hours straight, it makes you sick.\n\nI actually did not know this was written and directed by the Wachowskis until I saw the end credits. What happened to their skill of using a perfect dose of special effects to tell a multi-layered story?\n\nThe only good thing about this film is the visual aspect. It looks nice. Kudos to the people working on the CGI. The problem however is that there is way too much of it, a common problem with recent attempts at blockbusters. There is so much to see that eventually there is nothing interesting to see. 'The Matrix' was visually quite sober most of the time, and this is what made its effects stand out. In Jupiter Ascending, everything is spectacular from the first to the last minute, which results in nothing being spectacular at all. It is the visual equivalent of the 'loudness wars' in music. A spectator who is spammed with a non-stop visual overload, eventually does not care about anything anymore, no matter how spectacular it is. They will start focusing on the acting and story, and noticing that there is simply nothing of interest there.\n\nThe acting is ho-hum, some of the actors seem to be even more confused about what kind of a mess they have been cast into, than us spectators. The story is made to sound complex but it is just a paper thin idea padded with expensive words and pseudoscience, and vague hints at trying to bring important messages that get entirely lost in all the noise.\n\nI mentioned The Chronicles of Riddick before, which is conceptually very similar but which I found much more entertaining. Maybe it was because at least one of the characters did have a back-story and acted as if he cared. Jupiter Rising on the other hand seems like an example of what can go wrong when technological advances allow to show anything on-screen a director wants, and they cannot decide what to pick from all the possibilities, so they simply pick everything that exists and throw it together."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Jupiter Ascending\" (2015), directed by the Wachowskis, is an intergalactic science fiction film that seeks to provoke awe and exhilaration but falls short on both counts. The Wachowskis have struggled in the sixteen years since making the trend-setting \"The Matrix\" (1999), not quite recovering their reputation after the critically disappointing sequels and their financially-underwhelming films \"Speed Racer\" (2008) and \"Cloud Atlas\" (2012). This means \"Jupiter Ascending\", originally scheduled to be released in July 2014 but pushed back to January 2015 to complete the work on the computer generated special effects and to allow its studio Warner Bros., to mount a more effective marketing campaign, has so far struggled critically and commercially. It's not hard to see why either, with a clunky and exposition-filled opening that betrays a lack of confidence with its subject and further hampered by at times poor dialogue. The script, an original, is all plot and forward momentum, clearly influenced by a number of literary sci-fi sources including Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" series and some half-baked allegorising on capitalism. The Wachowskis' eagerness to create a blockbuster franchise means they rely too heavily on the expected genre traits of epic odysseys, with silent, brooding heroes (Channing Tatum) and hysterical, manic villains (Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne, who alternates between quivering whispers and exploding uproar) with an ing\u00e9nue female lead to be rescued and have the plot explained to (a rather wooden Mila Kunis).\n\nThe script is an unsatisfactory mess that manages to conform to every expected reversal in the plot and the Wachowskis compound the feeling of familiarity with a quick editing rhythm (with Alexander Berner doing the actual cutting) that is redolent of many other mainstream action films. The only distinctive directorial set piece is an eight minute aerial battle over the dawn skies of Chicago that allows John Toll's cinematography to truly breathe and deliver a genuinely thrilling moment in a film that otherwise has little time for Toll's photographic magic. The other memorable sequence is when Kunis must claim the title to Earth from a galactic bureaucracy; it's a rare moment of humour in an otherwise po-faced filmed. The production design (by Hugh Bateup) and costume design (by Kym Barrett) is inventive and excellent, from a planet created with a Frank Gehry aesthetic to incorporating Ely Cathedral into the spaceship of Titus Abrasax (Douglas Booth in an amusing, self-deprecating performance, the best in the film). It's visually extraordinary but almost too much; combined with the unrelenting special effects, the rich textures become suffocating, especially when their isn't the script or characters to sustain it.\n\nIn thinking the audience are engaged with its stolid characters, it fails to find any fun in itself, even when Sean Bean is supposed to be half man and half bee. Instead, we're left to dwell on its ephemeral pleasures, from the costumes and sets to Redmayne's twitching mannerisms and one well-done action scene. It's not enough to sustain the picture, leaving the film ultimately hollow and superficial; the Wachowskis were once renowned as original, visionary filmmakers, but now it seems they're as over-enamoured with special effects and franchise-building at the expense of depth as the rest of Hollywood."

The underlying story is not bad, it borrows from both modern movie classics as well as mythology.\n\nBut the problem is in the presentation of the core material, too big issues brushed over with not enough depth, action filling each small gap of the movie hindering any tension or interest to build up any climax.\n\nAnd the cardinal sin to introduce technical sci-fi in a space saga (midi-clorians), but in this case it's gene-sequences.\n\nBut watching Jupiter Ascending without any expectations to begin with (as I did) makes it an quite pleasant experience."

Too much muscle and a buzz cut don't say 14year old obsession like a skinny with hair blocking half his eyesight. And Mila is sexy enough but not really an action heroine, especially when her looks are so down played as here. Also, the love story and Cinderella parallels are much to prominent for hard core sci-fi fans, so it also falls short with that crowd.\n\nI should have given it zero stars, but two go to Mila's eyes, one for Tatum and one for each minute Terry Gilliam is on, so five in total."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Your Majesty, I have more in common with a dog than I have with you.\"\n\nWith the exception of Speed Racer and The Matrix Revolutions I have always enjoyed the Wachowskis films and their unique vision. I haven't seen Speed Racer since it was first released, but I have heard a lot of praise for it in recent years so I might need to revisit it soon considering many people have claimed it was way ahead of its time. Jupiter Ascending may be one of their weakest efforts because the plot is messy and convoluted, but the film still looked great and had an underlying sense of humor about it. When I watched the trailer for the first time my high expectations were tamed, but I actually ended up enjoying the movie more than I had anticipated due to the comedy. The Wachowskis have interesting and unique ideas and somewhere in Jupiter Ascending there are some, but the film fails to develop the story. The Wachowskis might have been trying to direct the Star Wars for this generation, but I'm sorry The Guardians of the Galaxy got there first.\n\nA lot of critics have claimed the film is so ridiculous that it's unintentionally funny, but I have to disagree. I think they were aiming for a sci-fi comedy that isn't supposed to be taken seriously. The Wachowskis are having a lot of fun with the characters Sean Bean has been playing in the past and he is great here. There are some great hilarious scenes about the bureaucracy in the Universe. There is another one taking place in a space ship involving an elephant man which reminded me of some of the wacky characters that had small roles in Star Wars. Eddie Redmayne is amping it up as a villain and has taken a lot of criticism for his performance, but he too is part of the fun the Wachowskis are having with the film. Everyone is so focused on the incredible Chicago chase scene at the beginning of the film, but I wasn't really blown away by it. What stood out for me was the wacky sense of humor (the bureaucracy scene is my favorite). I may be reading to far into this film, but I felt they were also poking fun of Twilight with the love triangle in the middle of the movie involving the gorgeous Mila Kunis, the very pale looking Douglas Booth, and the dog man Channing Tatum. At times they also reference Beauty and the Beast, and the Terry Gilliam cameo proves they were influenced by his work in Brazil.\n\nI haven't spent any time detailing the plot because it is hard to set up this expanded universe. The Wachowskis take their time to introduce this world and set things up. They have some interesting ideas, but they aren't developed too well and the action set pieces take over. This had the potential of being The Fifth Element, but the Wachowskis were aiming a bit higher than that and missed the mark. Channing Tatum and Sean Bean give the best performances in the movie, while Mila Kunis was miscast in my opinion. Eddie Redmayne's talents are also wasted by the way the Wachowskis wanted him to play the character. Jupiter Ascending looks great and the humor got to me, but the sic fi elements weren't that great. This is a forgettable film, but I was entertained."
