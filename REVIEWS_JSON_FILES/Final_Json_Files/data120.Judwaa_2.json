I knew the sort of movie I was going to watch so I enjoyed it thoroughly,apart from some boring portions. :) Having watched Judwaa previously, this one brought back some good old memories of it's predecessor, with certain scenes almost completely copy-pasted, including the dialogues.Varun has tried to pull this off extremely well and almost carries the entire movie on his own shoulders !! Some people might literally find the movie nothing less than a disaster....but if you know this kind of cinema,if the masala entertainers are your thing, you won't be that disappointed. Leave your brains at home & dance to the \"tan tana tan\" with the Dhawans, provided mindless entertainment amuses you."

Spending so much on location, songs and dance would not give inception of a good film unless script is thoroughly worked upon. There is no definition of Story, Script and direction tin Judwaa 2. The main drama unfolds in the later reel which again is intolerable with screenplay written by a school kid. Editing is horrible. The torture goes on for almost 2.25 hours. Art direction is good. Cinematography is nice. Songs are tuneful (again all the songs. baring one, is lifted straight from the original. Dialogues are less-impacting. Performances are over- top\n\nOverall, a pathetic film in every sense. Poor- 1/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "Trying to create the same magic after 20 years, David Dhawan makes a disaster known as Judwaa 2 which stars his son Varun Dhawan in a double role.\n\nDavid Dhawan directing a film after 3 years and that too a remake of one of his own films which was a hit in 1997 seemed to be exciting before it's release but eventually it lands up becoming a mindless entertainer.\n\nSachin Khedekar who plays the role of a father of twin sons who helps the police to catch a smuggler, gets in trouble when that smuggler takes one of his twin and keeps him on the railway track. But that child is saved as his brother turns on the right side and as they both have a reflex action the one on the railway track also turns. I laughed sarcastically at this scene and this same continues throughout the film and makes me get irritated.\n\nThe twins Raja and Prem are played by Varun Dhawan, his performance is like a toothache. Varun has delivered the same performance which was in Main Tera Hero. Varun's SRK mimicry is also preposterous.\n\nScreenwiter Yunus Sajawal has written a horrible screenplay, which should be avoided these days. Actually I can't get it that even after 20 years, such kind of screenplays are written and are also accepted. The dialogues are penned by Sajid - Farhad which are partially funny, the dialogues like \"Ammi jaan kaha karti thi.....\", are contempt. Thus by writing such screenplays and creating no logic makes the Indian audience's mentality the same as it was 20 years before.\n\nIf I take a film like The Terminator (1984) as an example, that was written and directed by Cameron and was really nice. But in 2009 he made Avatar which was also good but better than his previous films. That happened because he didn't try to create the same magic. Over here the writers have written the same clich\u00e9 screenplay and the director has directed in the same manner which makes me bored. In one of the scenes while diffusing a bomb Raja says that he should cut the red wire as red was lucky for him. This scene makes me completely baffled and later becomes terribly annoying. Thus the screenplay and direction lacks innovation.\n\nSomething that I liked in the film is Ayananka Bose's cinematography, which is top-notch. The frames are really impressive. Also the editing goes well.\n\nI really don't get one thing that what are actors like Pavan Malhotra and Sachin Khedekar doing in such a film? Such great actors in such a film! I really didn't like it.\n\nComprehensively, this cynical film has a lot of funny scenes that make you laugh for no reason as it's a film which makes no sense. I'm going with one out of five stars.\n\nRATING: 1/5"

This one was more towards the refreshing ones.\n\nIt got all the needed distractions like the BMX chase, some roof and street jumping, so it never really got boring. Some nice action scenes which could have done with a bit less violence. So please do not take your one and two year olds like the guys next to me in the cinema.\n\nThe main actor, Varun Dhawan did a solid job, playing these two different characters, Jaqueline Fernandez seemed to enjoy the dance lessons before and was in sync with Varun, and Tapsee Pannu, well, she is just gorgeous.\n\nAll together a nice comedy with some sidekicks to other movies like Three Idiots. I enjoyed it. I tend not to over analyze movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "Judwaa 2 is an Indian Hindi film directed by David Dhawan starring Varun Dhawan, Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee Pannu. It can be called a Slightly Twisted Remake of 1997 film 'Judwaa' With very few changes in the story, this movie is very predictable for the people who have watched the prequel. This movie has very rare laughs unlike the prequel. The story seems to be illogical at so many parts. This movie does a decent job for the young viewers who just want mindless entertainers but for the elder or logical audiences, this flick is just a mess!\n\nPerformances - Varun Dhawan is good in his role of Raja and Prem. He does a good job in differentiating the characters of Raja and Prem and carries the burden of whole movie on his shoulder.\n\nJacqueline is simply an attraction for the male audience. She looks hot throughout the film. Her acting is definitely poor in this movie but even a good performance from her wouldn't make a difference to this terribly scripted film\n\nTaapsee tries her best to make this film a good one, she acts really well and looks hot.\n\nMusic - This Music Album is given by Sajid Wajid, Anu Malik and Meet Bros. The Iconic Song 'Chalti hai kya 9 se 12' and 'Oonchi hai Building' entertains. The lead casts dance really well. 'Aa Toh Sahi' is a good and entertaining song with good music. ' Suno Ganpati Bappa Morya' is a good tune with horrible and senseless lyrics.\n\nSummary - This is a below average movie with a good performance from Varun and Taapsee, a few laughs, a good looking cast and fantastic music.\n\nShould I Watch this? Varun fans and people expecting a mindless entertainer with glam and good songs might like this one but for the rest of the people, it's better if you stay away from this!"

Varun Dhawan plays a dual role (Raja / Prem) with Jacqueline Fernandez (Alishka for Raja) and Taapsee Pannu (Samaira for Prem).\n\nPrem's father meets a person (the villain) on his flight from London to Mumbai. Upon landing, the villain keeps a water bottle filled with smuggled goods in his co-passenger's bag so that he comes out clean when Airport police checks him.\n\nPrem's father rushes to hospital to know that he has twins and the villain visits him in the hospital (how !?) so that he can take the water bottle. But, Prem's father has already intimated the Police and they catch the villain. When he tries to escape, he takes one of the twin babies (Raja) and leaves it near train track, runs to a godown, and blows it by opening a gas cylinder making the police and Prem's father believe that Raja was inside and is dead (due to the blast). Villain is presented to court and is sentenced to jail. Due to villain's strong network, Prem's father is advised by the Police to go elsewhere. Prem, his father and mother go to London, settle and he is raised there while Raja is raised in Mumbai.\n\nAs the story unfolds, all the characters travel to / meet in London\n\nFun concept is that when the twins are in nearby, each others are connected and action done by one are mirrored by the other\n\nPlot holes:"

If you've seen the original and even if you don't like it as much you'd have to admit it is better than this piece of junk.\n\nAnupam Kher is a legend in my eyes but he couldn't replace the original comedy of the great Kadar Khan, those scenes with the \"wrong number\" dialogues cannot be reused with feeling forced and they weren't even funny.\n\nI could not watch this film without remembering scenes from the original at least Salman played both characters with a bit more finesse, Varun copying Salman's style just makes him look silly. Mannerisms that cannot be repeated and dialogue delivery that makes you slightly sick. I personally enjoyed the original there's a lot of nostalgia behind it. The last fight scenes cannot be matched and shouldn't have been. I am really surprised that Salman Khan endorsed this second film and even made a cameo, what a wasted scene that was. Anyone who's considering watching Judwaa 2 don't bother just watch the original again."

        "review_detailed_main": "JUDWAA 2 REVIEW : I hope whoever is reading this review might have seen the 90's Judwaa film, because anyhow even if you don't want to, somehow comparison will obviously be made with the remake and i think it will be unfair to the new film as we all know film-making has changed so much in last 20 years. Same story which looked logical and interesting in 90's would look illogical in Today's internet generation. So i'm bit confused about reviewing Judwaa 2 cause i have seen 90's Judwaa many times and i enjoyed it lot so comparison is obvious and that's unfair. Let it be, i don't want comparison but somehow it will be made so, let me try to balance both the things.\n\nJudwaa 2 has same basic story of original Judwaa but has got different screenplay and few changed characters. Not a single character hits the old films characters magic. Not even Varun, he tries but fails to match Salman's one of most memorable characters, not his cup of tea. Even on individual level, he's not much impressive, Decent. Lead actresses got only hot chicks and thighs to show rather than showing acting talent. Music is disappointing and too loudy, sounds irritating at some moments. For e.g. Prem's ragging song and Rocky's defeat song was completely useless and highly irritating. Screenplay is fairly good in first half and too stretched in second half. Few illogical moments such as Football scene and couple of more scenes could have been removed or could be done in logical way. Even when The End was looking perfect it was again spoiled by Bomb scene. Even most anticipated Salman's cameo too looks completely needless, it comes at the End when there was no need of that scene, and even that scenes wasn't much good. Cinematography is Below Average overall but too bad in that 'Beach Song'. Only plus thing about the film has to be it's production value. Judwaa 2 holds upper hand in lavishness compared to Judwaa. Varun's clothes, actresses dressing, cars looks too lavish and posh. Direction looked confused and tricky. I can't believe the last film of David Dhawan was a good entertainer but despite better story, goodwill of Judwaa's popularity and high scale production value David failed to match his own last film Main Tera Hero? I mean, how much disappointing it is. He tried too much to make it a complete money making entertainer but ignored basic things like making a decent watch for audience, Or may be there was a pressure of recreating old magic again in different era, for different audience. Hence proved, old good films shouldn't be touched, let them remain Old and first of it's kind, people say Old is Gold for some reasons mate, you don't listen to people and ruins old ones just for the sake of money and lose your standard.\n\nOverall, Judwaa 2 is Strictly Average film and can be watched once with family in this festival weekend. But i personally don't see this (don't deserve) film in 100cr club, or may be it can touch it by the help of Holidays and enough mass elements in the film. A potential Blockbuster is ruined by Director's typical money making film and trying to be in a safe zone vision. Sorry Varun Dhawan but you have to wait more for your First Blockbuster. I give 5/10* to this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Somehow I don't understand why Bollywood insists on making sequels or remakes but I guess the producers are just on the verge of saving their production houses like NHG who are responsible for average films like Rangoon and Housefull 3.\n\nI always found David Drawn to be a cheesy filmmaker but some of his films really do make you laugh like Partner, Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya, and Mujhse Shaadi Karoge. Even the first Judwaa was funny and hilarious especially when Karishma Kapoor was a legendary actress back then.\n\nSo the movie revolves around Prem and Raju, twin conjoined brothers who were separated at birth by a gangster. Prem is based in London with a high-class status but his weak and geeky motives leads him to a big problem especially with a split personality where he shows off these unusual reflexes like kissing a girl or slapping a person for no forsaken reason. Raja on the other hand lives a low class life in Mumbai working for a fisherman and he is strong and the bravest of one the twins. How these 2 encounter each other and fixing the past behind them is basically what this film is about.\n\nQuite frankly, this movie is constantly below average. The trailer was something I had zero expectation in as well. Although Main Tera Hero was disappointing, I still liked some of the comedic factors in that film and it was sort of a delight to watch but this one tries really hard. The writing is the terminated achievement in the film. The script was too clich\u00e9d and I felt some of the scenes were just modified to look like the original film.\n\nThe acting was like somebody came on set just to make a quick buck.\n\nThe six pack abs on Varun's body managed to outdo him in terms of performance. This guy just doesn't want to leave his comfort zone.\n\nJacqueline Fernandez isn't really known for her acting and putting her in a film like this speaks volumes for itself. Even Taapsee was somebody I didn't like in the film although she was attractive, but still she lacked the justice she had in Pink for Judwaa 2.\n\nThe cinematography was absolutely cartoonish. Ayananka Bose has trouble picking the right camera for such films or is it the editor using a cheap software in a scene where Varun falls on the roof of a building.\n\nThe music is outstanding and gives you the nostalgic feeling Anu Malik managed to give. Oonchi si Building and Chalti Hai Kya 9 to 12 were modified nicely and brings back that vibe from the previous film.\n\nOverall, this movie is quite a disappointment. Very clich\u00e9d script along with mediocre performances also lets not forget the underwhelming cinematography and eating but despite a few laughs and good music, Judwaa 2 is worth watching but on Netflix or a T.v Broadcast.\n\nQuite some hype was created for this film. So the box office will be good surprisingly the theater during the 2:45 pm show was 75% full.\n\n2.75/5- Just save your money this weekend and wait for Chef which looks overwhelming but a remake is a skeptical factor for every film like this one."

Anyone who has directed as much as a street play, would know how difficult it is to make audience laugh. This movies does that well enough for a large target audience. If that was not the case, finer comedies like \"Bareilly ki Barfi\" or \"Dum Laga ke Haisha\" would have earned more than one-fifth of Judwaa 2's collections.\n\nNow to prove yourself an intellectual - try finding a cancer cure, build some artificial intelligence programs or write a Booker winning literature piece - don't take the shortcut of hollow and misplaced criticism."

The acting is subpar, with the usually reliable Varun Dhawan struggling to elevate the bland script. The worst part is the music - the soundtrack is annoying and forgettable, with one ear-piercing song after another. And don't even get me started on the \"comedy\" - it's all just cheap gags and slapstick humor that fails to elicit a single laugh. It is a disappointing and uninspired sequel that fails to deliver on its promise of fun and entertainment. If you're looking for a good Indian comedy, look elsewhere!"

        "review_detailed_main": "David Dhawan will test your patience level with Judwaa 2. It is filled with crass jokes and cheap humour. Women are treated as objects. I don't know how the girls working in it accepted their roles. Varun Dhawan's character spanked their asses and they really don't have any problem.\n\nVarun Dhawan was all about jumping and dancing. There is not a single dialogue which he delivered normally. As if two Varun's were not enough, both girls behave as puppets, only dancing to his tunes. Tapsee Pannu was comparitively less irritating,but her mom? She was happy when Varun's character forcedly kissed her daughter. And that idiot doctor, even his name(Surname) is a hindi expletive and he spoke that in an ugly manner. Can it get any cheaper than this?\n\nJokes are terrible. Varun Dhawan in an emotional mood says, 'Ammi jaan kehti thi,... Chittian Kalaian ve'. Who writes dialogues like this. Atleast half of the jokes are sexual.\n\nCensor board can cut a few swear words matching the situation from Masaan, but they allow disgusting films like Judwaa 2 for some reason."

Varun dhawan did a very nice job acting in a double role film his comic timing was amazing and also Jacqueline Fernandez did a really good job and her comedy was much better than in A Gentleman, Tapsee Paanu hands down she did a really good job specially in a comedy movie which she hasn't done. I would really recommend this movie your going to laugh a lot if you like comedy, action, and romantic movies."

Yes the movie 'borrows' gags from other comedy/drama flicks, but I thought these running jokes enhanced the plot! Raja is probably the BEST character next to Anupam Kher's Bakshi."

Varun Dhawan is a great performer, both on the acting front and the dancing front, and has a strong screen presence. The film is quite silly, so leave your seriousness at the door before coming in.
