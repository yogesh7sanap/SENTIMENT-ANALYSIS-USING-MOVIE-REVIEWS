        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" was made and shelved for two years....a clear sign that the studio knew they had a box office bomb on their hands. The picture ended up costing $100,000,000 to make and earned back only a little over $11,000,000 worldwide! Because of this, it's the biggest financial disaster in film history. However, after seeing it I realized that is not that bad...even if it is on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...and has a horrid overall score of 3,8!!\n\nAll this being said, I don't think it's really that bad a film. I think the problem, more than anything else, was that according to some sources, the star, Eddie Murphy, really burned a lot of bridges while making this film...insisting on re-writes and overruling the director repeatedly. And, it seems that the studio got sick of him and the controversy...and word of this leaked out and killed the movie. And, so, as often happens with movies like \"Gigli\", people just start getting on the bandwagon...and heap tons of hate on the picture. However, after seeing it, I thought the movie was actually not bad. Would I pay to go see it? No. Would I pay to rent it? No. But if it was available to see for free on TV, then it's worth seeing.\n\nSo apart from its horrible reputation, there is one big problme with the film....it's not a comedy. Now perhaps it was intended as one....but there isn't a laugh in the story and it's more an unusual action/adventure film....and I can enjoy it on that level. It also doesn't help that it's very obvious that the film was written and re-written and edited and re-edited...with entire story lines dropped and inexplicably so!\n\nThe story is set in the future ...a future when the moon is colonized and is a nice place to live...unless you are Pluto. This is because some mobsters want to take his successful nightclub...and they offer him a fraction of what it's worth. He rejects their offer...and they almost immediately blow the place up and try to kill him. Most of the film consists of Pluto and his companions (Rosario Dawson and Randy Quaid...who plays a robot) on the run until the final boss battle.\n\nSo what did I like about it? Well, the film looks nice for 2002 with decent special effects, costumes and CGI. Compared to today's CGI it's kinda shabby...but that is to be expected after 17 years...technology simply improves and improves over time. Also, the story isn't terrible and the acting is generally decent.\n\nSo, on whole, the story just isn't funny, parts are obviously missing due to hack editing and re-writes but it looks good and isn't annoying or hellish....like a Bottom 100 film should be. Watchable.\n\nBy the way, a couple final comments. First, I saw a review which said that they 'laughed from start to finish'. I can only assume this person laughs at ANYTHING....funerals, dramas, Coke commercials, etc....as the film simply isn't funny and doesn't look at all like a comedy. Second, it's become in fashion to hate Eddie Murphy in recent years. While he has had some serious box office stinkers, he's STILL amazingly talented. See \"Dreamgirls\" or \"Bowfinger\" and you'll know what I mean. But I also think he'd benefit from realizing that he alone cannot make a great film...it takes teamwork and a good script."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's maybe one laugh (if you're lucky) in this universally-panned disaster, but that doesn't mean THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH is a complete loss. Eddie Murphy is the title character, a reformed felon operating the most successful club in the \"Little America\" part of the Moon. But after he turns down an offer to sell to a shyster for $10 million, the laser bullets begin flying in his direction. Now he and gal pal Rosario Dawson, along with robot bodyguard Randy Quaid, are on the run.\n\nMurphy is generally appealing, but his comic touch just doesn't jive with the sci-fi environment. The plot is at times incoherent and suffers from trying to roll comedy, action and excitement all into one. It's kind of amazing this clunker ever made it beyond the idea phase, particularly with talents such as Murphy and director Ron Underwood (CITY SLICKERS) involved.\n\nWhat does PLUTO NASH have going for it? Though it's supposed to be a comedy, it actually works to some degree as a sci-fi adventure. The massive $100 million budget and futuristic setting make for some interesting visuals. And the picture moves along at a fair pace, with a tidy running time of 95 minutes.\n\nFor all its flaws, I would not use the term \"boring\" to describe PLUTO NASH. Hollywood has done much better, but it's also done far worse."

One thing I would like to say is that just in resent times (the last 4 month (date Nov, 27, 2005)) I can name 2 movies that were worse BY FAR!! Stealth and JarHead have to be 2 of the worse movies that I have ever seen. Anyways, I do see some of the points that people have made about this movie. I grew up in the 70's and 80's and like some one said this would have been a better success then. My main point is if I were to judge this move on the basis of the movies I have seen in the last year or so I would have given it a 8 out of 10."

I know my doom is coming soon, I cannot prevent it, and there is only one certainty: This film can only do harm."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is just another example of the continuing downward spiral of Eddie Murphy's once exciting career. Murphy will always have scripts handed to him and he'll always be working in films but the once edgy comedian has lost his edge a long time ago. This story takes place in the future where Earth has populated the Moon and a former smuggler named Pluto Nash (Murphy) takes over a nightclub from a friend and Nash makes it a big success and moneymaker. A young woman and aspiring singer named Dina Lake (Rosario Dawson) asks for a job but all Nash gives her is the opportunity to waitress. Some mobsters have been buying up the local business's and they want Nash's club but he won't sell. So they blow the place up and try to kill him but Nash, Dina and a robot named Bruno (Randy Quaid) escape and the mobsters try and find him. This film was directed by Ron Underwood who is usually reliable with lightweight comedy like this but this film fails from the outset. The special effects are adequate but not overly impressive. Many of the scenes are clearly filmed on a soundstage and in one shot Underwood resorts to actors being hoisted by wires for the gravity effect. Didn't they stop doing that in the 60's? And poor Randy Quaid has to play a horny and overly sensitive robot. Were we really suppose to find it amusing that he tries to get it on with other robots? But the big flaw comes from Murphy himself. This once exciting comedian use to be so reliable for edgy performances but here he plays his character totally straight. As you watch this you keep waiting for Murphy to say something witty and off the cuff but it never happens. It looks like Murphy has decided to try and be an action star or be the romantic lead. Murphy has become boring to watch and its sad to watch his films now. Pam Grier pops up as Murphy's mother but she has nothing to do. She has maybe two scenes and then she runs off (Literally). This film wastes opportunities and the script has nothing new to offer. Along with Murphy's boring and drab performance this film was dead on arrival!"

        "review_detailed_main": "And to think my all-time fav genre is sci-fi comedy! Here's a prime textbook case at how not to do one.\n\nIt's a comedy with only a microscopic trace of humor, a sci-fi that really could just have easily been set in present-day Earth with no sci-fi elements at all, and an action film that contains only the standard D-grade action story setups and climaxes - and done at a lackadaisical by-the numbers contract-delivery pace.\n\nThe only element that has the slight bit of remote interest is Randy Quaid as a rather quirky bodyguard robot. At least it's an interesting exercise at how to play a totally fanciful out-of-this world concept with no real-life equivalent. Yeah - the sort of role that your standard modern drama school graduate would be scratching their heads trying to get a grip on; and your academic drama scholar would be tearing their hair out till they looked like Homer Simpson over the fact \"its not the type of role -or story for that matter- that has any credibility or truth to the human experience\" (blah blah!) The fact that he is even a tiny bit watchable in that deserves a bit of a finger-clap - maybe.\n\nIt could have been so much better - a few puppet-type aliens hanging around, a bit more showing of the light gravity bits, a dig at your serious Arthur C Clarke space drama like MOONDUST - anything at all to make this remotely interesting as a cinema experience - or even a storyline.\n\nBut what we actually get is the real sort of movie that the conservative critics have accused all summer-style movies of being: brainless formulaic uncreative popcorn entertainment plying to the lowest common denominator that is churned out when the bloated Hollywood studio system is working on autopilot.\n\nActually - this is the movie that makes the normal summer blockbuster movies look like works of literary genius. The critics should have been aware of the old saying: \"Be careful what you wish for - you just might get it.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "See a lot of guys giving this a one out of ten, not really fair I feel. To me there are lots of worse movies in all categories. But that said - it's not a top notch movie.\n\nI've never been a fan of director Ron Underwood - he might be decent for TV but features aren't his strong side in my opinion. You'll notice best when it comes to the comedy parts (the attempts I should say) and the actions sequences.\n\nAs for comedy, the directing does nothing to enhance the seemingly weak script. Since comedy seems to be what this movie was to be about and the pace seems intended to be rather fast - maybe they should have gone for a director who could make something out of it? The action sequences are incredibly lame. It resembles grown people playing war without saying \"pow pow\". Here the director's at a loss as well, which shows in sequences as when Randy Quaid's robot character is taking out his two canons for guns. I take it, this is supposed to be a \"cool\" shot but the angle of camera, timing and pace makes it about as cool as when your dad hangs up his coat upon returning home from work.\n\nThe budget ($100 million allegedly) didn't seem to be a problem and the special effects as well as the sets seem pretty well done, along with a pretty nice cast (even tiny sub-minute parts are mostly done by actors you at least recognize). This must be seen as further critique of the director, since he seemed to have all the necessary tools at hand.\n\nThe actors put in from a half-hearted to a decent effort. A lot of great character actors (Joe Pantoliano) didn't get enough space to be interesting and there is a lot of untapped comedy resource in both Jay Mohr and Eddie Murphy. Though it has to be said \u0096 Pam Grier put in what has to be her worst performance ever as the mother of Eddie Murphy's character. One you can always trust to give his spirit is Luis Guzm\u00e1n, and he doesn't disappoint in this one either.\n\nAll in all I would say there was a weak script to start with, that grew even weaker when it was handed to a director that couldn't handle the sort of comedy it was supposed to be, nor the action it was supposed to contain. Probably actors underachieved, especially in the comedy department, due to this directing. The end result was nor a comedy, nor an action \u0096 simply a bleak sci-fi that was one of the biggest net-losses in movie history if I got it right. My guess is that the guys at Warner Brothers probably are killing themselves for not picking a more suitable director."

        "review_detailed_main": "3.7. A 3.7 out of 10. As I sit here, writing this review, this film has a user-average rating of 3.7 out of 10. I'm going out on a limb here, and assume that there are many people who blindly voted low scores to bring down the rating, based solely on the negative publicity. Because, I honestly can't believe that they all witnessed the same film I did. (Not to mention, mass negative voting from people who haven't seen the film is a problem here for movies with hype or notoriety.)\n\nI knew the story, I heard about it all. The film was shelved for two years, didn't get much publicity, and was released August of 2002. Releasing a major comedy with a huge budget 2 years after completion, with little publicity on almost the exact date of the 1-year anniversary of one of the biggest tragedies to ever hit the US... Seriously, did the studio even think when they tried to push this film out? I can only assume not. Critics crucified it. Audiences ignored it. It was a flop.\n\nI went along, blindly following the notion that because it flopped, it sucked. (Although, I have found out that many great films flopped, among them \"It's a Wonderful Life.\") Finally a few months ago, a friend of mine said: \"Hey Adam, let's watch 'Pluto Nash'! It's on NetFlix!\" I scoffed, but after he persisted, I agreed.\n\nI'm glad I did.\n\n\"Pluto Nash\" was refreshingly entertaining, and in no way was it the abysmal slight against cinema I had been told it was.\n\nThe film centers on Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy in a fun performance), his sidekick robot Bruno (Randy Quaid in perhaps my favorite performance in the film) and Dina Lake (the astonishingly beautiful Rosario Dawson), with numerous other actors in supporting roles. Nash is the owner the nightclub \"Club Nash\", on the moon, some time in the future. He bought the club to save the life of a friend (Jay Mohr), who has since become a famous \"singer\" in a snazzy upscale part of the moon, leaving Nash behind. Dina arrives, hoping to work for Nash in order to earn money to buy her way back to Earth.\n\nSoon, henchmen sent by the mysterious Rex Crater arrive, interested in buying Nash's club. When Nash turns them down, they destroy the place. Nash, Dina and Bruno vow to discover who this Rex Carter is, and stop him.\n\nAnd so begins this fun action/comedy/sci-fi feature. In all honesty, the story is clich\u00e9, but it actually works quite well. This isn't supposed to be a revolutionary masterpiece, it's meant to be a fun good-guys-VS-bad-guys-buddy-movie type film, only set on the moon in the future. The characters are quite endearing and likable as well. They feel like people you'd want to hang out with.\n\nThe special effects (which were unfairly criticized at the time) are surprisingly good, considering they were from 2000 (remember, the film was finished but shelved for two years), and the direction of Ron Underwood is quite nice. Visually, the film is a treat.\n\nThe cast works. Murphy, Dawson and Quaid are all great in their roles, and supporting characters are played very well by some big names, such as Peter Boyle, Pam Greir, Burt Young and even a cameo by Alec Baldwin.\n\nThe music is fun, the editing is great, the set design is exquisite, the acting is generally very good, the direction is fantastic, the story is decent enough. I really can't say much. The craftsmanship is very competent. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination from any conceivable way you look at it. Is it a particularly strong film? No. But is it a halfway decent film with some laughs and some heart? Yes, it is most definitely. I also admire the fact that this film isn't ashamed of being light-hearted and positive. A lot of films (especially these days) try to be dark and gritty. It's nice to see just a positive, fun film.\n\nI honestly can't understand how this was so hated by critics upon release, and so ignored by the general public. It's a very fun movie, and I had a blast watching it. I will gladly be buying this flick sometime soon, and sharing it with others, so they can finally see this treat they missed out on.\n\nI give \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" a good 7 out of 10. It's lighthearted fun."

It's a non offensive, straight forward sci-fi comedy that doesn't require any deeper understanding or intellectual delving.\n\nThere's no deeper meaning here than some funny people having an adventure on a future moon city. You could do a lot worse with your time than to sit back, turn off your brain for an hour and just enjoy the show.\n\nHonestly this is one of my go to movies for multitasking, something funny on in the background that doesn't require my 100% attention to still make me laugh while I'm doing other things. And it ends up getting watched more often than some of the \"better\" movies that I would rate at 10 simply because those are often a chore to watch and require actually thinking to understand them.\n\nYes if you understood that correctly: I do enjoy a deeper movie and would rate them higher, but it's also not what I would typically grab from day to day when I just want to laugh while getting through the grind: The Adventures of Pluto Nash \"is\"."

Certainly anyone expecting a movie where Eddie Murphy makes faces, laughs like a horse and tells immature vulgar jokes is indeed in for a sore disappointment, as this film gracefully lacks all those clich\u00e9s. In fact all kind of humour is scarce, jokes are few and far between and -- frankly -- vacuous at best. However, The Adventures of Pluto Nash is not half-bad as a sci-fi adventure. Effects are quite nice, and although the script does not blow one's mind with innovativeness, it keeps the story flowing fluently with no dead moments. 7/10."

It was 3's Company type action, with many bug-eyed looks at other characters, pratfalls, ludicrous plot holes, and juvenile humour. There are no redeeming qualities at all in this movie apart from the set design. It is really sad that a studio would waste that kind of money (100 mil) on garbage like this when the set could have been put to much better use.\n\nThere are very few highlights, one in particular involving John Cleese as an automated chauffeur. But that is about it. All of the cast members are wasted in this lackluster effort, including Eddie Murphy himself. He has proved he can carry a film (Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, Trading Places), but it has been a long time since he has appeared in anything decent. This could have been it, however the director went for a 3 Stooges approach instead of a much grittier and darker 48 Hours. If this movie had any of 48 Hours grit, or BHC's humour, it might have been halfway decent. Instead it is nothing more than smarmy, predictable, dull, and annoying. The fight between the Murphys at the end was very well done graphically, it wasn't possible to determine exactly how they did it (Murphy fights himself), except of course it was the type of fight that would have been more at home in an Ernest movie. All the special effects are therefore completely wasted, along with the 100 mil some studio sunk into this dog. What were they thinking? 2/10 (I gave an additional point for the sets, NOT for the movie)"

Eddie, please, we need a good movie from you soon, I'm sure the only reason they decided to release this was due to your outstanding performance in \"Shrek\", now that was a good movie.

Rather, this movie is a sci-fi-special-effects laden comedy that isn't funny, has no plot, no character development and less than impressive special effects (actually this would be a great stupid kids movie if it wasn't for the language as there aren't enough movies out there for stupid kids). There are moments where its entertaining and I enjoyed some of the banter as well as some of the effects, but the sum was far less than the parts. The one scene that I laughed at was when Jay Mohr was explaining his escape plan to Eddie, one of the dumbest escape plans in the history of bad escape plans, and Eddie just looks at him like he's a moron, not looking away for what seemed a solid 60 seconds. This joke took time to set up and someone talented to pull it off. Eddie is still talented in that he knows comedy and what can make people laugh. But for some time now all he has done are movies that are less interested in taking the time to make the joke work and more interested with throwing as much slightly amusing trash-talk at the audience as they can in 120 minutes and hope enough sticks to call itself a good comedy. If its on HBO and its raining and nothing else is on, watch and kill two hours. or don't. you wont miss much."

The visual side of the film is occasionally spectacular but nothing can overcome the increasingly frequent hollywoodian syndrome of having scripts and dialogs that look as if they were written by drunken apes, I mean zero intelligence, zero subtlety, zero coherence all amounting to one gigantic mess of half baked concepts that never gel into anything resembling a decent film.\n\nTo top it off for an action comedy the action part is feeble at best and the least said about the jokes the better(oh the endless horny robot jokes).

        "review_detailed_main": "Pluto Nash: Spaced-out junk Shallow plot and boring dialogue fail to impress\n\nDirected by Ron Underwood, The Adventures of Pluto Nash bears some resemblance to the 1960's cartoon, The Jetsons. While Pluto Nash has an impressive cast, including Eddie Murphy, Randy Quaid, Jay Mohr, Pam Grier, and Alec Baldwin in a cameo appearance, it lacks good writing. In fact, a rerun of The Jetsons would be more entertaining.\n\nThe year is 2087, on the moon, in a full gravity town called Little Americ a. Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy) plays an ex-con turned nightclub owner. The local mob offers to buy Pluto's successful club (`Club Nash'), but after he refuses to sell, the mob blows up the joint, and the chase begins. Pluto and his beautiful waitress/singer Dina Lake (Rosario Dawson), and his Robot (Randy Quaid) are chased by the gangsters, while they try to find and confront Rex Crater, the head of the mob.\n\nPluto's attitude-filled but hilarious mother (Pam Grier) could have added some more humorous moments to the movie, but she only appeared in a few minor scenes.\n\nRandy Quaid, (Bruno the bald-headed Robot), is not nearly as funny as his other witty characters of past movies (my all time favorite - Cousin Eddy- National Lampoon's Vacation movies). His performance was adequate, but repetitive lines and tired jokes got old very quickly.\n\nThe only scenes that made me snicker were the ones that featured the goofy, 1950-ish B-movie spacesuits. They reminded me of sci-fi parodies from Mystery Science Theater 3000, and Spaceballs.\n\nThe genre for this film says comedy/action/sci-fi. If this is so, then it's a comedy that has no funny jokes, action that has cheesy scenes, and a sci-fi with untasteful and unrealistic effects.\n\nThe uncreative and lame scenes seem to jump around with confusing transitions, giving the feeling that there was some serious cutting going on in the editing room.\n\nRon Underwood, (Tremors and City Slickers) didn't have much of a story to work with, however, there were some clever sight gags. For instance, Hilary Clinton's mug showing up on a $10,000 bill, Trump buildings, and a frozen dog that can be thawed in a microwave. Writer Neil Cuthbert, (Mystery Men and Hocus Pocus), could have taken his futuristic story line, and created the funniest movie of the summer; however, on film the story was `lost in space'. Having said that, it makes sense that Warner Brothers shelved this project for two years after filming.where it should have stayed.\n\nThere is no doubt that this would have been a hit in the 70's and 80's, but in 2002, its simply dated!\n\nExpect to find Pluto Nash on the $1.99 clearance table at your local video store very soon.\n\nRated PG-13 for violence, sexual humor and language. Running Time is 95 minutes."

There were moments of action, but it wasn't pushed to the point of being cool, just the few moments of very generic gun fire. So this wasn't an action movie.

It was incredibly underdeveloped and no suspense was built up as things were supposedly \"revealed.\" So this wasn't a mystery. So then what was it?

The product sucks big time.\n\nPluto Nash is an awful comedy. Behind the polished and fine-looking surface there\u00b4s a crappy movie that wants to be so much, but ends up being a total flop. When Eddie Murphy\u00b4s good he\u00b4s really good (\"the Nutty Professor\", \"Bowfinger\"), but when he\u00b4s awful he really sucks (\"Pluto Nash\", \"Metro\"). I haven\u00b4t seen \"I Spy\" or \"Showtime\" yet, but being a movie fan I know those two considerably big movies flopped as well. Poor Eddie has now scored three back-to-back flops which isn\u00b4t a good thing in Hollywood.\n\nThe (Horrible) Adventures Of Pluto Nash is said to be a comedy, but I didn\u00b4t find myself laughing while watching the movie. On the contrary. Few amusing lines don\u00b4t make a comedy and even good actors can\u00b4t be funny if the script and the characters are simply not funny. Even John Cleese has a small part in this turkey... How on earth did they get him aboard? All the cast members can do a lot better, I presume they all just lost their judgment for a minute when signing to do Pluto Nash. That can be forgiven with time and a lot smaller salaries for their next projects would be a suitable punishment.\n\nPluto Nash takes place in the Moon and that would actually be the only correct place for a movie like this: far from the civilization and fans of good movies."

It just might be the worst value for money though, with a reported budget topping 100M and a box-office of less than 5 it makes Jonah Hex look like a wise investment. But despite this it is more sad than bad.\n\nI can't possibly see where they thought the laughs were going to come from\u0085 I can't fathom which parts were supposed to be entertaining\u0085 Worst of all I can't really see where the money was spent\u0085\n\nI just sincerely hope it wasn't Randy Quaid's salary.\n\nPluto Nash was made by the same guy that made Tremors which is the inverse if Pluto Nash, a low budget / high entertainment affair that is remembered fondly by all that have seen it. Pluto Nash wants to be quirky, cool, edgy, funky and hip but is really none of these things.\n\nIt is 2080 and the Moon has been made hospitable for humans. Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy) is the guy who everyone on Earth's satellite adores \u2013 except the bad guys who want to force him to sell his bumpin' club to them.\n\nAfter a run in leaves his club a smouldering pile of rubble (like this film) Nash sets off with waitress Dana (Rosario Dawson \u2013 who obviously spent her paycheck on implants after filming ended) and his faithful robot Bruno (Randy Quaid).\n\nThe trio traverse the moon trying to lay low out of the gunsights of the bad guys while working towards finding who is ultimately responsible for their situation. Along the way they encounter many recognisable faces that add nothing to the film, Jay Mohr, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier, John Cleese and Alec Baldwin among others.\n\nI think the aim was for Nash to be cool and likable, Dana the cute love interest and Bruno the comic relief. All fail. As does everything else in the film.\n\nBut again Pluto Nash is as harmless as it is pointless, unlike the braincell shattering Tank Girl it made me want to sleep more than vomit \u2013 admittedly neither is an endorsement for the film \u2013 but the issue remains how could something cost so much look so ordinary?\n\nNow I know how the Miami Heat must feel.\n\nA big budget light comedy set on the moon and featuring its own fading star in Murphy was never going to be a big hit. This can't be the fault of director Ron Underwood but the big-wigs who greenlit it and opened the coffers. The absolute ceiling for this film was Demolition Man, itself decidedly average. The floor was Tank Girl, which Pluto managed to avoid but just barely.\n\nNow you tell me; is a ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR investment worth making for a film that at best could end up mediocre?\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 3.5 / 10. Pluto Nash sucks, but it is isn't the end of the world\u0085 unless you happened to be the one who covered the budget."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a sci-fi/action/comedy starring Eddie Murphy (who kinda sleepwalks through his role) as a nightclub owner on the moon who winds up running from the mob, who wants to turn his club into a casino. Th storyline is really rather silly and pointless and the performances range from dreadful (Murphy, Joe Pantoliano as a mob henchman) to embarassing (Randy Quaid as a robot!) to almost decent (Rosario Dawson as the love interest, Jay Mohr as a lounge singer). For a comedy, the jokes are few and far between, with only Quaid's impossibly bad performance and hamming providing any kinda of humor. The action pieces are also kinda weak.. On the plus side however, the film looks great. The production team did a fabulous job of creating the future world of the moon and they throw in a lot of nice little jokes into the sets that those bored with the main story might enjoy. The visual effects are also impressive, for the most part. So you could enjoy the film on a technical standpoint. It isnt an awful movie and is certainly watchable but it is not very good either. GRADE: D+"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had expected Eddie Murphy and Randy Quaid to deliver outstanding performances in this movie since they are both experienced talented comic actors, wrong. Instead I was more impressed by the performance of Jacynthe Rene' who played Babette the french robot maid. Her performance reminded me of the creative performers of Cirque' du Solei, who use actions rather than words to entertain. Although,her performance consits mostly of dropping her feather duster, bending over, and saying \"Oops\", it is the most entertaing part of the movie i.m.h.o. The worst part of the movie, Jay Mohr trying to perform as a Frank Sinatra lounge singer. So 3 stars for Jacynthe Rene' and and 1 star for the special effects of the movie. Watch this movie only if you receive a free movie coupon, enjoy campy sci-fi jokes, or are passionate for french maids."

Add to it some of the lamest jokes ever exposed to celluloid since Carrot-Top and many eye-gouging, sleep-inducing twists and we have here a total disaster.

Playing Frank Sinatra was also adorable, love the touch and the hole robot theme. The music is just great too, I love the sound track! If I would sum this movie with one word it would be \"Happy\" because that's how I felt after seeing it! =D Only negative would be the story as a hole but I figure it's made for everyone including a young public and a bit predictable but other then that there's nothing I can complain about."

As it stands, it's still better than most teen-oriented drivel coming out.\n\nKudos to Randy Quaid, who's about the only one entirely believable in his role (and to think he had the toughest part!). Eddie Murphy does an OK job, but its clear his best part is as a character actor, or someone a little more interesting (like Jay Mohr's character). Easily a 6, and I'll probably vote a 7 just to balance out those cast votes to movies sight-unseen."

Part camp, part thriller, part adventure, part comedy, part sci-fi, part action part romance... and it still amounts to nothing.\n\nEverything just falls flat, and when you see the result you can't help wondering what the actors were thinking as they acted out their scenes. Obviously, it must have been a case of monetary issues - and there's nothing wrong with making money, but it doesn't make it a good, or even entertaining film.\n\nEddie Murphy seems determined to ruin his career with utter crap like this. I mean, here we have a film that decides to take time out from the action to let the audience gawk at a french maid robot getting gradually undressed. If only the same level of attention had been given to the script as to the aforementioned robot's knickers and bra, then maybe it would have been less pointless. Still, the music was kind of catchy... [1/10]"

        "review_detailed_main": "Which came first Independence Day or The Adventures of Pluto Nash? Independence Day was released six years before Pluto Nash. The connection between the two? James Rebhorn appeared in both. Seeing him looking younger in Pluto Nash than he did in ID added to my sense that Pluto Nash was a late 80s or early 90s film. It just has that look and feel to it. Pluto Nash resembles 1986's Howard the Duck more than its 2002 brethren Star Wars Episode II, Lord of the Rings II, Spider Man, or MIB II (which also included Rosario Dawson). The reason that Pluto Nash seems out of place is that its genesis came in the mid-80s. For some reason, no one stuck a fork in it. Going into production 15 years (in 2000) after its conception is odd to say the least. The mid-80s were not the early 2000s. What might have been entertaining in 1985 wasn't so in 2002. The 80s were just a very different time. Pluto Nash has such an 80s feel to it that I distinctly remember watching it repeatedly on HBO while in my apartment. The thing is, I had moved from that apartment in 1988. Freaky false memory, huh? Other 80s features of Pluto Nash are its dialog, sets, coloration, and special effects. Cheesy is the word that describes the general feel of Pluto Nash. What perplexes me is that this movie cost about $125 million dollars. I could not see anything or any combination of things in Pluto Nash that should have added up to $125 million. A fifth of that? A fourth of that? Maybe. Maybe Eddie Murphy made a killing with his salary. Maybe Warner Brothers worked with the federales to funnel cash to the NSA, and Pluto Nash really cost only $1 million to make. The extra $124 million would buy a lot of flash drives.\n\nAs cheesy and unbelievably expensive as this movie is, it is still moderately entertaining. Eddie Murphy (who hit his stride in the 80s and probably peaked just before this movie) is an entertainer through and through. I can't think of many roles where I haven't felt good from watching him work. (Delirious is one funny standup performance with him in that red leather jumpsuit and all.) Rosario Dawson spent a lot of the movie doing nothing but looking cute, and she excelled in that. (She's another performer who seldom disappoints.) Randy Quaid made a good performance as an outdated android. The part didn't have much depth or opportunities, but he scored some of the movie's best lines. All of the humor in Pluto Nash was subtle. Very subtle, but there nonetheless.\n\nPluto Nash is a good movie to have on as background stimulus. Maybe at a family holiday gathering when the movie is secondary."

But, there are certainly much worse movies that have been made like the Italian Job, but watching Pluto Nash, I never wanted to turn it off and watch a blank screen instead. Critics be damned, this is a good movie to watch on a rainy day. I wouldn't say to make a sequel, but the premise was solid, the lead actors good, the visuals excellent, but there is just a lack in general direction in the movie, but each scene is fun to watch. Give it a chance, don't expect a lot, and enjoy."

I hate it because it is for me simply not funny and wastes a cast that I think are talented and deserve better.\n\nGranted the special effects are elaborate and really quite good and I did like the music, however that is all I have to say that was good. Don't get me wrong I do like Eddie Murphy and his films, Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, Trading Places and Shrek and classics and I liked Coming to America and Bowfinger too.\n\nHowever, when it comes to talking about his films, the only movie of his I consider worse than Pluto Nash is the atrocity that is Norbit. Murphy is a funny and likable actor, but he is very bland here. He does make too much of an effort to stop his character from being bland and ends up over-compensating.\n\nThe rest of the cast are wasted. John Cleese phones in, Pam Grier is saddled with tired material and sadly it comes through loud and clear in her performance and Rosario Dawson struggles with a clich\u00e9d character in the form of a wannabe singer. Worst of all is Randy Quaid, who not only has some of the film's worst dialogue and gags but his performance is just awful.\n\nThe cast are not helped by a truly tired and unfunny script, lazy direction from Ron Underwood(was it really the director of Tremors and City Slickers?) and a rushed and predictable story that is filled with poor characters and trite and disconnected scenes.\n\nSo in conclusion, a very poor film and one of Murphy's worst films. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

Unfortunately it brought out their weakness as stars making this movie truly worthwhile for the barnfire! (I laughed twice - once at a Randy Quad line, and once at a John Cleese line.)\n\n-Z"

I find it difficult to say where this went wrong. The best I can figure is that it is stuck between a sci-fi movie and a comedy, and in doing so it fails at both. The comedy is not strong enough to support the movie. And the sci-fi is likewise not strong enough to keep the viewer's attention. Many people praise the sci-fi aspect of the movie, but part of the problem is that the attempts at comedy tend to detract from creating a true sci-fi tenor. For example, Quaid's performance is decent as a comedic part, but he is just goofy and so it's difficult to take the plot or the movie seriously. By comparison, Total Recall has some comedic parts, but they are effective and brief enough to not affect the sci-fi tenor. On the other hand, something like Spaceballs (or Dark Star) doesn't take itself too seriously and works as a comedy. Perhaps another matter is that we have high expectations for Eddie Murphy, and thus we are more critical of his work. Also, perhaps we have seen and heard his mannerisms so many times that the humor has worn off (e.g. Eddie's classic laugh)."

Well, the film has a very polished look about it. Although some of the moon scenes had a Total Recall look to them. The background artists were quite stilted and didn't look at all 'natural'. Back to the film. There was not much to the film. Characterisations were very simplistic, and the 'robots' were very curious in their presentation. It was quite a violent film, and what there was did not appear as comedic violence. One of the villains was especially ugly in a fashion which I suspect was comedic - cross eyes, curious gate etc. Murphy didn't add anything at all to a fairly limp script, and the Nash character was hard to pin down. There were a number of car chases 'on the moon', one featuring John Cleese, but any comedic angle to this went over my head. The end was very light - seeming to lack any sense of threat/urgency/difficult job well done etc. All in all, this was a poor film with what seemed high production costs but had neither any sense of originality, urgency or character empathy. All in all, it just seems boring."

The primary problem with this film is that its characters are miscast and this places the entire burden of the film on the writers. The premise and sets and the atmosphere they created were great, but the miscast girl-next-door character opposite Murphy did to provide him with enough of a straight-woman to launch his comic talent. Randy Quaid was miscast as the robot. He's too tall and imposing to be a subservient geeky robot. Although there were some good moments, he has no comic delivery or timing-especially for the kind of quick-witted comic style of Murphy. Substitute a Robin Williams, Steve Martin or Jim Carrey type for the robot, make the robot gay with a unrequited love interest in Murphy, and then, finally, dump the trite and time worn clone idea and make Quaid the Howard Hughes villain. Much much better. Next, the Frank Sinatra character. Very good idea but the guy couldn't sing and looked like a grocery clerk. Get someone who can sing, wear a fedora, drape a sport jacket over his shoulder, and do the Las Vegas thing.\n\nIn short, the film had mega opportunities to comically exploit hilarious stereotypes in a creative setting but then completely and mysteriously missed the boat. And it looked like Eddie Murphy knew, as he was almost reluctantly reciting this lines, that the movie was going to be a flop. Five out of 10."

It's got an amiable performance from Eddie Murphy, plus amusing support from Randy Quaid, Luis Guzman, and John Cleese. And, even though they're given little to do, it's good to see Peter Boyle, Burt Young and Pam Grier working. I though the cluttered design of the film, which reminded me a bit of Matt Groening's \"Futurama\", was well done, and I was pleasantly surprised that the design team and special effects team got most, but not all, of the sci-fi-geek details right (they still included an audible explosion in a vacuum). All in all, it's not a great movie, maybe not even a good one, but it's certainly not a bad one."

When people are outside in space suits, they float around in slow motion, but when they're inside, everything behaves like they're on Earth.\n\nThere are lots of cameos, from Pam Grier to John Cleese, and they all looked like they waited for the check to clear before showing up and lazily reading their parts.

It was very silly; we were laughing pretty often, which is always a good sign. Eddie Murphy once again showed his command of both comedy and action, giving us a performance that, though not Oscar-worthy, was nonetheless very enjoyable. There were several interesting casting choices, of which I heartily approved. Randy Quaid was very odd but very funny as Bruno, the bodyguard robot; Joe Pantoliano looked odd with hair and a mustache; and Alec Baldwin had an uncredited cameo which was classic Baldwin. All in all, a good time for a relaxing Friday evening."

Is it a great movie? No. Not by a long shot. But it's watchable. Which is more than I can say about some of his other movies for sure.\n\nRosario Dawson was just fine in this, and as attractive as ever. Randy Quaid...well he got screwed here. His character was awful. They definitely could've done something there."

This movie is fun, not fantastically funny, but entertaining. Kind of a cross between The Fifth Element and The Milagro Bean Field Wars. Visually, big screen presence reminiscent of Total Recall. Go in planning not to like it, and you will probably end up buying it on previously viewed DVD or video someday."

This movie is nothing special, but it isn't the worst movie ever, either. I don't think there are a lot of people who could love this movie, but I don't think it entirely deserves its horrible reputation either. It features some of the best parodies on modern world, and a decent amount of talented actors: Eddie Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Joe Pantoliano, Pam Grier, John Cleese... John Cleese surprised me actually, I didn't expect to like his character, since I usually don't like him, but was really a great parody of the British butler/chauffeur stereotype. It has a normal amount of Eddie Murphy's typical humor, and that is pretty much what one can expect of any of his films. This is not Eddies best film, but by no means his worst either. Big fans of Eddie Murphy might like this, or people who love sci-fi comedy. As this is *slightly* above average, I gave it a 6/10."

It actually got painful near the end.\n\nJohn Cleese phoned in his performance from a studio in Shepperton. Randy Quaid and Peter Boyle, among others, soiled themselves. Rosario Dawson comes off best in this mess. She can actually act plus she's super-hot. Oh, and noted mouthy leftyst Alex Baldwin provided the only genuinely funny moment playing a mob blowhard. I esp enjoyed when he shoved the cameraman down the stairs.\n\nMurphy deserved the Razzie for the movie, and the Razzie of the Decade they handed him at the end of the Oughts. I'd like to think this is his worst movie but let's be honest, he's made some of the worst movies of the past 25 years. This garbage stands out because it lost so much of the studio's money. I assume it got released only so that the writeoffs could be legally claimed."

For being on Mars in the future they should have had more cool technology. More creativity. The plot is down right simple. You can tell they were trying to go for a Fifth Element, Total Recall, Judge Dredd feel, but the movie lacked in the creativity those films had.\n\nThe movie is still fun. And Eddie Murphy is great as always. Lots of good faces. And there are a few jokes that might make you chuckle. I loved the robot guy. He was my favorite character in the whole thing. The only one with a memorable personality. And the robot jokes were awesome. But overall the movie is very simple, very toned down for a futuristic film Not a lot to it. They toned Eddie Murphy and his funniness down too much. And didn't give the gorgeous Dina Lake much of a role. Not much grit to it and not cheesy enough to be a comedy."

I'll have to admit I thought it was Terry O'Quinn (\"Lost\": John Locke), which made even funnier at the time, but it's a good job done.\n\nHonestly, Eddie Murphy and Rosario Dawson feel a little big for their roles, but the story is good: a former smuggler turns legitimate business owner has to find the mob boss behind the people trying to kill him.\n\nWhile I do think this is an average movie, it is solid, and I don't think I would go changing a lot to it. I could see a couple versions of a reboot, but in 2020, they'd probably put it in the MCU."

Sure, The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a notorious bomb, a devastating box office debacle and a frequently bashed film in general. But guess what? I loved every second of it.\n\nCall me a masochist, but sometime during mid to late 2003 I decided to locate and watch all of this decades' biggest cinematic flops \u0096 just to see if they were really that bad, or perhaps they were just poorly released with zero studio back up. After literally puking my guts out upon watching such horrors like Battlefield Earth (ugh) or Gigli (barf), I finally stumbled upon the Summer 2002 misfire that is Eddie Murphy's The Adventures of Pluto Nash. What I feared would become another celluloid travesty at first, slowly turned out to be a fun, campy and harmless sci-fi ride, with neat special f/x, imaginative settings (you can easily notice that someone put a lot of thought into this) and hilarious dialogs all packed into one. So OK, it's hardly a masterpiece, but I oddly found myself watching it again and again, until I finally purchased the damn thing on DVD.\n\nThe playful plot is set in a future where man settles the moon, there we meet Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy), a successful night club owner whose club is burnt down in flames. Determined to figure out who's sabotaging his business (and trying to make him take the fall), Nash embarks an across-the-moon adventure with the help of his loyal robot Bruno (Randy Quaid) and female protagonist, Dina (Rosario Dawson) \u0096 only to find out the startling truth behind the lunar mafia forces. Along the way, we also meet some wonderful actors in the likes of John Cleese, (the late) Peter Boyle, Joe Pantoliano, Jay Mohr, Luiz Guzman and others.\n\nWhile you won't find a solid moral value at the end of the road \u0096 this film delivers the goods (and then some) on the pure old-fashioned entertainment field. If you give it a chance, you might easily find yourself humming \"fly me to the moon\" once the final credits start rolling."

The movie was fast, had a quite cliche, but a working storyline, EXCELLENT sets and subtle humour here and there. This definetly ain't a comedy, if that's what you're looking for, but a full-scale oldskool adventure film! The theme music is kickin', and the sets and the whole movie is so colourful, you'd think it was actually made in France (Just watch i.e. Vidocq). It was like experiencing some mid-90's computergame in a movie.\n\nI think Eddie did a good job in his role of Pluto Nash, other actors were also high quality, but perhaps a bit shaded by Eddie, not because he acted better, but because of more screen time. I love to see this movie over and over again, everytime I get happy when I've watched it, and everytime I feel like I've seen one of the greatest space-adventures ever. I highly recommend if you like cool characters, fast action and extremely nice sets.\n\n(BTW: There was a MOMO logo on the moon, I'm 100% sure I saw it!)"

No morals, no thought provoking material - just a lunar-futuristic eye candy sometimes-funny movie.\n\nThere's laser guns, robots, hover-car chases, lunar landscapes, purple space suits, moon mafia, even a high-tech cabaret show. And to top it off, Eddie Murphy whose screen presence is undeniable. Much imagination has gone into this movie, and that's more than I can say for a lot of others.\n\nMy Vote: 7/10"

Director Underwood manages to get a good cast like Joe Pantoliano, Jay Mohr, Luis Guzman, James Rehborn, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier and more. The supporting cast has little to do here expect for Quaid and a bit part by John Clesse have the best moments in the movie. Murphy has some good moments here, Dawson is extremely likable but the last act of the film is a major disappointment. It is probably why that this movie flopped. Special Visual Effects are a mixed bag here. If it had re-shoots and a better third act, this feature could have been saved. There's worst Eddie Murphy movies than this one.

It is a shame that this movie didn't receive a whole lot of promotion. Go to the theater and have a laugh with Pluto nash."

Much better than I originally expected and far better than some of these other reviews make out. The jokes aren't all that crude, the acting isn't too bad, and there are some good action sequences. The visual effects and sets are very good. Very Bladerunner/Total Recall in style. If you haven't got anything to do for about 90 minutes, I suggest going to see this enjoyable futuristic, comedy romp. It will have you laughing, for all the right reasons."

It has visual effects, music not so bad, good actors, and a usual story but in an interesting environment. The movie tried to bring a popular script to the future. I enjoyed the movie, much better, light, then other movies today. Eddie Murphy is not disappointing as always, his movies as well as this one are a all family movie to go and just enjoy it. In my opinion, even the robot scenes are somewhat novel, in contrast to other reviews."

The problem may be in the scripts and directors he is picking. 'Pluto Nash' is not much more than a TV pilot, but you will not see the series soon, because they did not catch with the audience. Effects are like Star Trek in the 70s. The only bright spots are Rosario Dawson - better and more beautiful in each movie, and Randy Quaid, acting good, though his robot humor is quite expected. But so is the humor in the whole movie, and you do not get much more cinema satisfaction than you do watching some TV comedy. Actually I saw many better TV ones. 6/10 on my personal scale."

The technology and culture of the futuristic period was dead on with risky yet probable decisions by the producers. This film is clearly geared toward the highly intelligent.

Box office flop.. cost $100M to make, took $4.4M over what period of time.. the introduction makes you wonder, but once it gets going, its a romp!! Yes, many ideas stolen from other sci fi pics but then what film doesn't copy some things. Total Recall/Blade Runner came to mind. What new ideas are there anyway. The money must have gone on effects, and I thought they stood up very well. Yes, its a family film, don't remember any bad language in it, but this was a TV cut. Some great ideas in this,no mention of John Cleese in the write up, but its a cameo. By the end I realised I have seen it before. So I've forgotten it, enjoyed it all over again. Flop, well, many people seem to expect blood and gore now, shame. Is it the age group? Not funny? 'Humour chip' missing is it? Maybe its too subtle. Its a very sad state when people couldn't enjoy such a well made film.. as another comment said, accept it for what it is. Don't expect. So many good bits in it..some set pieces. Yes, Fifth Element as well to a degree.. I like Eddie Murphy as an actor, I love sci fi, whats wrong?"

Definitely not her best work but gets the job done. It's nice to see someone make a movie that breaks the norm and almost reminds of the old serials they played before the movie when I was younger,or should I say young. Lol. The old Flash Gordon and such. Would really recommend that they should make a big bowl of popcorn and give it a try. Maybe by themselves if their afraid of being teased.

Even if there were, they were less than a handful, compared to the entire film which both entertained and had realistic Moon/sci-fi action. The director and special effects people did their homework. There were some weak points in the plot, such as some of Pluto's motives, but I understood the entire story. It's almost Beverly Hills Cop combined with Total Recall (and direct reference to both a Star Trek episode and Star Trek movie regarding identical people) but set on the Moon."

Also, if one payed attention, the gravity situation is \"explained\" up front: the \"Welcome to Little America\" sign also notes \"Prepare for Full Gravity\".

        "review_detailed_main": "As a long term fan of Eddie Murphy, ( From SNL ), It was a great thing to see him take on a diverse role, especially in a Science Fiction Movie.\n\nWith Sci-Fi Movies being my favorite genra, right next to comedy, It was great to see many of my favorite actors, ( Even the new ones ), bringing it all together, but this time in outer space.\n\nCannot unterstand why the movie did not do as well as it did in the theaters. Feels like \"politics\", but perhaps it could have been \"Timing\".\n\nEddie playing \"a suave and sophisticated bar owner on the moon\", seems like a pretty cool foundation a movie, especially when you add a razy side kick like \"Randy Quaid\" as a robot.\n\nThen the movie takes it back to more \"old school\" with the infamous \"Blacksploitation Actress\", PAM GRIER. ( Looking as good as ever ), and especially tough while helping to run down the bad guys. (Pam is still all that)!\n\nMy first introduction to Mr. Boyle was in the De Nero movie, (Taxi Driver). Through the years he has done an awesome job in both areas of comedy, (Gege Wilder / Mel Brooks), to dramas.\n\nThe casting was like something sent down from \"The Movie Gods\". Not to mention that \"Whacky Assed Jay Mohr\", who played behind a Celebrity name I have not heard of since the 60s, (Tony Francis)..... Heh, Heh...\n\nOver all, the movie did well! My perspective is from looking at black actors from the \"Stepin' Fetchit\" era, up to present. I view this movie as \"A DEFINITE STEP FORWARD\", and perhaps with a different chemistry, (Viewing the down falls of this movie), one should take all elements into consideration, and just \"DO IT AGAIN!!!!\"\n\nHats off to all involved in this venture. Lets, again, contribute an even larger positive lead by evolving the acting spectrum, as a whole!\n\nAlso, would love to see Jacynthe Rene` (Babette), again but in an expanded role. She has a lot of potential acting in American movies;<)\n\nFrom the words of Eddie Murphy himself: \"Its All Good\"! My favorite saying, only because its true.\n\nTony M. FiveDolphins"

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie on TV on demand and thoroughly enjoyed it. Eddie Murphy, as usual, was excellent and the rest of the cast was just as good. I loved the sets, the goofiness, the lines, the story. Since I found myself wanting to re watch the movie I bought the DVD and the movie now stands on my shelf, next to my other favorites. Critics can be wrong. For example, back in the 1950s, \"Imitation of Life\", now recognized as a cinematographic masterpiece, was unanimously panned by the critics! This is just one example. Personally, I make it a point never to read them before watching a film. Instead, I check out the director, the cast and maybe the story. If I know neither director nor cast I use my own critical judgment based on the story, what my movie - savvy friends say and a general feel based on trailers. I might read the critics after seeing a film to see who I agree with or rather, who agrees with me. By unanimously panning The Adventures of Pluto Nash the critics have committed another Great Critic Blunder. The movie is really very good."

I saw it years later on tv and loved it! Its FRESH and ORIGINAL and FUNNY. I completely loathe critics now. Especially these days when the brain dead lemmings will rant and rave about the stupidest crap (like some dumbass muscle heads strapping rockets to a car and going into space, or a bunch of lame cgi super heros jumping around in slow motion). Its why movies these days just suck!"

Not sure what ppl expected with this movie I'm guessing it's just because Eddie Murphy was in it that ppl must have expected some huge belly busting block buster. That is not what this movie is, it is a light hearted comedy set in space (the Moon). I really liked the original characters with the quirky personality's of the machines (IE robot, Cadillac) If your looking for a sci-fi scene with some good laughs and funny characters this movie is for you!"

His adventures occur as he goes about protecting his interests and his existence from the underworld figures who are trying to muscle in on his turf. Dina Lake (Rosario Dawson, also seen in Men In Black II) makes for an attractive cohort. Bruno (Randy Quaid) is an unexpectedly sympathetic android character. Some will appreciate the rather enjoyable exterior scenes of lunar habitats and Earthrise moonscapes. It's just a movie, folks, but if you're in the right mood, it's entertaining."

It was a lot of fun and it had a very good ending. I think all of you out there giving this movie such a hard time need to stop taking yourselves entirely to seriously. Lighten up!:) I have read a lot of comments, and reviews on movies such as Megaforce. This movie was the same as Pluto Nash. fun, Unique, and after all is said and done light hearted. Like Puto Nash it had a great if a little over the top story line. You should look up some of the reviews. However I suggest you see the movie for yourself first. Remember It was made In what 1979-80? movie technology wasn't quite where it it today (except for the Lucas's and Spielburg's) of the world, but they did the best with what they had. I Just believe most of these movie critics are just venting their own frustration at having nothing better to do. So there being as mean as they possibly can."

The whole thing wasn't a laugh a minute, but I'd definitely recommend it. Heck, just writing this makes me wanna go see it again.\n\nIn short, this is a fun movie, which you should catch if it's ever on TV. The story isn't bad either, it really reminds you of the family movies made in the late 80s early 90s. If you're looking for some excellently written piece of bore, then you won't enjoy it. But if you wanna see a hilarious, colorful adventure in space, definitely see it."

I thought that the humor was amusing if not always funny and the dialogue pretty good. i also liked the role reversals such as the kick ass Pam Grier mom and for once, a black character plays a hero in sci-fi instead of just being some mechanic or sidekick or the first-to-die victim.\n\nas some other commenters have written, if you're expecting eddie murphy to be the clown, you'll be disappointed. expect low budget, entertaining, slightly transgressive, sexy eddie murphy sci-fi."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 2002, Eddie Murphy delivered one of his most polarizing performances in the science-fiction comedy \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\". Hailed by some as a major misstep, and universally panned by critics, the film has since developed a cult following of those who believe it to be a misunderstood gem.\n\nMurphy's eccentric style was in full display in his portrayal of Pluto Nash, an ex-smuggler turned nightclub owner on the moon. With an intricately woven narrative that dives into themes of economic manipulation and artificial intelligence, the film boldly confronts complex topics through a comedic lens.\n\n\"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" indeed suffered from a severe disconnect with audiences at the time of its release, making it a significant box-office flop. However, the film's ambitious approach to comedy and storytelling, set against the backdrop of a futuristic moon colony, sets it apart from the traditional comedy fare.\n\nOne of the film's defining features is its refusal to take itself too seriously. From the tongue-in-cheek future tech to the moon's multicultural denizens to the unabashedly campy special effects, it all adds up to a film that's more farce than hardcore sci-fi, which may have rubbed some viewers the wrong way upon its initial release.\n\nHowever, the audience is rewarded when they approach the film with an open mind, free from preconceived notions. Despite its commercial failure, \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" features a standout comedic performance from Eddie Murphy and a unique blend of humor and sci-fi that is truly its own.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" is an underrated and delightful film that balances its eccentric comedy with unexpected depth. Its initial box office failure should not dissuade potential viewers from giving it a chance. Over time, it may just prove to be a hidden treasure in Murphy's illustrious filmography."
