        "review_detailed_main": "Jai Bhim turned out to be a hard-hitting, raw and powerful court-room drama. The purpose of cinema is not just to entertain but also educate and empower the audience. The courtroom drama based movies are always engaging as the prosecutor and defendant both fight to solve the case with solid evidences and innumerable witnesses.\n\nBollywood Films like \"Damini\", \"Jolly LLB\",\"Talvar\" \"Rustom\", \"Pink\" or even \"Section 375\" have been immensely successful in keeping the audience engaged with impeccable dialogues and fantastic screenplay but what makes Jai Bhim different is the beautiful message on morality and equality of a tribal woman who fights for the justice of her husband.\n\nJai Bhim is based on 1995 Habeas Corpus petition in which human right activist cum lawyer K. Chandru ( played by Suriya ), who takes up the case of Irular tribe couple (Rajakannu and Sengeni) where the husband is wrongly convicted by local police for stealing ornaments from village head's house.\n\nAs Jai Bhim opens, we see that cops segregating the prisoners based on their caste. Among all the caste, the tribal people becomes the easy target for the cops to clear the pending cases under the influence of their political head. We also see how Rajakannu, the main accused in the jewelry case, is forcibly taken away from his family. The film goes back in the flashback mode where life of the tribal couple is beautiful in the serene village where they hone the skills of catching rat for their bosses. As their life progresses, in one of the event Rajakannu and his brothers are caught for the crime which they did not commit. They go through extreme level of police harassment and torture which will be very hard to digest and is completely raw. Enter Chandra a.k.a Suriya who takes up the case when Sengeni narrates the entire incident and request to help find her husband who as per police, has been absconding from the jail.\n\nJai Bhim is one such hair-raising film which is definitely difficult to digest as it gives you goosebumps and eye-popping experience. Screenplay is the hero with nail-biting moments. Art direction is fine while Cinematography is excellent. Suriya is a knight in shining armor. Watch out for him in the second half when he questions the witnesses in the courtroom. It is unforgettable performance which should be lauded for its sheer brilliance. Among the actors - Manikandan and Lijomol Jose are mind-blowing with their natural performances. Prakash Raj does well as IG.\n\nJai Bhim is an experience that needs to be lauded for its impeccable direction, electrifying performances and beautiful message. Excellent 4/5."

        "review_detailed_main": "Turns out, the movie is based on a real-life incident from 1993.\n\nIn times when being a policeman is mostly glorified in Indian cinema, I wasn't expecting a movie about police brutality, something that's usually swept under the rugs, which makes this an important film in Tamil film industry and thanks to streaming services, in Indian Cinema.\n\nThe storytelling does a great job of making you care enough for Rajakannu and Sengani (both brilliantly played, with Lijomol being the show stealer in this movie) that you empathize with them throughout the movie. Parts of the movie were brutal and hard to watch, don't be surprised if you find yourself shouting \"Okay that's enough! STOP!\" at the events that unfold. Suriya and Prakash Raj play their respective roles with just enough intensity, nothing over the top with this one. Acting by all of the support cast was very well done.\n\nAs much as this film is about police brutality, this is also about casteism, which is still prevalent in our great country. Movies, both good and bad ones, in the past on this topic have been made, but you can tell if the script is trying too hard to highlight the caste system. This one, I thought, did it just right and didn't overdo it.\n\nIf you HAVE to, you can find things wrong with the movie - some cinematic liberty, the \"comedic\" elements, some \"mass moments\", were all necessary IMO. That said, this isn't the kind of movie you find flaws in, but the kind that you watch, and learn and grown from as a person. So, I'd request that you simply appreciate the filmmaking, empathize with the characters and learn a thing or two takeaways for real life."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite being over 2 hours and 45 minutes long, 'Jai Bhim' is an engaging, thoroughly entertaining watch backed by an astonishing real life story of custodial violence, police cover-ups and systemic corruption.\n\nSuriya plays a crusading lawyer, hell bent on revealing the truth behind three Irular (Scheduled Tribe) men who go missing while being in police custody.\n\nThe superstar turns in an impeccable performance as he fastidiously chips away at the truth, only to discover layer upon layer of lies, caste hatred and cruelty.\n\nDespite having a big name star at his disposal, director T. J. Gnanavel deserves praise for letting the story take the driver's seat, never reducing to unnecessary 'massy' sequences or masala elements to drive the narrative forward.\n\nLijimol Jose as the wife of Rajakannu (played by Manikandan) is an absolute force of nature in her role, delivering some of the best sequences in the film, turning in a performance a veteran would be proud of.\n\nPrakash Raj as usual excels in a supporting role while and Rajisha Vijayan had precious little screen time to make any sizeable impact.\n\nThe music from Seal Roldan played very significant role, helping the audience to feel the pain of the beleaguered protagonists in the beginning and that of vindication and righteousness towards the climax.\n\nJai Bhim does not rise up to the emotional highs of previous classic dramas based on custodial violence like Visaranai (2015) or Naandhi (2021) but is an immensely engrossing watch. Recommended!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I am basically in absolute agreement, without equivocation, of its main message against the rampant and wretched authority given to the police in this part of India (that I can gleam in general, not knowing much about how all the Caste systems work and just how much sub-*inspectors have in terms of power), while at the same time I bristle at the presentation - how the same hand that beats these poor peasants in the jail cell is as heavy as the director who's wielding the camera and editing software. And I know I know I know I know, these movies are what they are, but for this to be even in some part a Musical kind of undermines to me the shock and real pain and agony of the citizens here. (Just imagine like, I dunno, Kiarostami making this).\n\nJai Bhim has an important story to tell, and the actor Suryia (just Suryia far as I can tell) is very strong, often when he isnt doing anything and is just listening, as the crusading and heroic human rights lawyer leading the charge against these especially heinous acts (kind of like Law and Order but Defense not prosecution), and there are moments for the actress playing the pregnant and heartshattered wife of the man accused of stealing and on the run to show some depth of feeling past the screaming and crying imposed on her. On just a technical level, it's hard to doubt that those beating scenes are effective as a blunt instrument to get the audience into a particular frame of mind.\n\nBut liberal propaganda is still not any less the latter because it's the former, and all the good will I have for this gets tested over the not atypical 164 minute run time. On the other hand, this definitely has in the middle, once it gets into the meat and potatoes of the case, some good and rather gobsmacking procedural court scenes here (that this one decent lawyer could unravel a whole bees nest of corruption is amazing). At the same time though I almost would've been more interested in a story centered on the tribespeople and how they live and maybe learn and try to become citizens (even if all for not)."

Yes, the horror of stereotyping people. It breaks your heart throughout the event. Jai Bhim is thoughtful in the sense that it will keep you thinking about who is really the culprit in today's society. Finally it will gives you a silver lining throughout the dark episode. An intellectual war between constitution and unconstitutional surpassing caste creed and divisons.\n\nNow coming to the movie, Suriya plays the role of a dedicated lawyer. He works for upliftment of the downtrodden and provides justice. He plays the part well, no nonsense behavior normally done by the protagony of south movies. The antagony is well represented. Means he is perfect outwardly but a devil inside. A genuine depiction of villains in real world. The movie progresses as a war between justice and injustice that finally gives an optimistic ending. Like a ray appearing in the dark. The message of awareness that we should cultivate rearding oppression done by law keepers is a mandatory nowadays. I shall remember movies like Jai bhim and Ardh Satya regarding the social issues. Both are good though opposed to one another in story.\n\nPrakash Raj is good to watch esp in Positive role. The performances are praiseworthy. All possible edges are covered makes you seated. The BGM is of heightened feel. It is a positive themed movie. One of the best from south. Recommended for social issues in Indian context. It's a strong point also that the movie is based upon a true story, but there is a minor political issue attached with it. It is modified so is slightly unreal with unreal vibes throughout. So a 90/100."

More horrific than most horror films and very very frightening when u know that the movie is based on true events.\n\nThe real life judgment of Rajakannu vs State of Tamil Nadu & Ors, has Parvathi's statement on the torture that she and her husband had suffered, the reality seems far worse than art."

        "review_title": "Suriya & Co. deliver a hard-hitting social issue drama! [+73%]",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's always nice to see a star like Suriya move away from a typical masala flick for Diwali and come up with a hard-hitting courtroom drama based on actual events. In the film, he is more of a tool that helps enact justice for the oppressed victims. There's no showy entry, songs that praise him to the skies, or stock heroines who exist only to admire him. Instead, the film focuses more on the tribal characters played by Manikandan and Lijomol (both excellent) and the series of unfortunate events that they go through.\n\nPolice brutality has been a sensitive topic, touched upon by very few films and filmmakers, even when we keep hearing several such cases in the news. Films like Visaranai and Karnan paved the way for TJ Gnanavel's Jai Bhim to tell a harrowing social issue without the need to be preachy. Jai Bhim's first hour is a somewhat disturbing watch, with the cries of the oppressed both tugging at your heartstrings and coming across as slightly amplified. There's no subtlety at play. The punches are wholly felt, the screams are heard loud and clear. If you still don't, Sean Roldan's woeful score will drive the point home.\n\nBut the film gets infinitely better in its final hour. While the finale isn't exactly unpredictable, the journey of getting there is riveting. Both Suriya and Prakash Raj deliver the goods gracefully - not for once, getting in our faces with loud monologues. At a length of 2h 45m, Jai Bhim works due to its performances and topical relevance. Glad that a mainstream audience gets to see it on OTT."

Movie is based on real incident... fine, then show as it happened why you change the religion? The movie tried to portray discrimination experienced by the unprivileged class of society... It's a good thought. But in the real incident (based which this movie was made) the sub inspector was a Christian but in the movie his character was modified into an upper caste man. Why Anthony Das becomes Guru here? All other main character names are retained. The original characters have been intentionally replaced to target specific communities who are against the Surya's favorite Ruling party. Only because their minority appeasement will come to stake or there will be a question mark on their so called secularism ideology. The moment I saw Periyar (person who was believed to fight against discrimination, but filled with hatred towards hindu traditions) I was disgusted. This movie is made to create hate towards certain communities which was unnecessary."

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Gnanavel captures the raw nature of police brutality with a high degree of realism, and every scene was emotionally charged. Suriya brings another firebrand performance after SP, and delivers with his impeccable dialogue delivery and mannerism. I'm glad they didn't add any unnecessary mass/commercial scenes just because it is a Suriya film, and even the songs went along with the story instead destroying the pace. Another important mention is Lijomol Jose's performance as the Irular women who nailed it in every scene.\n\nIf I had to nitpick some minor negatives in the movie. It would be the antagonists. While they did a satisfactory job, perhaps having a more intelligent lawyer to counter Suriya would have added to more intensity, however this barely impacts the film. The runtime could have also been shortened by 10-15 minutes.\n\nJai Bhim is a fantastic movie and frankly I was more emotionally moved by it than Soorarai Pottru. The movie is an eye-opener to police brutality, but isn't over the top in its police bashing either. Instead it provides nuanced perspectives from well-meaning police officers (pay attention to Prakash Raj's role) in an attempt to support a more just legal system.\n\nRating: 9.5/10."

        "review_title": "Indian Binary Voting",
        "review_detailed_main": "We Indians live in binaries since our votes are mostly emotionally driven. When we love a film star in the film or the cause it discusses, we are hypercharged and want to give it a 10. Just the way Vishwaroopoam was. Vishwaroopam had 9.8/10 with more than 30k votes back in 2013 when Indian films barely touched 10k votes (pre-jio era).\n\nThe same is happening with Jai Bhim, which is currently at 9.6/10 in above 70k votes. Diving a little deeper into the vote analysis, it shows 62k votes is 10/10. That would mean, the film has been voted as one of the rarest of rare flawless pieces of art to ever come out in the world of films. I think I have rated about 4 films 10/10. Not to say this does not deserve a 10/10. But the film receiving a perfect score from more than 88% of the total votes is an extreme coincidence, especially when the top 1000 voters on IMDb have a weighted average of 4/10 - not 6, not 8, only 4/10 for the film. The funny thing is, 3.5% of them have voted it 1/10 as well. Let's compare this with another fan-driven top 10 IMDb film \"The Dark Knight\". The Dark Knight has a combined percentage of 10/10 and 1/10 of 46.3% against Jai Bhim's cumulative 91.5% in 10/10 and 1/10.\n\nNot saying this could not be possible, but this clearly seems like a large section of the audience is voting on the basis of the biased emotional rush. We saw similar instances with Wanted (2008) when this had just come out. However, this has reduced by a huge margin for Salman Khan films in the last 5-6 years with growing awareness on the mediocrity of bhai's films where even the fans now feel illiterate on praising his work. But considering the Hero worship in the Tamil and the Telugu films industry combined with a cause many people strongly resonate with, I am sure many things have been overlooked while judging this particular film. We saw this happen with Baahubali as well, no doubt it is an entertaining film but not without flaws. I am sure, so is this and many other such films."

In the era of SQUID GAME and Suryavanshi fantasies, we need such real life stories. I feel so much guilty that we are still carrying the burden of this 2500 years old rotten caste system where our fellow human beings are still treated worse than animals. As if the actors have not acted, it feels like I am watching CCTV footage! There is minimal heroism, maximum expression. There is not much court room drama, still the pace of the story is intense. The police and system which were supposed to protect us, provide everybody equal rights for survival, in reality literally killing people based on their surnames!!! :-( This movie based on a real life story on tribal rights made me sad, this movie made me hopeful too! Hats Off to all the Actor-Director-Story Writers and entire crew members. 10/10."

        "review_title": "Jai Bhim- Heart in the right place but...",
        "review_detailed_main": "Looks like those who have watched Jai Bheem are already divided in two groups. The ones belonging to the segment which has superliked this innocuously immature movie and are championing it to be a messiah of their lost ideology and those who are considering this as a threat to their existence. It has a rating of 9.6 on IMDB and yet to come in the top 250 list of the database provided by the site even after securing nearly 56k votes when this review is being written, a proof of the fact that something is wrong with the metrics and the effervescent rating will overcome the emotional doldrums and will stabilize soon after the initial emotions doze off. This shows how people belonging to any particular political ideology have strongly voted in favor of this movie. On the other hand, the way this movie is being slammed by some so called 'Film Pundits' or the 'Protectors of the nation' on several social media platforms show their unnecessary fear of losing their propaganda politics for a mere movie. The real metrics of IMDB will come into action when the initial zeal will die off from both the parties. Wait till that day to be too biased by any judgmental review.\n\n'Jai Bhim' is an honest endeavour to champion the spirit of protecting the rights of our indigenous people. The movie has its heart in the right place. The depiction of the brutality meted out to our innocent tribals invokes pity. But that in no way makes a movie scale the heights of greatness. In no way, Jai Bhim succeeds in being obstinate to the popular demands and reach new heights of glory in terms of movie making. It is melodramatic from the beginning to the end and even though it has its effervescent moments of greatness it fails to live with it.\n\nThe movie is a strange admixture of movie making of the present-day style of real-life storytelling and the bland, over emotional way of direction, reminiscent of the 90s style of creating a movie. The entry of the protagonist in many scenes are made to invite whistle from the audience, uncalled for a movie belonging to this genre at this age when people expect a movie with this much sincerity in its intention to be grounded, uncompromising and undeterred by the lure of commercial gains.\n\nBut the pursuits of 'Jai Bhim' are unfathomably ambitious, to an extent that it fails to be realistic in its portrayal of the plight of the tribal people. Right from the inception of the story, where a sarpanch is pressurizing the SP to catch an innocent tribal till the trial in the court in presence of a buffoonery AG of the state, the movie is bubbled to shed its earthliness and thus fails to arouse any real emotion. The torture scenes are brutal, naked yet they do not conform to the storyline and appear to be exaggerated.\n\nSurya as the protagonist is good but at times appears to be lost in agendas and a weak screenplay does not allow him to come out of the shell. Prakash Raj is hyperideologist and does not have any connection with the ground realities. The ones donning the roles of Raja and Singani are brilliant though.\n\nThe reason why communist flags are being shown again and again and those went missing while the narration was leading to a conclusive end is nebulous. Communists or their ideologies or flags have been shown as mere agenda or objects appearing only when the screenplay needed them not when the situation demanded them. The intentions of the petty police officials are unclear and why the AG is hellbent on supporting them even when he is refuting the SP is also equally hazy. The theory of monetary benefits could not be well established.\n\nOverall, this movie should be hailed for its honest intention in portraying the plight of the oppressed sections of the society. Only the execution could have been better.\n\nThe cherubic style of the little kid is the best takeaway from this movie.\n\nMy Rating- 7 out of 10."

I'm not quite sure how my Amazon algorithm works, but I always have to dig for gems like this.\n\nFor me to stick to a subtitled film, without a distraction, no phone or tablet, this was quite something.\n\nThat scene with the cobra, that was the moment that won me over, and showed me this was one to watch. After that I found myself engrossed in the storyline. The ending really did surprise me.\n\nAt two and a half hours, it is maybe a little long in parts, but it's not drawn out or padded, everything is purposeful, a quick coffee break is all that was needed.\n\nI thought the cinematography was brilliant, perfectly suited to the film, at times it's grey and harsh, and at others it's bright, loud and loaded with colour, they sure made use of the glorious landscapes.\n\nI have seen several real life shows which show the way The Indian Police work, they seem to have a very different set of methods to those used in The West, I think this film showed how tough it can be for people to get justice.\n\nI heartily recommend watching this. It's all the more impressive knowing that it's based on real life events.\n\n9/10."

The interpretations of Suriya who played as Chandru and Lijo Mol Jose who played as Senggeni were very good and they made the difference. In addition to this, the direction which was made by T. J.

The issue of police brutality in the developing world gets far less global media coverage. However, the scale and scope of the havoc it plays in the lives of the downtrodden is very real.\n\nSurya's acting chops come through in every single scene. The intensity he brings puts most other performers in his shadow( a number of whom are new and cannot be faulted) - except perhaps prithviraj.\n\nLijomol, manikamdan , Rajisha and Guru are creditworthy too..\n\nHowever, the lack memorable music , with one really out of place song at the start during Supriya s introduction , shows a below par music direction(Sean Rolden).. This robs the movie of some of its potential - especially when compared to the true great films that tackled important themes like this film attempts to\n\nHowever the greatest issue is with the direction and especially the editing( assuming the burden for this is shared by the editor and director)\n\nJarring changes in tone, misjudged transitions and a general lack of unifying color - something visible from start to finish in masterpieces by the mani ratnams and imtiaz Alis of this world - pull this movie well below the usual benchmarks of great social and drama masterpieces produced before by Indian cinema\n\nA definite must see for Suriya fans.. and the stirring true story that deserves more awareness..."

I don't even want to talk about acting performances because I don't think I'm quite qualified to talk about it. Suriya sir did it again after Soorarai Pottru and supporting cast deserves a special mention, TBH, they performed better than most bollywood actors. Indian cinema deserves more movies like this.

        "review_detailed_main": "I just don't understand why this movie gets the love it does. This just feels like a diluted \"Visaranai\", with nothing new to say to the audience. The story progresses in snail's pace and it's oh so predictable and cliche. Yes, I get it, it's based on a true story, but what matters in cinema is not what the story is, but how it is presented.\n\nJai Bhim isn't by any account a bad movie. I think it's a decent one. But like literally every legal drama movie ever made in Tamil cinema, it falls victim to overestimating its appeal. Do we really need the exaggerated slow-mo's, the over dramatic profiles and the intrusively annoying musical numbers to have effectively told this story?\n\nThe worst part about this movie is its characters. They lack an enormous amount of depth. I still wonder why the character of M S Baskhar even existed in the movie, if not to annoy us with literally every word he says, effectively bogging the movie down with him. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy and think he's an amazing actor, but he was so poorly written overall in this movie. And that is true for Suriya as well. The character has nothing to set him apart from what you might expect from an exaggerated \"goody\" lawyer.\n\nThe movie is 160-something minutes long. That is a painstakingly long time to have to sit through a movie with so little substance. If they had cut down on everything they thought would make it a commercial movie, and had stuck with only the meat of it, they could have made it into an amazing 90-100 minute experience of high spirits and emotions. But no, you just had to drag it for as long as you did.\n\nI don't hate the movie, if not for feeling like it wasted one extra hour of my attention it deserved to have. It's at least a decent one, but nothing close to the amount of praise it gets. But hey, I'm in the minority here, so who knows..."

Pace and construct of the movie keeps you gripped despite the story being predictable.\n\nNegatives: Movie is too long and should have been wrapped under 2 hours. Movie tries to cash on regional jingoism like the scene where a man is slapped for speaking Hindi. Police brutality is very commonly presented subject and not a new theme.\n\nOverall a well made movie but if you are hoping to see a ground breaking masterpiece going by the ratings, then sorry this is not."

This is a story of 4 who belong to one such tribe who work for upper caste in rat infestation control and catching snakes in their homes. The oppressor and the oppressed... a habeas corpus case... court drama ... movie does succeed in portraying a heinous gruesome picture of the atrocities and systematic violence that are being committed by the police, the upper caste, the justice system and the government against these tribes. A bitter reality... in last 5 years In the last five years, a total of 300 caste-related murders have been reported in Tamil Nadu and most victims were Dalits. At least two Dalits are assaulted every hour in 21st-century India, and every day, three Dalit women are raped, two Dalits are murdered and two Dalit homes are torched on average. Over 200 million Dalits, who comprise nearly 17% of India's population, face the threat of such violence daily (Ref: Wire) The apotheosis of the protagonist and few unnecessary jail sequences however takes away the focus from the underlying tribal issue .. but it does not fail to deliver a strong message and demands one to introspect.. thought provoking, based on true story ..

An issue that I believe, should be construed as a topic of discussion more often!\n\nThat being said, I'm still not fully convinced. Make no mistake, I wholeheartedly admire the cause as well as the initiative taken by the whole team but my biggest gripe is about its core treatment, which for better or worse has mostly been mass-centric. Probably due to the inclusion of superstar 'Suriya' in this narrative.\n\nNow, I do understand, why the creators might have taken such a lenient route! Their primary incentive was to reach a much broader base of the audience rather than limiting themselves to a niche category and in that regard, they went for the most reasonable choice vacant. But then again, a delicate subject like this, in my humble opinion, rather asks for an artsy & articulative way of storytelling.\n\nI'm in no way implying this was a bad attempt, not at all. On the contrary, I do appreciate the honesty and the audacity of the makers for even thinking about making such a movie that would dauntlessly question the injustices and would put a mirror on our administration and the jurisdiction for self-reflect. It's just that I beg to differ in the journeys taken not the destination it aspired to go to."

They didn't shy away from showing the police brutalities or show them in rosy light. And in the current political context, these truths need to be told more so now.\n\nKudos to the entire team for making such an amazing film.\n\nJai Bheem !"

I mean there was no real intense debate or speech scene b/w lawyers in the movie which makes you think.\n\nYou can skip first 1 hour easily. So much over dramatic scenes. So many tollywood like emotional scenes of poor people which you can see in their almost every other movie.\n\nAnd they also distracted from main topic in the middle (caste discrimination).\n\nThe only thing to watch to watch this movie is that it is based on a true story and the role of the wife otherwise they wasted a good story about a legend.\n\nIt's the time people should stop giving high ratings to a movie just because it is a south indian movie.\n\nLike KGF or Master or na jane kaun kaun si."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the exceptional, outstanding movies of Hot Chocolate, Hot Shot, Actor Suriya (Younger Killer Looks). Court drama that is so thoroughly astonishing & engaging right from the start of the movie. Distinctively unique, even from the very first 5-10 minutes. Definitely from the lines of \"Visaranai\", I am getting used to the recent cinematic legal works such as Nerkonda Paarvai, Ponmagal Vandhal etc, these kind of thought-provoking scripts is fast catching up as a trending inspiration for all film makers.\n\nIn his Brave & Bold attempt, Director TJ Gnanavel 's Jai Bhim (2 hours, 45 minutes long) flawlessly speaks about custodial violence, police cover-up, systemic corruption at a huge level, that is so hard to logically digest or reason out the whole truth and finally there would be no end to the entire picture. The blame game is never ending.\n\nI can add to this saying that Jai Bhim is actually truly-brutally honest, clear-cut reality filled with heart-wrenching scenes, that is sure to leave you feeling that there is more bad in this world than good.\n\nOne can praise Actor Suriya for his super star performance that is so shockingly awesome, only to discover embarrassing sheets of lies, caste hatred and cruelty. Actor suriya has done a wonderful job of acting so well & so concealed, that I just forgot him in the process, being so much involved in the amazing narration of this deeply appealing, story-telling method that the writer TJ Gnanavel has crafted & adopted.\n\nHuge round of applause for the extreme level beautiful Cinematography of S. R. Kathir, which gave this movie it s core life & the element of suspense. Music by Sean Roldan is noteworthy in it s own way, made me feel pain and all kinds of emotions throughout the film. Other actors namely Prakash Raj who shines seperately as usual due to his sensible acting portions for a supporting role, while Rajisha Vijayan, Lijomol Jose, Rao Ramesh deserve a standing ovation and especially K. Manikandan who earned the merit of a special mention. One wonders how he actually did all those gruesome scenes.\n\nThe director unquestionably has to be awarded for the stupendous success of this movie which solely entertains family audiences without depending upon masala factor or \"mass\"components.\n\nI would definitely watch it again as it was based on detailed portrayal of true events & people!\n\nHats off to the entire Cast & Crew, Team of Jai Bhim! Cheers!\n\nOriginal Content By Ar Deepika Dhilip."

The guy who acted as Samikannu literally must be awarded an Oscar for all the abuse he took onscreen. His spouse just lived the role with her great natural acting.

Dialogue writing was also great support to the movie hard-hitting and thought provoking dialogues . Sengani character was the highlight of the movie , Lijo Jose very well performed in that role . Suriya's performance and dialogue delivery were awesome , Prakash Raj very well supported . Manikandan had less screentime but gave a very good performance . Every cast done their job . Technical team work was good , especially makeup artists and art work . Cinematography was good . Sean Roldan music was mind blowing . Only negative I felt bit lag in few places .

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is a disturbing and traumatic watch dealing as it does with extended scenes of police brutality in the jail premises. The plot is about a tribal who is wrongfully arrested for stealing jewellery and police use third degree to force him to confess. The narrative is gripping as it first shows the police version and alternates with scenes of actually what happened.\n\nDirector TJ Gnanvel deserves credit for making a riveting movie based on a taut screenplay focusing on the oppression faced by the marginalised tribals. There is raw realism as we see them catching rats for food and struggling to make an existence with dignity. Their way of life both in the sad and happy moments are shown well. I felt that that the director has been inspired by the work of Shyam Benegal and Prakash Jha.\n\nLimo Mol Jose who has played the role of the suffering wife has done a superb job. No less impressive is actor K Manikandan as the harassed victim. Suriya plays a brave lawyer- crusader who takes on the entire police department in order to deliver justice to the pregnant wife of the tribal. Veteran Prakash Raj is impressive as IG, police. The acting of all is high class.\n\nThe courtroom scenes have been shot skillfully and are absorbing. It is clear that the self respect , dignity and human rights of the tribal community are on trial here against the all powerful police and bureaucratic state machinery. The movie has excellent cinematography and editing.\n\nDespite the scenes of excessive police brutality (custodial third degree), the movie should be on the \"must see list\" due to its overall excellence."

I am no supporter of any discrimination. But what I am trying reveal you all from other states or other countries is some of the facts of original events are manipulated in this movie to satisfy some community people and some political fundamentalists.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is based on true events that took place in Cuddalore district in 1993. In the original story, Rajakannu, a member of the Andai Kurumbar tribe whose main occupation was making bamboo baskets and agricultural labour, was accused of stealing jewels from a house that employed him. Based on the complaint, Rajkannu was taken into police custody.\n\nAfter suffering torture at the hands of the police, Rajakannu died in custody. To cover up their crimes, the local police moved his body late into the night, disposed of it in the neighbouring Tiruchirappalli (Trichy) district and later claimed that he had escaped from custody. Rajakannu's wife Parvathi, however, did not buy this story and sought help to locate her husband. Finally, she found a lawyer of the Madras High Court, K Chandru, who joined her quest for justice.\n\nK Chandru, who would later on become a well-respected and popular judge in the Madras High Court, filed a habeas corpus petition in the same court. After a 13-year legal battle, the court adjudicated that this was a case of custodial death and the accused police officials were sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment for the murder of Rajakannu. In an interview with The News Minute, he recalls how the police attempted to bribe Parvathi and him during the case. Chandru responded by throwing out the suitcase of money and the police from his office.\n\nGetting Parvathi justice for the custodial muder of her husband, however, is only one among the many incredible contributions of Justice K Chandru for the marginalised and downtrodden.\n\nIn his six and a half years as a judge of the Madras High Court, he disposed of 96,000 cases, a remarkable feat which was only possible because of his immaculate planning and organisation."
