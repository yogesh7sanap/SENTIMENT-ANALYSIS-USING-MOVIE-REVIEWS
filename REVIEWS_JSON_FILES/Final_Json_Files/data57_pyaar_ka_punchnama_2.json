        "review_title": "An enjoyable but gender biased comedy that would be LOVED by the boys and (most likely) HATED by the girls for their silly & mean portrayal throughout.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Despite moving on a similar-seen before path, the film still scores well in terms of entertainment basically due to its young realistic feel, local language, enjoyable dialogues and performances specifically written from the point of view of its 3 victim boys projecting the girls as simply mean, ignorant, greedy, money-minded and wicked witches just there to exploit their foolish boyfriends using them to the maximum. So where the boys are truly going to love it, the girls would more likely hate it for their silly, dumb and unpleasant portrayal throughout.\n\nDescribing the theatre experience, the film right away comes to the point with its 3 male characters speaking their comic dialogues in a typical Delhi-NCR lingo with many annoying beeps. But the young viewers easily get to understand what's being said (behind the beeps) mocking the questionable Censor Board, that insists on muting some key words even in a film given an ADULT rating pointing towards all confusing standards. Introducing the three girls next, PKP2 goes on maintaining the young feel and the well written dialogues, executed superbly on screen do not disappoint at all till it says intermission.\n\nIn the second half, though the viewers can easily judge that its nothing new from the team progressing on exactly the same format of its prequel, they still don't mind enjoying it as the fun continues in its final hour too, but following a strictly one sided mindset ridiculing the three girls. Moreover it all ends on another high point in the police station sequence wherein once again it's the boy playing the winning stroke insulting the girl for not coming up with the truth in front of her father.\n\nIn few words there are three basic reasons why PKP2 works majorly for the young boys despite having a stale subject talking about the same things. Firstly, because here we have a completely natural actor Sunny Singh who never lets you miss the most loved character of the original i.e. Liquid (played by Divyendu in PKP1). Secondly it's the realistically written dialogues of the film every boy can easily relate too, making an instant connection with the viewers. And thirdly it's the superbly executed 6.30 minutes long monologue brilliantly performed by Kartik that receives a roaring applause from the audience as if it was their personal feelings expressed by the man on screen so truthfully.\n\nIn the performance section, I would like to rate Sunny Singh scoring the most (playing Chauka) as it was certainly not an easy task to match up the performance of Liquid in the original and that too with a contrastingly different (and strong) physical appearance not suiting his sheepish character at all. Next is Kartik Aaryan playing almost similar role as in PKP1 but again coming with a fabulous monologue scene deserving all the attention. And then Omkar Kapoor playing it real cool in a pretty decent manner as the main financer of the trio irrespective of an illogically written character constantly being fooled by his greedy girlfriend.\n\nComing to the girls, Ishita Raj scores the maximum (especially due to her belly dance scene), followed by Nushrat Bharucha working hard on her dumb character that at times also turns to be hamming in some specific sequences. Sonalli Sehgall looks hot and beautiful taking a few steps further than the prequel and the supporting cast does a fine job too including Sharat Saxena, Mona Ambegaonkar and the two girls playing Nushrat's (Cheeku's) friends. Technically PKP2 becomes better in art direction, cinematography, editing and background score supporting the theme aptly, but this time its vision as well as the writing becomes more biased supporting the boys in particular.\n\nStating the downers, PKP 2 doesn't offer anything worth mentioning in its soundtrack and one frankly misses a song like \"Ban Gaya Kutta\" in its various sequences. The basic characterization also turns out to be hugely contradicting when we get to see a supposedly talented and educated person earning 3 lacs a month (Omkar) being fooled so easily by a girl met in a gym, living alone in a big apartment. And then the otherwise confident boy (Kartik) forgetting all his smartness once the girl says 'Yes'.\n\nFor friends who think the film is once again misogynistic in nature as earlier, it's actually not the same as seen in PKP1 which did have some major features pointing towards the same. As per definition, a misogynist is a person who hates, dislike, mistrusts or mistreats women. Whereas in PKP2 the boys are all loving, trusting and believing in their girls wholeheartedly right till the end and it's the girls only who repeatedly ditch them on purpose either for money, security or being plain dumb like the one portrayed by Nushrat. As a result, the three girls simply get projected as someone highly selfish, intolerable, manipulative and always looking for money or security in their man, instead of love or togetherness.\n\nIn comparative terms, where PKP1 could easily be called as a fine satire on love and cracking relationships among the youth, PKP2 is a more comical take on the subject conceived specifically from a male point of view as being the key sufferers.\n\nInterestingly, sex doesn't become any centre of attraction of the script this time for a change and it's the humour that takes care of every shortcoming of the film providing a fine return of your money and time spent on the multiplex outing.\n\nHaving said that, though PYAAR KA PUNCHNAMA 2 surely deserves a good rating for its entertainment factor well taken care of, it still remains 'a guilty kind of enjoyment' derived from a one dimensional project sidelining its female characters."

Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 is a comedy movie with humorous scenes and dialogue, fast paced and full of 'punch' lines which is surely not a waste at all. Just like the PKP1, this movie too revolves around three male roommates, Sunny Singh Nijjar, Omkar Kapoor and Kartik Aaryan(same cast as PKP1) who fall for three women(same cast as PKP1) at the same time and their life is not the same anymore. A roller coaster fun ride of three men in a relationship, is a must watch for every guy who is or wishes to be in a relationship. Kartik Aaryan's 7 minute long dialogue is awe aspiring, jaw dropping, inspiring and one of the most entertaining part if the movie. Hat's off to Kartik Aaryan's acting. Basically a male centric adult movie, this movie is I repeat, this movie is NOT for all all types of audience, choose your company well to enjoy it the fullest. If you are a fan of the Pyaar Ka Punchnaama 1, you will surely love this more not less and you can't afford to miss this one. Laugh, Whistle, Enjoy!"

Its purely for Men & I must admit, I had a ball!\n\n'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' Synopsis: After falling in love, three roommates experience extreme changes in their lives.\n\n'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' is hilarious, in most parts. Watching the three protagonists struggle in love, is amusing & very, very funny. The characters are well-written & you really feel sorry for the guys. The women (clearly this is a sexiest film) are shown wrong, but again, this is a story about men & their misadventures in love. While the first-hour is entirely funny, the second-hour slows down for a bit, but things get back on track during the finale.\n\nRahul Mody, Tarun Jain & Luv Ranjan's Screenplay is truly humorous. Though one-sided, the Writing still remains engaging & the dialogue, are simply superb. Luv Ranjan's Direction is very good. He has maintained the energetic mood, from start to end. Cinematography is fine. Editing could've been sharper & the film needed some trimming, by at least 15-minutes. Music by Various Artists is decent.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Sunny Singh makes a terrific debut. The actor shines on-screen & his comic-timing, is spot-on! Omkar Kapoor (a former child actor), also impresses in his adult debut. Kartik Aaryan is quite good, however, his long monologue in the film's latter half on women, is fantastic & brings the house down! Nushrat Bharucha is a hoot. She's consistently annoying & very believable. Sonalli Sehgall is effective. Ishita Sharma looks sexy & delivers seductively. Sharat Saxena stands out in a supporting role.\n\nOn the whole, 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' works! Go, laugh out loud!"

PKP2 is the next in succession! This is the story of 90% of us. The 3 guys fall in love with 3 different girls, in 3 different situation and faces 3 different problems, which in reality overlaps in our own lives. It's the wisdom of this movie that counts the most till the end. Until I watched, I was doubtful that part 2 cannot get better than its prequel, but I am happy to say I was so wrong. There wasn't a moment of boredom or a time where the story seemed to get off-track. The direction and the story are beyond perfection, and the cast is the best suited for these roles,even the best of the Bollywood actors/actresses couldn't have done it better. I laughed my wits off till the end. And definitely look forward to PKP3!!!"

They again fall in love with the girls who possess characteristics of the women fraternity which have been described as greed, confusion, indifference, inconsideration, gullibility, impracticality etc.\n\nIt packs the right punches in some scenes, the screenplay is little inconsistent and loses the main focus as some situations are impractical and we cannot identify with those.\n\nHowever, it has been researched well as it conveys the message that love cannot be superficial and it requires a commitment from both sides. Being covetous and unreasonable is the reason of struggle and it also requires a respect for both. And finally all roads lead to home that is mother; mother's love for a child is unconditional.\n\nAll the actors have done their jobs brilliantly; they personified the characters with plausibility and some the scenes stand out, the scene at the police station where Chauka delivers the perfect dialogue which worked like an eye opener or the monologue by Kartik.\n\nThe songs are forgettable but the good thing is that movie did not have many songs.\n\nOverall a decent effort by Luv Ranjan, a movie for the youth who can easily put themselves in the shoes of the characters, and \"the wearer knows best where shoe pinches.\""

In beginning i wasn't expecting it to stand any where near to its prequel but i'm glad that i was wrong.\n\nThough Thakur couldn't gel up as a replacement for Chaudhary, i personally feel the boys cast should be the same... missed the bonding of Rajjo, Liquid and Chaudhary but Chouka takes that place as a nice replacement package. Its a story that revolves around women's 1. the money minded.. 2. the best friend conscious.. and 3. girl concerned with family... the movie scenes were well shot and Anshul/Gogo monologue is longer, better and epic.\n\nI will agree to the fact that First half is more fun and dominant over the second but the story ends really well Talking to their mothers;)\n\nDon't listen to any1, if u r a fan of first PKPN you will definitely enjoy this movie without any disappointment, cheers!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Generalizations and Sexism are at the core of PKP movies. And that doesn't really make it bad. People liked the first one, didn't they? So, why a 6/10?\n\nWell, this movie is a slight improvement to the last one, but still there are a lot of things that don't work. Even if we ignore the constant sexism this movie portrays, it is a little strange that every happy/sad/\"katta\" moment for every couple, happens at the same time. They even have their first dates and break up on the same day. It's like the six people were dating each other! Got on my nerves cause it's practically impossible. Especially considering how the three couples were COMPLETELY different than each other.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the background score. It is a little better than the previous movie, but still annoying as hell. Felt a bit like I was watching an Indian MTV show.\n\nThen the fact that this is a A-Rated flick, but still all the curse words are bleeped out. Even the word \"gha**a\" (bell). Like.. Seriously? What is this, 1990? You can do better, Indian Censor Boards! By that logic this movie should have been at least U/A. But NOPE. Made it more annoying.\n\nAlong with that, a lot of the \"jokes\", especially near the end were merely laughter at the pitiful state of the guys. I mean, being a guy and living in the same world as them, I was empathizing with their situation. Laughing at someone's pitiful situations is NOT COOL. Were these emotional moments? No. Were they supposed to be? Yes. But no, everything is good because it's a comedy flick aimed at the male population and laughs are supposed to be delivered. If they deliver even a bit of \"feelings\", the movie will no longer be a d**k-flick.\n\nAnd the last but not the least, almost nothing shown in the movie is REAL. It's just an exaggeration of all the things that actually happen. Fiction, eh?\n\nI understand the hype! And I clearly understand why almost all guys relate to this movie. But a 10/10 movie is supposed to be more than just merely entertaining whilst bordering on offensiveness.\n\nTo summarize, entertaining (loved the monologue!), a fairly fun movie to watch, but LITERALLY nothing more than that."

In that scenario, movies plays a crucial part in de-stressing and re-energizing your vibe. The sequel to the cult classic 2011's cult classic Pyaar Ka Punchnama, Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 has right dose of medicine to uplift your mood and entertain you to the core.\n\nPyaar Ka Punchnama 2 tells the stories of 3 room-mates in the city of Delhi and the after-effects in life when they meet their dream- girls.\n\nNow when you watch the film, you will notice the premise to be same as original. In fact, the director Luv Ranjan has kind of remade his own film ( Yes, the seven minute famous monologue/rant scene by Karthik Aryan is repeated once again) But the good news is that the sequel is bigger and better the original. Luv Ranjan goes one step further in Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 and gives you a sensational film. The plot is a simple and predictable battle of the sexes but it is the handling of subject with aplomb and sensational performance with well-written screenplay that will keep glued on to the screen till the end. Luv Ranjan does a fairly good job in keeping you entertained with hilarious dialogues and is sure to bring down the house with hilarious moments in the first half. The second half becomes monotonous with occasional speed bumps in form of unnecessary inclusion of songs and loose screenplay but defined colorful characters with strong presence will compensate for the loose ends. Cinematography is outstanding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Editing should have been better. Music is tuneful.\n\nOut of 3 main protagonist , Karthik Aryan and Sunny Singh stands out with superb performance. Both of them should be applauded for fine comic-timings. Omkar Kapoor does well as a new comer. Actress did justice to their part.\n\nPyaar Ka Punchnama 2 is a laugh ton which will be remembered for its utmost hilarious moments. Good 3.5/5\n\n\u2013 Ketan Gupta"

But don't worry, all that happens in these so-called relationships is nothing like what happens in reality. Exaggerated instances of girlfriend pampering, gold digging like it's the end of the world, pretentious party-sex-sex-party brawls are some of the elements that the story uses to create humor. While the first half is periodic and comic, the second is dramatic and overlong.\n\nThat (all) women who enter a relationship are in for the perks is the main theme of the Punchnama films, and in here, the theme has been remodeled with sexier men and women, plush apartments, Apple products, and mild sexism. Had the narrative added women's viewpoints, I would have rated more generously.\n\nFamiliar one-liners, anti-climactic second act, and lack of visual sex scenes is what salvages the whole movie from becoming a putrid bore. The jokes are on women, and men's struggle in wooing them; and it is funny to a certain point. If you are not a purely platonic couple and do make love to each other on the kitchen bench, and like to watch (or re-watch) six hot people analyzing stereotypes about modern romance, this one is for you.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Pyaar Ka Punchnaam 2 is a sexier version of Pyaar Ka Punchnama (2011) which believes that it is easier to score in India, and that Moms are the best people to say \"I Love You\" to.\n\nGRADE: D+\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? NO\n\nProfanity: Medium"

That 'Frustration over Girlfriend' dialogue will not disappoint you. It will make you laugh and cheer over it, Brilliantly written but sadly it's only going to be remembered for this dialogue.

The two new faces made their roles their own and didn't really give me much chance to miss Liquid and Chaudhary. Chauka and Thakur were so much fun and had their own personalities that led me to root for them too.\n\nThe movie was fun although the music could have been better. My one big problem with Luv Ranjan movies is that the female leads are all shown negatively. Just one time, I wish he would have a female character not as air-headed or annoying. Moving on to the acting, all three male leads were great. Sunny and Omkar filled the shoes of their characters and Kartik was again fantastic, especially in his 5 minute long monologue. The girls were okay, although their characters were pretty vapid. Overall, the movie was entertaining and a fun watch."

But the movie was not that difficult. The trailer was slightly disappointed but movie did not. It works guys. Story line was similar to first part and which has carried up correctly. Movie is full of fun and some emotions. Dialogues are outstanding. Specially the speech given by Kartik Aryan (as Gogo). Yes, I am talking about the speech. They added this time as well with equal humor. You will feel it less if have already heard it in first part. If we talk about cast then I can say that you will not gonna miss Liquid or Chaoudhary. It is not because new guys has replaced them but I will must day that they has created there own space. Now you have Chouka and Thakur to talk about. The guys managed to do handle there roles well. While watching you will not feel like you are watching this again because it is different one.\n\nI don't think I need to tell you about the story because it is expected one but the music is good. You can have it in your next parties. The puppy's noise had perfect timing. You gonna love it. Luv Ranjan holds the craze of movie. Movie budget was high as this time as holiday was in Thailand not in Goa. All three relationship stories had there own taste. The awesome thing about this movie is that you can feel the life of characters because it is every next door's story.\n\nIn the end I will say that it was worth waiting and worth watching. The the taste of Pyar ka Punchnama is in there."

Not going into the debate of which is 'feminism' and which is 'femiNazism', I just don't think a comedy lives up-to its name successfully if it is only funny to a certain gender. The previous reviews have already covered the material of plot and other theatrics. I only wish to say that a comedy movie shouldn't leave its viewer with a bad taste in mouth, as 'Payaar ka Punchnama' did for me. I leave the women this advise, \"Watch the movie, but be ready to force a laugh or two, if you don't want to be termed a dirty feminist, and blackballed by the male companionship, who will find this movie highly 'realistic'\"."

I have personally experienced all the kind of girls that have been showed in the movie and I must say that it was a confidence booster making me realise that when all the time, I was made to feel guilty of things I was not responsible for, I was actually right and they are wrong. The fact that there are 10 guys available for any girl out there has given girls the liberty to exploit the guys and use them are \"use-and-throw\" stuff. Long have they forgotten that guys, no matter how masculine they are have a heart too. This movie is a pat on the back for all those heroes who have survived such girls and a wake up call for all those guys who are being used as resources rather than humans. The acting in the movie is fine but what's powerful is the dialogs and the content. They film makers have portrayed the reality from the point of view of a guy and is a feel good factor for every guy out there who is having a difficult time in his relationship!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 is a story about three flatmates/friends whose lives are going perfectly going fine till they fall in love with three girls and since then everything they never ever dreamed of, starts happening. It is a sequel to the movie with the same title released in 2011. The plot is exactly the same as the one in the prequel but the movie doesn't disappoint at all with brilliant dialogs, perfect comic timing.\n\nStory and Screenplay (8/10): For some, the story might be shouting out loud - misogynist - and may well be exaggerating the male dilemmas of the relationship. However, there wouldn't be any humor in the movie without that. When the plot and the story doesn't leave much room for creativity, the only thing directors need is an excellent screenplay. And that's what the movie boasts off. While there are some dull patches in between but overall, Luv Ranjan, Rahul Mody and Tarun Jain does a great job with some brilliant punches throughout the movie that the audience will remember after walking out of the cinema hall. The amount of thought and detailing that has gone into the seven minute monologue of Kartik Aaryan is beyond imagination!\n\nActing (7/10): PKP2 doesn't boast of any brilliant acting performances. However, all the newbies do well enough to the demand of their roles and thanks to their good comic timing that covers up for expression flaws. However, if there is one person you will miss in the entire movie, it would be Liquid (Divyendu Sharma) who had created a good fan falling after the first movie. While Omkar Kapoor looks sophisticated enough for the character he plays in the movie, he looks too cool (or may be expressionless) to be frustrated, happy, sad or angry with anything. Sunny Singh Nijjar makes a good attempt to replicate Liquid's level of frustration but misses it by miles. Kartik Aaryan shows some promise in the movie and steals the show with his epic seven minute monologue that tops up his earlier performance. The girls have been given largely similar roles and they respond with largely similar performances.\n\nDirection (8/10): Luv Ranjan has impressed with his direction in both the movies. Especially, given the challenge with PKP2, he does well in terms of execution of an already told story. The movie relied heavily on the screenplay, humor quotient and the dialogs and that's where Luv Ranjan directed all his efforts. Climax could have been shorter. For twice or thrice, you feel like its going to get over but it doesn't. With only four songs, he even saved about 15-20 minutes he had wasted in his earlier movie.\n\nOverall (8/10): Overall, PKP2 is a great entertainer if you are fine with some adult comedy. The point of view is exaggerated but that's where the fun is."

Supriya is from a middle class conservative family, who is afraid to commit in love because of her parents.

What all complications arise? Who takes the control of the relationships? Do the boys find the girls cool even after dating as they appeared to be initially? The film does mention the fatness with which the face-book relationship status and profile photographs are updated. The boys blabbering and complaining about the girls' behaviour and regret of their freedom being curbed generates laughter in parts, but most of time, these are bit annoying and irritating."

Direction was absolutely brilliant and Screenplay was also pretty gripping.\n\nAnyway! 8 out of 10 Stars from my side. It's better to avoid watching with your family, but yeah! If you are that much close with your cousins or siblings then you can go for it, just you have to take care of Kissing scene and bikini scenes comfort.

I was not able to see any flaws in the movie but then Kartik looks less confident then the first part. I will specially mention Thakur's character (Omkar Kapoor). His performance was dazzling. The way he acts in the movie was so good that no one can say that it is his first movie. Chauka (Sunny Singh) reminds us of Liquid (Divyendu) in some scenes. Out of all the three actresses, Kusum (Ishita) was very honest with her character, rest all done an average job.\n\nIt is a reality check for all the guys who are or wants to be in a relationship and while watching the movie one can easily relate the situations. While guys will find this movie entertaining, girls will be judging as an one sided drama."

I feel like the movie could have been half an hour longer though. It seems as if the mood of the movie is changing very fast.

Story is totally confusing. Screenplay enhances this confusion. Whenever they want, they jump to song or random scenes. Dialogues are OK but fade up with repeating 'Chu...' word with all male characters, like it was only word to express their irritation. Surprising film is 'A' certified but again full of beeps. Even 'Gangs of Wasseypur' came without beep, then how anyone can impose beep in this childish foul language in compression of dictionary of slangs in 'Gangs'. Beeps irritate. You can't relate with any of characters. All are exaggerated. Without any reason father opposes daughter marriage with a boy? How and why? A girl can doubt her male partner but don't mind sleeping her male best friend in a bed!? Is she mentally challenged? First part background was interesting and fresh but this part have irritating score. Look of film is very good. Every frame looks beautiful. Credit goes to cinematographer #SudhirK.Choudhary . Monologue of this film shows that how much they have gotten carried away with their appreciated work in first part. This monologue is lengthy too and have some interesting punches but bores due to rush and meaningless performance. Actor was in so hurry that he was not acting but participating in some 100 meter race. This film deliberately tries to cash all good things of first part but fails badly. First half is slow and second half in unbearable. I like taking of few scenes, like all three couples come in frame one after another, while saying their point of view. Long scene of mall, where couple is talking and moving on escalator. Basically steady cam work is very good. Performance wise Kartik Aryan as Gogo and Omkar Kapoor as Thakur are OK. #SunnySingh as Siddharth is impressive. He looks good and acts perfectly according to character and scenes requirement. Sonali Sehgal as Supriya and Ishita Sharma as Kusum are good. Nushrat Bharucha as Ruchika alias Chiku is below average. Music is peppy."

Half of the movie is so ridiculously predictable that after a moment you wonder if you're just here to see famous celebrities make fun of women based on their societal stereotypes.\n\nThe reason this tends to the male audience is because it feeds them that the stereotypes about women are not only true, but also shows that in the end its male friendships which always win over relationships, which is why you should never take relationships seriously (unless it is with your mother/sister) and only cater to your male friends. Apart from this there are many scenes which a woman seeing would absolutely cringe upon and get overcome with rage but would make male audiences (those who don't care about portrayal of women) laugh or instead make them hot and bothered.\n\nMost other critics say it is not misogynistic because it \"doesn't hate on women,\" which is true. It doesn't. But it reduces women into mindless creatures bound into 3 stereotypes."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know why, but, before its release, I lost the hope that this film will do something. And because of this thought, I didn't enjoy this sequel while watching. One another factor is tiredness because of Navratri. And just the day before, I went to watch Talvar, a masterpiece. So, lot's of factors affects on me to dislike the film. Though, story is as same as its prequel. But, it contains less humor and more unrealistic drama. I can't be able to figure out how those couples fell in love with each other! Even I'm confuse about the girls' behavior, which has been shown in the movie, is real or not! I know, all the boys have to suffer a lot in a relationship, but, those things have been shown in the prequel, so I was expecting something better and good. But, the movie fails to impress me. In the whole movie, I laughed hardly 4-5 times. Even the 8 minutes long dialogue of Kartik also fails to give some impact on me. Everyone in the theater is just seeing, without laughing. Performances wise, the movie is okay. Not a single character can stand along with Liquid. Kartik is above average. Omkar Kapoor is just okay. Sunny Singh is below average. All the three heroines are okay. But, especially I liked the character Chiku, played by Nushrat Bharucha. Only this girl remains in my mind after the movie. Music is as poor as it was in prequel. Even, I can say more than the prequel. Not a single song is there that can touch my mind or heart, and which I can think about to download. Dialogues could have been written better. This can be also said in terms of story and screenplay. Only 2 dialogues made me laugh - 'Haath se shaadi karlo' & 'Bhai hai, muh bole? -Na, Bina bole!' So, on the whole, according to my experience, Its a waste of time and money, can be easily skipped, better to watch its prequel on laptop, or else do whatever you want to do man!"
