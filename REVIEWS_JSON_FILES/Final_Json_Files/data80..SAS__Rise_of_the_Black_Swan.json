        "review_detailed_main": "After video spreads of a massacre in a Georgian village committed by private military contractor Black Swans, Interpol issues a Red Notice on Black Swans leasers William Lewis (Tom Wilkonson) and his adult children Grace (Ruby Rose) and Oliver \"Olly\" (Owain Yeoman). While the official task is to arrest the Black Swans, at the direction of the Prime Minister, High Ranking SAS officer George Clements (Andy Serkis) seeks to kill the Black Swans as not to unleash scandal about the British Government and gas company Britgaz who hired them. The first attempt by the SAS only kills William leaving Grace and Olly to enact their fail safe. With SAS officer Tom Buckingham (Sam Heughan) on board the Eurostream to Paris with his girlfriend (Hannah John-Kamen) with the intent to propose, their trip is soon interrupted as the Black Swans seize the train and ransom the passengers against the British government with only Tom able to act against the Black Swans.\n\nBased on the Tom Buckingham series of books by Andy McNab, who also serves as a co-producer and writer on the film, SAS: Red Notice is one of Sky Cinema's original productions made to compete on the same playing field as Amazon and Netflix original films. The film has a rich source with Andy McNab, former SAS veteran turned author, very much the U. K. equivalent to Tom Clancy with his books praised for their details and thrilling action and there's definitely a foundation to be built upon, but unfortunately the film's turgid pacing, blandly staged action, and lack of tensions leads to a slog that ends this franchise before it even starts.\n\nDanish Director Magnus Martens has a proven track record with the decent dark comedy film Jackpot adapted from the Jo Nesbo novel as well as experience helming episodes of Banshee and 12 Monkeys, but here Martens finds himself out of his element as he doesn't frame or pace the film like an action thriller and instead treats it more like a procedural with much of the action presented in a rather detached fashion. The movie is basically yet another entry in the ever popular well of Die Hard clones and here the premise feels misjudged with the Eurostream equivalent of the Eurostar being rather cramped in real life in comparison to its film equivalent and even if we overlook that detail the setting isn't all that visually interesting with not much in the way of mining for potential action beats. The movie tries to operate on other levels such as a subplot of a mole (or \"snide\" as they call it) in the SAS but its such a limp attempt at intrigue with really only two possible suspects that the reveal comes off as rather limp and unimpressive (possibly a plant for sequel bait). Some of the shadowy political power plays with Britgaz and the Prime Minister are potentially interesting, but we're often held at a distance from these proceedings despite them being the most engaging.\n\nThe cast does fine for the most part (even if there's not much to work with), Andy Serkis has fun playing an unscrupulous figure not afraid to get his hands dirty, and I did enjoy Ruby Rose as Grace Lewis. Sam Heughan of TV's outlander as our lead is fine I guess in the film, but there's really not all that much to his character. The movie tries to analyze Psycopathy since Andy McNab has been diagnosed as a functioning Psychopath and incorporates that into some of his characters, but we never really get to feel exactly what that entails with Tom Buckingham and there's not much in the way of depth. There's certainly depth to be mined from protagonists with psychological baggage as seen in reliable staples like Dexter and Hannibal, but the movie just pays lip service to it if even that.\n\nSAS: Red Notice is a rather underwhelming military thriller that is reminiscent of the underwhelming international co-productions Euan Lloyd (Who Dares Wins, Fflokes,etc.) made back in the 70s and 80s with a fresh coat of paint. With a rather flat delivery that's lacking in tension and action that's not engaging SAS: Red Notice kills whatever chance it has at a franchise."

It had good action sequences, but they had poor flow with the rest of the film. Each actor seemed to do what they could with what they had, except perhaps Rose who was too happy being a psychopath to be truly psychopathic.

        "review_detailed_main": "Seasoned TV director Magnus Martens dabbles for his third time in a full length feature film, alongside producer and newb writer Laurence Malkin, who put together this screenplay based on the novel of the same name by Andy McNab.\n\nFor the first quarter of the film, the story was all over the place. I can't put my finger on weather it was bad edit scene cuts, flawed directing, a confused and convoluted screenplay, or all of the above. It almost seemed like it all happened too fast, with lots of filler and very little substance. I was just about to throw in the towel on this one. But, once the story started to progress with the train acts, the scene transitions got much better, and the story flowed much smoother, and became very interesting and suspenseful.\n\nThe cinematography by Nick Remy Matthews was outstanding. All the visuals and V/SFX were on point. Aside from a few plot and technical issues, the last three-quarters of the film were excellent. Sure there were some cheesy scenes and dialogue, but the tunnel and train sets were very suspenseful and mostly edge of your seat thrills. Even the 123 min runtime flew by with near-perfect pacing.\n\nCasting and performances by all were spot on, and although at first I wasn't impressed with Ruby Rose, she nailed her acting and character in the latter part of the film. The score was the adequate B-grade quality, and that's too bad, because had it been better and less obvious and unfitting, it may have added more suspense to many scenes.\n\nIt is certainly not worth all the lame 1/10's - strictly on a production value alone, but I'm guessing most of those are from upset members who saw the ridiculous shill fifty-three 9 and 10/10's. This film was not exceptional by any means to deserve anything close to those numbers, as it had very many flaws. But, it was an unconventional setting with claustrophobic scenes that will make many cringe in suspense, and those scenes were done very well. The story although not entirely unique, it still had many merits to it. Martens should be proud of his work that went into this, and for a newb screenwriter, Malkin did good.\n\nAm I glad I saw it? Absolutely. Would I recommend it? If you're into action and suspense thriller movies and are not overly picky, you will enjoy this. It's a well deserved 7/10 from me.

She cannot play a villain to save her life and it really shows: Sam Heughans character is great and is portrayed really well by him. He is a fantastic actor. The cast is pretty amazing too. Yes some of the acting could be better but remember THIS FILM WAS MADE DURING A PANDEMIC. So they would have struggled more than other productions.\n\nOverall if you like quirky action films it's a good film to watch on a Friday night with a takeaway. Enjoy."

But of course, as the movie is based on an Andy McNab novel.\n\nThe storyline told in \"SAS: Red Notice\", as directed by Magnus Martens, actually was interesting and captivating from the very beginning and up to the end. So this movie was essentially without any dull moments for me.\n\nThe acting in the movie was adequate for a movie such as this. And while I can't claim to be overly familiar with actor Sam Heughan, then he did carry \"SAS: Red Notice\" quite well.\n\nThere is a good amount of action in the movie, nicely crammed into the storyline and it actually made for a good combination of action and storytelling. Sure, the storyline was predictable, but hey, aren't most action thrillers following the same formula anyway? And I will say that the action sequences in the movie had a very dynamic feel to it.\n\nI was genuinely entertained by \"SAS: Red Notice\", and it is a movie that actually is well-worth taking the time to sit down and watch. My rating of \"SAS: Red Notice\" lands on a six out of ten stars."

For some unknown reason, after it seems like the movie is going to be about the Swan family of mercenaries, it takes twenty minutes to introduce the wedding preparation for one of the SAS soldiers and how happy his life is. Then the movie constantly goes from the Swans and their efforts to hijack an international train, to the SAS guy and his girlfriend. Just totally distracting and useless to the actual story.\n\nI have to admit that I gave up on this when the SAS guy rescues a little 6 year old girl from the hijacked train. Then he is climbing around the train with the little girl, trying to kill Swan crew members with the little girl walking around asking questions. It was just too stupid to watch."

HELL NO! is it worth the 2h you spend watching it? maybe. depends on what you're looking for. if it's an action flick made in the way of the old 80's and '90's action movies (think old stallone or schwarzenegger movies) you want to see then i say go for it. if it's a romantic movie or something loaded with a political agenda, look for something else. yea, i know, the movie has more plot holes than a romanian road (not joking!!!) but action movies were never meant to have much plot coherence in the end. just grab some popcorn, sit back and just enjoy the mindless violence and some quirky dialogue. don't expect brilliant acting, don't expect mind-blowing plot or anything thought provoking. it gets almost everything wrong. from how psychopaths really work, to how they're supposed to be super-soldiers or some such nonsense, to how it's easy for one to find love, to how they actually react in combat. but it's still some mindless fun. just take it as it is.\n\nFYI: i'm a psychopath myself, former paratrooper. also, psychopaths are born, not made."

Also, I think it's the perfect role for Ruby Rose, where she just plays a murderous psychopath. OK, I am a bit mean with the girl, but she does seem to only have one expression... A bit bummed that it's yet another production where they are making fun of Tom Hopper. Won't the guy get a role where they don't make an ass of him? The movie had pretty high production value as well.\n\nAnyway, that's about the good. The bad, quite a lot, too. Some action scenes are good, but most of them are pathetic. The \"twist\" at the end is pointless and the ending overall is really really bad. If we have learned anything from the past is that a movie will only be as successful as its ending and that is why people who really hate this film do.\n\nWhat hurts for me is that this had a lot of potential. It is a terrorist attack in the Eurotunnel in which a highly trained SAS operative is travelling with his soon to be wife. The terrorist is psychopathic and so is our hero. Gasp! Yet the entire thing had a too long a setup and a convoluted ending that detract from the quality of the initial idea. Too bad.\n\nBottom line: I thought that the acting was competent, the premise good, but the script focusing on all the wrong things."

Grace and Olly escape and immediately plan to avenge their father.\n\n\"This isn't about money, its revenge\" - Tom Grace now leads the Black Swans and they hijack a train going to Paris and hold the passengers ransom against the British government. The plan is to blow up the gas pipe network when the train is deep inside the Channel Tunnel.\n\n\"If you don't pay us I'm going to destroy this tunnel and everyone in it\" - Grace \"If she exposes what we've done this is a very big problem for me. Get down there and kill her\" - Prime Minister Now what they didn't count on is a SAS officer, Tom Buckingham (Sam Heughan) being onboard the train. Tom escapes off the train and contacts and warns his friend who is also a SAS agent but he has been bought out by Clements and sends a rescue team into a trap. So Tom is on his own against Grace and the Black Swans.\n\nThis is a OK thriller with really good actors and lots of action, but it looks more like a TV movie.

Here, the evil leader is a female, but also a character for whom we can find some kind of empathy, as were the villains of the novel from which DIE HARD was inspired from, terrorists who had good \"human and reasonable reasons\" to commit what they did. This is the only movie among the DIE HARD rip-offs where the bad guys are lead by a girl. That deserves to be noticed. That remains a lousy directing piece of work though. No, only the evil gal is worth the watch. And the behavior of the good guy's broad, at the beginning reluctant to the fact that her man kills people, and then suddenly asks - orders - him to kill, kill, especially the villain gal, fo whom the audience may feem some empathy.... Interesting indeed. Very interesting. Forget the rest."

However I was pleasantly surprised. Firstly the slight negatives. It is a bit cheesy in parts which I don't get in Andy McNabs books but condensing a 10 hour book into 2 hours I guess there has to be sacrifices to get the story across to the audience. Secondly some of the scenes were on the silly side that not even The A Team would be able to get out of, but that's no difference to a Bond movie! My biggest negative is that in any McNab book, autobiography or fiction he goes into such detail which I really love, sadly not so much in this film. I know he advised on the film Heat to give it a realism on shooting scenes but not sure if that was the case in this movie. Positives are Tom Bucking felt like the same person I had pictured while reading the book and was likeable and for me Andy Serkis stole the show, loved his style in it. Noel Clarke is brilliant and would have liked to have seen more of him. Good lot of action, easy to watch and overall enjoyed it a lot.\n\nTake it for what it is which is a easy to watch action movie with a fair amount of tension and blood!!!!"

Suspenseful, with a surprising twist! Very believable action. Sam Heughan shines as Tom Buckingham & I thought Ruby Rose was credible as an amoral psychopath. Good chemistry with Hannah John-Kamen. Enjoyed the score, the themes enhanced the sense of danger & struggle. My only complaint would be the quality of sound mixing; had to resort to closed caption to catch dialogue as sound seemed muddy in a number of places. A definite hit in my book & I will rewatch! MORE TOM BUCKINGHAM, PLEASE!"

Nelson DeMille) but even they simply can't compete. The old saying applies: he's like Joe Louis in a land where everyone else is five feet tall.\n\nSo - what we have here is a dynamite book with authentic flavor dragged down by the Brollywood treatment. That's a shame because it could have been filmed directly, in which case it would have been outstanding. BUT given the high level of the starting point, even this laden production has merit. And if you have read the book there is added value. I was very glad to see the train and the tunnel; the British countryside etc.\n\nIt deserves a 6.5 but I went with 7 since it's quite underrated now.\n\nThank you for everything, Mr. McNab."

She wants to be Michelle Rodriguez, but totally lacks the charm.\n\nThe rest of the cast varied from almost great to mildly boring (mostly latter); plot was rather cheesy and predictable, but overall it was an entertaining movie with remarkably low volume of virtue signaling.

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is as good if not better than any other action suspense thriller film. I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. It is filled with twists and turns throughout. The characters of Tom and Grace are incredibly complicated. They each have psychopathic personalities. Tom uses his for good and Grace uses her for evil. Sam Heughan does a superb job at portraying this deeply flawed character who also has to wrestle with his feelings for Sophie which are counterintuitive to everything in his nature and everything he has learned and experienced in his work as a SAS agent. His love for Sophie is not part of his natural DNA and he often missteps in his relationship with her because he is just not wired that way. Despite their differences Tom and Sophie love each other but she really doesn't understand him until the end of the movie when she sees what his job actually entails and how good he is at it. Ruby Rose conveys her cold calculating character Grace who has no redeeming qualities in a truly dead pan and convincing fashion. The supporting cast also does a great job. Andy McNabb has done a brilliant job at weaving together a very intricate and complicated story of espionage, suspense, drama and action. Benji Morrison's sound track is like another character. It enhances every scene but does not overwhelm. I don't understand the incredibly negative reviews. Some people actually admitted to only watching less than 15 minutes. Others seem to have a beef with Sky TV. Others seem to have personal beefs with one or more of the actors. Others complained it was not realistic or believable. Seriously? This genre of movie is never judged on its realism or believability, because we all know, they never are. I defy any of the naysayers to state an action packed, suspense thriller movie which is realistic or believable, surely none of the wildly successful franchise film movies. Other reviewers had a bone to pick with some minute aspect in the film then condemned the entire movie. I read in disbelief people who thought it was low budget and cheaply or hurriedly made. I don't know if all these people watched the same movie as me. I don't get the harsh criticism. I loved SAS: Red Notice. Kudos to everyone involved."

I had to give it a 6/10 because it wasn't the worst movie I ever had to sit through.

This based on a book by SAS man Andy McNab. I find that hard to believe really. The story is bad, along with the script and some of the acting. Why Wilkinson and Serkis did this is strange. The storyline is unbelievable and has plot holes everywhere. The casting is dubious, as the chief baddie played by Ruby Rose is so unconvincing and looks like she'll blow over in the wind. Serkis' character on the other hand walks around with a Danny Dyer accent using F words in every sentence and is actually quite comical. Unintentionally comical. I really should have turned off after 30 minutes but kept going as others were watching. Remove the swearing and you have an all action cartoon style movie for the comic reading generation. As it is, it's a badly written B-Movie that insults your intelligence and not worth 2 hours of your time."

Only one monkey, recovering from a ketamine addiction, locked in a room with a broken Tomy Speak & Spell and repeatedly tazed. The result? Not only this script but the casting decisions too! First time, no retakes (or, retazes) needed.\n\nThe most enjoyable thing about this movie was the opportunity it gave me to count the collection of unusually shaped logs I have not been able to bring myself to put into the burner over the last three months.\n\nIf you have logs of any shape which have not been recently counted, then this could be just the movie you have been waiting for.\n\nIf you don't have any logs, I would highly recommend gently returning the remote control to the side of the sofa. If it's too late and you have already added this movie to your planner, then it's bad news.

The train is taken by a small army of well trained criminals from America led by Ruby Rose and Tom Wilkinson to expose the British governments darkest secrets and blow up the tunnel if her demands are not met. Sam is the only one that would be able to stop the criminals. The storyline is based on the novel written by former SAS operator Andy McNab. The flick reminded me of Daylight that stared Sylvester Stallone which was a much better film. Andy Serkis acts as a private mercenary hired by the oil company to clear the path to either buy out or destroy small villages to complete the pipeline project. Overall the film had a good plot but terribly portrayed on the screen. It was an okay movie with means that sequels are in the works with Netflix at the helm."

Here's the deal with this film I'll make this quick. \ud83d\udc4c it's a good film that settles in rather well after the first 15 mins. The opening pillage scene is done rather poorly with special effects to put it nicely were amateurish and a few of the aerial shots before you see the motorcycle gave off a strong B movie feel but it doesn't persist. And once the aerial shot of the man on a motorcycle begins the videography starts to get a little sharper then the film opens up and divuges the plot and you begin to see a rather sprawling storyline with massive wealth, government corruption and sinister bloodlines. You know all the stuff we deal with in real life. All jokes aside this film is worth the watch just give it 20 mins. and you'll realize it's potential to be worth it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film made it's way to Sky Cinema last Friday and last night I sat down and watched SAS: Red Notice and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a small force of trained mercenaries hijack a train where one man has to stop them.\n\nMain Character Sam Heughan plays one of the main characters here and I thought he was okay. He was good in the action scenes and provided a physical presence to the role which aided in the film, also I like some of the things they do with the character in terms of the mental state of the character. But it just isn't handled well enough and Heughan is quite dull in his performance and the film doesn't do a good job of making you like him or care about him. Ruby Rose plays the main villain and I actually thought she was the more interesting character and sold her insanity in a more interesting way. She gives a menacing performance and Rose does as good a job as possible, but in the end her motivations are very dull and it wastes the opportunity given due to her decent performance.\n\nSupporting Characters This cast has plenty of well recognised actors, though they don't exactly get much to work with. Andy Serkis is a nice fun character here, he is completely over the top and kind of like he is in a different film to the rest of the cast but you cannot deny that he is entertaining. But others like Hannah John Kamen, Tom Hopper & Noel Clarke are given very little to work with and despite being good actors the characters are bland and don't offer much to the overall product to the film.\n\nStory The story here is really bland too, this films plot feels like it belongs in the 1990's where action films like this were churned out all of the time. The film wanted to do something unique with the two main characters but the story doesn't do enough to make it interesting and as I said above the whole motivations for the villains is clich\u00e9 and not well thought. Also the film has twists and turns and I am pretty sure not one of them makes sense and the end of the film cops out and takes the easy way out instead of providing something unique.\n\nScript The script as well is weak and really does hurt the film. It provides clich\u00e9 motivations and twists that are unnecessary and feel like a poor attempt to try and make the film feel better then it actually is. The film also takes itself really seriously too and kind of misses the point of an action film like this.\n\nStyle There are some good action scenes here that are pretty violent and are the best parts of this film. The film is paced pretty well and despite a longer runtime that I would like, I never really felt bored by any of it. Though I think with the other elements of the film being weaker I needed more from the action scenes and some truly memorable sequences which the film doesn't have.\n\nOverall Overall, SAS: Red Notice is a pretty poor film that just feels very forgettable. It has some okay action but there are so many better action films out there and this is one to avoid.\n\nRating - 3/10."

I don't really like Ruby Rose but I do kinda like both Sam Heughan and Tom Hopper so I gave this a shot... and it kept me hooked all throughout.\n\nGood action thriller, decent fight scenes, decent tension, decent acting all around, even Ruby Rose was surprisingly decent here.\n\nSam Heughan is a pretty charismatic lead even when playing a psychopath... which is something I actually found interesting: A lead character who's a psychopath but also tries to do good. Heughan has a bright future in action leads if he plays his cards right.\n\nAll in all, I was actually fairly surprised at how good the movie was considering how little marketing I've heard about it. In fact, I had no idea what it was, and I watched it thinking I was getting one of those B-grade action movies that I just watch in the background while I skim my phone.\n\nIt wasn't. It's better than a lot of major blockbusters I've watched recently. It's certainly better than majority of Netflix movies out there. Better than the other Red Notice movie at least (the one with Dwayne Johnson).\n\nThis movie completely doesn't deserve the current 5.8 imdb rating it's sitting at."

I was mentally checked out 40 minutes into the movie. The action scenes themselves were too short, which made sense because pretty sure there wasn't enough budget for competent fight scenes.\n\nEven worse, this movie tried to be all complexed with an actual premise about psychopaths not being able to feel love, and some rare ones can. This literally made no sense and served no purpose to the movie. I swear to god I just want an action movie, not some NyQuil pills or some lectures.\n\nOverall, one of the punch line of the movie was \"Drop him\" or \"Drop her.\" I say drop this crap out of Netflix. 2.5/10."

The amount of tactical errors including the military command structure, or lack of military discipline made this very painful to watch. Even Ross Kemp did better and Ultimate force had much better plots and tactics.\n\nA designated marksmen with a 45 degree arc of fire sat and watched as multiple enemies got in position and a gun emplacement was set up... Lol lol lol\n\nMaybe if this was a random popcorn flick with a random military force it would have been better. I'm only giving it an extra star as I liked the banter and camaraderie between two of the characters (for some parts)"

Instead of making black swan look like a badass group of operators, at the intro they stage an ambush and wait for a SAS raid, and get their asses kicked by non-lethal weapons. They spray tons of lead and get not a single SAS target, they don't make them look like pros. You get your hopes up about the SAS operators going against an enemy who is properly trained & organized, but no. As soon as events start to unfold, the movie turns into a classic cat and mouse save the girl, marry the girl. Some good shooting carries you to the end of this boring script."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on most of the reviews I've read here, it appears people expect movies to be real life. Newsflash, they aren't. This movie is an adaptation of the book. It is a very good adaptation. I read the book in 2 days. Couldn't put it down. Now, I've watched the movie. I was not disappointed. I'm not a huge action movie watcher. Honestly, the draw for me was that Sam Heughan was in this as a lead. I wanted to see how he handled the character of Tom Buckingham. Again, I was not disappointed. Sam was brilliant. It was a little (actually more than a little) scary how precisely Sam played a psychopath. He embodied that character entirely. Equally, Ruby Rose was intense as Grace. Two very disciplined actors playing off of each other equals perfection. The film was cast perfectly. The dynamic between Sophie and Tom was just as it was in the book. The chemistry between Hannah and Sam was perfect for the characters and the journey they were going through. Hannah was a very strong Sophie. I was extremely impressed. The supporting cast was fantastic. Each playing their parts successfully. The storyline of the movie took the book's written word and condensed it in ways that worked. That does not often happen when bringing a book to film. It works in this one. If there was much CGI in this movie, I didn't notice it. With exception to the dilating pupils, which made the emotion of the characters evident (and I loved it), I didn't notice any other CGI. It was pretty flawless. Okay, maybe the helicopter smashing into the tower was a bit obvious, but that was about it. Lets talk about the MUSIC. The music was EVERYTHING in this movie. I LOVE this soundtrack in it's entirety. It helped with the flow of the movie. It helped to define the characters and the action. The music was perfect. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and plan to watch it again. I expect there are several new things that I will pick up on in subsequent viewings. If you enjoy action movies, I would recommend it. Just remember, it's a MOVIE. NOT real life."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some guy keeps telling his daughter how special she is because psychopaths don't feel love. Turns out dad runs a mercenary outfit called Black Swans. Both his daughter and son are part of it, but as expected, the daughter is super special and the son is supposed to be a goof who gets abused by everyone. They are hired to clear out a village to make way for a gas pipeline somewhere in Georgia. The villagers refuse and the decision is taken to wipe out all the men and boys. But one girl films it all and posts it for the world to see.\n\nThat puts the English government in a bind as for some reason the PM authorized this so they can't turn these guys, who are American but living large in England, over to Interpol who have issued a Red Notice for them. Instead he tasks the guy in charge of special forces to eliminate them. Which the team tries to do, except that super girl and brother somehow manage to escape.\n\nWe meet one special forces guy, who loves his work a bit too much. He's ready to propose to his physician girlfriend in Paris so he's going to take her by train to Paris. But wouldn't you know, black swan girl Grace makes it onto the train as well. Eventually the black swans take over the train and stop it in the tunnel. Tom quickly recognizes her, escapes and starts attacking the swans. Turns out that unbeknownst to the whole world there's also a gas pipeline running through the Paris-London tunnel. Special forces makes it to the tunnel as well and Grace demands a whole lot of money and an escape in exchange for her silence regarding the village massacre which was for the benefit of the gas company. So the usual stuff happens--Tom starts taking out the swans one by one (and there sure are a whole lot of them), the swans find out about Tom, and eventually his girlfriend, and try to use her to get to him, but he has to save a little girl, Grace has a mole inside special forces which is why they keep running into traps, and so on.\n\nEventually a deal is reached, but Grace does have other plans for her and the pipeline. And we do learn a bit more about Tom and so does he.\n\nI'm not familiar with the book, but there's a lot to like about SAS: Red Notice / SAS: Rise of the Black Swan. Cinematography is nice. I like the setting of the the Paris-London train, I don't think I've seen a movie set there before. Action is well-filmed for the most part. The political/economical aspects of the gas company and the English PM are interesting but not paid too much attention. The character of Tom and Sam Heughan make for a good lead, Andy Serkis, while he doesn't look the part, adds a bit of humor here and there. I would like to have seen them do something more with the character of Grace's brother, they were sort of setting things up for something to happen there but it never did. Also they could have given us a bit more pre-chaos scenes and characters on the train. But as always with movies that end up on Netflix, there's also some weird goofiness going on. Grace's ugly haircut is too distracting. The main problem is the utterly incompetent orchestrated music score of this film--completely out of place, setting the wrong tone for every scene; thankfully the volume is fairly low. The movie could also have been trimmed by a couple of minutes and as mentioned they could have introduced some more characters."

So to the actors: Ruby Rose should retire and find another means of employment- I think she has anyway. She was truly awful. Sam Heughan. Well, this guy plays Jamie in outlander and for those viewers who know the Jamie character well, they will recognize many of the same mannerisms, and facial expressions. If Heughan ever hopes to break loose of his strong identification with Jamie, he's going to have learn to change certain aspects of his body and facial language. Was he good in the film? Sorta. I think they tried too hard to make his character multi-dimensional and Heughan seemed to struggle with that. He's larks a spark on the screen - a star power which I believe he can achieve, but he needs a break-through opportunity and great direction to help him \"not be a Jamie\". This was not that film. Outlander may have cooked his goose for future and better opportunities. The scripting of SAS was poor as was the direction - and they weren't of any help to this film. Overall, the film wasn't a complete disaster and now that it rentable, viewing it is not total waste of your time. There are cheesy scenes, there are decent scenes. The final fight scene, however, was absurd. So get ready for that. This film was in the can for almost year before the studios locked down and the film failed to a distributor, which may tell you that my 5 rating is generous. Not awful. Not great."

But the script is clunkingly bad (a discussion with a French girl on top of the train... #shudder) and there are story segues that shock (in a bad way): at one point our hero (Sam Huegen - most recently very good as Paul Newman in \"For Olivia\") walks out of a French vineyard into a winter wonderland with 6 inches of snow! Did I miss the wardrobe???!\n\nAfter \"Twist\" this is yet another dire Sky Original movie, this time with a wasted cast.

Strangely, the movie seemed to be a vehicle for promoting Sky News, with so many TV live reports going on. I mean, really, as if they'd have access to such sensitive breaking news - in such detail - as they happen! I think not! Ruby Rose was diabolically awful (she really needs to find another profession). Andy Serkis was totally wasted in this. And how Tom Wilkinson was persuaded to get on board is a mystery! Everyone else was just hanging on for dear life until it was all over so that they could collect ther pay checks. The whole debarkle was a waste of 118 mins of my life. If this is an example of a Sky movie production, they need to stop - now! This is possibly the worst movie I've seen this year so far."

        "review_detailed_main": "Honestly, I wanted to give an 8, but I gave it a 10 to raise its average because some people obviously have an agenda. Movies are subjective. Some of the best picture nominees put me to sleep and make me wish I could turn back time. So, my thoughts-some in response to other reviews. 1) Definitely not the worst movie ever made--far from it. 2) The acting was not bad. I'll admit I'm a huge Sam Heughan fan, but I have not always liked his movies. I love him as Jamie Fraser in Outlander and Tom Buckingham is my next favorite character. He does an excellent job of playing the aloof, charming, good psychopath who doesn't understand why others think him odd. I won't spoil anything, but when he finally begins to realize he can in fact love another person, WOW. It will tear your guts out! I have seen Sam in numerous roles and interviews and I saw mannerisms and expressions in this that I have never seen before. He embodied the character. 3) Idk why some people don't like Ruby Rose. I heard some people say it was unbelievable that a small woman could be the main villain. Whatever! 4) I will say that agree the sound mixing is bad. The soundtrack by Benji Merrison is great, but it is allowed to overpower the dialogue and I too had to turn on the captions to tell what was being said. Tom Hopper is especially difficult to understand. 5) there are a few problems like, you can't just park a motorcycle on the street and board a train and surely if you are going to Paris for the weekend, you take more than a purse. Maybe the butler had delivered the luggage earlier and maybe picked up the bike. Also, I'm guessing the train does not have 5 inch scissors in triage kits in the bathroom where everyone can access them! These are problems that could be solved by a bigger budget.\n\nBottom line, it is a fun action movie and I have watched it 3 times. If it comes to a theater near me, I'll go see it on the big screen. Do yourself a favor and grab it from Redbox for $2.00 and decide for yourself. I hope to see more Tom Buckingham movies with Sam Heughan in the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "EDIT: It seems the Sam Heughan fan club have turned up en-masse to inflate the ratings for this film. Sam is OK in the film, he is good but doesn't stand out in any way, it seems they are trying to get him to be the next Bond or something, but there is NO WAY anyone could consider this film a 10/10 masterpiece, it is terrible in so many aspects.\n\nI was looking forward to watching this, and boy what a disappointment it was.\n\nThey have a half decent cast so I'm not sure how they all manage to act so unconvincingly. I think it has a lot to do with the script which is comically bad, full of plot holes and the characters motivations and consistency are all over the place. The characters actions don't make any sense a lot of the time, which would be OK if the action carried the film along, but the action sequences are also quite comically bad.\n\nThe action is like a dud firework, you expect to be at least somewhat entertained but the action is badly choreographed and very underwhelming. It like a very bad straight-to-TV 80s low budget film. Looking at the credits they have a load of people that worked on the movie, but they seemingly forgot to hire any military advisors.\n\nEven the love story (yes, it its core it really is a love story) is really corny and doesn't work. Some of the dialogue, especially in the ending is just so unbelievably, facepalmingly, bad, and not in a so-bad-its-good way.\n\nWho Dares Wins, almost 40 years old, still hasn't been bettered and if you want to watch a SAS/action movie just watch that instead it is leagues better in every way."

McNab (aka Steven Mitchell) has made a fortune out of his volumes of published works over the years, but this latest book-to-film conversion is a painful 2-hour crawl whilst dragging a broken hip.\n\nApart from the existing buildings that were used in the film, many of the tailor-made sets need redesigning: the tunnel entrance is, well you can make your own mind up about that. Then there's the acting talent (or the lack of it). Long, atmospheric looks that pass between the key players are only there to fit around the dramatic chords that go to heighten the tension - and not the other way around. The storyline has more holes than Swiss cheese and is about as convincing as Bill Clinton saying he didn't inhale.\n\nAnother reason as to why this is such a dire and stilted, clich\u00e9 ridden disaster is the fact that there are (wait for it) 34 credited producers. There's nothing quite like using the 'camel' comparison here: a camel is a horse that's been designed by a committee, and that's what we have here. A film about a British military unit deployed on British turf was shot abroad but not one of the 34 producers could convince the money people to invest in a UK shoot.\n\nThe film will probably do well amongst bedroom soldiers, Mitchell has his money but the viewing public now has an awful testimony to bad writing and even worse screenplay."

But that doesn't mean that you should ignore this film or that it's not good entertainment. If you think about it - pick an action movie, any one, and you'll find something cringe-worthy about it. This is no different. But we're not really watching this because you're a professional movie critics or because you were actually weighing between watching this or The Colour Purple. You knew what you chose and why, and this will honestly not disappoint. Good action, reckless near-immortal heroes, predictable villains and lots of senseless action. That's why! Take the movie for what it is. It's a painless way to spend the next 1h30min and although you won't really remember the details of the film, tomorrow - somewhere - you'll have a vague memory that it wasn't half bad.

Buyers beware.\n\nBut the sad truth is it's way more likely movie producers take us for such a inept herd of zero brain cell pulp eaters, that they feel they can pull any kind of crap and sell it to us passing as a quality entertainment.\n\nDull mash up cliched stories - I wouldn't even dare to say \"written\", they're not written, they are a combine of overused, cheap blocks of low tier content, thin default characters and some random \"dialogue\".\n\nPeople that don't know how to act. I get it, the story is meh. Director tells you to \"give him that hard as nails chick look to the camera and then grunt some\". But still, that girl fails that. Take some badass MMA fighter and tell her to look mean and yell, this will be at least somewhat believable.\n\nAnd how the hell is that even possible? Proper casting for any role that is not offered to A+ actors consists of dozens if not hundreds of rehearsals. You tell me Ruby Rose could win in any of them passing for a hardened character?\n\nThat beign said, not even a stellar cast could have saved this derailed (pun intended) wreck of a movie.\n\nJust go ahead and watch Under Siege 2 or something.

Noel Clarke is a decent British actor but is well suited to urban movies and maybe comedies so not sure why he's cast as a lead of an SAS team, the main hero is an unknown (at least to me) and has zero chemistry or acting gravity, Tom hopper in support should have played this role in my view.\n\nThen we have the villains, the father is elderly and could have been great but instead more screen time is given to his children. The girl - Ruby Rose is completely unbelievable. I've seen her in a couple of movies now and she's always cast as a bad ass action heroine but she's just never believable and has no charisma. The son is an unknown and is probably worse than Rose.\n\nAnyway save your time, this movie is bad and a waste of two hours of your life."

With lots of good action and an intricate plot that has some surprises, it kept the momentum going nicely. Some of the characters were a bit one dimensional and had unclear motivation, but what do you expect from an action/thriller? I haven't see Ruby Rose in her other roles, but I think she played the evil villain well. Certainly worth the price of admission, and a fun way to pass the time."

As for the rest, the plot was shocking and to echo other reviews full of clich\u00e9s, you know those films where there's a bad guy holding a detonator in his hand saying \"if you shoot I'll press the switch\" and a good guy has his gun pointing at his head and concedes, yep that's this film.\n\nCouldn't agree more about the scene with the little girl being saved hiding from bad guys and asking questions like she was on a school trip when she had been shot...... so so bad."

Her unforgettable, all equally bad \"drop him\"'s will have me cringing on her behalf for ages....oooops.\n\nI would love to see Sam Heughan playing a serious role ... soon. I am sure there is more to him than muscles and sex appeal and he owes it to himself to escape the stereotype - in this movie - same Sam, different Jamie. Additionally one wonders at various points during the movie - are we James Bonding here? Answer: trying, but not successfully.\n\nAs for the plot - some parts so good, some parts so ridiculous - how does the gas line assume a pseudo \"train station\" where everybody just \"pops out\" seemingly at a predestined place? Said gas line having already been blown up LOL. At this point I was confused, maybe this movie had been a comedy all along.\n\nIf anyone remakes this movie in the future - the liaison should be between SAS hero and Swan daughter - such energy there, and great potential for on screen polar-opposite attraction; magnetic conflict. By the way - why did you even need a Swan brother here.... like so many others, could have saved money on the budget - drop the role.\n\nAh well, not all bad."

The main character Ruby Rose, whose acting is so robotic is almost enough to compete with Nyquil as a sleeping aid is the chink in this movies armor. She resembles a young Justin Bieber and is just not likable or believable at all.\n\nWould I watch this again? ... Heck No, should you watch it? ...

Ruby Rose is the least intimidating villain I've ever seen seriously a 40kg woman going hand to hand with a professional soldier, can we stop casting Ruby Rose as a military threat she looks like she doesn't have the strength to pass basic. Also why does she have an American accent, they said her father has been in Britain for 40 years yet she's got a clear Californian accent and not even a hint of British in her? All in all the supposed elite SAS are left looking like some poorly trained local swat team rather than the hostage rescue and tactical specialists they're meant to be."

Some have critizied the editing and that it looks low budget. Well, it may be low budget - but to me it looked and sounded more realistic - I think the abrupt editing made it seem more \"documentary\" - it was also a choice. No, the plot is not uber realistic but then no worse than other action movies. I think Sam nailed it. I would certainly watch the sequel. An 8 from me. Watched a second time - still good!"

If you want to be entertained for a couple of hours SAS: Red Notice is worth your time. You could say that it was petty standard as far as action films BUT it is also unique because it isn't severely over the top. There were many action sequences but they were paced and spread out very well. Plus they seemed realistic. No heavy fake fighting choreography. No over long fight sequences either. The direction must of been \"you know all those other action films well we are going to do that but take it down 20%\". Sometimes less is more. SAS brings it but just the right amount. Plus it showcases some real and unique ways to kill people. The other thing that is interesting is this isn't an action hero movie. The main character Tom Buckingham is not the typical hero. Typical heroes usually kill for a good moral reason. Tom kills because well that is his job and he likes his job. He has a functioning mental disorder called psychopathy which allows him to kill and still sleep at night. One key question moving on for the sequel to come is will Tom Buckingham continue to find his sensitivity chip and become a full feeling person? Sam Heughan and Ruby Rose were great in their respective psychopath rolls. The rest of the cast were good too. I enjoyed the storyline even though at times it seem predictable. The good for me was the action. The bad for me was there was some editing issues and the production level, while decent enough, still could be even better. The great was the acting and the pacing of the movie. I look forward to the sequel hoping with the success of this movie MORE MONEY will come it's way to beef up the production level."

The only way anyone with two brain cells to rub together can ever make this scenario as believable as this debacle of a movie, is by suspending your belief in reality. Even if there were an infinite amount of parallel universes, this scenario could never be possible with the same parameters of life as we know it. This movie would've been an eight or nine, had they just used any other man on earth as the protagonist. Undeniably Forrest Gump would've been more believable then Mary Sue, I mean Ruby Rose as the protagonist."

Sorry Sam don't call us well call you.\n\nWe had more fun coming up with alternative working titles. We came up with 'Die Softer' or 'Dover, I've Fallen' (one for the Vic Reeves fan), or Tommy English.\n\nTheres only so many time you can hide under a train, or on top of a train, or next to a train and the tension falls flatter than than the train tracks.\n\nThe 'heist' plot is clunky and unimaginative, which might explain why the director just gives up on it and just edits a series of action sequences together. I say 'edit' but that's being generous. The scenes are slammed together without finesse or care.\n\nThe political corruption story line is equally mishandled. The UK government is involved, the PM is implicated, but honestly who cares?\n\nThe dialogue is awful too. Not knowingly bad like a good Arnie movie, just laughably terrible.\n\nDo yourself a favour rewatch Kingsman, London has Fallen, Die Hard. Or even make you own film with a smart phone and video editing software. I promise you your writing, directing or editing will be no worse than this. And your family actors will have more chance of being the next bond."

The story is bad, the pacing terrible, there's no character to really root for because they are mostly all equally terrible people, except for the doctor.\n\nDo yourself a favour and don't watch SAS: Red Notice (2021).

But that was only part of the issue.\n\nThe biggest failure, atleast from my perspective, was how significantly the producers failed to convey even an ounce of realism. Considering this movie was largely based around the SAS (given the title), one would immediately make comparisons to the likes of \"Who Dares Wins\" or \"Ultimate Force\", which both featured a fair degree of realism in terms of the British Military.\n\nHowever this movie seems to have been put together by a team who had no idea who the SAS are, let alone how they might perform or even what equipment they may use... From make-believe weapons, to Generals with cockney accents, this seems to take everything \"genuine\" that may be associated with the British Military, and throw it out of the window.\n\nAfter 20 minutes of watching this movie, I was prepared to turn it off, but I was so disgusted I wanted to write a review, and thus felt I needed to watch it until it's shameful conclusion to reputably do so."

There are always shades of gray when dealing with covert ops. Sam Heughan shines in this film as much more than an action hero with a layered performance. He discovers that he is a \"good psychopath\" in love with an empathetic doctor. He wonders if he is even capable of loving someone and we are committed to finding this out along with his girlfriend."

He truly makes you believe what is going on with the range of facial emotions he can project. The cast was stellar and Ruby Rose was so good at her job she came off as a scary psychopath you don't want to run into. The Andy McNab - Tom Buckingham character is a series of three books, that makes you wonder will they expand and continue like the James Bond spy series from Ian Fleming? Only time will tell, but for right now, I see there is an action movie future for Sam Heughan."

I read the reviews out to husband, who is not really into action movies much, space is his thing, and he actually got perturbed at some of the ridiculous reasons that were being listed by people as reasons for not liking the movie. \"Okay! Now I WANT to see this film!\", he said.\n\nFor me, someone who does not like the violence in action movies, I was ready to pass on this movie even though I like Sam Heughen in \"Outlander\". But, I thought I would try and watch, and just duck when something might upset me, but I didn't really need to do that at any time throughout. Sam became Tom Buckingham and was never Sam Heughen (or Jamie Fraser) for me from the get go. Very believable.\n\nHusband says it was what you would expect from a movie of this genre. You have to suspend belief in some details and not nit pick because, after all, it is fiction and an action movie and it's super fast paced.\n\nAs for Ruby Rose, sorry , we'd not heard of her before this. Some reviewers panned her acting skills. We disagree. She played the part of a emotionally challenged person who had no feelings for anything. She played that part to the hilt. She did well.\n\nSome edits had me lost, wondering what happened there? Special effects were good. Supporting characters were fine.\n\nI'd watch a sequel if they do make one. This, coming from a very old school, classic movie lover. That's an amazing statement for me. That's saying a lot.\n\nMake some popcorn. Watch this movie. I can't say, \" It's good clean fun\". It's an action movie! But, I liked it. Husband liked it. Bring it, Tom Buckingham !"

It just does not make sense as a whole.\n\nThe acting: sometimes average, but mostly mediocre. In a couple of cases just outright wooden and bad (many mention Ruby Rose - I agree). The SAS operators behaving completely amateurishly in a fight is a dead giveaway.\n\nThe scenery: a couple of nice aerial views (with one CGI'd so badly, the Eurotunnel seems to turn 90 degrees downwards just to get underwater). The rest is studio-made and a selection of creative filters were applied to make it look more \"actionly\".\n\nIf I wanted to watch a superhero movie and willingly abandon all logic, I'd watch some fantasy flick or a Batman movie. This movie aspires to be at least plausible, but is so far fetched, it does not make sense.\n\nTL;DR - don't watch it. I did so you don't have to."

Sam's interactions with Tom Hopper were some of the best parts of the film. I appreciate it must be difficult to portray a person with little obvious emotion (Sam managed) but Ruby Rose spent most of her time stomping around with an expressionless face.\n\nIf they make a sequel, I hope the script is better and Sam Heughan and Tom Hopper get many scenes together"

The infamous SAS team working together as one; and, the intensity of Tom Buckingham (Sam Heughan) give every scene authenticity. The cast is amazing and have great chemistry. The visual effects, CGI and Cinematography are phenomenal. The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant and enhances every mile of their mission. Loved every second of this thrilling movie."

Sam Heughan is amazing with his range of emotions. You can see when his switch is flipped, he could have easily gone to the dark side but refused to. Ruby Rose is great as the villain and does a great job of being cold blooded, stoic, menacing and generally kicking the butts of men twice her size. Hannah John-Kamen does an excellent of playing Tom Buckingham's love interest, Dr. Sophie Hart. She helps Tom realize he's actually a good psychopath. I enjoyed every minute.

This is where I felt sick to my stomach, seeing the people of the Swan family go from \"normal\" people to complete psychopaths.\n\nThis movies tries to be a mix between \"Die Hard\" and \"Under Seige 2\" and I guess it does a decent job when it comes to action. The problem is that it is pretty boring. The main protagonist is mildly interesting in that he loves \"winning\"(killing people).\n\nThis trait gets some small amount of exploration towards the end but I wish they did more with it and dared to leave on the bitter note that it sets up.\n\nI don't have a problem with Ruby Rose being a action star, I think she probably can do some of the physical work herself but when a grown muscular man has trouble taking her down in a grappling fight I can't help but roll my eyes.\n\nHollywood could do better in portraying strong females and this sort of overcompensation is not the way. Gina Carano or someone like her would be a better fit for that kind of physically strong character.\n\nRuby kind of pulls of the commanding presence at times but I still find it hard to think that anyone would follow her after her dad dies.\n\nAll in all: this movie is alright if you have very low expectations.

Even the acting was affected although some actors/ actresses had quite a potential.\n\nA good director can make good actors brilliant.\n\nAs someone said in the movie: \"You're only as good as your worst day, huh?\"\n\nBr, U."

        "review_detailed_main": "Man who is hidden in facility while it's under attack single-handedly fights back and takes down the bad guys... sounds familiar. Unfortunately, SAS: Red Notice is much more forgettable than its Die Hard ancestor.\n\nIt's an intriguing film with potential for expansion if given the right touch-ups, but it could have been more thought-provoking than it was given the subject matter. It feels like it's missing some key details, but it also feels gritty and real. It's borderline (and I went back and forth on rating and verdict), but it just barely makes the cut.\n\nVerdict: Watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "SAS: Red Notice (or Rise of Black Swan--I'm getting these two titles) is an adequate and perfunctory action special ops movie. Their \"Best\" agent just happens to be on a train with his girlfriend that is taken hostage. Coincidence! The action is well choreographed, but as typical, only realistic if there is a \"Super Spy\" to do it.\n\nThe introduction of some moral lesson doesn't add much to the movie. In reality, it muddies the water when the film doesn't need to have anything extra to make it watchable. Issues of sociopathy just seem a bit overwrought given professional mercenaries, professional soldiers, profits at any cost, and government power are the other stakes in the movie.\n\nActors do well with the script. Ruby Rose seems perfectly suited to be a cold-blooded, amoral mercenary. Sam Heughan does well in his leading role, and maybe someone should consider him for another Super Spy role.\n\nWatchable as noted before, but don't look too closely."
