        "review_detailed_main": "Few critics, few including Rediff ones whom I look for some good writing, have rated low to BMB. The reason they give is that movie lacks coherence and clarity. Really? I think they should only rate Hollywood movies because whoever thinks this movie is no good does not know what Hindi cinema is. Farhan has done an awesome job, and if I say awesome then it is not for his physique and dialogue delivery but for the transformation, he has gone to become Milkha Singh. We as an audience witness the physical stress and labor that an athlete as likes of Milkha Singh undergo to become a 'flying Sikh'. Hindi cinema celebrates the life of this living legend with songs and drama and music. Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra has done a decent job, still; I fell he could have done a lot better especially in the scenes of Milkha's childhood memories. His attempt of giving the movie an epic convention seriously affected the narrative portion. However, all this can be sided by the grandeur of Farhan's effort. I would like to mention a statement of one of the rediff users who wrote against critics who are undermining the effect of this movie: \"note that 400mtrs is a very difficult race to run. it is at the border of quick races and long jogs. after partition India did not have either the experience nor the infra to produce runners for 400mtrs. So Milkha was a true champion in every sense. If critics pull films like these down for abstract reasons\u0085we will forever have 20 goons flying in the air with one punch from one man. Grow up critics.\"\n\nSo true."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag works for two basic reasons. One it is based on the story of a sports person whose personal life is dramatic enough to keep you engaged apart from its racing track achievements and second it is played by Farhan Akhtar who plays his role as if he is really Milkha Singh himself. Farhan Akhtar excels playing Milkha Singh like Ben Kingsley excelled playing Gandhi. Farhan Akhtar seems to be enjoying every bit of the movie. When he runs, he runs like a tiger. When he dances, he dances like a pure Punjabi. When he loves, he loves with innocence and passion. Farhan Akhtar can easily be given all best actor awards of 2013. All supporting actors give their best. Divya Dutta is excellent, Sonam Kapoor looks fresh, Pawan Malhotra and Parkash Raj's performance are heartwarming. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is first rate and awe inspiring. Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra like an expert captain provides movie its uniqueness, technical perfection, soul and purpose. Like an every fantastic experience, this also comes with its dull moments. Movie takes around extra half an hour before reaching to its finale. Rangrezz song could have been avoided and prolonged sequences of Milkha's achievements could have been shortened. Dilip Tahil playing Pandit Nehru looks like a missed stroke. At the end, you can safely say, you had a great time running with Farhan Akhtar for more than 3 hours. Run to your nearest theater now to watch this powerful biopic."

        "review_title": "A commendable film on Milkha Singh's inspiring tale!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The sheer joy of watching someones hard-work come to life on the screen is inspiring indeed. To portray Milkha Singh's struggle and achievements and his zeal to succeed at the world stage, required an equally earnest and dedicated effort by the filmmakers. This effort is reflected in Bhag Milkha Bhag, and is what makes the film commendable.\n\nFarhan Akhtar's tough physical training for this role pays great dividends on screen. The races look pretty convincing because of Farhan's effort and soon you find yourself cheering for Milkha, if not loudly in the movie-hall then at-least in your head.\n\nThe non-linear narrative of the film keeps the movie engrossing, so although you know the basic outline of the story, you can't really guess what would happen next. The story is narrated by Milkha's coach Gurudev Singh played brilliantly Pavan Malhotra by who first recognizes the Milkha Singh's talent.\n\nThe women in Milkha Singh's life play a very important role, be it his elder sister (played by Divya Dutta)who single handedly brings Milkha up, or the love of his life (Sonam Kapoor) who is the reason why he changes his unruly ways. Although one must add, that the part where Milkha goes on a romp after a party with Stella(Rebecca Brooks) during the 1956 Melbourne Games does look a bit forced.\n\nSome people may have qualms with the dance sequences but personally they were quite enjoyable and didn't jar the narrative. Keep an eye out for the song with Sonam Kapoor who plays Milkha Singh's love interest in the film. The shot with them both on top of a bridge with green, swiftly flowing water below was captured beautifully.\n\nThe director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has a signature style which is apparent like from his previous films- Rang De Basanti and Delhi-6. He can merge music and visuals to great effect. Although in some scenes a little bit of restraint in the stylistic details and drama could have certainly helped.\n\nTo emerge as a world leading athlete from India just after independence, when I suppose sports facilities weren't great, with the scars of the partition deep in his mind is some achievement. We salute you Milkha Singh! One must commend the efforts of the filmmakers to bring the story to us."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well I was not excited enough for this movie, but when the trailers started coming and then the music, my curiosity began to flourish little bit. But the main reason I went to saw this movie was because I heard almost 50-60 review from my friends and not even single person had a negative review against it. And when I saw this, it really blew me away because it had many mixtures which made this movie work. First of all FARHAN AKHTER is at its best, no doubt its his best performance till date. It was like we were seeing real Milkha Singh on screen. Divya Dutta is awesome, Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh & Prakash Raj have really performed well. Sonam Kapoor is completely waste though her role was very little, so you won't miss her. Rebecca Breeds looks fabulous, Dilip Tahil as Jawahar Lal Nehru was not a master stroke. Screenplay was good, music was fabulous and the background score really kept the life in each and every scene. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's best work till date also. YOU DARE TO MISS THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN RISK !!!"

Farhan Akhtar is like the epitome of dedication towards Milkha Singh's character. He was running like a pro. Cinematography was just amazing. Many shots were just breathtaking. Direction was just perfect and the casting was sensibly done. Parallel storytelling kept the movie balanced between Milkha Singh's life and his sports career. The trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did their job as always.\n\nBut one of all, Farhan Akhtar rocked. He has always given his best in every field he has ever stepped in to. Respect for Farhan Akhtar, respect for Milkha Singh, the true hero."

Based on the real life story of an awesome athlete \"The Flying Sikh\" Milkha Singh, the story solely revolves around the hardships and horrors of his life. The whole film in a sense, is perfect.\n\nDirector: Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Now, i don't think i have to tell you about his past achievements. After delivering one of the greatest blockbuster of bollywood \"Rang De Basanti\", Mehra is back with a bang!!!!! Direction is superb with almost no loopholes left to be noticed.\n\nScriptwriter: Prasoon Joshi This National Awardee (Taare Zameen Par) needs no introduction. Script of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has been beautifully transcribed and and more beautifully presented on the silver screen.\n\nActor: Farhan Akhtar yes, this is solely a Farhan Akhtar movie. This multi talented person has put his heart and sole in the movie. His talent can only be judged by his dedication. Farhan Akhtar's talent has been put to justice. And Pavan Malhotra's role as Coach Gurudev Singh also fits.\n\nAll in all, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a must watch for all movie lovers, sports lovers and Indian History lovers!!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "In less than ten minutes into the film, you get goosebumps all over your body. You get into high-spirits and then the story of The Flying Sikh begins...\n\nIt talks more about perseverance and how man can excel even in the worst conditions than the actual atheltic history. Milkha Singh, wonderfully portrayed by the talented Farhan Akhtar is one character that induces inspiration. Akhtar now has totally proved himself as a successful actor. His demeanor is appreciable and the film does showcase his hard-work. Supporting cast is very good as well. But, the actresses were sidelined which is very apt for a bio-film.\n\nMost of the story is told in flashbacks and there is where the screenplay works. It grabs your attention. The childhood story MAY bore you a little, but every other biopic has to be honest. Much like last year's Paan Singh Tomar, BMB does have lots of surprises in store. The relation of every detail is astronomical and very well adapted. Fresh writing, inventive editing & below-average SFX/CGI makes me wanna give it a humble 8.0/10.\n\nThe songs & score are energetic which do cause an urge that we run with the athletes on-screen. That is the power of Rakeysh O Mehra and his crew. I was blown away by Akhtar's bod and his expressions. Humor touches the script at times, as well.\n\nOverall, an entertaining biography which is well-written and well- executed. Only, the running time of 190 minutes COULD'VE... could've been shortened. Otherwise, everybody rise for this cinema of massive potential.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A very good entertainer with mentoring prowess. It feels good that the team has brought an epitome into reel. Kudos!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nProfanity: No | Nudity: Mild | Sex/Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Violence/Gore: Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Smoking/Drugs: No"

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched a Paid-Preview of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag last night and I was star-strucked by its fame watching the house-full crowd in the theater (as if it is the first day of the release). When I first watched its teaser in October last year and first trailer in January..it had me going since then, and now I am happy that my expectation was worth it.\n\nBRIEF STORY & REVIEW SKETCH.\n\nThe film is about Milkha Singh and introspects his being through the eyes of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. There are no twists or turns in the movie but its just a tale told on a clean slate. Film starts with a defeat in Olympics, carried on when Milkha refuses to visit Pakistan (has his valid reasons for doing so) but Pt. Nehru sends Milkha's latter and former coach to Chandigarh so that they can convince him for the tour. During the train-journey, Pavan Malhotra (former coach) reveals the story of Milkha Singh and his reason to not visit Pakistan to the other two gentlemen which unleashes an assiduous, interesting and penultimate story about the legend. This Sikh has been running his whole life, starting his first race for a glass of milk to the Olympics..and never ending. It reminds me of the great metaphor ' The race of Life'. Milkha Singh ran to save his life, to eat, to dream, for love, for country, for passion and to overcome his own personal fears, ''and what a run it was!''. BMB traces his scarred childhood, brutalized by India's partition ; followed by penury and petty crimes. He finds the purpose of life when he falls for Beeru (Sonam). Joins the Indian Army and since then his passion, eagerness and situations along with the efforts (negative & positive both) made by different people led him to become an athlete, a runner who remained uncased even by his own daemons. He keeps on breaking records but witnesses a heartbreaking defeat in Rome Olympics (1960) but thats not it, he takes it in his stride, overcomes his catastrophic past which was the cause of Olympic defeat and emerges out to be a clear winner.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nROPM delivers yet again a tale in his own style (fond of changing tones in his films), where the length is bit of a disappointment otherwise the content heals the flaw with a superb execution and sticky pace, that tops with Farhan Akhtar's outstanding performance (the actor gave his blood n sweat into the character) and he emerges out to be the soul of the movie physically and mentally. The story by Prasoon Joshi is admirable and the track 'Zinda' is well written by him, beautifully composed by Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy and descriptively choreographed by Shaimak Davar. The background score by the trio adds on to the whole movie. The performances from the other cast is noticeable where Divya Dutta deserves a special mention (Hats off to the lady for creating a great impact in spite of having such a small role) The film truly deserves to be one of the best that Bollywood has offered this year so far and I hope to see some more in-depth biopics like this in coming future.\n\nI'd rate this dig-till-hell marvel biopic as 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Last week two films watched with a very late decision, first one Pacific Rim and second one Bhag Milkha Bhag. Love the former more than BMB. Anyways, starting with BMB-Biopic of Legendary Sprinter Padma Shri Milkha Singh.\n\nIn first impression, it looks like more commercial than a biopic for me and that's hurt a lot. Some unnecessary scenes and avoidable songs stretch the film more than 3 hrs. And you may feel bore, searching for the interval. Film turns little faster after the Sydney Olympics. But it looks ugly for a legendary, how it shows about the reason of his failure; though I don't know what was happened in his real life. It's a shame O P Mehra and screenwriter Prasoon Joshi adopts a manipulative, melodramatic approach to highlight Milkha's achievements and justify his failures.\n\nBut everything is very well managed by the genius Farhaan. It looks merely original in a scene where he slaps himself. The actor in fact, and his committed performance, is the film's biggest strength. From his convincing accent and his dialogue delivery to the sheer beast of his physical presence, Farhan is riveting as Milkha. Don't know about others, but like the appearance of Dilip Tahil as Pandit Neheru and Milkha's earliest coach, Gurudev Singh. However panoramic in scope, usually boil down to a greatest-hits collection, and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, for all its sepia-toned flashbacks and terrific training sequences is no exception. Though, hard to believe Mikha trained in Ladak by the National Coach; but nevertheless the background looks more than awesome. Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra able to recreate the same impression in a scene when two Milkha (Young & Child) run together; just the way he did in Rang De Basanti with Bhagat Singh.\n\nFew silly slip-ups that you never expect from a movie like BMB. Divya Dutta, as Milkha's doting sister is the only character in the film, who appears to have never aged. Mikha rides in a Royal Enfield Battle Field with wearing a Titan Edge, looks more than modern. And even Air India (not Indian) flight with a Kingfisher like Air Hostess; force you to feel about the year. May be I missed the recruitment part as it was not the first show. But, if there was any scene like this, should not be edited where you have many less important than that. Feel unfortunate having a single scene for Rome Olympics. But every Indian will love the Mikha's last run in Pakistan and becomes Flying Sikh.\n\nOverall BMB is a 3 hrs package of lesser biopic, more commercial and extra ordinary Farhan. It may not impress an average moviegoer, for it comes across as a very slow film. But it will certainly leave you with a sense of pride for having the legendary athlete as a fellow countryman. However, you can't compare it with its counterpart \"Paan Sing Tomar\" or \"Chakde India\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a confused film at its very best. Scratching only the surface of the many themes and characters that are part of it. What grants it grace is its music Zinda and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag have an absolutely uplifting effect. Each 'Aho' uttered by Farhan was hurting my ears and hisPunjabi was generally painful almost as much as the juvenile \"Relax Singh\" joke. Milkha's angst with his past could have provided the requisite tension to the film. But what is a true blue Hindi film without a villain, so we have Pakistan and its menacing athlete with a twirled mustache and nasty prick for a coach. Milkha Singh and his coach on the other hand are simple loving creatures. You can sit through the film (3 hours), enjoy it even and still come out at the end to realize the only characters that are etched out well are those played by Divya Dutta (Milkha's sister), Pavan Malhotra (First Coach), Art Mallik (Milkha's father). Jabtej Singh Singh as young Milkha was heartbreakingly good and streets ahead of the fumbling mumbling performance of the senior. The credibility of bringing depth here too lies with the performers; it is not as though the film makers went the extra length for any of the characters. Why was Sonam Kappor in the film at all?\n\nUnwittingly, one is drawn towards making a comparison between this and Pan Singh Tomar. While being poles apart in terms of the larger treatment and of course the story line, there are common threads. The track, the army and humble beginnings being a few, but this film definitely lost its way somewhere. Me thinks Farhan wanted to run and flaunt what many might consider a gorgeous body. Om Prakash Mehra wanted to make a film about athletics. And they've dealt with the film with just about as much depth. We are none wiser about the kind of man Milkha Singh was nor is it clear where his motivation stems from.\n\nShankar Ehsaan Loy were part of the graces and the title track made me wish that it was made during the time that Milkha Singh was active on the track. The sheer power of hearing such a track would have got him a couple of more golds!"

The story is about one man but he is not the only one who plays the role exceedingly well. After watching this I don't think any one who acted in this film was remotely bad. They all acted amazingly well and gave true justice to their own characters.\n\nOnly drawback that i can mention here is the time. i think the movie is a bit too long. For the first 2 and half hours i didn't really feel the need to look at my watch.\n\nOverall a refreshing film with excellent story and great acting."

        "review_detailed_main": "BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is riveting to the core and inspiring. No doubts about that. But the disappointment comes to spoil the thrill.\n\nBMB has a runtime of almost 3 hours 15 minutes that is too much. The film's biggest flaw is the editing. The film needs dome serious editing not because its 3 hours but because it gets boring at many places. The training sequence mainly needs trimming. The film is otherwise a good watch because it's brimming with inspiration that young India needs.\n\nThe direction is good and RAKYESH creates the retro look well. The music by SHANKAR-EHSAAN-LOY is amazing, especially ZINDA and MERA YAAR.\n\nFARHAN AKHTAR is the soul of the film. He's not actually acting- he's being Milkha, he's living Milkha. SONAM KAPOOR was paid 11 rupees for this film. I say she's over-paid. She is a joke amidst all the stunning performers. The rest of the cast does really well.\n\nAltogether, watch BMB if slow-paced biopics and inspirational pieces suit your taste. I'll go for a 5 for the film and an extra star for Farhan. So 6/10 for this flick that is dedicated but often falls short and bores you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rating: 3.6/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid\n\nRaw, passionate, intense, emotional, and inspirational; \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is quite a competent retelling of Milkha Singh's journey, which just falls short of being a completely rousing epic. Director Rakesh Omprakash Mehra does a fine job of putting us right into the protagonist's shoes and he literally makes us feel the trials, tribulations, metamorphosis, and triumphs of our hero.\n\nNow, if the Director only had done away with some unnecessary songs, tightened up the narrative a bit, trimmed some loose ends, and focused a bit more on certain important sporting accomplishments of the sprinter's career; the film could have been so much more memorable. The tone of this sports-drama could have also done with a more stirring background score.\n\nAlso, Farhan Akhtar's performance while dedicated and nuanced, is not that great like it is being made out. At times his accent does falter and his dialog delivery might make you forget occasionally that he's Milkha and not Farhan. The performances that really stand out in the movie are Yograj Singh's, Divya Dutta'a, Pavan Malhotra's, and surprisingly even Prakash Raj's (Director's please give this talented actor better roles).\n\nAlas, we have to make do with a film about one of India's greatest sporting icons, that almost delivers on its promise. Perhaps, the most significant feat of the movie is that we feel like running and celebrating along with Milkha Singh."

        "review_title": "Living in its moments and surrendering in its narration",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Indian film industry's most loud and noisy version Bollywood has survived most of the last three decades without telling any story to its audience. The only creative aspect of Bollywood has been its lilting music which is created by those not so good looking talented singers and musicians who are left to watch beautiful( fare skinned) actresses and actors with chiseled body(Steroids) dance and lip sync over their hard work. So whenever a story does drop by in front of them they stumble and fail to narrate it in front of their audience.\n\n'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is one those important true stories that needed to be told by someone other than Bollywood. With its very prejudice and narrow minded thinking it fails to liberate an inspirational personal life story beyond their myopic views.\n\nMilkha Singh, the Indian athlete who was one of the few bright spots during the early years of independent India was like his nation lived its childhood in bloody tragedy of partition. Born in a Sikh community in pre-partition Multan, Milkha survived the partition with his elder sister along with her abusive husband.\n\nMilkha goes on to survive the hard ships in the refugee camp in new born India by hook or crook. His persona comes off as lively and mischievous. In a very prolonged flashback we are shown his small town love affair and his tryst with the law. The director uses these sequences to insert the usual Bollywood machismo with girls shying from kisses & hugs along with tons of humorous sequences that are inconsequential to the storyline.\n\nAll these flashbacks are narrated to the secretary of Prime Minister Nehru during his journey by train to Chandigarh to meet Milkha Singh personally at the behest of Mr. Nehru. He is meeting Milkha to convince him to go to Pakistan for the Indo-Pak friendship games to be held in Lahore. He is accompanied by Milkha's athletic Coach in the Army and his current Indian national team coach who are trying to narrate Milkha's reason for not visiting Pakistan.\n\nHis refusal is due to his childhood traumas based in Multan i.e. now in Pakistan. He watched his father's head being chopped by Islamic fanatics after his father forced him to run away from the massacre. He does not feel any strain of friendship towards the neighboring state.\n\nWhile the narration is about his refusal to go to Pakistan, there is no reference to it for over two hours into the movie until the Secretary himself stops the coaches in between to make them aware of his and audiences dilemma that what has been narrated has very little to do with Mr. Milkha Singh's refusal to head to Pakistan.\n\nThroughout the narration we see Milkha join the Indian Army and dance with his colleagues in the dormitory, he grows up being a small time burglar and falls in love with the village beauty and sing and dream and then when he goes to Melbourne Olympics, he falls for a Blonde Australian and they sing and dance. By this time the murmurs and the desperation inside the movie theater is palpable as it is already over two hours. When the movie finally reaches its climax after over 180 minutes we witness a fleeting moment of a real historical sports movie with a race in Lahore that include Asian Champion Abdul Khaliq. The interjecting images of the race watched by Pakistani dictator Ayub Khan (who confers Milkha with the title 'Flying Sikh') and listened around India through Radio it is an easy win for Milkha but an important personal win. And the moment passes away as all the side characters begin to do Bhangra dance for the 100th times as they did for many other inconsequential sequences and occasions.\n\nBut nothing less is expected from Bollywood makers who are diagnosed with narrative mood swings that could be compared to a bi-polar person. They never stay in the moment of a storyline and try to squeeze out every existing emotion one way or the other.\n\nApart from the sharply written character of Milkha i.e. comparable to his sharply chiseled body none of the characters hold together for more than few minutes. They are either left praising Milkha or being jealous or falling head over heels to fall in love with him. Pakistani athletes are characterized as they way Indians feel they would behave with flaring nostrils and deep disdain for anything Indian (may be Abdul Khaliq did act arrogantly in front of Milkha).\n\nBut it has to do with some deep rooted feeling for white blonde among the film makers, for the way they portrayed Milkha's two love stories. While his village love is shown in a very asexual manner, where when the couple goes away for privacy they make childish gestures of love towards each other alone, but with the Australian it is filled with sex and booze from first night. May be they do go far off from village to make out, but for Bollywood to show intimacy it is easy way round to hook up with a blonde white woman.\n\nSuch views and forced dramatization of a very personal story discourages the narrative of the film to go along coherently. Unfortunately Bollywood manages to bring down the story of a national hero to its knees and successfully fares well where every other forgettable Bollywood movies fare; in its moments. In moments during Milkha racing from the pains of running bare feet to running for life, 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' finds its footing that are rare and too few in myriad of drama and Bhangra."

So much respect for Sardar Milkha Singh ji for all his hard work and for all those people who endured what they endured during the partition of India and Pakistan 1947. Milkha Singh..Nobody could have played this role better than Farhan Akhtar...an absolute legend. His work in the movie is absolutely Mind blowing. His acting was so genuine I can not imagine there to be a person who wasn't moved. This movie absolutely touched my heart and shook me to my very core. I laughed, cried, got excited, nervous like I was there witnessing it all in real. Sardar Milkha Singh there SHOULD be a public holiday every year in your honor.

IN first 15 minutes, I was sure these 3 hours are going to be ride with goosebumps, excitements.\n\nYou can feel the pain of failure and happiness of each and every success of legendary Indian athlete Jeev Milkha Singh. Farhan is in so much of depth with this role that you will love it. It is a complete 3 hours treat which gives you a lot of lessons. That it is not easy to succeed.

This type of movie can inspire a generation. Director was so indulged in the film that rather making a film he was just living it. His approach towards every scene is very balanced. Movie length is 3.20 hours but you won't regret for spending this much of time. Even, you enter in film with biased opinion to hate it, slowly movie opens it arms to embrace you and eventually you have to fall in love with it. Screenplay and dialogues by Prasoon Joshi is too good. He has given minute details of the characters very well. When, Milkha Singh prior coaches come to convince him to go to Pakistan, that time he was a rich person, his servant comes with the tea tray but he prefers to make tea by himself and he knows well that how much sugar his coaches prefer. This scene reflects his modesty, honesty and respect without speaking a word. There are so many scenes of this caliber. Dialogues are very balanced, sweet and inspiring. Few of them are \" Unche Udne Wale Parindon Ko Chhote Chhote Darakhton Se Dil Nahi Lagana Chahiye......Main Aapki insult nahi kar raha hun ji, Bas Khud Se Lad Raha Hun...Wahan KI hawa Mein Mere Apno Ke Khoon Mile Hue Hain, main unme sans nahi le paunga\". There was least scope for humor but it is blended with right intensity at right place. Performance wise Farhan Akhter is mesmerizing. This is not acting; it is simply transforming yourself in to the character. Simply awesome. The boy who played, young Milka Singh is amazing. He looks so innocent and fierce. Sonam Kapoor looks adorable. Divya Datta is mind blowing. She can make your eyes moist so many times, with her expression only, without speaking words. Pawan Malhotra as his first coach is very good. Prakash Raji is fine. Music by Sankar Ehsan Loy is completely blended with mood of film. It gives proper pace to film when it requires. This type of films make me proud to be part of this industry. Hats off to complete team of this film."

        "review_title": "Each subplot has been stretched 400m when it could've ended in a 100m dash. That doesn't stop Bhaag Milkha Bhaag from being a thoroughly entertaining biopic, Bollywood style.",
        "review_detailed_main": "It has been a while since Bollywood has brought out a three hour epic, and therefore I was apprehensive about the audience response towards Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, which runs close to 189 minutes. Predictably, a couple of youngsters began texting on their cell-phones ten minutes after the movie began. This activity however stopped after a while, and the theater hall became unusually silent and more responsive towards the film than the PJs (poor jokes) messaged by their buddies on WhatsApp. The girl besides me too paid attention (reacting stupidly with a 'Eww!' every time Farhan bled or spat) as the movie paced towards its finisher. Just at the end, this same girl who spent the last two and three-fourth hours cackling at the most inappropriate moments (carrying all the symptoms of a 'Dumb Blonde', except she was brunette) said what can be the best way to summarize this film: Every subplot has been stretched too long. I too had the same thought running in my head, but to hear these words from her mouth made it easier for me to understand why this movie doesn't work the way it should.\n\nDirector Rakyesh Om Prakash Mehra has indeed stretched each subplot to a four hundred metre stretch when he could've ended it all in a hundred metre dash; this wasn't unexpected really, as his first and probably the best effort to date Rang De Basanti itself lumbered as it came to a tragic close. This is a thoroughly entertaining biopic Bollywood style, which looks back at itself, frets that it hasn't done enough to honor Milkha's glory (and enough to become commercial), and so adds more and more till it exacerbates its weaknesses and exhausts us patience. It's like watching a Life Time achievement honoree who just doesn't know when to end his speech; you either need a Professor Umbridge to 'Hem Hem' him or a Meira Kumar to cry 'Baith Jaiye!'.\n\nAnyone who has seen Orson Welles' Citizen Kane will remember how Kane's life was seen through the eyes of different narrators, each giving an insight of his or her experience with the publishing tycoon. No one says anything he or she cannot know, and that's what makes their stories fascinating and believable. Now what would be the chances of Milkha Singh telling his coach Gurudev that he had slept with the Australian girl on their Melbourne tour? Or that he had snubbed the reigning Indian female swimmer's advances? Writer Prasoon Joshi thinks nobody would notice this implausibility but it ain't that hard to figure out; the story's framing device could've had two narrators \u2013 Gurudev, who would narrate about Milkha's training, and Milkha himself, who would take us to more personal memories using flashbacks. We shouldn't be blamed for going 'Huh?! But how does he know that?' often during the film.\n\nThere is a 'havan' song in the film which has stirred Hindu organizations, who demand that the part be removed. Yes, the song should be removed but not for the reason they're giving; the real reason is that it's an unnecessary number beginning abruptly and making little impact on the film's continuity. The romance between Milkha and Biro (played by Sonam Kapoor, who seems out of place in every film she has starred in, especially here where she sounds like a 'Mehemsaab' in a little village) is given too much screen time; far more interesting is the romance between Milkha and Australian Stella, which is dominated by music when words could've made their moments sweeter.\n\nScenes which could've been inspiring are made insipid with unrequired gags, and many points could've been subtler and more incisive. A cutting remark by a Pakistani coach, for example, didn't require to be highlighted with such emphasis (close up shot of Milkha's face losing color followed by another close up of the haughty Pakistani coach) and could've been replaced with subtle digs usually heard among rivals. The felicitation at the end takes too long to end, and I personally felt the film could've ended right after Milkha's personal journey reached its resolution.\n\nYet, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an enormously entertaining and sometimes engrossing biopic (Mehra's especially strong when it comes to transitions; the occasional shifts to Milkha's childhood is especially worth a watch); its lead Farhan Akhtar is a strong presence who is consistently watchable, faltering only towards the end when the emotions he needs to bring are too overwhelming for him. It's funny how whenever I heard 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!' I could also hear 'Run Forrest Run!' in my mind. That's a line from the Tom Hanks film 'Forrest Gump, an emotionally richer (much richer) movie. Try watching that film after Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and you'll see the difference.\n\nFull review on http://sashankkini.wordpress.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie begins in 1960 with Milkha's failed attempt at securing a medal during the Rome Olympics. Despondent, he tries to withdraw from a government-orchestrated race in Pakistan. One of the organizers can't comprehend why Milkha would quit, but the runner's coach explains (complete with sorrowful music) that the young man has personal reasons. Naturally, the government official asks for further explanation. And, boy, does he get an answer. Some of the stories offer a bit of comedy, a chance to stage a requisite Bollywood musical number or offer some insight into Milkha's personality. There is a sweet subplot involving the beloved sister that raised him and some lively comic relief from his early days in the military. The movie also spotlights the moment Milkha first discovered competitive running. The Movie is very very long\u00853 hours 10 mins? I could have done a better editing job than PS Bharthi. Screenplay is amazingly done. Especially the track running part..the low cam going around the track looks stunning! The film could have been better if the love story part would have been skipped. I have read a ton of articles on Milkha Singh and not one of them has anything to say with reference to the Australian girl or Sonam kapoor part. Bollywood masala I guess.\n\nWhat I didn't like is that the movie ended with Pakistan President honoring him with the name \"Flying Sikh\"\u0085It should have been Milhka's defeat at Olympics. Another silly attempt to end a Hindi movie on a high.I didn't like this movie as much as I liked Pan Singh Tomar. It was a low budget film but still was better than BMB.\n\nBMB would have been a better movie if it was rounded off in 2 hours and the love story part was skipped. Shitty CGI at some places. There would be calls to send this to Oscars but if Pan Singh Tomar wasn't worth it,this sure in hell isn't either.\n\nI would rate it no more than 6.5. If you haven't seen PST, watch that first!"

A couple of such close finishes on the field would have been justified but I don't understand the point of including a dozen of such scenes. Farhan Akhtar's dedication towards this role is awe-inspiring and is deserving of accolades. Jabtej Singh's riveting performance as kid Milkha was just as good. Sadly, even several good performances fail to save this over-the-top and melodramatic film. The romance tracks needn't have been in the film at all. Waste of time."

This movie is going to give running in India a boost. Hope more such movies are made in India which have some content, a emotional connect and give some life lessons but at the end you leave the hall on a high.

The story starts with his childhood that how he survived when India was partitioned, continued with his struggle for being a world Champion. The movie is a perfect blend of Romance, adventure and inspiration.\n\nRakesh Omprakash Mehra's Unparalleled direction and P S Bharathi's Editing will make stick to your seats. Farhan Athtak's acting was as usual (Great). Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music gave a perfect feel to every moment in the movie. I would go for 8.5 starts out of 10. A must watch movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a brunch of regular commercial movies, it's a relief to watch biopics like \"Bhaag Milkha Bhag.\" Such movies tend to educate viewers about the forgotten heroes. Such is Milkha Singh, who gave fame to his country as an athlete. The film chronicles the hardship of Milkha Singh to rise to fame from the dark childhood to hardships in the training. Though remarkable in its content and the numerous awards the film bagged last year, the film somehow lacks a coherent pacing and becomes overlong. The performance of Farhan Akhtar as Milkha Singh is remarkable. Sonam Kapoor's role gets wasted. Music is pretty nice though the songs feel a bit numerous in the film. Overall, the film is nice and inspirational as a sincere biopic on an athlete with a remarkable central character; but it somewhat lacks a coherent pacing to grip you. On the matter, \"Mary Kom\" is more preferable.\n\nRating: 2 stars out of 4"

        "review_detailed_main": "The screenplay was completely confused and a lot of sequences where added just keep in a certain audience in mind and completely diluted the gravity and seriousness that the movie such as this should have tried to aim for.\n\nWhen you try to cater to all the segments of an audience you end up with a very average to a below average piece of ****. That is what BMB is. Even I find it surprising that how MS approved of this movie.\n\nMaybe FA did a good job but one actor doing a good job does not make a good movie and that counts for only 5-10% of the overall product.\n\nThe sequencing of the movie was completely mixed up and resulted in confusion. The movie drags for 3 hrs and they do not have any good content to show. The characters have not been developed properly and unnecessary sex scenes have been put. Had they put in one more scene I would have not hesitated it calling it a soft core porn movie.\n\nCannot help but compare it with Paan Sign Tomar which has a very similar story. It was a much much better than MBM on all counts and although FA may have worked very hard IK did much better job as Paan Singh. While I will not blame FA for it, the character of MS was not at all developed in the movie as the director had set out to create a typical spicy Bollywood sex flick rather than anything worthwhile."

Specially Divya Dutta she played the role of sister of Milkha Singh, she is a real actor. Salute to bath Farhan Akhtar And Divya Dutta...... Movie was something more than i can write. It will make you cry, laugh and inspired at all moments. Its shows the fine work done by these great artist. More Farhan and Sonam Kapoor took nothing for this tribute work. A big salute to them. And finally some words for the legend Milkha Singh. What he did 50 years ago is never achieved till date and will not be achieved 1000 years ago. He is a example of pure hard work and sportsmen. He has suffered a lot in his life , a normal person suffering from same situations can not even lead a normal life but what he did is only and only his sincere efforts and diligence . Really he is a \"Flying Sikh\" . He bought laurels to the country and to our society too. I am a great fan of him. May he prosper in his life. I would love to watch this movie a million times."

        "review_detailed_main": "Biopics are gaining popularity in Indian Cinema as it is representing true incidents of a person portrayed on the silver screen. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag follows the trend and is thoroughly inspiring and motivating.\n\nBhaag Milkha Bhaag tells the real life story of former Indian track and field sprinter, Milkha Singh who is the only Indian male athlete to win an individual athletics gold medal at a Commonwealth Games.\n\nFrom the director of thrilling AKS and rebellious RANG DE BASANTI , Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra gives you another solid-punching true story of Flying Sikh which is also based on the book The Race of My Life. The movie begins with Milkha loosing the gold medal and refusing to participate in Paksitan as he had a troubled childhood during Indo-Pak partition where his parents were murdered. The movie goes into flashback mode showing his transformation from a innocent kid to a trouble-maker youth. Chance to meet his girlfriend changes him completely and he joins Indian Army for good where his racing skills are recognized and from this point , the movie begins to roll out. Couple of scenes will steal the thunder - Farhan Aktar running the race despite the leg injury in National Championship , the practice session shot in Ladakh will chill the blood and finally the beautiful shot climax scene. The screenplay do looses the steam due to avoidable songs , the romantic track between foreign girl and Farhan Akhtar. Editing could have been trimmed for few minutes. Also , I felt apart from \"Zinda\" and \" Bhaag Milkha \" , none of the songs contributed much to the film. Despite these shortcomings , the film boast off some fantastic performances. Farhan Akhtar gives his best as he has trained hard to get into the shape and appreciable sculpted physique clearly reflects in the movie. He emotes so appropriately that it is difficult to think of any other actor in this role. Praveen Malhotra , Yograj Singh , Divya Dutta and Prakash Raj lends in good support.\n\nOverall , Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a true tribute to real-life hero Milkha Singh and should be watched by every Indian. Excellent 4/5"

        "review_title": "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag \u0085 there is no Finish Line!!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The most awaited movie of the year, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is the story of one of the greatest athlete India has ever had. A story of achievement & disappointment, milestones & nightmares, passion & apathy. Most importantly a story of grit & determination and the struggle to achieve success besides all odds. To describe or write about a movie of this stature one cannot find enough words to express oneself. But, I will definitely try and summarize it from the heart on the different levels the movie worked for me.\n\nI came out pretty impressed with the way Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra has managed to depict the life of \"Flying Sikh\" in a movie slightly over 3 hours and NO, I did not get bored at any time in the movie. The script demanded the detail and though some sequences definitely match upto speed of the man on whom the movie is made, the rest of the film jogs along just fine. The race sequences have been shot very well and the climax is enduring and keeps you on the edge though most of us already knew the outcome.\n\nA true account of the life of Milkha Singh, the movie starts with him loosing the legendary 1960 Rome Olympic race and flashes back to his life tracing the journey from his child hood (born in the undivided India now Pakistan) to the great athlete he ultimately becomes making India proud. The various times in his life are brilliantly interwoven into the plot from the time he lands up in Delhi as a refugee from Pakistan to taking up the life of crime and then moving onto the Indian Army which ultimately changes his life. The sequences where the natural athlete in him is discovered by a Services coach and his ambition to wear the Indian sports contingent blazer are emotional yet inspiring. Full marks to Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra for using his signature style of inter-weaving flash backs with the present to tell a story which is not only inspiring but emotional to the core. He has been able to effectively depict how necessity drives a man to ambition and that ambition converts to passion. Mr. Mehra will make you fall in love with Milkha Singh and you'll end up wondering why you never read or heard about this awesome man.\n\nFarhan Akhtar has been the best at whatever he does besides acting, including directing & singing, but I am sure he would also be contemplating that this is his best performance till date. There was no Farhan Akhtar in the movie, you could only see Milkha Singh in the movie. He became one with the character that one could not differentiate between the two. His rigorous training sessions to acquire the lean body of the athlete definitely shown in the movie and his dedication matched that of the original Milkha Singh. Some sequences have of course been dramatized for the movie effect but Farhan makes them look so believable, you end up disputing the fact that they actually happened. The part where he tells his coach that he will wear the Indian team blazer one day has makes you want to do the same. Farhan's look is as close to the real Milkha one could get. The original athlete's nuances, the running style and the inner turmoil which he went through has been picked up closest to the original and though it has already been said countless times, no one could have done a better job of portraying this character.\n\nOnly 2 actors that can be mentioned in the same breath as him are Divya Dutta and Pawan Malhotra. Divya Dutta as Milkha Singh's elder sister, the one who looked after him after his parents were killed, gives a powerful emotional performance and ups the emotional quotient of the movie manifold. Every time she comes on screen you can't help but cry even when she doesn't say much. Pawan Malhotra who has proved himself time and again as an actor, once again proves as Milkha Singh's coach that there no a better actor than him when it comes to supporting roles. The large than life character and the actual influence this coach had on Milkha's life is portrayed by flawless ease and his comprehension of the character adds another dimension to Milkha's character. The young Milkha Singh portrayal by young Master Jabtej Singh is equally brilliant and the intensity the kid showed as the young Sikh makes him a deserving for future accolades. Yograj Singh (cricketer Yuvraj Singh's father) as Milkha's coach Ranvir Singh and Prakash Raj (finally he gets a break from playing baddie in Cop movies) as his unit's commanding officer support the lead character well. Sonam Kapoor as Milkha's love interest gets the best composed scenes, and though she does not have much to say in the movie, she delivers an effective understated performance. Rebecca Breeds from Australia in her first Indian movie gives a pleasant and light performance in the otherwise intense movie.\n\nMusic by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, forms an integral part of the movie. The title track \"Zinda\" is something you'd come humming out of the theatre. My favorites were the Army barrack song \"Havan Karnege\" and the \"Slow motion Angreza\" shot in an Australian pub. The music is easy on the ears and difficult to forget.\n\nMilkha Singh ran for our country for long and has been remembered for time immemorial. A rare sports person and you can read about him all over the internet. This movie does complete justice to his biopic, both as a sportsman struggle and symbolically conveying that life's struggles don't have a finish line.\n\nThe movie takes Indian cinema to another level and though there will be many more to come this year, my nomination for the Oscars is definitely Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Irrespective of your preferences this is a must watch for all Indians."

A life filled with emotions that just calls out to be adapted onto the big screen. A life which has ups, downs, triumphs, disappointments, rejections all rolled into one. I was really happy to see Farhan transform so closely into Milkha Singh. I was very happy with the Zinda song. Coming to the movie, its like a very very sweet dish, which you enjoy in the beginning, then its sweetness jars your mouth that you cant take it any more and yet wished and hoped that you could have eaten more of such an enjoyable dish but you cant. Its beautiful in every frame, the story highlights most of Milkha's triumphs and I was happy Rome Olympics was not the finale. It would have left a sour taste. The movie is over indulgent, no two ways about it. It drags and drags and at 188 mins, it becomes too slow to test the patience at times. It could and should have been a good 30 mins shorter. And come to think of, lip synced songs in a biopic?? Looked odd and wasted time as well. I was sad they didn't show his love story with his wife and wasted 20 odd mins on an one night stand. Rakesh Mehra's vision is fantastic, he chose the best parts of Milkha's life to highlight. Whats questionable is the screenplay and editing. Background score is very good, songs were average barring Zinda. Farhan breathes life into Milkha Singh's character. Its a near perfect role barring the inconsistencies of the beard.\n\nFinally a movie that could have been so so much better had it been handled with a little more dexterity, a potential epic gone bust. A Sikh that flies, but movie didn't exactly take off.\n\n6/10."

Divya Dutta appears in parts but makes a mark and leaves the audience in tears with her brilliant portrayal of Milkha's sister. this easily is her best performance ever.. Sonam Kapoor is OK in the few scenes she gets.. music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is superb and takes the narration forward.. rest of cast has done commendable job.. only flaw one finds is the editing part..overall length of movie(3 hrs 10 min) could easily have been trimmed by 20-25 minutes.. overall the movie is superb ranks amongst one of best of this year..definitely recommended.. it makes us proud of this great Indian sporting legend.. 8 stars from my side.."

        "review_detailed_main": "An extraordinary film.\n\nIn one sense a biopic of a real historical person \u2013 Milkha Singh, 'The Flying Sikh', the orphaned emigr\u00e9 (from the terrible Partition riots that followed the creation of independent Pakistan and India in 1947) who rose to become India's first world-record setting athlete \u2013 this movie gives its audience so MUCH more, in so many ways.\n\nOn an individual level, the Hindi film \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" (2013) takes over from the Stallone classic \"Rocky\" (1976) as a great sport-based 'triumph of the human spirit' story. Yet at a global level this film also succeeds as one of the best movies yet made about the Partition, which inspires much-needed emotional healing for both nations. Many countries, actually, could benefit from this film's message.\n\n(The title \u2013 'Run Milkha Run', in English \u2013 were Milkha's father's final words.)\n\nFarhan Akhtar \u0085 phenomenal!\n\nMr Akhtar's mindblowing performance here as the title character will make you forget, for a time, that he is also one of India's best directors. (And a producer. And writer. And lyricist. And singer. None of which hats he wears here.) \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" proves that Farhan Akhtar, at 39, has matured into one of the world's finest living ACTORS.\n\nHe has brought the same honesty, subtlety, and power to this role, as an actor, which audiences have come to expect as a trademark of the films he directs or produces. Mr Akhtar engages you completely, from the opening frame to the last. You will laugh. You will cry. You will think. You will feel inspired to fly.\n\n\"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" soars on the wings of Farhan Akhtar's performance.\n\nThe sheer \u0085 physicality \u0085 deserves special appreciation. It is no easy thing, for any mere actor to physically embody a career athlete. Mr Akhtar reportedly conditioned and trained for 18 months, to transform his body and his whole manner of movement. The result is on the screen: you will believe you are watching a world champion runner.\n\nIt's an extra plus that Mr Akhtar, the actor, does so strongly resemble the real Milkha Singh \u2013 in build, body type, and the bones of the face \u2013 as the historic photographs shown over the end credits clearly reveal.\n\nThe supporting cast are uniformly excellent, but I single out these four for special notice.\n\nVeteran character actor Pavan Malhotra gives a career-breakthrough performance as Gurudev Singh, the army coach who first introduced young Milkha Singh to competitive running. He becomes the audience point-of-access to Milkha's whole backstory.\n\nUK-based Pakistani-born actor Art Malik receives \u2013 and earns \u2013 third star billing, despite limited minutes. As Milkha Singh's father, his character is long dead and only appears in the 1947 flashback sequences. But Mr Malik so deftly projects an intriguing multi-dimensional character that his image, his presence, linger in the mind long after he has faded from the screen.\n\nDivya Dutta as Ishri Kaur, Milkha's sole surviving sister. Brilliant! Emotional touchpoint for the whole audience, on both the individual and societal levels.\n\nLast but certainly not least: newcomer Japtej Singh, who plays Milkha as a child. Merges perfectly with Mr Akhtar as the adult Milkha; you believe one would grow into the other. Most natural and 'genuine' performance by any child actor that I had seen in years. (May this be the beginning of a long and great career for young Mr Singh!)\n\nChief among technical departments, the strong story structure of \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is a huge plus. The filmmakers chose an unusual starting point to begin telling their story: what might be thought the greatest failure of Milkha Singh's career. (Breaking his own world record, but only finishing 4th \u2013 out of the medals \u2013 in the 400 meter run at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome.) But through deft intercutting between the then-present and selected flashbacks to Milkha's backstory, the film builds to an unexpectedly powerful climax that emotionally satisfies while inspiring on both personal and global levels.\n\nSpecial credit: without diluting the emotional horror of Milkha's childhood experiences during the Partition, visual horror is kept to a minimum. A very difficult balance to keep, but successfully achieved here. (Note to Parents: film does contain one disturbing image of an athletics injury.)\n\nThe taut script by Prasoon Joshi and crisp editing by P. S. Bharathi elevate \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" by an order of magnitude above director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's earlier movies (such as \"Rang De Basanti\" (2006) which, though fresh and original, was comparatively unfocused and sprawling in its storytelling technique). \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\", by comparison, is so tightly written and well paced that I never even noticed the three-hour length, the film runs so fast and so smoothly.\n\nThe music \u2013 by Shankar Ehsaan Loy \u2013 is so good, so inspiring, that I rushed straight out to buy the soundtrack music CD immediately after leaving the movie!\n\nPretty easily, \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is THE BEST film I've seen from anywhere in the world thus far in 2013. (This statement includes the Oscar holdovers from year 2012.) Will prove to be a landmark film in world cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm just astonished and really shocked at the direction. If you want an epic direction which is truly touching and inspiring at every damn point, Rakeysh Mehra is definitely gonna give you that. If you're thinking that the length of the movie is too long, it's certainly isn't. The movie never, ever ceases to bore you and becomes the point of interest for the whole damn three freaking hours. The movie revolves around the hard work, horrors and happiness of Milkha Singh which is totally inspiring with it's bliss of charm. It starts off a bit slow but do not worry, it offers you more than what you're paying for, it just gives you those feels and even brings your tears into reality at some points. The movie GIVES you what you exactly want. It entertains as much as a inspiring movie can and takes the level of touching to a stupendous different level. Portraying Milkha Singh's troubles, struggles, achievements and his sheer desire and zeal to break the world record and become the top athlete, has been brilliantly done by the director. Farhan's physical training and his hard work are beautifully and remarkable displayed which absorbs you and lets you feel the deep and intense emotions. Some of the scenes are thoroughly moving and give you goosebumps which make you feel like you're watching one of the best Bollywood movies ever. The desire of Milkha Singh to eat, to run, to love, to win, for his country, family and his love has been portrayed excellently.\n\nOverall, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is one of the best movies ever made in Bollywood and if you're missing on this one, you'll regret your whole life. The movie delivers the story, pace and the inspiration in it's own excellent and different way which cease to capture your heart.\n\nMy Rating - 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sprinting through the 400m track, Milkha Singh flies with a dream to win glory, with purpose to shine for his country and reason, to overcome his weakness. Honed by expert coaches and disciplined by the Army, Milkha Singh achieves what no athlete could with his background. The finest visionary filmmaker, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (R.O.M) introduces Milkha's childhood to delineate the events and circumstances that made the orphaned refugee a world class athlete. The inspiring real life story is nothing short of epic on the cinema screen with Farhan Akhtar, embodying a soulful portrayal of R.O.M's envisioned protagonist. The parallel storytelling smoothly transitions between the humble beginnings of young Milkha, the events of partition that led to him taking refuge in Delhi's camps and his rebellion against his circumstances that made his coal-blackened hands hold the Indian Army's guns.It wasn't until he went through rigorous training and transformation to fight his inner demons to overcome his horrifying past, that we see Milkha's ultimate success and recognition as the Flying Sikh.\n\nIt all begins with the race at the Roman Olympics when Milkha Singh failed to clench victory. A distraught Milkha has the opportunity for reclaiming glory in Pakistan, where his original home and memories remain. Partition drove Milkha to the refugee camp in Delhi where he reunited with his sister, only to run away from his circumstances to liberation. Love takes over Milkha's life with the innocent Biro charming her way into his heart. But Milkha's inability to find a respectable livelihood separates him from his love with a newfound ambition. The Indian Army is where he learns about respect and a cross-country trial was where his talent was recognized. While being completely dedicated to running, his affair with an Aussie girl prior to the Melbourne Olympics distracted him from the cause and he failed to qualify. Disappointed with himself, Farhan portrays the raw emotion with punishment in front of the mirror. His next goal is to break the 400m world record and when the aims are that high, so are the training grounds. R.O.M has showcased Ladakh in all its desolate beauty. Farhan's painstakingly developed brawn is that of an athlete and one has to applaud his genuine effort. Over time, Milkha Singh achieves success on the track and unimaginable glory for the nation. With renewed focus and nothing to distract him from running to the finish line, Milkha attains the title of the Flying Sikh with his epic victory.\n\nRakeysh Omprakash Mehra has brilliantly visualized an inspiring story of the legend, of course adding his own dramatic elements, and given us a masterpiece to live by. In familiar styling of setting distinct color tones for flashbacks and using ultra-slow motion photography, he greatly enhances the visual feel of several important scenes.\n\nFarhan Akhtar had spent days with the living legend, understanding his character while transforming his physique to appear athletic. His dedication to the character and his own contribution to its depiction are truly remarkable feats because you do see him as Milkha Singh and not Farhan Akhtar. Such a performance is to be cherished and must hail accolades at ceremonies. Sonam Kapoor in a brief role as Biro is charming and vital to the story's evolution. Japtej Singh as young Milkha is versatile with his emotions and has a good understanding of the character's circumstances. Divya Dutta is a great talent and has been used wisely by Mehra to bring an emotional balance in Milkha's life. Yograj Singh as National team Coach Ranvir Singh is simply outstanding as Milkha's progressive mentor. Perhaps the most heartfelt and genuine performance is of Pawan Malhotra as coach Gurudev Singh. His emotions are keenly felt and as exemplary an actor as he is, one must appreciate Mehra's casting that brought the best out of him.\n\nShankar-Ehsaan-Loy's return after a lull period justifies the time spent in creating the score for this film. From the uplifting background score to the petulant theme of Gurbaani that is enhanced by Daler Mehendi's passionate vocals, the trio have variety and pertinence for the film's subject. While Mera Yaar, Rangrez, Slow-motion angreza are tracks that could be edited to make the film tighter, they are still melodious tracks to listen to. Arif Lohar's Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a subtle anthem for his training in Ladakh but its effect is definitely uplifting. The rock version by Siddharth Mahadevan is inspiring and suited to the end credits. Maston ka jhund is catchy, fun and similar to Khalbalee in its effect. But the film's best track is the powerful Zinda that catches the spirit of Milkha Singh. It's the song that works while passing cars on the highway, in the gym, bathroom, while running or even jumping over train compartments.\n\nRakeysh Mehra has adroitly used technologies to enhance the film's emotional feel. Milkha's feet running over sands, him running over train compartments and crossing the finish line in slow motion are visuals that one cannot erase from the mind. He captures the essence of the dedicated athlete for whom running meant more than just a sport. It gave purpose to his life. Prasoon Joshi's writing is yet again commendable and has more impact when visualized by Rakeysh Mehra.\n\nThe hard work put in by everyone in the film is apparent in its realistic depiction. The sincerity is keenly felt and the passionate portrayal of Milkha Singh is warmly embraced. There might be a song too many and a sequence or two prolonged, but Milkha Singh's story is an important one nevertheless because it reminds us that there are no shortcuts to success. It comes at the cost of sacrifices, buckets of sweat and ounces of blood in its journey."

But instead Mr. Mehra(director) made a an entertainment movie with unnecessary comedy and poor story.\n\nFirst half was so poor that i almost slept. Second half was way far better. Farhan Akhatar was good but not best he was unable to give the painful expressions. The best acting can be seen by Yograj Singh.\n\nIndia Pakistan rivalry is the worst part of the movie. i mean why Indian movies use Pakistan as their weapon for gaining patriotism an.\n\ni Truly respect Mr. Mehra . i loved his 'rang De bas-anti' its one of the finest film of India but i am really disappointed with this movie"

As far as flaws are concerned nothing is perfect, you can always pin point deficiencies in some of most popular and great movies ever made in Hollywood.

It still fails to ignore the typical Indian approach; flawed by overdrama at several places, hilarious howdy romance!!!! Sonam Kapoor can not cope with her role.\n\nOverall, an admirable attempt to portray such inspirational character like Milkha Singh."

Farhan Akhtar you have done a great work i salute you hard work . This movie is very good filmed and directed . In 1947 the tragedy which happens is one of the most painful.

        "review_detailed_main": "Bhag Milka Bhag - Finally our Chariots of Fire\n\n\"Are you relaxing? No, I am Mikha Singh!\" \u2013 This the famous joke and that is unfortunately how we have been introduced to the Flying Sikh Milkha Singh all our lives.\n\nWhile the legend has been living all his life while we grew up to become just mediocre metro-sexual youth, never ever, there has been a sustained attempt by our society to bring out these legends to lead us, or to enthuse our kids\u0085\u0085 and then we had to learn about Pan Singh Tomar, Mir Ranjan Negi and now Milkha Singh through our filmmakers\u0085. And hats off to these directors who chose these guys over much hyped guys that are littered in our so- called Indian Sports scenario.\n\nBhag Milkha Bhag is an homage to that undying spirit so universal but somehow so unsung in this country. And the decay all around is not unnoticeable.\n\nAgain this movie proves that at least in cinema , India has matured. As the scene after scene transcendent, it allays my (and others) anxiety over the doubtful feasibility of this biopic. Some three to four years back when Rakesh OP Mehra declared his intention, it seemed a subject of a documentary. And here we are, with a movie, that actually gets deep down your throat and alleviates the inner conscience. Few, very few movies have that effect, where long after you have left the screen, the scenes ghostly hover in your subconscious self\u0085. May be the universal value system re-instates itself once again, may be that is the deep rooted ethos-system that we imbibe. Bhag Milka Bhag, brings about those elements in you to the surface which make you promise once again to self that you shall surely rise above your own self pettiness day after day, everyday.\n\nSo then, this movie joins the elite, it is as powerfully stimulating and real as Chariots of Fire, as perfect and inspiring as Chuck De India, as craftily and more as Pran Singh Tomar and as heart wrenching as Million Dollar Baby\u0085. Its one of the few near perfect movies made in Bollywood\u0085.. thoroughly researched, thoroughly perfected.\n\nBiopics are not thrillers, they can't be. To infuse energy and purpose while staying true takes a lot. Here, a lot of credit goes to Farhaan Akhtar. Amazingly dedicated\u0085 unlike any other actor till now in Bollywood, he has metamorphosed himself to get into the character. Look at his fitness, his toned energy level, struggle and which shows because he went through it\u0085 it convinces you that yes, Milkha lived those days and we had an Indian athlete doing that.\n\nTechnology and paying around with camera and light and music while living the story is a strong forte of Rakesh Mehra, and not one bit, he lets you down. Divya Dutta and Pavan Malhotra (remember, back in 1980s he was part of Nukkad) are amazing.\n\nFinally, its one helluva inspiring story that shouldn't be missed because these stories do repeat everyday around us but we have lost the eye to notice them and heart to celebrate them. Do yourselves a favor now, RUN to get acquainted with Milkha because he ran and did his bit! You shall get a chance to celebrate true nationalism with self triumph!!!"

Again Farhan Akthar acted very well and the movie is worth watching for that itself.\n\nInstead of being hypocritical I'll cut this review short and say this; unless you hate/dislike serious drama, don't think twice and go for it."

There are few moments which really touch your heart - like when Milkha is asking his sister to wear the National team's blazer."

        "review_detailed_main": "A chiseled body covered by a sweating vest, a coveted coat of a national hero worn with pride and honour,a rowdy youth, sweet little romantic tracks, and a scar from the post- partition tragedy deeply rooted in our lead character's mind - that's ample opportunity to show one's acting prowess and commitment .In fact its a role of a lifetime and Farhan owns it for sure but the same cannot be said about the makers who give us a film though entertaining and inspiring, doesn't quite hit the perfect notes.\n\nCelebrating the life of India's national treasure Milkha Singh, this epic drama tries hard to influence the viewers with its melodramatic sequences of events but eventually falters due to this very obsession. In fact the movie had everything going for it right from a cast of good character actors, a riveting premise as a backdrop and the magic wand of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. What it needed was a little heed to what Milkha Singh's coach says - 'bus sone ko tarashna hai'.Here the efforts seemed to have gone a little haywire resulting in an unfocused storytelling of this important saga.Much effort has been put in making the audience feel each emotion that when it works you feel like clapping just like at the climax or feel a lump in your throat particularly in the sequences between Milkha Singh and his elder sister. But when it doesn't, say during the pre- interval sections, you might get a little edgy and restless at your seat.\n\nThe background score, the cinematography and camera work are top notch. The music is good and blends well with the narrative. But the movie could have done with some sharp editing. With more than 3 hours of running time, some scenes are dragged a tad too long without adding anything to the narrative.\n\nThere are some wonderful performances by Pavan Malhotra, Prakash Raj, Divya Dutta,young Jabtej Singh and others who enact their roles to perfection evoking tears and laughter at various stages. Sonam Kapoor as Milkha Singh's love interest looks good in a cameo.. But its Farhan as the flying Sikh who awestrucks you with his earnest performance and surpasses expectations.. The efforts invested in his looks, his carved body, the training sessions he undertook to run like he did speaks volumes about his commitment.\n\nThe movie may be a little exaggerated and overdrawn, but barring these hiccups the biopic is pleasing to the eyes and is inspirational in talking about the indomitable human spirit.. For me, it just falls short of Paan Singh Tomar,last year's offering from the same genre.\n\nNot entirely a disappointment but certainly below expectations .A beautiful performance by Farhan and the spirit of Milkha Singh saves the day though for Bhaag Milkha Bhaag."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first time I learnt about 'Milkha Singh' was when I was ten years old. Preparing for a GK quiz, I had to remember the sobriquet 'Flying Sikh' by heart. Little did I know then the value of the greatest sporting sobriquet in Indian sport at least.\n\nSo, what's great about Milkha Singh that we call him legendary or one of the greatest athletes India has ever produced? Neither did I know the answer prior to watching 'Bhaag Milkha..'. But when I decided to learn, answers were aplenty.\n\nMilkha Singh had lost only 3 races out of the 80, he participated. Though Milkha finished fourth at the 1960 Rome Olympics, it was still a track record bettering the previous records. So much that five decades after Milkha Singh, with the aid of foreign coaches and training and nutrition, the best 400m time is a silly 0.12 seconds better than that of Milkha (set by K M Binu at Athens Olympics but this wasn't even enough to take Binu past the heats). Shockingly Surprising. There are more but out of the purview of my review.\n\nBack to the reviews, the movie is as grand as the above fact. Bollywood's finest answer to 'chariots of fire', the fabula is the actual story of Milkha Singh, but what pushes this biopic to the next level is the syuzhet \u2013 the way the story unfolds on the big screen; in a series of analepsis.\n\nFrom enthralling race sequences to a terrifying partition tell-tale to some breath-taking romantic moments, Binod Pradhan captures the subtle nuances that you even forget to wink your eye. Background score by trio, Shanker Ehsaan Loy is adequately top notch.\n\n'Agar Milkha bangaya India, Farhan bangaya Milkha!!' No actor, living or dead, Indian or foreign could have suited to Milkha's role or acted like Farhan Akhtar did. An epitome of elegance and dedication, Farhan infused soul into the movie. Each and every scene is a mark of his versatility and he delivers with an intricate charm, impeccably. There are scenes ranging from boyish romance to scenes where he fights with the ghosts of his past, to scenes that show his perseverance after he loses the 1956 Olympics and are an absolute delight to watch, particularly the way he trains himself after the 1956 loss. It just makes you feel that you are watching the legend himself on the silver screen.\n\nDon't expect a regular 'coke and pop-corn' style story. Though many people complained that the movie is lengthy, I was never bored, but also felt that each and every frame was well thought, penned and screen-played.\n\nA magnificent tale woven around a childhood trauma and a tantalizing agony of not winning an Olympic medal in athletics, a story of will and hope, a celebration of athletic spirit, a truly inspiring and motivating biopic, coupled with a fantabulous movie-making by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag makes an exhilarating watch, without any second thought.\n\nArguably, one of the finest sporting movies, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag will go into the annals of Bollywood filmmaking just like the legend. And a film worthy of winning an Oscar for India, this year.\n\nAnd yes, don't miss the beginning."

From the physical development, to the running style, the look, the accent, the Punjabi language, the dancing.. everything. And he delivers well on all of these. Clearly, he seems to be the perfect fit for this role.\n\nMilkha Singh's story is told very well, in interspersed flashbacks, in almost a similar way that Mehra had mixed the characters and story of India's pre-independence revolution with modern day characters in Rang De Basanti.\n\nEveryone giving stars to Bhaag Milkha Bhaag when it actually deserves a moon. Once in a lifetime kinda stuff. Epic is the word"

It is a fact that he could not get his love but because of that love only he is today known by the name Flying SIKH. Grand Salute to the man who proved his words and earned the BLAZER of team India. Milkha Singh made his lifetime achievements winning 77 races out of the 80 he ran. The one which no one can forget is the Olympics race of 1960 in which he saw behind. The moment he saw behind the GOLD medal was gone. It was hard day for all the Indians but he never made the same mistake again ever."

The true story of how Milkha Singh \"broke the world record with an injured foot\" (but couldn't win the f***ing Olympics)\n\n6. 2 minutes of snot running from Farhan Akhtar's nose\n\n7. Look at all the special effects!\n\n8. There's kissing scenes!\n\n9. The \"true\" story of how Milkha romped with all dem hotties (but actually met his wife in 1956 and married her in 1962)\n\n10. We'll reference the title every third scene!(wait if this is the title then...)\n\n11. Milkha vs Pakistan: The most important race EVARRR! (F*** the Olympics, nationalism ftw)\n\n12. We make the \"Relaxing... No Milkha Singh\" joke!\n\nNot much of this is really a true story (maybe 30% of this tripe has any substance). Rakeysh has twisted facts, manipulated events and completely bastardized the real story of one of our eternal sports legends, all to bring you one more mass-movie for the frothing and mindless millions who will lap this movie up like Pani Puris on the Mumbai streets. It is also FAR too long, with great depth given to the utterly false tales and legends springing from the director's imagination which was highly unnecessary. The mood and tempo of the film swings like a pendulum from serious to jovial with barely any connection and decides to eschew a realistic slow pace for a grandiose and testosterone pumping roller coaster with steep banks, long lulls and sudden loop-de-loops\n\nTechnically it is sound, directed well, acted well, shot well and with a good soundtrack. Is it enjoyable? If you're one of those people who simply want their dose of adrenaline and mindless action, heck, go for it. Frankly, if this movie hadn't the \"inspired\" card, it would have made absolutely no difference."

He makes you realize the struggles and the horror Milkha Singh had to overcome in his journey to become what he is today. He makes you feel for Milkha Singh like a fellow human being, a man with feelings and flaws of his own. He makes you root for the man to succeed and celebrate with him when he does.\n\nAnd of course, Mehra's portrayal of Milkha Singh probably wouldn't have been half as believable if it weren't for Farhan Akhtar's outstanding performance. Maybe his character was in reel, but his perspiration was definitely real. 10/10!"

To learn to pick ourselves up\".And yes Milkha does stumble many times but at the end of it all comes up triumphs.\n\nCONS:The movie could have been a bit more compact specially on the music scenes because the music was not of the masterpieces of Bollywood.But saying that there wasn't any moment in the movie when you would feel bored.\n\nAll in all,Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a compelling watch for not only movie lovers but almost everybody.We can all appreciate the fact from the movie that in the race of life be it on track and fields or in our personal experiences,\"Willpower,dedication n hard work can make us reach for the sky\"."

Besides sports, there is so much associated with this film, like the aftermath of partition between India and Pakistan and its effects, creating innumerable victims, whose lives got shaped for worse. Had it not been for the army and sports that embraces Milkha Singh, we would have seen another Paan Singh Tomar like personality that Milkha Singh could have turned into. Hats off to Rakeysh Mehra and its producers for bringing this real life story on a celluloid screen for everyone, especially India's citizens, who would have been deprived otherwise to see this historic episode, which would have remained hidden. The song and dance in the bar reminded one of a similar song from 'Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara'. One or two slow numbers could have been avoided to make the film bit shorter. Overall it was a good blend of history and main stream Bollywood movie. Farhan Akhtar definitely deserves 2013's best actor award."

In Rajeev Masand's words (on the final scene): \"Never before has slow motion and background music been so abused in a film!\" Nothing works for the film. Absolutely NOTHING. It's an epic tale of epic exaggeration which sadly turns into an epic disappointment of epic proportions. Despite the repeated use of the word 'epic' in the last sentence, the contours and essence of the word fall short of the amplified excesses in the film. Overdose of melodrama, overwrought with jingoism and fabricated self-indulgences, trapped in a deeply flawed screenplay with out-of-sync songs and desperate attempts at emotional manipulation. Farhan's eye-gasmic photoshopped abs, bandages flying off and blood oozing out, coaches doing bhangra on an athletics ground, Divya Dutta's glycerine-soaked eyes. Yawn. Dilip Tahil is good. One of India's greatest character actors, Pawan Malhotra stands out, far above the rest. National Award winning Prakash Raj successfully sheds off his Bollywood stereotype tag of the garrulous villain. Prasoon Joshi may be one of the finest lyricists of our generation, but he fails miserably as a scriptwriter. Farhan Akhtar, however, deserves accolades for his sincerity. He sparkles in bits, but although he replicates Milkha's body, he fails to do the same with his soul. The Flying Sikh deserves a better homage. Much, much better."

It's just over dramatised (read 'bollywood masala'), bad acting and terrible scenes.\n\nYeah Farhan must have gone through a gruelling training to seem like Milkha Singh (and so I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1) but that's besides the point!! To start with there has to be a decent copywriting and direction and all other finer elements of story telling to come together to make up a watchable movie.\n\nI grew up around some sports people and god they just hated it. I dunno if Milkha Singh actually was part of the film-making, but it just seems such a bad attempt at capturing his biography."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"This can be your last race of life.\" \"I'll run like that\u0085\" Words truly came from the deep of Milkha's heart.\n\nHow can you earn a blazer? It was not a simple blazer \u2013 It was The most precious wearing of an Indian Sportsman \u2013 the Indian team Blazer. He saw himself in the Blazer once in the mirror. Was it true Milkha? No of course not. It was only a mere reflection of his dream. But that was one of the most important step towards a dream \u2013 Live the dream. The slap from his trainer made him come back to present. \"He is far better than you \u2013 he is a champion. Can you beat him? CAN YOU BEAT HIM?\" \"Aho!\" His eyes does the rest of the talking. In a moment his life turned towards a single goal. His life just got a purpose \u2013 a bigger aim far bigger than anyone around him dared to dream about.\n\nHe started his run behind his dream \u2013 yes he ran hard. Too hard to be ignored by anyone around him. When his competitor beat him in the legs to make him not to participate in the coming race, was just an acceptance of his caliber. Milkha was for bigger purpose and these small barriers wouldn't stop him. He learned to cross the barrier. The same guy who could not cross a finishing line for a stone in his foot made a national record with 4-5 spikes holes in both of his legs. It was the first acceptance of his attitude. But who cares for acceptance? He was a hero of his own. He was a hero for his dear Didi and Biro. He can fight the world for them.\n\nMilkha earned his Blazer for India. Though that was just a start, but of course a dream come true. A dream people around him dared to think about. His Didi was the happiest person in the world. Her every tear showed her proud \u2013 her joy. When she found the earrings from the Blazer pocket, the shiny smile mixed with her tears made her the most content person in the world. Blazer was truly earned \u2013 for Milkha, for his Didi.\n\nAfter all this Milkha was a man. He was not freed from all the bonding God has created. He just floated on his feelings with Stella in Melbourne Olympics. But soon after he realized his life was for different purpose. This gives him more strength than ever. This freedom completes when he left the swimming pool refusing the \"mermaid\". That moment was a battle within where the brigadier Milkha won. And that was the start of his winning.\n\nHe trained as hard as possible \u2013 beyond possible. This was the training of a saint \u2013 a true champion. Did he achieve his ultimate goal? Heh does it matter? A medal \u2013 an Olympic medal would surely be the brightest feather on his hat but weren't all the feathers on his hat are far brighter than the longed one? Wasn't the tears of joy of his Didi means hundreds of Olympic gold? Wasn't his coach Gurudev Singh's every hug equals to those medals? Yes truly they are.\n\nMilkha's life got a completion when he visited Pakistan again and fought his childhood fear. The ultimate solution to relief from fear is not to run away but it's in crossing the line and winning the fear. He crossed the line when he visited his home in Pakistan only to find his bloody memory rejuvenated. But that was much needed and his soul gains true freedom. Every human life goes around all these stages from dream to run behind the dream to realizing the dream.\n\nEvery person gets chance in one or another form. It all depends on in which stage he leaves the track. Milkha shows how to stay on the track with all odds in the opposite side. Sheer dedication, willpower gave him the strength to do the inhumanly deed"

The storyline varied a lot in this movie which is what made it exciting and not for one minute it became boring, i recommend you watch it as its the one of the best bollywood movies I've watched in my life, seriously guys watch it!! I assume that a majority of the events that took place in this movie did take place in milkha's real life apart from the dance scenes obviously but i do actually think that you should watch this film because this is basically an untold story of the one of the very few successful Indian athletes."

        "review_detailed_main": "Story Line-up: Story of the glorious journey of being Milkha Singh to Flying Sikh. Farhaan Akhtar, the one who puts energy in the movie played the role of Milkha Singh. He totally justified the character. Two story runs parallel one of the story is of his childhood to become an Army Commando and another one is of the winnings and his training of representing the India on the International platform in Olympics, National Games, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. Movie is not just a movie, you can just relive the era of patriotism and the tiff between India and Pakistan partition after the independence. Amazing story telling. Much inspirational thing is, Milkha Singh sold the rights to produce the movie, which is based on a book written by him, for one rupee but inserted a clause stating that a share of the profits would be given to a charitable trust set up in his name.\n\nPerformance: Milkha Singh's challenging character is played by Farhaan Akhtar, he totally justified the role. The hardwork he done can be seen in the movie. He done training for running throughout 18 months. Its tremendous performance as an actor. I became fan of him. Sonam Kapur played the role of his crush Biru, but I dint go to cinema hall to see her. I was pretty much interested in Milkha Singh's life story. Pawan Malhotra played role of Milkha's coach in the army regiment. He is a method actor and totally justified a character of Sardar and his dialogues are too motivating while he is giving training to Milkha Singh. Yograj Singh (Yuvraj Singh's father) played the role of on-field coach of Milkha, I never know he is also an actor and his lines are also inspiring. The story puts charm in the character's performance by actors. As far as I know, Farhan Akhtan dint charge his fees for the movie, while Sonam also dint charge for the movie, both have just charged the signing amount worth Rs. 11. Prakash Raj is also in the movie and he puts some comic events and alive the movie from its serious track to a comedy one, he proved him a percentile actor. Divya Dutta played role of Milkha's elder sister and shown the perfect era of male dominant victim in the movie.\n\nDirection: Rakesh Omprakash Mehra came back with another patriotic movie after Rang De Basanti. The story telling is the essential of the movie. Story drafted by Prasoon Joshi in an amazing way, its hard to put all the cosines in one dish while one is directing a Bio-pic of a living legend. We can see Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in the movie in scene in the plane, he played a little role of pilot of a plane in which Milkha and team was going to Olympic.\n\nMusic: Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, trio did fantastic job by composing such background score as well as songs of the movie. Two songs are in the favourite list of mine, Zinda and Alfallah. One gives energy and another gives charm of love. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag also an energetic song. Ghul Mil remind me the era of Shammi Kapoor.\n\nVerdict: Must watch movie. The movie set the benchmark in story telling of a bio- pic. Meanwhile, so many \"Whistle blowing\" and 'Woows' yelled in the cinema hall. So much energetic. I bow my hands to Farhaan Akhtar for playing such a challenging role and Prasoon Joshi-Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra for giving an amazing flick for utilizing our time in watching the movie in a productive way.\n\nRating: I cannot rate the movie because if I judge this movie on the basis of just a film its totally wrong, Milkha Singh is a true living legend. Standing ovation from my side to you and Salutes. If I have to just the give a rating to the movie on the basis of its performances and directions and music I would definitely give 10 out of 10 stars. Must watch movie\u0085 Truly energetic."

It is very good to see the lives of iconic and distinguished personalities on the silver screen.\n\nAfter \"Aks\", \"Rang De Basanti\" and \"Delhi 6\", the tremendously endowed Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra presents a biopic BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG, based on the life of legendary athlete Milkha Singh, nicknamed \"The Flying Sikh\".\n\nIt is real great cinematic experience; it shows the utmost contemplation and researches. Kudos for Mehra's great effort and Prasoon Joshi's incredible writing, it urges every spectator to salute the sprinter and makes a mark on our hearts.\n\nBHAAG MILKHA BHAAG depicts the life of Milka Singh from his childhood tragedy to the achievement and becoming an iconic figure in Indian History. The pain of religious riots during the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan is illustrated through Milkha's eye that we can feel the horror of the catastrophe, orphaned Milka and his elder sister struggling to meet the ends and Milkha doing odd jobs (Burglary, looting coal from trains etc.). After much of the struggle, impediments, apprehensions, he found his athletic calling in the army, eventually setting 400-meter world records and representing India at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. The best part is Milkha Singh helped the creators in weaving the story and writer justified it. The writing never goes over the top; not it has the clich\u00e9d segments. It captures the every required detail and nuance. It never loses the focus from the credentials of Milkha's renowned career.\n\nThe razor sharp editing puts all the pieces together as if it has been shot like chronologically. Mehra sure has an ear for the perfect musical score and we can listen to the exhilarating background score situation by situation, moments by moments. Cinematography is a real pleasure to watch, it is shot beautifully and it soothes the eyes.\n\nFarhan Khan as \"Milkha Singh\" is remarkable; the effort invested by him is praiseworthy as he morphed himself completely to the character of Milkha Singh. His chiseled athletic physique, the long hair, the body language and the dialog delivery. , Farhan has pushed himself beyond limits to illustrate the eminent and renowned character of Milkha Singh with precision. He leaves no stone unturned, we really admire the conviction, commitment and sincerity of the actor. This is an immaculate and unforgettable performance.\n\nPawan Malhotra is impeccable. Cricketer Yuvraj Singh's actor-father Yograj Singh shines as Farhan's coach. Prakash Raj, cast in a positive role, is notable with a lovely mustache.\n\nOverall, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is another feather in the cap on Indian Cinema. We are waiting for more\u0085..\n\n8.1/10"

After having made films like 'Aks', 'Rang De Basanti, 'Delhi 6', Mehra succeeds in pulling off BMB; a feat that speaks volumes about his passion for the subject. Not that the film doesn't have any drawback. But it surely leaves you with feelings that you may not be able to describe in words.\n\nFarhan Akhtar as Milkha is an absolute treat to watch. None could have reprised the role of the athlete but him. Sonam, though has very little screen time, does her bit quite well. But the actors who add colour to the film are- Pawan Malhotra, Prakash Raj and Yograj Singh. They have pulled off stunning performances worth loud applause. The film on the whole is entertaining but has certain glitches that could have been avoided. Had the run time been a little shorter, perhaps it would have been a lot better. Prasoon Joshi weaves the story with various emotions. But the one that stands out is Milkha's love for his country- India. The music by Shankar-Ehasaan-Loy is like breathe of fresh air, but Mehra could have avoided lip-syncing songs.\n\nA handful of films sprint that extra mile beyond providing meagre entertainment to its spectators. BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is one such cinematic experience. However, director Mehra and writer Prasoon Joshi encompass pertinent episodes/chapters from the icon's life and create a film that makes you salute the sports person, besides evoking the spirit of nationalism in the spectator."

        "review_detailed_main": "The best thing about BMB is performance by one man, who gave his everything to it, quite literally. There is something really touching when an actor immensely transforms himself physically to fit a role and Farhan Akhtar does exactly that in this movie. And not only his physical transformation, but even his acting-wise performance is so sincere that I can not imagine what would have been the fate of this project if not handled in a manner that Farhan did. If you are not a Farhan-Akhtar-fan, which quite honestly I too wasn't before watching BMB, then this movie will surely make you one.\n\nBut a movie, even though it's a biopic, can not leave a lasting effect on you just because of a legendary performance by its lead actor. The movie is too slow, dipping into too much pointless information at various stages, while you will be left wondering- What was that scene for? Did this happen in real life with him too? What is the relevance of that character to the overall plot? After hearing Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's name, just as I did, you might expect a larger than life movie like RDB. But make no mistake, this does not even come close to that masterpiece. Neither plot wise nor in bringing out strong emotions out of a viewer like RDB did. And on a large part, this is to be blamed on a generously unfocused and clich\u00e9d constantly-on-verge-of-becoming-preachy kind of script by Prasoon Joshi.\n\nDivya Dutta's character is well played. Sonam Kapoor does not do much to the plot, which I don't even think was expected from her character as it's not featured longer than 15 minutes. But one character, other than Farhan, who won my heart was Pavan Malhotra's character Gurudev Singh, who is heart warming and funny at times.\n\nSound track by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is okay, since I didn't find any song memorable enough that I would remember even years later from now, except for one really good one- \"Zinda\".\n\nI am not saying the movie is not entertaining though. It does have its moments- funny ones, heart touching ones and seldom even horrifying ones too. But with a script so loose, they lack their intended punch.\n\nIt's true that a biopic is supposed to detail the main character's epic journey through his life, but showing it in the form of flashbacks into flashbacks, making it more than 3 hours long, putting songs when they are not necessary and giving useless information? Now that's overdoing it.\n\nSo if you want to know, in too much detail, who Milkha Singh was, only then watch this movie. But then expecting that you won't get bored, well, you can't have everything."

The way Farhan dances , I must say that he can give solid competition to the best dancer of Bollywood , Hrithik Roshan . Yograj Singh , Pavan Malhotra , Dilip Tahil have also contributed in making this movie memorable. SONAM KAPOOR does not shine but her role was very limited .\n\nThe direction of this excellent movie is simply superb . Rakeysh Om Parkash Mehra has done full justice in direction and he has also put in extraordinary efforts in making this movie memorable . This biopic will definitely inspire many young Indians and create confidence in their minds that hard work and perseverance can work wonders .\n\nThe film is a tribute to our long-forgotten but living legend of track & field; more than that a revelation of the iron determination of Milkha Singh to our young generation & generation to come.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is a film about the life of Milkha Singh--a man who is beloved in India but who I'd never heard about before I saw this movie. He is about the most famous Olympic non-winner you can find--and the film begins with him coming in 4th in the 400 at the Rome Olympics.\n\nThe film is non-liner in style, as it goes from this even in 1960 back a few years to when Singh enlisted in the Indian Army to his childhood. But, unusually, it bounces back and forth repeatedly--and might confuse some viewers.\n\nThe big reason for this film is not only because Singh was a three-time Olympian (only two times are mentioned in the film) or an Asian champion but because of his roots. He was born in a region that was India but became part of Pakistan after the partition in 1947. This was a serious problem for Singh and his family, as they were Sikhs--and non-Muslims were apparently not welcome there. This isn't surprising, as the partition resulted in the deaths of anywhere from 200,000 to a million according to some estimates--on both sides of the border (everybody seemed to be killing each other in the name of god!). So, that Singh's family was displaced and his father murdered isn't surprising. Years later, the Indians and Pakistanis were planning a joint competition--and Singh would be an important part of that team. However, because of his past, his participation was doubtful and the film chronicles this.\n\nWhile this is a sports drama, I wasn't surprised that, yes, there were still several song and dance numbers. Not all Indian films have this but a huge percentage do--so expect a few nice musical interludes. Additionally, expect AMAZING cinematography, direction and special effects--making it equal in quality to the films of any nation. What really impressed me as well as Farhan Akhtar as Singh. Farhan really buffed himself up for the film and was a very impressive looking guy with his taut figure and muscles. He really LOOKED like a world-class athlete. Overall, an enjoyable film and one well worth your time."

The Movie has been a delight to watch, much due to the character of Milkha brought alive by Farhan Akhtar. He must now be regarded as one of the best actors (and not a hero) Indian Film industry has produced who can very easily be put in the league of Naseerudin Shah, OM Puri and Nana Patekar. The pain and effort he has taken to showcase the true spirit of Milkha Singh must have made Milkha mesmerized. Movie is relatively a long one even by Bolywood standards, who now has time to watch a 188 mins long movie. Editing was the weakest link of the movie, second to which are the songs. From a movie that involves Prasoon Joshi, such songs were not expected. The character played by Junior Milkha was the second best performance to Farhan's.\n\nAt some points, the story line looked like being dragged whenever it was taken on the backdrop of Pakistan. While I understand, making base around to depict story of a legend is important, you may sometimes take way the essence by exaggerating it for too long. The goosebumps which were about to happen were taken away by such long portrayal of the elements connecting movie to the mainstream.\n\nFor other actors there wasn't much to do except for the characters played by India's coach of Farhan and team played by Yograj Singh (father of cricketer Yuvraaj Singh) and Divya Dutta (Elder Sister of Milkha) and both of them did justice to their roles. Yograj for once will make you think that was he the real coach during that period when Milkha was made.\n\nBhag Milkha Bhag is definitely an amazing movie but clearly not the greatest. Farhan did a job way above any actor for the character of Milkha Singh but the movie looked more like an excuse book on legend Milkha citing reasons for all those races he couldn't win. Rising from the ashes was very well shown by Rakeysh but getting to0 deep and to0 long took away the very essence of the biopic based on sportsman's achievement around track & field.\n\nYes, it didn't give the goosebumps, but movie was beautifully sculptured by the beautiful acts of junior Farhan and FARHAN THE AKHTAR"

Milkha gains the lead in the race and looks to win the first ever track Olympics gold for India. But as he approaches the second corner of the track, he hears certain set of words from his coach, and these words seem not to be just words for him - 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'.\n\nAs you watch the rest of the movie you discover what was in those words that they haunted Milkha. The movie also showcases the spirit and dedication of this man and how he overcame his fears. The movie has an excellent background score that completely compliments the emotional connect the director of the movie expects the audience to have with the pain and suffering this great man.\n\nThe story of the Flying Sikh would have had acted as a catalyst that it further motivated Farhan to display exceptional dedication and perseverance for the role."

        "review_title": "Though you may not find it as energetic as projected but that is how real cinema can revive in Hindi Film Industry.",
        "review_detailed_main": "One of the most important responsibilities of cinema in a country is to bring forward few well researched and worth watching movies not only on its History, but also on its forgotten national heroes such as S. Milkha Singh, fondly known as \"The Flying Sikh\". And with BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, his writer Prasoon Joshi and their entire team has duly fulfilled their said responsibility competently.\n\nTalking about the film itself, yes it rightly introduces the younger generation to a man who had the guts of steel, conviction of an achiever and the spirit to do the hard work beyond imagination. It perfectly portrays a few selected chapters (till his last race) of the tough life lived by S. Milkha Singh taking many cinematic liberties of its own and remains a worth experiencing film for more than one reason, unarguably. But at the same time BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG again showcases the similar mistakes made by the thoughtful director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra in his earlier films namely AKS (2001) and DELHI-6 released in 2009 like insertion of few over dramatized sequences, unnecessarily giving artistic touches to the horrifying days of independence, a less engaging second half full of predictability and few avoidable dull moments resulting in an over-lengthy film going beyond 3 hours. Here I am keeping RANG DE BASANTI (2006) out of the list as I do assume that the film surely had another thinking mind working behind the curtain, who was none other than Aamir Khan.\n\nNevertheless, beginning with its plus points first, BMB does remain a worth watching realistic saga for all, mainly due to its three strong merits mentioned below.\n\n1. Firstly it needs to be applauded for the unbelievable kind of effort put in by writer-actor-singer and director Farhan Akhtar playing the lead role. The hard working creator not only looks exactly like the real Flying Sikh but he also plays his part with an utmost sincerity and conviction which is mostly missing in the present big names of the Industry. If truth be told, you don't witness such kind of willingness to perform your given role with such perfection in our Hindi Cinema more often.\n\n2. As the second merit it has a commendable performance from a young Jabtej Singh, portraying the childhood days of S. Milkha Singh superbly. The boy is not only a perfect choice for the role but he also comes up with a performance which can equally stand tall along with the one presented by Farhan.\n\n3. Thirdly the film truly deserves to be seen for two small cameos of the immensely talented Divya Dutta & one of the most underrated actors of Hindi films, Pawan Malhotra. Both the veterans bring back the emotional tears in their respective scenes and make you feel the hidden pain in the life story of S. Milkha Singh more than any other actor in the entire film. Personally I too had moist eyes hearing the way, Divya calmly says, \"Milkhu\" in a scene where she meets him after a long time.\n\nIn the supporting cast, Prakash Raj surprises you in a short positive appearance and thankfully Yograj Singh comes up with a quite controlled act as the national coach. In the female lead, Sonam impresses in a guest role and both Meesha (from Pakistan) and Rebecca Breeds (from Australia) are just fine. K.K. Raina delivers an OK act but DalipTahil is not able to make any kind of impact playing Pandit Nehru.\n\nAs a cinematic documentation of S. Milkha Singh's world famous career, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG does ample justification to all the suffering, struggle and triumph lived by the Flying Sikh to a large extent. The cinematography is of international standard, enhancing the overall result to many folds using the graphics in its various sequences magnificently. Yet the director forcibly uses his own artistic touches in the 1947 killing sequences which could have been avoided as I strongly felt.\n\nThe early part of the film reminds you of PAAN SINGH TOMAR but then you get to see a well directed and majestically acted first half which impresses you a lot being a realistic bio-pic and a visual treat, also providing the much needed entertainment factor constantly. Post intermission the pace drops considerably and everything starts heading towards a predictable race event taking too long with many overstretched sequences. The girls coming one after another become annoying after a while. And then it all comes down to the most awaited moment of the race where I really missed some energetic background music and the excitement which could bring me on to the edge of my seat as expected.\n\nHence, its actually not a Sports movie but a realistic and emotionally moving bio-pic which goes over-length towards the end, unfortunately. The film does move you a lot in its various brilliant sequences, but with a better edit and more exhilarating background score it could have reached that much desired cult status for sure. The musical score by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy serves the purpose well as you are watching it and the songs are also intelligently used taking the narration forward (But I really couldn't appreciate its title song with such a weak composition).\n\nOn the whole, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG may not be as energetic as projected in its promotional campaign. It misses the fire and it misses the excitement. Yet it does remain a worth watching film and a significant step in Hindi Film Industry, showing them a way that we do need to make films on our historical figures and national heroes at regular intervals, along with catering to the commercial aspects of the business like BMB.\n\nSo do watch it in the theaters with all the young ones in your family, especially for Farhan, Divya and Jabtej respectfully saluting our national hero, The Flying Sikh, Sardar Milkha Singh."

Oh, did I forget to mention the Australian \"Sheilas\"\" This is like 9 different movies spliced into 1 long reel. It's got everything except Nazis, polar bears, and aliens from another planet.

But even than it would leave with us some marks, some impression that belongs to wide range of incidents from India-Pakistan partition to straw man life conditions. And other things that really worth to see is the character of Milkha Sing played by Farhan Akhtar. This man deserve a lot of applause not just because of stunning physicality that he has acquired, but for almost everything from his body language to the way he deliver his Dialogue, he look like a complete package in himself & I have no doubt to say that this is his carrier-best delivery.Other actors also have done justice with their characters like his trainer (Pawan Malhotra). Ladylove (Sonam Kapoor) doesn't have that much role to play, but she fits perfectly to her character."

His childhood life, his proffessional life, personal stories, his career as an Indian representative in Athletes cover the entire film. The movie is well scripted but is heavily draggy, to imply the emotions of the story. Another issue is the BGM ie rock score ; it didn't felt like well relatable to a person from 1930s. The characters are not bright ; rather dull and doesn't felt like that of defense guys. Not even Prakash Raj and Farhan Akhtar didn't get lighten up to their potential. Its just raw depiction, nothing higher than that. The depiction of emotions especially the partition issues fails to take a grip. Other actress and performances are good to watch.\n\nThe impressive thing shown in the film is that of Milkha Singh character, his dedication to his goal among so many Distractions. His self understanding of his own erroneous actions are praiseworthy points that makes the protagony as the bright point. But as usual ROM seem to be confused about what the direction of the narrtives should be. It felt less like a biography and gets inlined towards sports theme. But then biographical approach again takes a hold on and goes like that successively. Summing up its not a masterpiece but a good movie in biographical attempt. Just one or two watch. For the attempt it is a 65/100."

Inspired by true events, the movie feels very true. A long movie as it is, it touches various aspects and each of these have been splendidly perfectly made.It is like a huge pizza, but every little portion of it is well cooked and offers various flavors for a truly wholesome experience.\n\nAs an Indian, you should watch it to know more about Milkha Singh, you have the responsibility that you know what this man has gone through to represent your country and his life just unfolds in front of your eyes beautifully. Amazing content and perfect presentation.\n\nReminds you of 'Paan Singh Tomaar' due to similarity in theme. While 'Paan Singh Tomaar' was a very good movie, this is way way beyond.\n\nI am a hard core 'Rang De Basanti' fan and have watched the movie at least six-seven times. And when I asked myself whether this movie beat 'Rang De Basanti' , made by the same director (Rakesh Omprakash Mehra), I am inclined to say 'Yes.It has'. The product has come out extremely well - the thoroughness is mindblowing.\n\nWhile there are so many aspects of the movie that are extraordinary, while you watch the movie , what is most extraordinary is the movie itself. The excellent integrity of the movie is all that I could see while watching the movie.\n\nFarhan has just become Milkha. I do not remember any Farhan movies recently - so Farhan was Milkha for me. Milkha is such a sincere true-heart loving person that you are with him all through the movie. Farhan has done great work.\n\nSongs and music of the movie is great.\n\nCharacterisations are excellent. Relationship of Milkha with his sister is most endearing.\n\nThe little little incidents on life are beautifully chosen , beautifully picturised. Many heartwarming scenes.\n\nThe main thread of the perseverance of Milkha to be the best athlete is very well made. The national significance of sports and what it means to the common people , the excitement , the involvement, everything has been captured very well and true to it's times.\n\nI am filled with admiration for Rakesh Omprakash Mehra and I feel more and more sure that he has surpassed 'Rang De Basanti' with this one."

Divya Dutt stands out as the proud elder sister. Sonam needs to improve and a very smart cameo by the captain of the movie makes it a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nThe songs come and go along well.

Prakash Raj, Yograj Singh, Sonam Kapoor, Meesha Shafi and Japtej Singh acted so well."

Especially Farhan Akhtar who portrayed Milkha Singh with full determination, strength, emotions and all!! By this movie, he has truly emerged himself as an outstanding actor and this film will be the landmark of his career!!! On the whole, this movie is sure to win awards, admiration, respect and esteem besides emerging as a champ! Reserve the applause for Milkha Singh and the team behind this movie! After a long time, i have cheered for a movie!! It really deserves a standing ovation!"

The story totally revolves around the life of \"Milkha Singh\" and it has been done beautifully by the whole team of the movie. The film is critically a masterpiece and has some really good shots.

Most of our generation barely knows anything about Milkha Singh barring the fact that he was known as the \"flying Sikh\", this movie outlines the first 30 years of his life and enlightens us about his history. What makes Milkha what he is articulated well seamlessly through multiple flashbacks. Farhan Akhtar does a fine job shifting between Milkha's anguish over his past, his naive dreams and most of all his will power. The pace of the movie drops in a few scenes but still keeps the viewer tuned in. Great watch!!! Easily one of the best Hindi films in 2013."

He runs. Every sinew tugging and rippling to be fed. For that one glass of milk(ha!). He had a choice to run away, or to run. He did the right thing, he ran. Oh yes, the eternal metaphor 'the race of life'. We're all runners. With reason enough? A finish line to shred? Milkha Singh did. He ran his first race for ek glass doodh. And he never stopped. Untiringly. He ran because it was his religion.\n\n'BMB' traces his scarred childhood, brutalized by India's Partition; followed by penury and petty crimes. He finds purpose in life when romance blooms with Beero (Sonam). Joining the Indian Army, where his mentor (Malhotra) inspires him to take the big 'leap'. Thereon, Milkha just runs. Barefooted, bruised, and with the weight of a suffering soul. He goes on to break records, but faces heartbreaking defeat at the Rome Olympics(1960). He takes it in his stride, overcomes his catastrophic past and ultimately emerges a winner.\n\nMehra is brilliant at his craft; he infuses realism into drama, and explores characters so deeply and sensitively through tragedy and triumph, that it sparks an emotional deluge. The movie transitions from flashback sepia tones to moods of present, without losing the grip of emotions, ever.\n\nCinematography is ace (Binod Pradhan); the music (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) heightens the drama. Prasoon's writing is powerful, lyrics are pure poetry and emotions robustly sweep the scenes with few dialogues. While there's a lot to marvel at, a hint of the director's over-indulgence in the art, results in a long 'runtime' and prolonged scenes that distract.\n\nFarhan is fantastic! He peeps through Milkha's core to essay this role. With an awe-inspiring body, grit and guts, he puts blood and sweat into Milkha. He races like an athlete, breaks into bhangra like a proud sardar and shows prowess of a Punjab-da-sher. In a brief role, Sonam prettily breezes through. Pavan and Divya (Singh's sister) are outstanding. Overall, 'BMB' pulsates with the storyteller's sheer passion all the way to the finish line."

It shows how much work he had to do for this casting.\n\nIt's good to see that someone has made the it while Mr. Milkha is among us. A posthumous applause doesn't really pay homage to the hero, rather serves for the descendants only. But we need to pay condign tribute to these who deserves it within their physical being among us.\n\nPartition, a permanent ink bruise to our subcontinent is also portrayed with great skill, kudos to the director.

        "review_detailed_main": "I am not trying to relate this to Milkha Singh's real life. However, this was an attempt to portray Singh and narrate his life through a motion picture. To preserve the elements of Bollywood and to maintain the \"larger than life\" aspect, a number of unnecessary scenes and characters have been added. The ghee-gulping scene was terrible and could not be accepted. By any stretch of imagination, I did not find it possible for a man to do anything even close to that. Sonam Kapoor came and disappeared. She was not required in the story but as I said, was necessary for the Bollywood \"chatak\". The foreign girl and the sex scene could just not have been a part of the story. Other absurd things keep happening and God knows why IMDb rates the movie so high. Also, the story wasn't very long, and yet, it was stretched to 3hrs and 10mins. I must say that Farhan Akhtar has done an immensely difficult job. He was brilliant from the first scene to the last and i can well imagine the hard work that has gone into each of these scenes. I must say that if you are concerned with the relevance of the film with reality, forget it...you will hardly find any."

        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike most normies, I already knew who Milkha Singh was. I had heard about his losing in the Rome Olympics, and the moment I began watching the biopic I felt it was just going to be a whitewash of his image. All his actions will be justified. But as the film progressed I realised this is not the case. This is one of the best biopics I have ever seen. Considering there are barely any good biopics (and also the fact that I hate biopics), there wasn't any competition anyway, but it did set a bar.\n\nBhaag Milkha Bhaag is a coming of age biopic. It begins at the time just before independence and carries on to the 1962 Asian Games. Milkha's entire family is murdered during the partition and he goes to join the army. From there he gets fascinated to be an athlete. He is never shown to be a good guy. He has his own share of flaws, even though his intentions are never to hurt anyone. He just ends up doing things he should not do being the naive villager that he is. Finally he grows out of that personality and becomes the Flying Sikh that he is known as.\n\nThe score, the cinematography, the acting, everything is on point. Farhan Akhtar looks very much like the young Milkha Singh. Normally when we think of the time of the independence we only think of very cultural, conservative families. We never think of some fun loving loafer that Milkha was. Milkha Singh has himself confessed that this film is mostly true, so it's not like the makers of this film are just showing all that to market their film. The only problem I have with this film is the overuse of details. I understand that this is Milkha Singh's life being depicted as a person and not as an athlete, but there were many storylines that went absolutely nowhere like a swimmer who tried to kiss him, or what finally happened of Biro.\n\nI'd say this is undoubtedly one of the only good biopics Bollywood has ever made, the others being MS Dhoni: The Untold Story and Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (if that counts). Normally I completely trash biopics, but not this one. This one has made me have really high expectations from all biopics."

In the negative phase of this film there shouldn't be the songs like slow motion angreze which showed up the artificiality. Almost every department did well.

        "review_detailed_main": "Today's Hindi film industry observes that the movies related on lives of famous personalities, which are termed as biopic are attaining fast recognition and acclaim. Dhulia's Paan Singh Tomar, Luthria's Dirty Picture, Legend of Bhagat Singh and Chak De India are illustrations of such highly acclaimed projects. Considering this ongoing trend, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (Director of Rang De Basanti and Delhi 6) decided to encompass the real-life episodes of the athlete Milkha Singh in this film 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'. The film happens to be a sweeping and stirring biography of Milkha Singh entitled as 'The Flying Sikh' about his uphill struggle, apprehensions and his path towards glory. Three hours and 8 minutes of this Farhan Akhtar starrer keeps u hooked to your seat from commencement to conclusion.\n\nThe starting scene of the film is based in 1960 in Rome, Italy showing Olympic sports meet where a sprinter Milkha Singh starts the race being ahead of all but slowly loses speed and agility as the past memories of his childhood begin to haunt him amidst the race dropping him to the fourth position. The main reason for this loss happens to be a shout given by his coach saying 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' which triggers these past memories. This is the point where we know that this athlete has gone through some tough depressing days in his childhood. However, generation of past memories only by mere ushering by his coach for a highly experienced athlete seems very unrealistic.\n\nAfter the unfortunate loss in Rome, Jawaharlal Nehru announces sports meet between India and Pakistan to be held on the Pakistani land and Milkha refuses to be the part of this meet. The movie goes back a few decades where a child Milkha is seen having his happy time in a village of Punjab until one day, due to India-Pakistan partition, war commences there leading to all his friends and relatives getting massacred with only few survivors.\n\nMilkha comes to Delhi, India in search of his elder sister thereby leading a life of misery and unstoppable agony being a local goon stealing coals from passing-by trains with his local friends falls in love madly with a Punjabi girl (Sonam Kapoor) and decides to transform himself into a gentleman to win her hand for marriage. He joins Indian Army and ends up being an athlete due to his running capabilities and agility. A sprinter running for the Indian army, starts representing his own country India in Olympics, thus fulfilling his own ambition of doing so. The film shows some of his glorious and triumphant moments as a successful sprinter. Some of the episodes in film show his intimate moments with an Australian girl Stella as the film slowly starts unnecessarily deviating from its genre. The film happens to be respectful but unreasonably long.\n\nFarhan gets the golden opportunity to portray one of the most iconic characters hence delivering his most phenomenal performance till today. Right from a sculpted physique, body language to his look, Farhan has extended his capability beyond his limits. Dilip Tahil also delivers a convincing performance as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru while Divya Dutta captures the viewers emotionally.\n\nThe music director trio Shankar-Ehsan-Loy captures every beat with mastery uplifting the background score of the film, making the soul of the film more beautiful. Along with some splendid music, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra takes care with his shots, zooming in and using slow-motion to make a body travelling through a finish line.\n\nThe film would have been totally flawless should the director have pruned some unnecessary scenes only to have made the film short and sweet. The story oscillates abruptly from Milkha's personal and professional life and also displaying the flashback memories again and again. The race scenes are too much in slow motion but there is sufficient dramatic control by the director and grace in Farhan's acting."

This is was a wonderful biography and i wt give 10/10.. if there is no Indian Pakistani masala\n\nwe all have our hand dirty if we dig down the history. This type of movie only creates more hatred than ever.\n\nI am not telling that this history over projected and on sided .. the thing shocking me that 80s India Pakistan masala was not presented by Sunny Deol or Ajay Devghan\n\nThis punch was presented by two excellence Farhan Akhtar and Rakesh Omprakash Mehra .... WHAT A SHAME"

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the life of Indian Sport Legend Milkha Singh, 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is A Masterstroke! A Biopic that inspires, engages & enlightens. A Winner All The Way!\n\n'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' Is The true story of the \"Flying Sikh\" - world champion runner and Olympian Milkha Singh -- who overcame the massacre of his family, civil war during the India-Pakistan partition, and homelessness to become one of India's most iconic athletes.\n\n'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' unfolds the daring & courageous life of Milkha Singh, superbly. Prasoon Joshi's Screeenplay adapts The Flying Sikh's Story so amazingly, it left me spell-bound at many places. I particularly loved the depiction of Milkha's relationship with his Sister. Those portions are the high point of the enterprise. Even the races are executed masterfully. Joshi's Screenplay is terrific from start to end.\n\nRakeyesh Omprakash Mehra's Direction is outstanding. He handles each chapter of Milkha Singh's life with great imagination. A job very well-done! Cinematography is top-class. Editing is razor-sharp. Music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is lovely.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Farhan Akhtar is flawless as Milkha Singh. He plays the legend so well, you just forget you're watching an actor performing! An Award Worthy Performance! Divya Dutta as Milkha Singh's suffering sister, is incredible. Her performance is heart-breaking. Sonam Kapoor is wonderful in a cameo. Pawan Malhotra enacts his part like a pro. Yograj Singh is good. Prakash Raj is efficient. Master Jabtej Singh plays the younger Milkha Singh & he's delightful. Dalip Tahil is adequate.\n\nOn the whole, 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is a must see!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag works for two basic reasons. One it is based on the story of a sports person whose personal life is dramatic enough to keep you engaged apart from its racing track achievements and second it is played by Farhan Akhtar who plays his role as if he is really Milkha Singh himself. Farhan Akhtar excels playing Milkha Singh like Ben Kingsley excelled playing Gandhi. Farhan Akhtar seems to be enjoying every bit of the movie. When he runs, he runs like a tiger. When he dances, he dances like a pure Punjabi. When he loves, he loves with innocence and passion. Farhan Akhtar can easily be given all best actor awards of 2013. All supporting actors give their best. Divya Dutta is excellent, Sonam Kapoor looks fresh, Pawan Malhotra and Parkash Raj's performance are heartwarming. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is first rate and awe inspiring. Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra like an expert captain provides movie its uniqueness, technical perfection, soul and purpose. Like an every fantastic experience, this also comes with its dull moments. Movie takes around extra half an hour before reaching to its finale. Rangrezz song could have been avoided and prolonged sequences of Milkha's achievements could have been shortened. Dilip Tahil playing Pandit Nehru."

Director who gave blockbuster RDB has done a good job again. Shankar Ehsaan's music was fine. Australian country song in Punjabi style and the inspirational score of \"Thu hai aag Milka\" are such a treat to the ears. Actors did a fine job. Farhan was superb and almost looked transformed himself into the character. Sonam had too little role to offer.In spite of all positives, the film contains a lot of fictional elements along with facts (e.g..., a guy breaking some record with wounded feet and other guy drinking 2 cans of ghee and doing 100 push-ups. which is typical bollywoodish and unreal). The bottom-line is: Apart from few fictional scenes ,a must watch for all Indians (PG for below 12 years) as it is motivational and reminds us of our country's greatest athlete."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are two ways to look at Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.\n\n1. Comparing it to the usual Bollywood flick. 2. Talking about the movie itself. Here's my review if I compare it to the rest of the Bollywood flicks (especially) biopics like Bose \u2013 The Forgotten Hero. The movie is fantastic. Running at 3 hours and 20 minutes, it very precisely and beautifully shows what made Milkha, Milka! For the first time ever the painful partition of Indian into India and Pakistan was shown without Hindu-Muslim-Sikh chanting slogans. In fact not even faces of the people coming to vandalize Milkha's Sikh family are show. The director uses his cinematic intelligence to show it from the viewpoint of a 10-11 year old kid. Brilliantly shot and presented, that piece is. The screenplay is again brilliant and much like Rang De Basanti, the director has used different hues to show the different times. Scenes are interwoven nicely and the narration flows seamlessly. The research the director had done clearly shows on screen. Post partition, young Milkha is shown sitting on the boundary of the structure which hosts the refugee camp. This shot has taken inspiration from a real image wherein a Sikh kid is shown sitting on the boundary overlooking the tents. Shahdara is shown a part of UP (as it was) and Milkha's father is shown eating in a copper-alloy plate and is just a roti and ghee!\n\nIf I talk about the movie standalone? The best part about the movie is Farhan Akhtar as Milkha Singh. You can see his transformation on-screen and he's lived up the athlete more than convincingly. Pawan Malhotra and Yograj Singh walk shoulder to shoulder with Farhan Akhtar in terms of their acting.\n\nI guess that's where the best things about movie end. The director (or probably the editor) has simply wasted Misha Shafi. The good looking girl from Pakistan ends up saying a line or two in 2 different scenes. That's about her! Divya Dutta was under-utilized. She is one of the brilliant actors we have in Indian Film Industry. However, she wasn't able to live up to her magnitude. Sonam Kapoor was simply a waste and I am glad she just charged director Rs. 11 for her role. Can you imagine a girl calling India, India in 50s? Can you imagine a guy holding his lover's face in public? And how can you tolerate to see mobile towers in background behind dancing heroine? In fact Rebecca Breeds was able to leave an impression! And a good one for that matter.\n\nFurthermore, why does the hero has to sing and dance? Why can't we have songs playing over montage sequences? The movie is too long and saving 30-40 minutes would have made the movie much more interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist that is all - Oscar Wilde\n\nMilkha Singh lives and he truly lived against all the odds. Salute. Please, go watch this film and then judge it.\n\nI always believe that sportsmen and artists are the ones, who truly live. They have a purpose to do something. All others, merely exist. Now existence means, since we are born, and have to do something we just exist till death and then die someday and nobody except the family and friends remember us. While sportsmen and artists, live even after death and that's the kind of life, we must aspire for.\n\nNow, this film raised some very pertinent questions, do we Indians, love sport? When was the last film based on a true sports person and how many are made? Do we know sportsmen apart from the cricketers, who take part in Olympics? How many who are reading this, know Milkha Singh?\n\nIndia is in a sorry state in Sports and except few folks, no one is passionate or serious about sports in our country. A country of 120 Crores does not have 120 medals from last 120 years. Such is the state of the nation in sport, just very sad.\n\nOK, now coming to the movie. I just loved it, and it was flawless for me. Yes, there are evident flaws, but all were surpassed by supreme performance of one man, Farhan Akhtar and his commitment to the role shall win him sublime acclaim. Though all other performances were good. Divya Dutta excelled as Milkha's sister and brought tears to my eyes.\n\nThe cinematography was superb, the color toning used, the way the races were shot, wow it was just exemplary for me. The songs, so apt to situations, I would have still been happy with couple of songs less, but it's okay. The editing would have been better considering this movie is 3 hours but never did I feel all along that this was so very long. In fact I cherished every moment of it. I cherished it because of the honesty of purpose, it's one of the most purposeful true story that has come out in a long time in our country. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and Prasoon Joshi have done an exemplary job in executing a story that's nothing short of an epic.\n\nThat take away is this this \"Hard Work, Will Power and Dedication, for a man with these qualities, sky is the limit'\n\nIt's a 5/5 for this, nothing less. I just loved it.\n\nMr Farhan Akhtar, I loved you as director, then as an actor, then as a singer and then as a TV host too. Now, I love you as Milkha. You are a prime example of a man who knows his strengths and his limitations. But when stop doing the stupid ads of Intex and Tata Motors, you will be fine. You are the man who gave us \"Lakshya\" and Dil Chahta Hai\" just don't desecrate by becoming less. I still see you as a sanctified being."

Even commendable job by DIVYA DUTTA. The Indian Army training is very well portrayed, really wonder if MILKHA SINGH went through all that trauma. Hats off to the athlete in him that despite such difficult conditions, he rose to be what he is today. The movie also proves, why India has been so poor in Olympic Medal tally, you see our youth is lured by all the glitz in foreign land.\n\nAll in all, a very good value for your money, must Go and Watch it."

        "review_detailed_main": "It should have 'A' certificate for many of the scenes, more so as they refer to the history, which could cast a spell on young receptive minds leaving a permanent mark of some poignant emotions in a very dreadful way. All the children from new-born infants to the transforming teenagers should be strictly refrained from watching it to avoid another generation of fanatics being raised who can derail easily in the heat of circumstances. As the friend of Milkha Singh in the movie rightly puts it 'It's not people that are evil, its circumstances\u0085' and as we have a very limited authority of controlling the circumstances those would always outlast the human fanaticism and greed, we are left with the only option of developing young minds in the most righteous, noble and generous form as we can. The base of one's understanding of being, self-image and belief system is structured at large in the most formative years of life i.e. from 5 years to 15 years, most of the psychoanalysts agree.\n\nIt could be a little, why, a lot more short and crisp as far as the unnecessary stretch of some scenes is concerned and it surely could have done very well with getting rid of few songs. The 'comedy' and 'songs' are considered inevitable parts of a Hindi movie for some incomprehensible reasons which could be avoided for better with the evolving age of bollywood till the point in time when bollywood film-makers get to the depths of its intention and application. Particularly the mindless love songs and inappropriate hyperactive intense scenes (load of which breaks the back of most of the South-Indian movies with otherwise a good plot) could comfortably retire now from the silver screen unless they have a strong bond with the main thread or take the story to a new, high level. Even it is assumed that there is an emotional need of such scenes for 'sensitive' audience, the idiot box with its abundant dramatic reality shows and typecast 'nonsense' serials is providing for that stimuli much more than required(?).\n\nIt would be sensible and conscientious to check all the historical facts like Actual World Records, Authorized Documented Achievements and Chronology of the concerned events as the film claims to be inspired from and based on the true story of a living legend. With all the consideration for the cinematic liberty that the director has exploited to its extents, a thought about a less pseudo filmy and more rational authentic treatment could have taken the film long way in its credibility and not just the entertainment value. The sepia-toned fading flash-back style is quite effective and manages to engage the minds of the audience in a different world but it seems repetitive and clich\u00e9d as compared to its innovative use for the first time in 'Rang De Basanti' by the same director. Film is a media of great potential and for huge assorted population, director's relentless innovation in telling a story to the contemporary audience in the most captivating way holds the key to the success of a movie. It could be more entertaining yet influential with a touch of little quirky imagination that would offer it as another entertaining movie with an insightful message and still keep it from turning into a documentary.\n\nAs far as the cinematography is concerned, it is not only international standard but has raised the bar for world cinema so high that every film-maker will have to strive hard to maintain it. Slow-motion photography being the essence of it, it simply overshadows every other department of this effort except all-rounder performance with almost spontaneous and contagious dancing of Farhan, he has evolved more as an intense actor than the most sensible director he used to be at times. Pavan Malhotra, Divya Datta and Japtej Singh (Childhood) have done full justice to their significant roles and other supporting cast except Milkha's Father (Art Malik) could be forgotten easily. Sonam Kapoor, as usual, couldn't do much of yet another golden opportunity and manages to look comfortable under the skin of 'Biro'- Milkha's first lover. All in all, you can go for it if you are a social person who is supposed to be updated and knows-it-all types and even enjoy it for some part, still it will be audacious to call it a classic or even a must-watch, unless you are the sentimental types relating everything in the cinema to your own life!"

Active confrontations only lead to making him a tougher guy, who finally earns the title of \"The Flying Sikh\" from the head of what is called the rival nation, Pakistan.\n\nThe movie grabs attention with its quick switches from the past to the present, commenting upon the mental state of Milkha who has been shown to be a witness to a whole lot of eye-protruding sights. The title is derived from his father's last words asking him to run away from the hungry-for-lives murderers created at the time of partition.\n\nAlso incorporated in the movie is a traditional-Indian-cinema- requirement, an unrequited love story which thankfully does not overshadow the main theme, although love was responsible for pushing Milkha to quit being a thief.\n\nFarhan Akhtar, a persona that induces inspiration has flaunted an enviable body and wonderful performance, well complemented by Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh, Divya Dutta and others. The technique has been apt to create an awe as well as induce goosebumps in the audience.\n\nAll in all, it is a journey of hard work, distractions, resentment, consequent abhorrence, focus and emotions. A medley of all this contributes to making him what he really was...\n\nWell it had an effect on me too- I ran fast as I could to get home after the movie, because I knew my parents were restless to kick my butt off.... ;)"

Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is back after Delhi-6 debacle but is not as thumping as his masterpiece RDB. Boasting of brilliant performances by mostly all characters, this biopic becomes myopic with unnecessary love angles, non-required songs and a certain sluggishness. Farhan gives an out of skin performance and virtually looks like the real Flying Sikh. Pavan Malhotra and Divya Dutta are as endearing as the child actor who played young Milkha. Cinematography is realistic. Music is a bit ill-placed with powerful song like 'Zinda' not used to its full potential. Sonam and Rebecca just come and go to add glam which wasn't required in an otherwise genuine story. In all, a bit less than my expectations but definitely a one-time watch; all for Akhtar's hardwork and as a salute to a great sportsperson!"

In one word, awesome. The movie very beautifully portrays the life of Milkha Singh, commonly known as the Flying Sikh. There could be two negative aspects that you may hear about the movie. First one is that BMB is all about the life of an athlete. But, what's wrong with it? All movies tells us some stories. This particular movie shows us one of our own legends. How many of us know how his life was? If anyone tells you the film is too long with over 3 hours of running time, I could assure you that there is no single scene that is unnecessary. And, never would we feel bored though movie is on a slow pace at times. The direction by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is on an even higher level than where Rang De Basanti was. Though there was risk of repeated visuals of races boring viewers, he has handled all those beautifully. The cinematographer too is to be commended. Coming to our hero, Farhan Akhthar. There has never been such dedicated performance by a protagonist in recent years. Almost all scenes has Farhan in it. Master Jabtez, who shows Milkha's childhood, is also talented. Sonam Kapoor, Prakash Raj and Rebecca Breeds have small roles, and all have done a neat job. Music by Shankar-Ehsaan_Loy is another highlight of the movie. The title track as well as Zinda are chart busters, while Rangrez\u0085 is soothing. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is not a documentary. It is a class movie while it entertains as well. Viewers cheering the hero, something which is seen in the so-called mass movies, was seen here too. Milkha Singh was a bygone generation's hero. Some of us may think why we should watch that. But after a thirty years or so, if someone directs a movie on Sachin Tendulkar (maybe Bat Sacin Bat), would you not want your children to watch it?"

Unemployed and Disappointed, I switched on the TV and the movie was about to start...nothing to do, I watched the full movie. At the end, I was inspired from Milkha's story and struggles.\n\nBhaag Milkha Bhaag is the underdog story simply put. But Mehra and Akthar make it an outstanding film. Akthar gets into the skin on the legendary character and transforms himself. In many scenes, he looks, breathes and talks like Milkha Singh and at times, I felt that it was the real Milkha on screen. There is not any moment in the film where Akthar fakes his pain or struggle. Award winning stuff.\n\nThe movie at times is slow and uneven. It jumps from past to present and linking the scenes might end up confusing some. But these are minor hiccups.\n\nThe movie also has a spectacular supporting cast who deliver awesome performances starting with Divya Dutta as Milkha's sister, Pawan Malhotra and Yograj Singh as Milkha's coaches and Prakash Raj as his senior officer. The only disappointing bit is Dalip Tahil who plays Pandit Nehru. He plays Nehru as if Nehru was some American returned man.\n\nOverall, just watch it for Farhan Akthar if you need just a reason."

Though it was followed by a crushing disaster Delhi-6, he made up for his blunder with an awe-inspiring Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. What a movie!!\n\nThe movie depicts the life of Milkha Singh - how he became the famous \"Flying Sikh\". When the movie started, it reminded me of Paan Singh Tomar but with its progress I went on to a completely different world. A slight editing may not have caused any harm, but the 3 hour long movie with an elegantly simultaneous narrative of the present and past life of Milkha Singh was a pleasure to watch.\n\nNo doubt about Farhan Akhtar's credibility. His prodigious hard work was booming throughout the film. But the kid who portrayed Milkha Singh (past) was exceptionally brilliant. Divya Dutta too blossomed after a very long time...probably after Veer Zaara.\n\nThough certain flaws existed in the movie - being an Indian guy of 1956, Milkha would not smooch an Australian woman whom he had just known for a couple of hours OR a person who could not even speak in a normal pitch suddenly starts singing.\n\nBut considering the movie as whole, it is worth watching. 7/10 and +1 for the kid's acting."

I got surprised, since every now and then the title song of the movie gets played because every award had been stolen by this movie only.\n\nThis movie gets its inspiration from a script written by Prasoon Joshi based on the life of Flying Sikh 'Milkha Singh', an Indian Athlete who was a national champion, runner and an Olympian.\n\nThe movie get started with the 1960 summer Olympics in Rome, where a coach keeps on saying \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\". Then the movie ships back and forth in time. It goes to the Milkha's childhood and his traumatic and confused life. Childhood days of 'Milkha' always haunted him its because of the partition of India during British India in 1947 that leads to the religious riots and chaos, which leads to his parents death. Milkha met his sister in a refugee camp later and started stealing with his newly made friends. Soon he joined the camp, his running skills got noticed by the Hawaldar there and he convinced him for a race for the milk and bread, and he won. And this became the starting point of World known Milkha Singh.\n\nMilkha Singh then won several races and became the top most athlete of the nation. Inspite of being injured he breaks the national record. Later he participated in several international competition and hoisted the flag of India there too. Sometimes he got distracted by the materialistic world. The Then prime minister Jawahar Lal Nehru confronted him to represent India in a friendly sports meet between India and Pakistan. There he went to his village and it reminded him of his parents death and the last words by his father \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\".\n\nIn the field, initially the Pakistan favorite was leading but then Milkha gets the lead eventually overtaking opponents one by one and finally won the race. Impressed by his efforts, the president of Pakistan gave him the name of \"The Flying Sikh\", and declared one day national holiday on his name.\n\nFarhan Khan has done a great job in the movie making. He has played the character of Mikha Singh with full honesty and with great perfection. He also worked hard to achieve an athlete physique. But sometimes i do feel a bit of his own creation there, in that respect i will go with THE PAAN SINGH TOMAR for the acting of Irrfan khan was superb, but overall the movie BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG was best scripted and attracted lot of people.\n\nOverall this movie is worth watching, its a very engrossing and inspirational movie and tribute to what great heights a man can reach with determination and a fierce inner desire to excel. There is nothing much I can really tell you except to go and see this movie. It would make a great watch for kids and youth as well."

He grows rogue (because of what he witnesses) until the woman he loves addresses him to become a respected person. This makes him to join army where he finds his athletic skills. The later part is how he keeps on winning and bringing pride to India. At the end, Pakistan gives him the title 'The flying Sikh' and movie ends (4/5).\n\nMusic: Music is very good (4.5/5). It highly adds to charm of the movie.\n\nActing: Acting is very good (4/5).\n\nFinal Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)]."

Milkha Singh (20 November 1929 - 18 June 2021), also known as \"The Flying Sikh\", was an Indian track and field sprinter who was introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army. He is the only athlete to win gold at 400 metres at the Asian Games as well as the Commonwealth Games. Partition of India in 1947 caused chaos which resulted in mass religious violence in Punjab in British India, killing the parents of Milkha Singh (Farhan Akhtar). He reaches Delhi and later meets his sister there. Living in impoverished refugee camps, Milkha soon makes friends and survives by stealing with his friends."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, is a compelling biographical drama that chronicles the inspiring journey of Milkha Singh, one of India's greatest athletes. The film, based on Singh's autobiography \"The Race of My Life,\" captures his rise from a war-torn childhood to becoming a world-renowned sprinter.\n\nPlot Summary The narrative begins with Milkha Singh's (Farhan Akhtar) heartbreaking loss in the 1960 Rome Olympics, setting the stage for a series of flashbacks that delve into his past. From his traumatic childhood during the Partition of India, which saw his family brutally murdered, to his struggles as a refugee, the film portrays the indomitable spirit that drove him to greatness.\n\nMilkha's journey from a young boy fleeing violence to joining the Indian Army and discovering his talent for running is portrayed with emotional depth and intensity. The film covers his rigorous training, numerous victories, and personal setbacks, culminating in his redemption at the 1960 Rome Olympics.\n\nPerformances Farhan Akhtar's portrayal of Milkha Singh is nothing short of transformative. His physical transformation, coupled with his emotional depth, brings Milkha's character to life. Akhtar's dedication to the role is evident in his athletic build, running sequences, and nuanced performance, capturing both the vulnerability and determination of the Flying Sikh.\n\nDivya Dutta delivers a poignant performance as Milkha's sister, Isri Kaur, whose unwavering support plays a crucial role in his journey. Pavan Malhotra as Milkha's coach and mentor, Gurudev Singh, provides a strong, grounding presence. Sonam Kapoor, in a brief but impactful role as Milkha's love interest, Biro, adds a touch of romance to the narrative.\n\nDirection and Screenplay Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's direction is masterful, blending the personal and professional aspects of Milkha's life with finesse. The screenplay by Prasoon Joshi is tightly woven, effectively capturing the highs and lows of Milkha's journey. The film's non-linear narrative structure adds depth, keeping the audience engaged as the story unfolds.\n\nThemes and Execution Bhaag Milkha Bhaag explores themes of resilience, perseverance, and the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity. It delves into Milkha's internal struggles, his fight against his own demons, and his quest for identity and redemption. The film also addresses the impact of historical events like the Partition, adding a layer of socio-political commentary.\n\nThe portrayal of Milkha's training and athletic achievements is authentic and inspiring, with the running sequences being particularly well-executed. The film's pacing is generally strong, though some sequences could have been tightened for a more streamlined narrative.\n\nMusic and Cinematography Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music complements the film beautifully, with tracks like \"Zinda\" and \"Maston Ka Jhund\" standing out. The background score enhances the emotional and dramatic moments, adding to the film's overall impact.\n\nBinod Pradhan's cinematography captures the essence of each era depicted in the film, from the chaos of Partition to the grandeur of international athletic events. The use of slow-motion in the running sequences adds a dramatic flair, highlighting the intensity of Milkha's races.\n\nConclusion Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a powerful and moving tribute to an Indian sports legend. Farhan Akhtar's stellar performance, combined with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's visionary direction, makes this film a must-watch. It is not just a sports biopic but a story of human triumph, resilience, and the pursuit of excellence.\n\nFor anyone interested in inspiring real-life stories, the film offers a gripping and emotional experience, celebrating Milkha Singh's extraordinary life and legacy. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of an athlete who ran against all odds and emerged victorious."

He totally looks the part as a young Sikh man, and has gone the extra mile (literally) to make his physique look flawless! Farhan, can now be mentioned in the same breath as the other method actors in current India such as Aamir Khan and Hrithik Roshan.\n\nHis brief chemistry with Sonam Kapoor was simple yet beautiful and it's good that the director didn't drag the romantic side of the story on, but concentrated on Milkha's more important phases of his life.\n\nOther notable performances are Pawan Malhotra (Milkha's coach) and Divya Dutta (Milkha's sister) - both are flawless in their own performances and give fantastic support to Farhan throughout the film.\n\nI would say that Farhan should win the Best Male actor award, but I saw Krrish3 before this, so I think Farhan should win the Critics awards for it instead.\n\nOv"

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an award-winning film. It shows us the life of Milkha Singh through his very own eyes and deserves a standing ovation for its performances, writing and direction.\n\nTalking about Farhan Akhtar, he is one of the most superb actors of Indian Cinema. No one could ever play this role of young, energetic, ambitious Milkha Singh the way Farhan did. Claps for him. The songs of the movie were so catchy that despite of three long hours no one would want to leave their seats and miss a scene.\n\nTruly Inspiring."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is an undeniable truth that every life is an unfolding story with a fair share of twists and turns, highs and lows, delights & disappointments. Yet, not every life becomes a story that is told & more importantly listened to & passed on, for most are mired in the miasma of banality of daily living. It is in this key denominator, that the life stories of heroes and superheroes differ significantly.For these are the people who have confronted their crippling challenges and have managed to overcome them. In doing so, they remain a beacon of hope and inspiration to the millions of others who are confronted with challenges of their own.\n\nIn Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, noted filmmaker Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra (Aks, Rang De Basanti & Delhi - 6) brings to the silver screen, the life of independent India's earliest sporting hero, Milkha Singh aka the Flying Sikh.\n\nBio-pics are an uncommon genre among typical Bollywood fare, more so, when they involve sporting heroes. Bio-pics aren't easy to make either. It is one thing to identify the story to be told and quite another to bring a real life story to screen. Added to this, is the herculean challenge of presenting it in an entertaining package which would draw in the audience and keep them engrossed in these times of fleeting attention spans.\n\nPerhaps, it was only fitting that the story of one of India's greatest sporting talents was to be helmed by a maker of the calibre of Mehra, who had earlier successfully brought to screen, the life of Bhagath Singh & his comrades, in a very contemporary take that had struck a chord among viewers across the country in his RDB.\n\nMilkha Singh is that rare Indian sporting legend who rose to fame despite not being associated with cricket - the great opiate of the teeming masses of this least sporting of populace. Now, when Bollywood - the other & perhaps, greater opiate of the teeming masses - chronicles his lifestory, it is, in a way, a form of poetic justice.\n\nFor a nation of a billion plus individuals, it remains a travesty that we rarely ever produce athletes who shine in individual events internationally. Milkha Singh was one such rare talent who proved his mettle in the international arena and rose to great heights in an era when media coverage merely meant an occasional live relay over All India Radio or BBC and sports column of various dailies unlike these days of 24*7 media and instant stardom. It is, but a sad truth that, if not for this movie, his name would've remained unfamiliar with most citizenry of this nation.\n\nBorn in pre-independent India, in what is now Pakisthan, Milkha Singh is forced to witness the slaughter of almost his entire family in a carnage that followed the Partition and is forced to escape to Delhi as a refugee. He is deeply scarred and suffers the pain from these wounds which fester long after he becomes an international athlete of repute. He is supported by his doting elder sister and her abusive husband. After an initial fling as a petty thief to scrounge for a living, he enlists in the army where he is identified as a born athlete by his first coach who trains him and nurtures his ambition of representing India. The rest of the story narrates the several challenges, faced by him, enroute to acheiving sporting glory and how he overcomes them by his sheer hardwork and determination.\n\nFarhan Akthar plays Milkha Singh with a rare dedication seen on Indian screen and appears to have undertaken this assignment with all the seriousness of a saintly penance seeking salvation. He is utterly convincing in every frame and brings in an effortless charm to the part. His well toned muscular physique and the manner in which he sprints like a man possessed, speak volumes on the meticulousness of his preparation for the part which one normally associates with a Daniel Day Lewis or to some extent, with Kamal Hassan. I sincerely hope such hard work receives all the credit/laurels/awards, it so richly deserves.\n\nThere is also an able supporting cast in the form of ever-dependable Divya Dutta, Pawan Malhotra and Prakash Raj. It is a sad travesty of our Indian cinema that such rich talents like Divya Dutta and Pawan Malhotra get a meaty role so rarely that one feels that such occasions need to be celebrated like some festival. The three leading ladies, if you can call them that, Sonam Kapoor, Rebecca Breeds and Meesha Shafi do not have much to do except adorn the screen for a few fleeting moments. Dalip Tahil plays, nay, hams the part of Nehru with a clunky accent.\n\nThe music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is pretty good, especially the energetic 'Zinda' and the romantic 'Mere Yaar'. Yet, being an ardent Rahman fan, I wonder why Mehra had to settle for someone other than Rahman for this film, especially given the fact that Rahman has given some of his best albums for Mehra's earlier movies (RDB & Delhi-6) which added a nuanced dimension to them and lifted them to another level.\n\nDespite being earnest to a good measure, the film suffers in moments when it tries too hard to manipulate as in the sequence where a badly injured Milkha runs in a race with heavily bandaged barefeet with the bandages coming undone before the finish line. I felt such scenes belonged more in a eighties tear-jerker. The film could also have benifitted from some crisper editing which could've whittled the length by a good 15-20 minutes.\n\nOverall, despite its flaws, this movie remains a good attempt and worth watching, principally for the outstanding performance by Farhan Akthar who has poured his heart and soul into his part, in bringing to life the inspiring story of one of India's greatest sporting legends - an unsung hero."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is a great creation on Sardar Milkha Singh's real life. The backgrounds of 1950-60s were shown very well. As well Singh's life as being the best athlete of that time can be seen along with the emotional part of his life.. The problems he has faced during the time of partition of the country were too emotional. But how he achieved the success by converting into an athlete from an Indian Sepoy gives a change to his story which never stopped throughout his life.. He made a lot of records and gives pride to our country which is speechless. HatsOff to Sardar Milkha Singh & this movie which is fully dedicated to him."

Direction is perfect, and similar to Rang De Basanti, Rakeysh uses a non-linear narrative to unfold the story beautifully written by Prasoon Joshi. However, though the film starts off great and the first half is perfect, the film loses steam in the second half and feels like a drag thanks to slow screenplay.\n\nIgnoring its flaws, the film is still excellent. Farhan comes up with an unforgettable performance. Go learn more about the flying Sikh now!!\n\ncting: 9.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 7.5/10 Technical Aspects: 8.5/10\n\nVerdict: 8/10\n\nFor a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)"
