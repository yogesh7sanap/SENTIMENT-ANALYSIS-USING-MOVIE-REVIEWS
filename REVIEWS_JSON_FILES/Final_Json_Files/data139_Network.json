        "review_title": "\"The World Is A Business, Mr. Beale\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "In 1976 when this film came out, there was no cable television, no internet, no cell phones. All that existed, apart from newspapers and radio, were three or four \"broadcast\" television channels. Since then, technology has exploded with a cornucopia of communication devices. Which renders the story in \"Network\" painfully dated. And yet ...\n\nThe story's theme is as valid now as it was thirty-three years ago. The theme is that the ratings business has corrupted television, because ad revenue, and therefore profit, is tied to the ratings. Programs and events then, and now, get aired if, and only if, they are likely to result in high ratings. It's all very seamy, very dishonorable, very shabby, and very relevant to today's world of ten thousand channels.\n\nThough most of the characters in \"Network\" end up being corrupted by television, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is one who does not. His vision is pure. And he speaks the truth: \"... television is an ... amusement park ... a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of ... story tellers ... jugglers, sideshow freaks ... and football players ... You're never going to get any truth from us (television) ... We lie like hell ... We deal in illusions, none of it is true. But you people ... believe the illusions ... You do whatever the tube tells you ... you even think like the tube\". Worse yet, people elect their leaders based on how they look and sound, and how their words are interpreted by boob tube \"pundits\".\n\n\"Network\" is a film wherein thematic import is conveyed almost entirely through dialogue. Some of the dialogue devolves into speechifying, which may come across to viewers as preachy. Still, the film's message was highly prophetic. Except for the film's climax, everything predicted in this film has already happened. And credit should go to script writer Paddy Chayefsky for his futuristic vision.\n\nSome parts of the film seem superfluous in retrospect, like the romance between two main characters. But the film has a sense of realism, helped along by the use of technical jargon and a general absence of background music. The film's technical elements, including direction, casting, acting, editing, and cinematography, are fine.\n\nAs social commentary, \"Network\" is one of the best films ever made, despite a dated, time-bound, story. That \"there are no nations, only currency\" is becoming increasingly obvious, and as Ned Beatty's arrogant character explains in a frighteningly ominous tone: \"The world is a business, Mr. Beale\"."

It blew me away years ago, but I find it even more stunning now. Not just because of the writing, Sidney Lumet's taut direction or the Oscar-caliber performances by everyone involved, all of which are almost beyond being lauded with superlatives.\n\nBut what knocks me out is how Chayefsky seemed less to be writing from the power of his imagination, than channeling Our Times Now. As if he was capable of some form of mental time travel; able to look into the Nineties and beyond to see the coming of SURVIVOR, or Maury Povich, Jerry Springer, Bill O'Reilly and Paris Hilton. Even HE probably didn't know how he knew, but he sure as hell felt it and wrote it down for us to marvel over today.\n\nSure, there are political and cultural analogies throughout the picture that are dated. But the core of his vision remains startlingly clear and eerily prophetic. As for Howard Beale, there is not one single \"celebrity\" who mirrors that character today, but maybe he is a composite of several different personalities with whom we have become all too familiar in the world of \"news-fo-tainment.\" Or maybe he simply hasn't materialized yet. Maybe that is just how far ahead of its time NETWORK really was.\n\nAfter all, being \"mad as hell\" nowadays has so many more layers of meaning than it did nearly thirty years ago..."

        "review_detailed_main": "To think that this blackest of black comedies was made in 1976 could only means two things: 1) Nothing has changed or 2) Paddy Chayefsky was seeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. I endorse the later of the two because I believe things have changed since 1974 - I wasn't born yet, but I know because of my parents, the movies, literature, etc, etc, etc. Peter Finch as the mad prophet of the airwaves gives Chayefsky a riveting and powerful voice. The scenes between old chums Finch and William Holden are some of the best written scenes in any American movie until the Coen brothers emerged. Finch is superb, superb! and Holden, at the end of a legendary career, gives a performance of such ferocious sincerity that I rediscovered the man, the actor and felt the need to revisit some of his opus. From Golden Boy to Sunset Boulevard, Holden was a man who carried his own discomfort as a weapon. Extraordinary! However, the most alarming character in the whole thing is Faye Dunaway's. She is magnificent in her thin, nervous, bra-less attitude. She is a monster of commercial amorality. Everything in this incredible movie moves with the precision of an inspired clairvoyant's vision. Duvall's executive, Beatrice Straight's betrayed wife and Ned Beatty's god like big shot makes this one of the most frightening, entertaining, funniest, remarkable film from the 70's. Sidney Lumet proves once more that he's as good as his material. Here he is at his zenith."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Network\" is a fantastic movie that illustrates just how the \"mob\" and the media can exploit even the best intentions for mutual profit.\n\nHoward Beale (Peter Finch) is an on-air personality that, after finding he is not bankable anymore, snaps and starts to speak his own uncensored, and highly inflammable commentary about the hypocrisy of modern life.\n\nIn his mad-hatter routine, somehow he sparks his audience's interest, and in a twist of fame finds himself, the not bankable as prime market share for prime time television. And naturally, his bosses and those who stand to profit from his actions, use his fame to better their own cause.\n\nBeale's rise to stardom is only one facet of this intricate story about how the mob influences media. Throughout \"Network\" we as the audience are constantly shown, to nausea, how ruthless popularity and trend mold what we see as consumers of entertainment. Most of the main characters are in fact trapped in their roles - and powerless to the bottom line, which is that media relies on advertisement and ratings to generate revenue.\n\nIn fact, I believe that is what the point of \"Network\" is - this movie shows us, that \"news\" is entertainment, and how we as viewers (whichever demographic you are) are willing to suspend all common sense, class, independence, honor, integrity for a few moments of triumph or more pragmatically, how we relish tragedy.\n\n\"Network\" is too heavy for most people - it is meant for people who do not like TV, who think that product placement is ridiculous, and in general do not like to think of themselves as a \"market\". If you need your reality spoon fed to you, this movie is not for you.\n\nHowever, if you have had enough, and wish to feel for a moment like you are an empowered free thinker, i would humbly suggest that this movie is for you."

It's obedience and entertainment by those who rebel, no matter how insane they are. The exploitation of those in peril for any kind of economic profit. And the fact that everything Beale preaches is completely true and completely bashes the people who are producing him. I was amazed by how much he sells out while continuing to rant about how terrible the people he works for are, and the fact that they just keep him on the air because they want ratings.\n\nIt couldn't be more related to today. Turn on the news and you see videos of how horrific the war on terror is and how horrific American society has become, but it stays on the air because people don't want to see the good things in life. They care about the bad and the corrupt. People must have laughed it off back then, but it was such a foreshadow to the near future. The performances are just as brilliant as the social commentary. Each actor becomes so absorbed into their characters that you can't even tell they're acting. It feels like you're watching these people in their daily lives, interacting and becoming more and more corrupt. Finch and Dunaway easily give two of the greatest performances of all time. I could write 20 more pages about it's brilliance, but I'll stop now to keep me from rating. I just have to say that it's so rare to find a film as incredibly flawless as this."

        "review_title": "Doesn't fully fulfill its promising premise",
        "review_detailed_main": "An interesting, ambitious, and somewhat entertaining satire of television, but one that pretty much fails for a number of reasons. It's difficult to believe almost everything that happens in it. Not one of the characters rings true. William Holden is as boring in 1976 as he was in 1955, and his clich\u00e9 relationship with Faye Dunnaway is not at all believable, and not even that interesting. Their scenes together go on forever, and Holden's character carries the trite and obvious metaphor of Dunnaway as television personified, and their relationship as soap opera far further than necessary. Dunnaway herself puts an amazing amount of energy into her performance, and she didn't not deserve the Oscar she won, if you'll excuse my double negative. But her character really is only the metaphor that Holden attributes her, so what ground can she win with that? Beatrice Straight gives a performance that's most famous for being the shortest that ever won an Oscar, only three minutes. I didn't know who Beatrice Straight was, but it's obvious when she starts giving her big speech, so showy that she induced me to roll my eyes as many times as inches tall her Oscar is; that must be a record, too. Robert Duvall fares the best among the major cast members, although he hasn't much of a character either.\n\nPeter Finch's performance is interesting, but his ranting gets old quick. While Howard Beale's first couple of ravings would undoubtedly raise people's interest (the `I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore' scene is as great as it is famous), but I doubt the television show that is developed for him, which apparently airs five days a week and runs for many months before the film ends, would ever attract an audience of any kind, except maybe a small bit who have a taste for public access television, which is what it seems like. I think people, especially the kind of disenfranchised, cynical people to whom Beale's show is supposed to appeal, would be much more critical and suspicious of a man who does his show opposite a psychic and in front of stained glass window.\n\nPeople always refer to Network as `prophetic,' and then claim their proof is stuff like Jerry Springer, Hard Copy and reality television. As much as some of us may hate those kinds of television shows, only the deranged or stupid would ever believe that When Animals Attack is harmful to anybody other than those who are being attacked by animals. Does anybody really believe that anyone would ever air programs like The Ecumenical Liberation League or whatever that was? Some of the scenes focusing on this new show which the network is developing seem to want to be comedy, although the film is too heavy-seeming to ever succeed in being comic. Anyhow, in the world of reality, in which Holden's character keeps trying to convince Dunnaway and the film's audience that the story is really happening, the network's lawyers would have stopped them immediately. I will say that the film is prescient in only one way: Ned Beatty, who appears for one scene, has the most intriguing part, where he says, among other things:\n\n\"It is the international system of currency which determines the vitality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things today! And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature! And you will atone! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today.\"\n\nIt comes out of right field in the film - well, kind of. The almighty dollar is the driving force of the film, and, the film realizes correctly, the world. But what Network does not understand is how television works to propagate this system, or perhaps how it would. It's too busy finding its subject, television, overtly evil when it misses the ways it can be more subtly evil. Not that I think all TV is evil or anything. Personally, I watch a lot of television and enjoy it immensely. I don't think it is particularly wicked, and I actually think that there's a lot of great art to be found on television (yes I do!). However, most of the evil I do see comes from the news. I wasn't around in 1976, so I can't say whether or not the news was as suspicious and creepy back then, but, if Network really had been prophetic, it would have at least got some of the satire right. 7/10."

I loved this movie before I understood it, and I worship it now. Like \"Elmer Gantry\" or \"1984,\" it's a work of didactic art that only fails on an imaginative level -- Sinclair Lewis couldn't grasp how debased evangelism would become, Orwell couldn't foresee the excesses of Mao or Pol Pot, and Chayevsky couldn't envision the absolute decline of television from a vast wasteland to a malevolent sewer. Fox News, reality TV, even the OJ chase, \"Network\" anticipates every vile bit of it.\n\nNow, it's ridiculously overwritten -- NO ONE is as articulate as the characters in this film, and most certainly, no one who works in television is as literate as Diana Christensen (the Faye Dunaway character). I doubt that poet laureates or even Eminem could spew as witty an aside as \"muttering mutilated Marxism.\" But damn if that isn't part of its charm. Plus, outside of Max Schumacher (William Holden), the characters are pretty much archetypes instead of real people (the Robert Duvall character might as well wear a black cape and top hat), but their two-dimensionality works as a good metaphor for Max's seduction into the \"shrieking nothingness\" or television. Plus the actors are so superb they make screeching caricatures into almost-sympathetic characters: Duvall is a credible and charismatic villain, Finch is a fine mad prophet and Faye Dunaway manages to make a shrill, manipulative, soulless neurotic so damn cute and sexy you'll want to leave your wife for her, too, just as long as she promises to keep sitting cross-legged on your desk and hitching up her skirt. (Therein lies the real eroticism, forget the intentionally mechanical, unerotic coupling later in the flick). Anyway, this is complex, high art masquerading as popular entertainment, go rent it now."

The end of this film shows that nothing is above prime ratings, even murder. It was almost normalised. Great performances from a strong cast. The content and messaging is top notch. The only thing is the artistic flair with which the film is made. Despite Sidney Lumet being a great director if you had Marty Scorsese at the helm he would have taken it to even greater heights."

Finch is the truly crazed one and got the Oscar for carrying off the tricky role, whilst Holden is his equal as the seasoned news vet. Dunaway does hold her scenes well, albeit there is a fair degree of scenery chewing and there are fine, but brief and scene stealing supporting performances from Beatrice Straight and Ned Beatty. I wasn't wholly convinced by the Holden / Dunaway romance here and it does in the end move too fast and rather untidily, upping the stakes too much as it heads towards the finish line.

        "review_detailed_main": "One thing you got in 70s cinema, as the 60s generation began to grow up and relaxations on content stopped being threatening and started being normal, was that the message movie went mainstream. Understandably, the eloquence of the message was always going to be more important than its real importance.\n\nNetwork was scripted by Paddy Chayefsky, who was less the angry young man of the anti-Vietnam generation, and more the grumpy middle-aged man of any and every generation. Appropriately enough the picture is a cynical and grouchy rant. It is preachy, hysterically so in places, and yet it is so pessimistic, offering no solutions to the problems it builds up to ridiculous proportions, that watching it is a rather draining experience. Its message is not as clever as it thinks it is, conflating a new technology with ongoing social problems, as short-sighted cynics have done for centuries. There is even a none-too-subtle dig at women who take on masculine roles, which just goes to show how bitter and reactionary Network is. And the idea of someone so obsessed with an idea it causes them orgasm prematurely is simple a sad mix of bad psychology and playground puerility.\n\nAnd yet, the 70s were also a time in which Hollywood was starting to regain some semblance of professionalism, after the unevenness of the previous decade. Network seems to have been made by a highly consistent production team. Sets and costumes are designed to perpetuate a pattern of regular black and white shapes arranged in rows. Not just ceiling lights or skyscraper windows, but filing cabinets, radiators all conform to this same style. Director Sidney Lumet, with his usual mode of subtle stylisation, even keeps it up in the few outdoor daytime, with the even framing of the tree-lined boulevard in the scene after Ruddy's funeral. Lumet also often has opposing shots of two actors with one in bright white and the other in black, so the switching back-and-forth between them is like a light flicking on and off.\n\nThe 70s was also a time in which acting really started to successfully reconcile dramatic realism with theatrical exuberance, and here we have some great examples of both. William Holden, looking decidedly weary and craggy, seems to have entered the age which suits his style best, and he brings a layer of genuine humanity which Network sorely needs. Beatrice Straight gives a small yet impassioned performance as his wife, and though barely five minutes long her performance is among the more memorable. Another excellent bit performance is that of Ned Beatty, whose glorious hamming is the complete opposite of Straight's straightness, but nevertheless provides one of the most entertaining scenes of the whole picture. Of course any more than a few minutes of screen time and these two performances would unbalance the entire thing. Which brings us onto Peter Finch, who again is pure ham, but of the classic Charles Laughton variety, putting every ounce of strength he has into a compelling act. Had it not been Lumet's policy to ensure the real-world cinema screen never becomes the same as the film-world TV screen, we in the audience would be truly mesmerised by those mad prophet speeches.\n\nAnd thus Network delivers its message with great force and power. And of course the film has now gained a new raft of fans because this banal grumble about TV was supposedly \"ahead of its time\", except that TV never has been and never will be quite that way, because audiences \u2013 human beings \u2013 are not as stupid as Chayefsky thinks they are. In fact, the thing that Network probably best predicts is the wave of movies like Fight Club that didn't really say much but said it with an original twist and thus became cult hits. Which is a pity. And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to watch the new series of X-Factor, which though lowbrow at least makes good entertainment."

Peter finch stars as the TV anchor who becomes an \"angry prophet who denounces the hypocrisies of our time.\" We gradually see how he first preaches to the common everyman, but is then exploited by the slick executives to achieve their one goal: Ratings. Faye Dunaway also shines as the Vice President in charge of programming who finds herself becoming less aware of the difference between television and reality. William Holden also lends fine support.\n\nAs the acting and directing in this film are exquisite, the message it portrays is a very strong one.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I'M MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!\"\n\nOne of the most famous lines in film history is as impactful today as it was when it was first uttered by fictitious news anchor Howard Beale in Paddy Chayefsky's (seemingly) parody of where TV and TV news is heading, 1976's NETWORK.\n\nThe astonishing thing about this terrific motion picture is how prescient it is. News is now entertainment. Appeal to the disaffected masses. Drive our message to the viewers. Be provocative. The 6:00 news had \"less than 1 minute of hard news, the rest was sex, scandal, brutal crime sports, children with incurable diseases and lost puppies.\"\n\nSound familiar? This isn't from today, it came from this movie that was made 42 years ago as a cautionary tale of what might happen.\n\nBesides the social ramifications, how does this film hold up? Quite well, indeed. A rare 10 star BankofMarquis film. Starting with the great Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar winning Screenplay. This was the capper on a brilliant career from Chayefsky - who also won Oscar's for his screenplay for 1972's THE HOSPITAL (I'll have to check that one out) and 1956's MARTY.\n\nWhat does a terrific screenplay do? It attracts top-level talent clamoring to be in this - and they all deliver. Start with Faye Dunaway who won the Lead Actress Oscar for her role as Entertainment Head Diane Christensen - a driven, work hard, play hard individual who has the idea to make news \"entertainment\". Lost in the fog of time (and MOMMIE DEAREST) is the fact that in the mid-1970's, Dunaway was, perhaps, the greatest leading actress of the day and her skills are in sharp display in this film.\n\nJoining Dunaway in terrific supporting turns are Robert Duvall, following his turns as Tom Hagen in GODFATHER I and II, as network head, Frank Hackett, Ned Beatty as Ned Jennings, President of the company that owns the network - he has a speech towards the tail end of this film that is as good - both in performance and in the way that it is shot - as anything put upon the screen - it was masterful. Speaking of masterful, Beatrice Straight won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in one of the shortest performances to ever win. She is in this film for about 6 minutes in total - but she won her Oscar for a 5 minute scene that is, most definately Oscar-worthy.\n\nAnd then there are the leading men. William Holden gives one of the last great performances of his extraordinary career as the \"voice of reason in this film\". He is our everyman caught up in the bizarre, absurd circumstances that evolve around him. It is his effort to try to make sense of this insanity that jumps off the screen. Holden was, deservedly, nominated for a Best Actor in a Leading Role Oscar, but lost (rightfully so) to Peter Finch's turn as crazed newsman turned prophet, Howard Beale. His maniacal (but not over the top) turn is one for the ages. If you do nothing else, see this film for his performance (but there is so, so much more to love here). Unfortunately, Finch passed away from a heart attack in between his Oscar nomination and win, and was the first posthumous winner in an acting role (sadly, Heath Ledger would join this \"club\" years later).\n\nFinally, enough cannot be said about Sidney Lumet's direction. A movie like this would not succeed without a sure, steady and seasoned hand at the helm - and this is how I would describe Lumet's direction. He lets the camera roll and lets the actors and the screenplay take center stage, not drawing attention away, but adding to the themes of the film throughout - especially in Beatty's speech at the end.\n\nNETWORK was nominated for (but did not win) the Oscar for Best Film of 1976. Did it lose out to other nominees ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or TAXI DRIVER? Nope, it lost to ROCKY.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nIf you get a chance to watch (or rewatch) this film, I highly recommend you do so. For me, it was GREAT to watch this on the big screen with an audience, one of the reasons I love - and will continue to attend - the SECRET CINEMA series of films.\n\nLetter Grade: A+\n\n10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"

        "review_detailed_main": "#1 Best Film of 1976\n\n'Network' is Paddy Chafesky's riveting and grim tale of the sleaze surrounding the American television industry. Winner of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, 'Network' is without a doubt one of the most powerful, influential and meaningful films ever made. One of the reasons 'Network' was so well received by both film critics and movie-going audiences was because it possessed a certain quality that most films unfortunately lack -- intricate and involving characters in realistic situations. 'Network' definitely makes my list of the top 10 films of the 70s, and it's an absolute shame it didn't pick up the well-deserved 'Best Picture' Oscar at the Academy Awards ceremony in 1976.\n\nThe film follows a low-rated television network trying to keep it's head above water. The network, UBS, has decided to fire an aging veteran news anchor, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), in an act of desperation to boost ratings. Beale is given a two-week notice, and instead of going out with his tale between his legs, Beale announces on live television he was fired and is going to kill himself. This raises panic and chaos at UBS, until they get the memo that Beale's crazed rant just bumped the ratings significantly. The UBS execs, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) decide to give Beale his own show where he complains and screams bout the problems with the world, while Beale's best friend (William Holden) feels it's inappropriate for the network to take advantage of a mentally-ill man. Besides exploiting a mentally unstable man, the company execs also work out a weekly program with a anti-establishment African-American communist, Laureen Hobbs (Marlene Warfield) following political terrorists and their violent outbursts.The film also stars Beatrice Straight as Schumacher's boring wife, Conchetta Ferrell was an assistant working for the network and Ned Beatty who plays the sinister boss of the UBS television network who always gets what he wants.\n\n'Network' boasts one of the finest and most intricate screenplays ever written that rightfully earned Paddy Chafesky the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Sidney Lumet's directing is absolutely incendiary and the movie has an incredibly strong cast. Faye Dunaway gives what is perhaps her very best screen performance as the cutthroat Network executive, while Robert Duvall is just as brilliant as the ruthless Frank Hackett (which should have earned him an Oscar nomination, period!) Beatrice Straight is solid in her role (not quite Oscar-worthy if you ask me, though) and Marlene Warfield is just as great as the sassy pinko sistah (excuse me for that phrasing). The two performers who really steal the show however are William Holden and Peter Finch. Both nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the Academy Awards in 1977, Peter Finch gives a startling and powerful performance as the 'mad-as-hell' (not to mention crazy-as-hell) Howard Beale, while William Holden gives a subtle but none-the-less outstanding performance as the conflicted Max Schumacher. It's hard to say who was better, but if I absolutely had to decide I'd choose Holden's non-Oscar-winning performance slightly over Finch's sympathy Oscar-winning performance (he still was extraordinary,m though). I honestly believe if Finch hadn't died just after the film, Holden would have taken home the Oscar gold for Best Leading Actor, both were still magnificent though. The only player in the cast that I felt wasn't that great was Ned Beatty. In a role far-deserving from an Oscar nomination (which he for some odd reason received), Beatty plays the angry little man role he always does. Besides Beatty's performance and marginal pacing problems towards the middle (you are gonna get that in any 70s film that isn't a Kubrick film), the movie is utterly perfect.\n\nI can't recommend you seeing 'Network' highly enough. If you want a carefully made motion picture that makes you think and reflect on how cutthroat our society has become (especially TV broadcasting), 'Network' is a absolute must. What are you waiting for, go out and rent 'Network'! It might just alter your perspective on things. Grade: A-\n\nMADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #46"

Is it the film's 1976 period of 4 television networks in the US (even less so in the UK!) or my own perception of modern mainstream media as streaming, multi-channel, cable TV, YouTube, the internet?\n\nWhat I think the film gets high praise for is some of the screenplay, and cast performances, They do deliver. Also you know what the more I think of it, some attributes that this film satirises could be true in the modern media landscape? 24 hour rolling news channels, opinion channels, loudmouth TV anchors etc.\n\nI was particularly endowed by the late Peter Finch's (Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971)) performance as lead Howard Beale, the aging anchor of a failing US television network called UBS nightly news. He delivers a performance that starts of as a failing, middle aged news anchor and develops into some sort of mad 'modern' preacher of ramblings on life with a healthy audience share and a new lease of broadcasting life. Finch was rightly honoured posthumously at the Academy Awards as Best Actor.\n\nDirector Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky deliver a clever satire on mainstream media. The more I've thought about this review the more I can admire it's intentions and my rating has gone up."

        "review_detailed_main": "A scathing indictment of the TV industry and its propensily towards ambition, corruption and self-prostitution. A washed-up TV presenter, Peter Finch, is gleefully exploited by his management staff , as he suffers paranoia and at the edge of a mental breakdown turns into a celebrity when he acts with his epileptic evangelic revivalism . As the network chiefs attempt to profit from his illness, as his announce to commit suicide himself boosts the ratings to such an extent that he finds his salary doubled.\n\nBlack satire taking a savage, cruel bite at the American television , its anchormen, and the shares that rule the executives who work in it. Thought-provoking and ironical script from the prestigious Paddy Chayefsky. The individual roles are startling well drawn and the interpretation is magnificent. Peter Finch won an Academy award in his last film, he is excellent as a neurotic and ranting Television newcaster who flips his lid and he is prophesying gloom and doom and then he announces he is going to commit suicide on the air. While William Holden displays a sober acting as the faded executive in distress who falls for the younger Dunaway . As Faye Dunaway plays an ambitious executive who will stop at nothing to triumph, she gives overacting, an strident interpretation that threatens to overbalance the movie. And Holden's neglected wife is magnificently played by Beatrice Stright in a brief acting, considered to be the shortest performance to win an Oscar as support cast .Remaining secondary cast is very good such as Ned Beatty, Lance Henriksen, Wesley Addy, and special mention for Robert Duvall, and as narrator : Lee Richardson.\n\nIt contains an adequate cinematography by Owen Roizman and atmospheric musical score by Elliot Lawrence. The motion picture was magnetically directed by Sidney Lumet, providing a lavishly mounted vehicle for three great actors, Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and William Holden. Giving powerful scenes especially at the John Finch's appearances and when people come to the windows of their block of flats in a thunderstorm, and while displaying shouts .Lumet was one of the best American filmmakers, including important films such as 12 angry men, Fail safe, The pawnbroker, The hill, The deadly affair, The group, The offence, Serpico , Equus, The wiz, Prince of the city , Deathtrap , Daniel, Power, The morning after, Family business, Night falls on Manhattan, Gloria, Before the devil knows you are dead, among others.

The script is sharp, throwing out some killer lines that stick with you, like that famous \"I'm as mad as hell\" speech that totally hits hard. The acting is awesome too, especially Peter Finch, who just owns it as the crazed news anchor losing it on live TV.\n\nBut even though it's got some awesome moments, sometimes 'Network' feels like it keeps hitting the same note too hard. Some of the speeches drag on and start to feel preachy, which kind of kills the buzz of the movie's faster parts. I'd give it a 7/10 because it's still a pretty wild look at the TV world and definitely makes you think, but it could've been tighter to keep the energy up the whole way through."

An exaggerated demonstration of how people are exploited by the media? They are, but not as blatantly as this. It was supposed to be overdone, of course, but for me that didn't save it.\n\nYou can call it satire, or what you will, but it became a fantasy, not a drama. The trouble is that, if you want to make a film about exploitation, make it real. To spend two hours being hideously over the top at the top of your voice to make a simple point like that is unnecessary. It wasn't comedic either. It wasn't funny, it was just loud.\n\nOf course the acting was fine but the script dwelt too much on money, ratings, materialistic nonsense that personally was about as interesting as watching an accountant doing balance sheets, and myopically so.\n\nSo, sorry, bored to death and wishing it was over. Which, thankfully, it was eventually. Peace at last."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those wonderful films where everything comes together. The acting and the writing is by far the most impressive elements of this film. William Holden and Peter Finch should have both received Oscars for their performances, instead of just Peter Finch. Faye Dunaway pulls of the most dynamic and emotional characters she has ever played.\n\nThe true brilliance of this film is that all elements of it fade appropriately behind the actors and their messages. The film is completely a work of storytelling and, at least for the writer, stunning clarity of message and purpose. Political films come and go but few remain in the annals of film because of their effectiveness at their own message.\n\nThe cinematography, editing, sound, costume design, art direction and production design are all quite simplistic. In some scenes the film can be accused of being almost ugly. However this all lends to the back-washing of the film so as to allow the message to ring loudest. In my opinion, Sidney Lumet took this just a little too far and thus I give it a 9 instead of a 10.\n\nThis is certainly a film for the history books. Every connoisseur of film should be exposed to this movie at some point in their life. If you happen to be cynical, then you will love every minute of this movie as its stark view of life in the 1970's (and onward) touches the hard of even the hardest of cynics. For those educators out there, GREAT film for classes on Media and Politics."

Etc. At the beginning of the movie a drunken Max Schumacher (William Holden) fantasizes about a show called \"the Death Hour\" comprised of films of car crashes, suicides, train wrecks, and so forth, to be put on Sunday night in prime time. \"It'll blow Disney outta the f------g water!\" he laughs. A few years back some network put exactly such a show - \"Eye Witness Videos\" - on the air. On Sunday night. In prime time. In short, as most everyone here has commented, \"Network\"'s horrifying vision - brilliantly written by the incredibly prescient Paddy Chayevsky - has been truly and frighteningly prophetic, and rings absolutely true today. The movie is totally over the top yet penetratingly incisive.\n\nThe movie is a veritable feast of tour-de-force acting from all involved. In particular William Holden's wrenching performance as the burned-out but still sensitive Max is drop-jaw stunning. I feel he, not Finch, should have gotten the Oscar, though Finch's work is not exactly chopped liver either. And what a brilliant device on Chayevsky's part to make the lunatic Howard Beale the only one of the bunch with clarity of vision.\n\nThat the film is intended to be a satire and a comedy is clear from the narration, especially the final comment about Beale becoming the first man to be killed because of lousy ratings. But it is without doubt the blackest black comedy ever filmed.\n\nA lasting legend of the filmmaking art."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those works that is emblematic of what can be done with a director who knows his craft and chooses a style that is both controlled and not controlling, a writer who can let out some wild scenes and incredible exposition and make it practically believable (maybe more so today), and a cast that understand their creative forces at work. After seeing the film I was actually struck just as much, for example, by William Holden's performance as I was by Peter Finch, though the latter usually gets most of the credit (and rightfully so, in an Oscar-winning turn beating out De Niro in Taxi Driver if one can believe that). But then one has to take into account their different levels of skill in their performances, and how they both deliver even more than what is required. Holden, for me, is just as good here as he is in his best work (Sunset Blvd, The Wild Bunch), but in the role of the worn-out, dedicated professional who in his own way has had about as enough bs that can be taken as the main character. Yet Holden also knows his performance needs to be more reserved, and as his story gets more complicated he has to make some subtle choices as perhaps the only really sane person in the film. His work here is accomplished in the style of one sense, while Finch, who plays a character going back and forth between being totally nuts and knowing more than anyone else out there in TV land, takes his role with a heedless abandon.\n\nIn short, this is one of the more fearless looks at the media ever presented on film, and it's even more relevant today perhaps than when it was first released. It's sad that not only did Lumet and Paddy Chayevsky think that what they were doing (aside from the ending) was all true, but that as the decades have passed since Regan's to-do with changing the rules of journalism, it's gotten worse. It was actually kind of shocking to see one or two of the revelations from Finch in some scenes, and the connection made in the 3rd act with Saudi Arabia is one of my favorite parts of the film (particularly the speech by Ned Beatty in one of the all-time great one-scene roles). News, basically, now is like everything else on TV, where you get what you pay for via the advertising, but not as it should really be with the news as it is. Howard Beale, basically, is like one of those ultra-symbollic (but relatable) characters in movies, in a demented way like Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, where the truth has to be spoken by someone, but who in America will listen (or, ironically, who won't if it's shelled out right in front of the cameras).\n\nIn other words, this is one of those films that does ask a viewer to think about what is being shown- an 'informed' public (which is growing less and less as the media becomes smaller and more controlled via government and regulations)- while still providing acting that sticks and lines of dialog that are among the best in 70's films. Faye Dunaway is the female counterpart to her older male stars and is just as good, being like a very cold, typical businesswoman who only makes things feel like she does, as if something was lost in youth. Duvall is also good here, if maybe not at his very best, in a role as a TV exec. But there are bit parts that are really good too, like the black female militant member who complains at a meeting about the grosses of showing footage on TV. And in a small way, like the films of Brooks and Monty Python, Lumet understands how to film things very realistically (though the style appropriately changed from start to finish) so that the satire within can spring out. Even an over-the-top scene like Beale's first Mad-as-Hell speech works on this level.\n\nOverall, this is a really amazing film, with enoughs scathing, dark material mixed with the truth that should and isn't presented to those who rely solely on programming. \"Because you're on television, dummy\" are the last words Beatty says to Beale in their scene after Beale asks \"why me?\" By the end, as the film reaches its ultimate climax, one might wonder if his question is relatable to all TV, not just the news. Why is it what you say to people through this abstract medium important, or not? The answers, looking at how the news is run now, should be obvious. Maybe Lumet's best outside of his more 'urban' films (i.e. Serpico, The Pawnbroker, Dog Day Afternoon)."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are two kinds of \"Network\" fans in the world: the Max Schumacherites and the Howard Bealists. William Holden has never looked or sounded so impressive, and there's much to be admired in his performance as the callused, romantic Max. But I happen to be in the second camp. I love Finch as an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times, on TV, in the florid language of a 5th Avenue bodhisattva. I can't overlook Max's tendency to roll out that tired anecdote about taking a taxi to the George Washington Bridge back in the 1950s, and what a fitting way it would be to open a memoir about the Golden Days of Television -- which is the very fate he ends up consigned to. I listen to him browbeat Diana Christensen about what a creature of TV she is, and yet can't help but cringe at how easily he slides into the role of the Unfaithful Husband (and how easily he's able to talk about that irony). All this suggests to me is that Chayefsky was unable to keep the one character he most identifies with from running away from him. Beale straddles the past and the future of television: an \"old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples\" yet who also recognizes that the medium has not begun to know its limits -- and sets out blindly to find them. (They turn out to lie somewhere between corporate America and the FCC.) As a self-referential visionary, he anticipates some of the more rabid talk-show hosts of our own time, a kind of left-wing Bill O'Reilly. Well, now that I think about it, that's not much of an accomplishment, though it's fun to watch. The tragedy of \"Network,\" I guess, is that it's Diana Christensen who's ahead of them all: she's the real Sybil the Soothsayer, and when she sees the future of television, she sees Reality TV; yet as conceived by Chayefsky, she's brilliant, beautiful, and cold as a frozen dinner."

I still stand by my thoughts that Network has one of the best screenplays ever, scathing yet daring and sophisticated and intelligent. And it is flawlessly delivered by William Holden, Peter Finch, Robert Duvall and Faye Dunnaway who in turn give wonderful performances and a stellar support cast.\n\nAll in all, it is a superb film, and I'd say it is one of the best of the 70s. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

We have right and left slinging mud. We have reality shows that make the news, full of disgusting interactions among people. The Jerry Springer influence is all over the place. We even have shows to create our next entertainers. Don't be surprised if in the near future we televise executions. \"Network\" saw the handwriting on the wall and simply put it out there. Like Capra's \"Meet John Doe,\" this is the blood lust of the populace laid bare. It's a reflection of a nation that is so full of itself that it has become bored with the mundane and the pleasurable. This movie capitalizes on those feelings. Now we find out that huge corporations are buying up newspapers and television stations and have the blessing of the power structure in Washington. Can you say \"1984.\" I used to think that this was conspiracy theory. Let's hope that what Faye Dunnaway is planning in this film doesn't come totally true because when news is manipulated, we lose our last bit of control of the decision makers."

Although he offers some keen observations, Chayefsky spends too much time having his characters pontificating pretentiously. It just becomes tiresome after a while, and the plot just becomes too silly, even for a satire. What's more, the relationship between Holden and Dunaway is never believable."

        "review_detailed_main": "This satirical masterpiece is considered, by experts, to be one of the greatest movies ever made. This website ranks it 197 out of the top 250 movies ever created. AFI (American Film Institure) ranks \"Network\" one of the top 100 American films (#66) to ever be produced. The phrase \"I'm as mad as Hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore\" is ranked the 19th most famous quote ever, in the history of the cinema by AFI. Last, but certainly not least, the script for \"Network\" is rated as the eighth best script ever written, according to discerning critics of the Writer's Guild of America East. This last accolade is one for which I wholeheartedly concur with. Originally, the film \"Network\", was inspired by an incident which involved a possible corporate takeover of the ABC News Division back in 1970. The entire matter of a corporate takeover of a network news division initiated an outburst of creative genius from Paddy Chaefsky (The writer of \"Network\") to address the dubious repercussions of such a corporate megalomaniac's scenario. Should a corporation take over a major network's news division, the ultimate goal of huge profits would compromise the journalistic integrity of the news, as well as the news' tenacious objective for hard bitten accuracy! The film \"Network\" became a cult sensation which fascinated the movie audience. The traumas of terrorism and apocalyptic catastrophe are reduced to numbers on a conceptualization analysis chart which crossed the table of a Madison Avenue boardroom! Their degree of doom and despair is measured in terms of marketability potential! Tummultuous radicalism became relegated to the mundane process of contractual consent decree. Basically, Howard Beale was a deteriorating news anchorman for UBS whose neurotic compulsions escalated into a Nielson ratings bonanza. Within the realm of exaggeration, all occurrences in this movie were acrimoniously plausible! The unprecedented talent in \"Network\" is unbelievable. Sidney Lumet, was a director who was driven by the uncompromising efforts of New York Theatre. Peter Finch, and Faye Dunaway, were performers who had an enormous amount of theatrical experience, this was advantageous to the support of their roles in \"Network\". Other performers in this film, William Holden, and Robert Duvall, were actors who were known for their straight shooter intensity, and, their ability to cogently focus! \"Network\" was a film which depicted a bevy of left wing coups and wanted criminals to be an auspiciously cunning carnival show for caricatured reprobates. Each character in the movie had their own brand of emotions; William Holden (Max Schumaker) was always afflicted with one sordid conundrum after another,this always left him ethically challenged. His wife, (Beatrice Straight- Who won an Academy Award for best supporting actress with her character)played the part of the proverbially injured party.Peter Finch,(Howard Beale) who won the Oscar (posthumously) for best actor with this role, became an overnight pop culture icon who was perpetually agitated. Howard Beale belonged in one of three places, Bellvue, Believe it or Not, or, the third one, which wound up being his choice; Prime Time Television. Robert Duvall (Frank Hackett) was the corporate yes man who thought everything could conform to a Fortune 500 pie chart. Ned Beaty, (Arthur Jensen) was the dictatorial disciple who explained to all parties involved that euphemistic phraseology and showbiz buzz words were simplistic subterfuges which corporations used to accommodate their precarious quest for the almighty dollar. Finally, Faye Dunaway, (Diana Christensen) was the television induced purveyor for ratings popularity.. For her, corporate callousness was a by product of lucrative business decisions. Faye Dunaway's performance as Diana Christensen was perhaps the single greatest performance that I have ever seen in any movie whatsoever. A performance like this, has the potential to spoil the writers of a movie script! Such esoteric dialog that \"Network\" possessed, straddles the fence of liability which can be made or broken on a performer's delivery. Such a stellar delivery of the lines in this movie, by Faye Dunaway, could very well be perceived as a windfall of reassurance to the writers, directors and produces of this film. Suffice it to say, Faye Dunaway won for best actress in 1976 with her role in \"Network\". The single greatest attribute which an actor or actress can garner with a part, is the quality of having a totally comprehensive control of the part in which they are playing.(Prime examples of actors with this quality are Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey) Faye Dunaway's performance in \"Network\" indeed, epitomizes such a remarkable feat! The ability to detach yourself from the mechanical persona which you have assumed in a movie, cultivates a zenith in professionalism, with it, emanates an idealistic state of mind! This performer's dichotomous isolation establishes a necessary bluntness for their character, thus making it easier for that character to be effectively entertaining! Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Diana Christensen was one whereby the utterly heartfelt responses of a human being were very derivative for her, realizing that, she confined herself to her work. The fact that she was impervious to compassion, devoid of vulnerability, and \"insensitive to joy\", was what made Diana Christensen's stilted demeanor vicariously devastating to any decent individual with whom she encountered! Director, Sidney Lumet, was vehement about requiring that the character of Diana Christensen remain academically ruthless all throughout the entire film. His purpose for doing this was to see to it that she would purport an essential mass media concept which made this movie extremely powerful. This omnipotent concept advocated a sub humanoid philosophy that unfortunately establishes rudimentary ground rules for the disconcerting and virulent world of television. This film was spectacular! Why \"Network\" lost out for best picture to \"Rocky\" is very inconceivable to me! Paddy Chaefsky and Sidney Lumet were brilliant! All of the actors and actresses were magnificent!! The fact that it did not win for best picture in 1976, leaves me with only one thing to say: \"I'm as mad as Hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!!\""

Executive Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) has the news division on the chopping block. Schumacher allows Beale to go on one more time to say goodbye, but he goes on a tirade which cause the ratings to spike. Beale catches the eye of Diana Christensen and she convinces Hackett to keep him on the air. Diana starts to have an affair with Schumacher.\n\nIt's a funny satire at the time. It's more of a funny but sad reality of TV nowadays. What is over the top satire from the mind of writer Paddy Chayefsky is now too close to the truth. The fact that it's so real diminishes the comedy. It's a little sad that the stupidity has become common place. Director Sidney Lumet does this comedy straight and allows the material to shine on its own. I also find the second half too convoluted and too unreal. All the Howard Beale Show stuff is too weird with a very uncomfortable ending. I just can't see why people would watch his show. And ending the movie that way is really unfunny."

Instead, Mr. Finch goes on another tirade. Of course, the ratings skyrocket, and Finch becomes a TV demagogue. Next, his popular news show is given to entertainment division executive Faye Dunaway (as Diana Christensen), who uses it to build a sensationalistic and successful schedule for the \"Network\". With uncanny direction from Sidney Lumet, \"Network\" is a bottomless pit of great performances, with Holden and Finch demonstrating the best use of vulgar language in at least a decade.\n\nWriter Paddy Chayefsky's award-winning warning was taken for satire in 1976, and is now considered a blueprint for success. Everything in this film was happening then, and continues on a larger scale. Mr. Chayefsky was a television original, and had a front row seat when he witnessed television's \"vast wasteland\" grow to unmanageable proportions. Perversely, the real networks responded to this film by turning their news coverage over to entertainment divisions (one rather blatantly, and famously). The end of the Fairness Doctrine helped insure a future of garbage, with no end in sight. Presently, we have 24-hour news channels delivering less information than was once available in less than 30 minutes. \"BREAKING NEWS!\" headlines everything from a politician's assassination to a supermodel's hangnail.

        "review_detailed_main": "Much as Stanley Kubrick took a satirical aim at America's Cold War paranoia in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, so too do Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky take a satirical aim at television in NETWORK, still one of the most pointed films ever made. The film centers around UBS, a fourth-place TV network without a single show in the Nielsen Top 20. Then their long-time TV newsman Howard Beale (Peter Finch), having been canned due to poor ratings, announces on the air that he is going to kill himself! But that's not the end of it. The following night, he comes back on and apologizes, saying that he \"just run out of bulls***!\". The ratings soar right through the roof, inspiring the two top people at UBS (Robert Duvall, Faye Dunaway) to give Finch his own show--a deal that is sealed when Finch urges his audience to open their windows and yell, \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!\"\n\nBack in 1976, of course, NETWORK was so outrageous that everyone in television dismissed it as a joke. But look around you now, and you'll see that its visions of tabloid journalism and guerilla warfare TV shows are perilously close to coming true today. And what else is Finch's Howard Beale character but a model for, respectively, Rush Limbaugh (on the Right) and Howard Stern (on the Left), and even Jerry Springer (in the Toilet!)?\n\nFinch and Dunaway won Oscars for their lead roles, and Beatrice Straight won a Supporting Actress Oscar for her brief role as the wife of UBS' former, conscience-stricken news department chief (William Holden). Holden's performance is also incredible and explosive; who would have thought that the \"Golden Boy\" would ever say, on film, \"Tell Mr. Hackett (Duvall) to go f**k himself!\"?\n\nNETWORK, to sum it all up, is still brilliant and now more timely than ever before. Lumet and Chayefsky (whose script won an Original Screenplay Oscar) concocted not merely a satire, but a scathingly realistic nightmare as well."

Just think of all the reality TV, advertising, exploitative news cycles, and so on - hardly an insightful observation nowadays. I will give this movie credit for tackling this in 1976 but other than that, there's not much to recommend.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Network\" is hard to describe.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Sidney Lumet's acidic tirade about American news networks caused a sensation back when it was released. The famous refrain that becomes the mantra of Peter Finch's character, a news anchor who has lost his stomach for the kind of crap he's asked to spew out night after night and decides to do something about it, is \"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!\" This could have been the refrain for America at large in 1976, after assassinations, a failed military conflict and political scandals had pretty much decimated any faith Americans still had in their nation. The fact that that same phrase could be a refrain for America today shows how ahead of its time and relevant this movie was and is. The story seemed outrageous then. Finch's character decides that he's going to kill himself on network television, and the network chief, played by Faye Dunaway in a blistering ball-buster performance, rather than react in horror, sees only the potential for sky-high ratings and a boost to her career. Sadly, in this age of reality television and sensationalistic journalism, the premise no longer seems very outrageous.\n\nSo as a satire I think \"Network\" holds up expertly, but as a movie, I think it shows its age. Paddy Chayefsky, who wrote the screenplay, stages the film's action as a series of monologues and speeches, and the overall result can be a bit tedious, like a film version of an essay. The writing feels like it might work better on stage than on screen. But Sidney Lumet, who was coming off a high with \"Dog Day Afternoon\" the year before, happens to be a director who's always had a knack for giving stagey material a cinematic quality, so he's perfectly matched with Chayefsky. And there are no quibbles with the acting. Finch and Dunaway are fierce and get the showiest moments, but Robert Duvall and William Holden, in quieter roles, do outstanding work as well. Ned Beatty and Beatrice Straight give two of the smallest Oscar-nominated performances ever. Both each have essentially one scene, but both do quite memorable things with them, and Beatty's in particular is one of the most grotesquely fascinating cameos ever captured on film.\n\nAn essential film from the 1970s whose impact is blunted now only because the film was so prophetic. How many movies can you say that about?\n\nGrade: A"

The filmmakers objectives was a completion critic and satire of television world and television stuff people, as well as the usual citizens, who blindly believes to television illusion world.\n\nGreat cinematography job, brilliant dialogs but... no highest point. The film ends very quickly, but end, even if we consider to the film as critical of TV, has no culmination in main way. I mean, the themes which movie raise up tells us, that filmmakers had in mind much more, than they said.\n\nNow about the screenplay limitation. Movie said that as first reduction Howard failed. So why nobody get the simple thing, that Howard was stressed while he delivering his speech, and they needed to save this psychological condition of him. Strange that why Howard was so lame, and has been influence, and he starting propaganda of business world, which he against, actually. I mean all that type of people like Howard, feels and knows the lie, and feels alien attempts to their space, and protest they to them.\n\nAnd why almost since first second of movie we see probability of \"Something more\", but didn't get it.\n\nProbably the filmmakers set themselves objective as only critical and satire of TV world, and nothing more, and all that political and business system critic it's just an accident due to fact of high masterpiece of movie. So, the objective of critical and satire TV is fully completed, and due to only this objective - this movie is true creation of art."

        "review_detailed_main": "Network is one of the most intelligently written films I've ever seen; the characters in Chayevsky's script fight viciously, tear each other down, rant against the \"isms\" of society, and fall in and out of love \u0096always sounding authentically like the educated executives that they are.\n\nThis isn't a talking-heads film, however. The plot, and the broadcasting world put on frank display, is (to use a clich\u00e9d phrase) eerily prescient of today's TV climate of corporate merges and (ridiculous) reality programming. When Faye Dunaway's ambitious and wispily beautiful programming exec, Diana Christensen, pitches an actual-footage lead-in to a drama about guerilla bank robbers to her colleagues, they balk \u0096 but we aren't shocked. Audiences in 1976 most likely scoffed at this idea just as these characters do, but in our creatively sucked-dry world of non-scripted Fear Factors and Survivors, it sounds like a ratings magnet. And Diana is right \u0096 it scores. The film does ride the line between the ridiculous (or satiric) when urban terrorists become producers of this show, and make demands of the TV suits with wild rants and violence, and when mad-as-hell news anchor Howard Beale (played by a thinner, edgier Peter Finch) turns his authentic one-time rant against all that is wrong with life into a production where he \"faints\" at the apex of his Dennis Miller-meets-TV evangelist soliloquies.\n\nWatch Network to be wowed by the language of the characters. (Strangely, the sparse voice-overs contradict the crackling intelligence of these TV-land players with dry, monotone authority.) Watch it to appreciate the acting of a generation since replaced by less impressive stars. You'll wonder if Chayevsky employed a psychic when he wrote this amazing script. The tagline \"Television will never be the same!\" is a prediction, two decades early, of the onslaught of dreck that has in fact transformed television into a wasteland of envelope-shoving, outlandish programming."

        "review_title": "Just Who Is Being Satirized in Network?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Our adult film course recently watched this film and discussed it at length afterwards. The initial reaction is to see Sidney Lumet's and Paddy Chayefsky's Network as a brilliant satire of television news and, more broadly, the television industry, and to that end there's some brilliant writing by Chayefsky. Chayefsky, and Lumet, have to tread lightly with their movie audience because the ultimate target of their merciless satire, whether intentionally or not, is the American public. The 1970s were perhaps the last decade where commercial mass broadcasting via the three networks almost monopolized television viewing in America, and these networks operating as commercial programmers targeted their programming at the mass audience, sometimes viewed as the lowest common denominator. If the ravings of Howard Beale, the newscaster on Network who's having a severe breakdown, earn a \"40 share\", i.e., high ratings, then that's because the public finds him interesting or amusing, and not that they're getting a balanced report of current events. The irony in this movie is that the networks during this period, and previously, pursued the \"lowest common denominator\" in their commercial programming but viewed their newscasts as akin to a public trust without a strong emphasis on profitability. The FCC licenses that conveyed to them slices of the public airwaves required some forms of public service.\n\nAmong the highlights of the film for me were: (1) the brilliant speeches Chayefsky wrote for some of his characters, (2) the performance of Peter Finch as Howard Beale, the deranged \"anchorman\", who goes on the air \"to make my witness\" and delivers wild, rambling, incoherent speeches to his viewers followed by a physical collapse on the air, and the public loves him, so the programming dept. takes over the newscasts to ensure their high ratings (One might argue that Chayefsky has given Beale some of his disdain for television and his quasi-political paranoia but delivered in the form of a madman's ravings; others might argue that Beale, while clearly unhinged, is making observant points), (3) the amusing situation of radical Marxists, who've been given choice programming slots, arguing like capitalists over their \"distribution rights\", and (4) the production design of the revised newscasts, after they're controlled by the commercial programmers, that have all the trappings of a live variety show.\n\nDespite Chayefsky's brilliant script, in parts of the film, after a while the script seemed to me increasingly verbose and almost irritating in its deluge of words. In addition, although he wrote some brilliant speeches for his characters, I think he wrote too many of them, probably because (another criticism) he tried to make too many political points in one 2-hour film. For example, Arab petrodollars in the 1970s generated the same overwrought fears as Japanese capital in the 1980s and Chinese capital today. Finally, many reviewers on this site have called this film prescient. Well, I suppose the existence of reality TV and a Kardashian-oriented channel might suggest Network's prescience, but actually we're in an era of narrowcasting and not broadcasting as many of us have 500 or more cable channels from which to choose, and all of us have access to numerous offerings on YouTube. If you're so inclined, you're able to watch nature documentaries, ballet performances, classic films, European golf tournaments, biographies, and literate sitcoms, and you're not confined to watch what the mass audience liked in Network."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently saw the movie Network last night for the first time. This was based on the recommendations of the people here (@ IMDB) who mostly liked it.\n\nI did not like it. Although it got a good deal of critical acclaim and praise when it was released, I find too many faults in this picture.\n\nTo say that the pacing of the movie is slow is an understatement. The characters seem to drag from scene to scene as if they are reluctant to move.\n\nThe characters themselves, are wooden. They are filled with greed, ambition, and disgust. It almost like I am reading F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\". Even Peter Finch's rantings (While good at first) start to tire the viewer after a while. It seems as if the director wants to make the ideas so clear to the viewer that he bludgeons the audience with the repeated dialogue... Subtly is not part of this movie.\n\nI think that a good point that someone pointed out was that all the script is is a continuing set of monologues. People in this movie are not saying lines of dialogue they are saying commentaries. The social points and ideas are heavy handed.\n\nThey are forced into the viewers face as if to say \"This is what the media is.\"\n\nWe as a culture have come to accept Media as a crazy circus. (Take the OJ trial for instance). We see it not only has a benevolent father (Tom Brokaw) but as a Crazy uncle (Jerry Springer) as well. The (Heavy-Handed) social commentaries of this film fall on deaf ears in this jaded and media-saturated society.\n\nNot only is the film not relevant today I would also argue that this piece is more about greed and ambition (Or some combination of the two) than the \"evils\" of the nightly news."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the most cynical films of all time, with a very dark and sometimes humorous look at the banality of television and the stupidity of the public. At the same time, since it's so cynical and dark, it features some exceptionally adult dialog that even today should exclude kids from watching it. Now I do understand why such rough language was used (after all, this is a harsh \"wrinkles and all\" look at television), but it's a shame really as the film COULD be an excellent civics lesson to our kids--especially teens. Watching the contempt that network programmers have for intelligence and decency is an important lesson and makes this an exceptional film.\n\nJust how far a network will go for ratings is the major thrust of the film? The evening news anchorman of UBS News (a great acronym) is losing his mind. However, when he actually has a nervous breakdown and announces he's going to kill himself on the air, even the soul-less people at the network are even initially upset--that is until the ratings come in for this an the following broadcast when the same announcer uses tons of profanity. Then, instead of disavowing themselves from it, they bathe in the horrible spectacle of a person losing his hold on reality! And, in turn, this sort of crap programming results in even more controversial and pointless shows--such as one that glorifies terrorists and encourages these killers to film their exploits so they can be shown on TV! The sickest and funniest aspect of this was the business meeting the network bigwigs had with the terrorists when it was becoming obvious that these Communist Radicals were actually becoming astute Capitalists and were concerned with profits and residuals!!\n\nThere's a lot more to the film than this. In particular, there is a relationship between William Holden and Faye Dunaway that is actually intended as a representation of the shallowness of the media. In other words, Holden is seduced by Miss Dunaway--just like the public is often seduced by glitz without substance or depth. This parallel story is exceptional and Dunaway received an Oscar for her wonderful part. Oddly, while Holden was also exceptional in the film, the Oscar for Best Actor was given to Peter Finch (the insane anchor man) even though he is really more of a supporting character. Both he and Holden were up for the award. Beatrice Straight received the Best Supporting Actress for her very brief appearance in the film. While she WAS excellent, she was only on screen a tiny fraction of the film. So, choosing her and Finch as Oscar recipients both seem like odd choices in hindsight. Paddy Cheyevsky, not surprisingly, also garnered an Oscar for his insightful script.\n\nAll in all, while not one of the very greatest films I have seen, it certainly is a must-see for film fans and a wonderful example of cynicism and dark humor."

His ravings reveal the truth, and he is soon dubbed \"The Mad Prophet of the Airwaves.\" Today, in the age of trash TV, \"Network\" still has significance.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Network\" is a blazing, ballsy, and smoothly calculated satire of all things American and Corporate as seen through the tunneled vision of mass market consumerism in the form of television. Made in 1976 with no-nonsense old-school direction from Sydney Lumet and a so-good-it's-almost-sick script from Paddy Chayefsky, this is not only the second best film satire ever made (behind only \"Dr. Strangelove\" in my book) but also a simplistic hologram of what every great film, no matter what the genre, should be: a stone-cold acting, writing, and directing tour-de-force.\n\nFaye Dunaway (Oscar winner) is icy perfection as the programming exec who will put anything on TV for higher ratings. Peter Finch is \"mad as hell\" in his Oscar winning performance as the \"mad prophet of the airways\" spouting off tangents on everything from soulless consumerism to the dangers of MidEast corporate buy-outs (sadly things are still the same thirty years later). William Holden is equally good in his part as an aging and recently axed news exec looking for old-fashioned love in a crazy god-less new world. Robert Duvall (with his dreams of big-titted hits), Ned Beatty (with his forces of nature), and everyone else involved are all amazing. This is one of those films so perfectly tailored to its cast and sublimely directed that an actress (Beatrice Straight as Holden's wife) can walk onto screen for a mere five minutes, exorcise her lines as if this is her death dirge as an artist, and walk off with an Oscar.\n\nThen of course there is the writing. This is a film not only of great lines (like \"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\") but also of grandiose, verbose, and articulate dialogue (take any of the Dunaway-Holden scenes or the Beatty/Finch showdown of apocalyptic proportions). Only \"Casablanca,\" \"Annie Hall\" and perhaps \"Paris, Texas\" can compete with \"Network\" for best film dialogue ever.\n\nAnd finally, this is one of the few classics ripe (and dare I say begging) for re-imagining. In 1976 this was a hilariously dark satire joking about the worst case scenario of a new world order. Viewed today, it's a horrifying oracle of things that came true. If ever was there a film from the past with a more urgent message, I dare you to name it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Finally after 33 years I finally watched this classic film from start to finish. As over the years I would maybe catch a glimpse on Turner Classic Movies from time to time. I must say I'm glad I viewed \"Network\" it certainly holds up to it's praise and acclaim. Made in 1976 when watching it you can certainly say the film was made ahead of it's time, as clearly we see today how TV has turned into propaganda and a media circuit that dominates culture it even influences our political beliefs, eating habits, and social decisions.\n\nLong before the FOX News Channel, or Bill O' Reilly who reminds me some of lead character newsman Howard Beale(who tells it like it is and he's mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore!)this film would show and prove that the news had the right to ask questions and fight the powerful. Plus \"Network\" showcased that news could become entertaining and it could mock society much like we see today on shows like \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" and \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\". Yet thru it all it also shows the dirty side of the network brass proving they will go to any lengths and measures for ratings at the same time corruption happens just like with any other business.\n\nThe story based loosely like a satire is well directed by Sidney Lumet and the acting is top notch with an all pro cast of Dunaway, Holden, Finch, and Duvall. Newcaster Howard Beale(an over the top performance from Peter Finch who was the first ever actor to win a posthumous Oscar) has been on top of the news ratings for UBS for years. Yet all of a sudden he's done and his ratings have declined and you guessed it he's ready to get canned. Only after Beale says on his final airing that he will kill himself the network is shocked yet interested at his message as they want to bring him back for another go around. This deal is done with office and corporate politics from executive Frank Hackett(Robert Duvall)who replaces popular and traditional news division head Max Schumacher(William Holden)with the younger and more upbeat and sexy power driven and ratings money hungry entertainment chair Diana Christensen(Faye Dunaway a role she played with passion). When Diana takes over the news division it's spiced up to a more tell it all deal of the truth as the news is more of an act with a live audience a sideshow type. Yet it's only helped by the intense rants of anger and truth telling from Beale (\"Who's Mad as Hell, and he's not gonna take it anymore!\"). And this is a ratings hit with audiences as it pours money in and it even helps the entertainment department. And Diana patches things up with the outed Max by seducing him.\n\nOnly the downside as is so common we see the greed with any corporation and the dirty ties it has to the world and how it destroys democracy. As Beale is tipped off on this he starts to tell the people about it even though it hurts ratings. As it proves with greed and money it shows companies are so power hungry that if they can't get good ratings then they will fire or shall I say kill the news host! Crazy way to sign off it still proves in the TV business ratings and money rule as it's the propaganda that makes money. Still people have the right to know the truth and they should be angry the way the world of greed and company corporate distrust has ruined democracy. That's why \"Network\" is such a classic film not only just for those messages, but it was a film that was ahead of it's time as we see today with newsmen like O' Reilly and shows of the like of \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" that was what \"Network\" showcased in 1976. Remember \"Be Mad as Hell and don't take it anymore!\" \"Network\" is clearly a stirring classic that mirrored what TV news has became today."

Therefore, poor Max Schumacher (William Holden), a friend of Howard's and head of the news department, has to give his colleague the bad news. Howard is getting axed. The two go out drinking and think back on the funniest moments in their years together. But, oh, the next night is full of surprises! Howard still has two weeks to go and he announces on air he plans to kill himself on air over his firing. The network's upper bosses are aghast. But, lo and behold, everyone is interested in watching what comes next and the ratings rise. This gives calculating, career-driven Diana (Faye Dunaway) the chance to plan more new shows for the entertainment side of things. Why, terrorism will be featured on one show called the Mao Tse-Tung Hour! And her staff better come up with more insanely great ideas. The attractive but lethal Diana turns Max' head and they move in together, ruining his marriage. More importantly, Howard is such a star now that they let him continue and rant and rave on many topics. This involves the classic scene where he implores everyone to go to the window, open it, and shout \"I'm mad as h*ll and I'm not going to take it anymore!\" But, even Howard goes too far and now what will the Network do? This movie is one of the best in all of cinema world. In many respects, the ferocious and superb script by Paddy Chayefsky is responsible for its attractions as many of his biting lines are still relevant today and forever. Holden gives a conflicted, masterful performance in one of his last big roles while Dunaway won an Oscar for her extremely unlikeable but attractive turn as the Dragon Lady of television. Fans of quality films, you must not miss Network !"

Next night - yep, he was allowed back - he declared that it was time the viewing public got off their sofas and declared they had \"had enough\" with lazy government and corporate greed. His long suffering boss \"Max\" (William Holden) wants to have him looked after (medically) but the ambitious PR executive \"Diana\" (Faye Dunaway) sees an opportunity amidst all this evangelicalism and convinces the station's new boss \"Hackett\" (Robert Duvall) to remove \"Max\" and to reinstate \"Beale\" with his own hour long news hour programme complete with it's own soothsayer! Initially, this all sounds too barmy to be real, but in true television tradition - it catches on. The audiences soar, the advertisers and sponsors love it. For once, the news division isn't haemorrhaging cash! Can this be sustained though? \"Beale\" is entirely out of control and nobody - even his own network - is safe from his ranting and raving. Sooner or later he is bound to overstep the mark - and then the dominoes are going to topple spectacularly. To be honest I found the story to become more and more preposterous as the potent points about avarice, venality and success at all costs became subsumed into a denouement scenario that was pretty ridiculous. That said, this isn't really about the story so much as the performances from Finch, Holden, and the frequently scene-stealing Dunaway who delivers some pithy monologues with the sharpness of hound's tooth! Even now, almost fifty years later, it still resonates as conversations about true journalism versus commercial pandering showing no sign of ever abating, let alone finding a solution that adequately satisfies both. It also swipes quite nicely at the audience - the anything for a peaceable life brigade who get their news from television so long as they like what they hear! I would have like to have seen more of Finch, but as it is, this is a cracking and characterful look at what makes some of us tick (or not!)."

Peter Finch's performance of Howard Beale is over the top. A bland over-the-hill washed up anchor with dismal ratings becomes a ranting lunatic and turns into a network superstar. Faye Dunaway plays the soulless network executive who exploits Beale. Dunaway's character is representative of a generation that grew up on television- cold, unfeeling, completely programmed.

Although I was raised as a child during the so-called \"Golden Age of Television\" with many happy memories of those glorious days, I no longer watch programmed television for several reasons. Instead, what I do is to check the offerings of \"TCM On Demand\", which may very well control part of my life in lieu of television, but, for the most part, it is much more intellectually stimulating and spiritually uplifting than recent television has been, at least in my experience. What's more is that I never seem to run out of films that I want to watch.\n\nIn my view, this is a movie about a culture clash between those who were a part of that \"Golden Age\", at least in the television news business, and those who contributed to the destruction of the medium, converting it into nothing but a garbage heap only for the sake of \"mass appeal\" and corporate profits. The conflict is established at the very start during the drunken conversation between Howard Beale (Peter Finch) and Max Schumacher (William Holden) and intensifies during their maddening discord with a new generation of television executives such as Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall), and Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty). Among the cast, the one unsung hero is Laureen Hobbs, who plays the African American militant, supposedly modeled after real life radical Angela Davis. Appearing with the very best that Hollywood could offer, Ms. Hobbs certainly holds her own, respectable place, and she is hilarious.\n\nThe script by Paddy Chayefsky is nothing short of brilliant. If you don't agree with me, please read some of his powerful words, including many fascinating monologues by several different characters, in the \"quotes\" section of this very resourceful IMDb website. While Beatrice Straight is impressive in her record- breaking, five minute, Oscar winning diatribe, Mr. Chayefsky's dazzling talent as a writer stands is a significant contributing factor as are the Oscar winning performances of Finch and Dunaway and the Oscar nominated parts by Holden and Beatty. The overall success of this film is the combined result of excellent writing, an exceptional cast that could deliver the knock-out punches that this very able writer handed them, and the very skilled direction of Sidney Lumet.\n\nAlthough Chayefsky clinched three Oscars for his writing (\"Marty\", \"The Hospital\", and this film), his life was tragically cut short at the young age of 58. The quality of his work rather than its mere quantity left a strong impact not only upon Hollywood but on the same \"Golden Age of Television\" to which I referred earlier.\n\nAside from the many memorable and meaningful monologues delivered by this extremely talented cast, the one brief instance that summarizes a key message of this film more than any other is when Max pours his heart out to Diana while she can't resist the urge to take a commercial break by answering a telephone call. For me, that says it all. By the way, William Holden may not have received an Oscar for his role here, but he surely deserved one for so effectively conveying the inner turmoil of Max Schumacher at a critical juncture of his life, a very serious matter that should never be minimized in the midst of the frenzied activity that surrounds him."

        "review_detailed_main": "Perhaps Network was ahead of its time when it was released in 1977...but then again maybe it wasn't. It won a slew of awards, including Peter Finch's best actor Oscar for his portrayal as Howard Beale \"The Prophet of The Airwaves\", which was the first acting Oscar ever awarded posthumously.\n\nThe movie comes across as satirical, however according to Sidney Lumet, and Paddy Chayefsky, it is anything but. The themes explored are if anything more relevant now in 2019 than they ever were in the 1970's.\n\nA TV Station exploiting the public meltdown of a man for improved TV ratings, creating reality TV shows which aren't 100% real, the concept of \"truth\" being a flexible term.\n\nMost importantly it hits on two key notes in my opinion, both of them painfully true. The idea that the average person is fed up with the status quo, and that they will listen to and believe almost anything they are told. \"Why me?\" asks Howard Beale, \"because you're on TV dummy\" comes the reply.\n\nThe performances of the core cast members, Robert Duvall, Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and William Holden are very strong, all portraying their particular tv execs with unique egotism, which pulls you into believing this is how a station operates. Beatrice Straight should get a mention for putting in an incredibly powerful scene as the wronged wife of Holden's TV exec Max Schumacher.\n\nAt times the story feels a little light and lacks a bit of depth, with key scenes moving along a little faster than they should. But overall, it holds your attention all the way through, and the dialogue is excellent!\n\nAs a film it is very thought provoking and acts as a warning in many ways. As a satirical / comedic piece, whilst incredibly different, it's up there with Anchorman 2."

However, justice is not always done at the Oscar. \"Beauty\", \"Shakespeare in Love\", \"The Silence of the Lambs\" won when they deserved, but the Oscar was very unfair to films like \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"Network\". This one won best actor, actress, supporting actress and screenplay, but why not best picture? Well, \"Rocky\" won that year but, if the masterful \"Taxi Driver\" was almost forgotten, the equally excellent \"Network\" should have won. Do you want some reasons?\n\n1- It is one of the most sarcastic, darkest comedies ever made.\n\n2- It is brilliantly acted, with amazing performances of Faye Dunaway, William Holden and Peter Finch.\n\n3- The screenplay is one of the best ever written, mixing very well dark comedy and personal dramas.\n\n4- It discusses some main subjects, as ethics, and makes an acid critic to the TV.\n\n5- It doesn't only care about this, but also to each character. Each one is very well developed, with his/her own problems.\n\n6- The film is profetic. It's more realistic than ever in our days.\n\n7- It keeps suspense about the destiny of the characters, with a very precise narration.\n\n8- The direction of Sidney Lumet is more than a high quality direction.\n\n9- It has one of the best movie quotes ever: \"I'm mad as hell, and I won't take this any more!\"\n\n10- The ending is just... great! Unpredictable and surprising! Between my favorite endings (along with \"The Sixth Sense\", \"2001\", \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"Witness for the Prosecution\", \"Nashville\", etc)\n\nDo you want something else? So watch \"Network\". It is a true masterpiece and a unquestionable classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Network\" is a prophetic film from the great Sidney Lumet, that proved its relevance every year since its release. You could use the same script for today, it hasn't aged. That's what makes \"Network\" one of the greatest screenplays ever written. The intelligence, the modernity of the script transcend the film, it's like the most proeminent character. So, the only decent way to start a review of \"Network\" is to salute at first, the brilliance of Paddy Chayefski's writing.\n\n\"Network\" denounces the evolution of the media and the way they use their far-reaching power for every single element of our everyday lives. Television plays the same role in \"Network\" than the Internet today, still, most of the IMDb users are old enough to remember when Television had a greater impact. But the movie is less about the influence of TV, than the control of big corporations on our lives. The movie is an intelligent satire targeting the business world and the decisional influence of the stock-holders on the economy, therefore -indirectly- on our consumption's habits. We're not people, we're consumers, we're the tools of a system whose only goal is to guarantee advantageous returns on investment. Everything is money.\n\nAnd full of an acid lucidity, this statement means one essential thing : media and especially television, aren't here to entertain you, but to make sure your brain is available to receive subliminal messages of consumption, in one word: advertisement. This is the fundamental basis of TV business, as would say Howard Beale, the rest is \"bullshit\". Time is definitely money and TV managers are not interested in audience because they want people to learn or to be entertained, they have library and sport for that. All they want is a reasonable availability of brain to wash. Announcers rule the media world. Who are the announcers? companies. And who lead companies? Stock-holders. Quod Erat Demonstratum.\n\nIndeed, in \"Network\", this logic is constantly demonstrated and deconstructed through the interactions between all the characters, each one brings his or her own dimension to a sensational tragicomic farce performed before our eyes. The central character of this cynical universe is Howard Beale (Peter Finch). Beale, as a has-been performer, by simply announcing his future suicide on TV, caused a chain reaction of events which sent him straight on prime-time as \"an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?\" How? Thanks to a simple catchphrase crystallizing this anger, and supposed to be what the producer of the information program, Diana Christensen was looking for. 1976 was full of memorable movies quotes, \"You talking' to me\", \"Yo, Adrian\" and \"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore\" summarizing the spirit of the post-Watergate 70's.\n\nThe problem for Howard Beale is that he plays his role too seriously, he really denounces the hypocrisy of the times, when in fact he indirectly serves it. Beale is here to improve the audience, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) doesn't give a damn about what is said on-screen, as long as the market share and Nielsen ratings are high. Doesn't that ring a bell? Isn't this, THE logic that made TV reality shows possible? Shows where people can be humiliated or authentic sensationalist live reports depicting infidelity, diets or crimes in the most voyeuristic way ... Anything that can attract more viewers is welcome, according to Diana Christensen. She's only good at business, she admits to Max Shumacher (William Holden) her lover and Beale's best friend. She's right, she's not good when it comes to human relationships, she doesn't know how to psychologically behave. But she does know how to psychologically deal with the audience, and that puts OUR position into perspective.\n\nOur fascination for Howard Beale, is because we love nonconformist people but here's an interesting question the script asks : if an anti-establishment celebrity appears on TV or media to denounce a system, isn't this already a part of the very same hypocrisy. Isn't the simple apparition on TV or any public media for that matter, already discrediting the message of the philosophy of the speaker? The films gives us a hint, through its clever approach to the political revolutionary activists. Media appear like a corrupting force that destroys anything on its way just to serve the power of finance and stock-holders. People are aware of that, they're the tools of the system, so the only trick to keep them on TV is like a modernization of the whole \"Bread, Wine and Circus Games\" concept. Give them what to consume : logos, brands, pop-culture and then, when they're comfortably seated with the remote control on hand, make them feel powerful like the audience who condemned the gladiators with a thumb down. We all have this sadistic tendency to enjoy seeing other people suffer, voting for this or that candidate. People's humiliation became so banal, we're the instruments of that. TV exploits our \"Shadenfreude\" feeling in a viciously subtle way.\n\nPaddy Chayefeski anticipated the psychological and economical predisposition for programs like \"American Idol\", \"Fear Factor\" or \"Temptation Island\", the mentality exacerbated by the Internet, although Internet seems like the antidote to the poisoning effect of TV on minds. But the genius of the script doesn't rely only on this prophetic aspect : the speeches, the construction of the plot, the way each single element perfectly fits in that big corporatist puzzle, is exemplary. And the genius of the film doesn't rely only on the screenplay but also on the performances of the characters, from Holden to Dunaway and Beale, and with the extraordinary cast of supporting characters : Robert Duvall, Ned Beatty, Beatrice Straight, this film is a real acting lesson.\n\n\"Network\" a brilliantly intelligent satire of the business world with the script as the surplus value."

It starts out on a good note and even delivers an important message about the world of television and all that it encompasses good and bad, especially bad. However, it devolves quickly into a far-fetched picture that goes on way too insufferably long. Finch and Holden are excellent but how Faye Dunaway supposedly ran off with 'Network' is a joke. They should have 'done away' with both her character and her performance. In many cinema circles, Dunaway's Oscar for this 2 hour overdone movie is considered a joke. I'm not saying 'Network' is awful, parts of it might even border on brilliant, but regrettably those times are few and far between."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Network\" has a wonderful opening, when newscaster Howard Beale is told he has been fired by his boss and best friend, Max Schumacher. We catch Max in mid-sentence, as he tells Howard a story about his early career with the punchline: \"You have your whole life ahead of you.\" Afterward, Howard suggests killing himself on-air. Why not, replies Max? You'd get a fifty share, easy. So of course Howard goes on air the next evening saying exactly that.\n\nI wish I loved the rest of the movie as much as I do that opening. \"Network\" is a brilliant film more in concept than in execution.\n\nWhat people know best about \"Network\" is Peter Finch as Beale. As the film progresses, he becomes \"the mad prophet of the airwaves,\" shrieking various profundities for the sake of salvaging the ratings of his fourth-place network, UBS. Wearing a raincoat and pajamas, he tells his audience to not just get mad, but mad as hell. \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore,\" he tells his audience to yell out the windows, and many do, to the satisfaction of programmer Diane Christensen (Faye Dunaway), who grabs the show and makes it her own.\n\nHolden and Finch are brilliant as tired newsmen who throw up their hands at the machinations of their fellow men, in part because they take their roles with a certain grain of salt. \"I was married for 33 years to shrill, shrieking fraud,\" Beale announces on the air at one point, as if his audience would view his failed marriage as an example of their own sad existence. Finch really straddles the line between satire and drama, while Max's drunken musings about \"the death hour,\" his own face a deathlike shroud, is startling in its delivery, never mind his comment after about Disney.\n\nLess successful are Robert Duvall as a \"hatchet-man\" for UBS's parent corporation and Ned Beatty as the head of that parent corporation, both of whom are way too shrill even for the excessive roles they are assigned. Dunaway is a fine actress who won an Oscar for her performance here, but I can't decide whether she's part of the problem or not. When Christensen goes to visit Hackett early in the film, urging Beale be kept on the air, Dunaway is alternately annoying and brilliant when she makes her case. Half the time she gives a breast-clenching display of actorliness, half the time she is subtle and believable, like when Duvall demands whether she is serious about putting the mad Beale back on the air and she simply nods yes.\n\nUltimately, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky is the problem. He had the concept, a lovely one, but his execution is verbose and excessive. He makes Jonathan Swift seem light. \"A strip Savonarola inveighing against the hypocrisies of our times that will just go through the roof!\" Who talks like that? Not any television executive, not even on PBS.\n\nBeale's subsequent success as a television prophet defies believability. People who claim Chayefsky saw television's future kid themselves. Even Bill O'Reilly doesn't attack religious belief or else claim he is \"imbued,\" the way Beale does. The way he is embraced by his audience cries out \"plot convenience\" as does the relationship between Max and Diane, especially near the end when Max dresses down Diane for her television stereotyping of their relationship. It's annoyingly convenient how Holden's character gets to have his roll in the hay with Dunaway's Christensen, then take the high moral road. Frankly, Max became a lot less palatable embarking on his affair not once but twice, and after Diane did him out of his job, too. I think Beatrice Straight as Max's wife won her Oscar simply because so many of the Academy voters choked on Max's holier-than-thou hubris, and appreciated the fact someone in the movie gave it back to him.\n\nBut did Straight have to use terms like \"emeritus years\" and \"dotage\"? The problem isn't that Chayefsky talked like that, but that he made his characters do likewise.\n\n\"Network\" is satire that is neither funny nor believable, featuring characters neither human nor empathetic, and dialogue that seems pulled from a thesaurus. No wonder it won so many awards. People who voted for it must have felt like they earned I.Q. points from doing so. Smart isn't always as smart sounds."

You know the type; if it's not three-and-a-half hours long or directed by either Fellini or Bergman, it's a lousy movie. What I do remember quite vividly is a discussion about \"Network\", which I hadn't yet seen back then, and never saw until now, another twenty years later. \"Network\" was unanimously referred to as \"the yelling movie\", and that is actually quite accurate.\n\nEverybody yells in this film. There's Howard Beale, obviously, the washed-up anchorman who goes berserk on air and unexpectedly receives a new career as paranoid TV-prophet/evangelist. His \"mad-as-hell\" speech is a legendary piece of cinematic shouting, but the rest of fabulous ensemble cast does their share of shouting too. The network director yells to the head of the news department. The head of the news department yells at the programming director. The programming director yells at everybody, the wife of the head of the news department yells to her husband, random TV-anchors yell at the programming director, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nAll the yelling is relevant, though, and together the harsh monologues and feisty dialogues form one of the nastiest and most biting satires ever accomplished. The characters are all loathsome, and the higher they are up in the network hierarchy, the more loathsome they become. And, clich\u00e9d as that may sound, that is a very realistic and accurate depiction of leadership teams in large companies; - media or otherwise.\n\nThe performances are, hands down, phenomenal.

Their Walter Cronkite is one Howard Beale who's been slipping badly in the ratings. Beale played by Peter Finch is given the axe by his good friend, the director of the news division of UBS Max Schumacher who is played by William Holden.\n\nBeale who really has nothing else in his life, left a childless widower a few years earlier, but this program.

Programmer Faye Dunaway decides to blend news and entertainment with a series of startling ideas.\n\nWhat hath Network wrought? In 1976 Network was considered clever way out satire. Now there's more truth in it than one would like to believe. Now we have television networks that are devoted to nothing but news, but strive for those all important ratings with blending entertainment with news.\n\nBut Chayefsky missed the boat in two respects. He did not anticipate the rise of cable television. Whereas my generation grew up with three networks period, affordable cable has multiplied the networks into the hundreds. That in itself makes the four network reality of Network outdated. And of course Mr. Chayefsky did as so many others, not anticipate the Internet where so many people now get their information and it's even a source of entertainment.\n\nBill Holden and Peter Finch were nominated for their performances in the Best Actor category. They probably would have split the vote which is what normally happens, but for Peter Finch's demise before the Oscar voting. Sad to say that probably clinched the Oscar for him, but it was still well deserved. An honest decent man who gets caught up in machinations that end in tragedy, you don't take your eyes off Finch for one second while he's on screen.\n\nHolden is caught up in the machinations as well. He gets a midlife crisis and starts an affair with Faye Dunaway, but their differences in not only age, but general outlook on life drive them apart. Holden's left his wife Beatrice Straight for Dunaway and she got a Best Supporting Actress award for her scenes telling off Mr. Holden. It's by no means certain what Holden's future is, but it is clear he has no place in the television industry as it was constituted in 1996.\n\nNor I doubt he would have one today in 2006. I can see Holden's character, a man now in his mid 80s being a professor emeritus of journalism at some college or even running a newsblog today.\n\nRobert Duvall, Wesley Addy, William Prince are all corporate types we find in various films about big business. The one character who stands out for me is Ned Beatty, the head of the conglomerate who bought the whole network. His scene with Peter Finch where he explains the facts of life to the now demented Howard Beale is the best in the film.\n\nNetwork is a great film, both entertaining and thought provoking."

Its not a matter of looking at it now and wondering if time has over taken it, it never worked for me. For me the film simply was \"shocking\" to seem clever even though it never really was.\n\nCertainly it hard to look at the film now and not think how psychic it was, but I think that was by accident, or perhaps it was the networks simply copying what they saw here and using it to boost their ratings.\n\nThe story of a network which radically rethinks what its going to broadcast after its anchorman goes mad and decides to kill himself on camera is ripe with possibilities. The film makers certainly explore many of them, but at the same time each time I've watched it I've always been left feeling like I've missed something, or rather that the film is not as clever as it thinks it is.\n\nTry it, but don't feel stupid if you don't get it...I don't think there is anything to get."

Nonetheless, I loved this movie.\n\nIn my experience, I have heard quite a few complaints about this movie. I believe that these complaints are why Network is not on the Top 250 today (June 10, 2007; Network has a rating of 8.0/10 with 15,319 votes). These complaints include:\n\n-the movie is too \"slow\"\n\n-Chayefsky's monologues are unrealistic\n\n-the film is irrelevant today\n\n-you can't relate to such a movie\n\nWell, in this comment, I would like to dispute such complaints.\n\nI will admit that the movie is somewhat slow, but what do you expect? It is a movie about the corporate greed of the television network. It is not a \"dumbed-down\" Tom Cruise action movie. Besides, each scene matters to the plot. If someone tried editing this movie, they wouldn't find many parts they could edit. I find a certain intelligence in each scene.\n\nPeople say that Chayefsky's monologues are unrealistic. They complain that \"no one talks like that in real life\". I beg to differ. I can think of many times where I went on and on in a monologue to strengthen and add support to my opinion. In fact, this whole comment is a monologue, written to debate and support my opinion, much like Chayefsky's monologues in the movie.\n\nPeople also say that the movie is irrelevant today. This is the most outrageous complaint out of all of the complaints. This movie is more relevant today than it was in the 70s. Many very unsophisticated people gather ALL of their \"information\" (mostly propaganda) from the television. And the television networks today manipulate their audiences to think the way they want them to think.\n\nLastly, people complain that you cannot \"relate\" to such a movie. Well, I hope you can't relate to the movie. I hope that you are not a greedy, selfish television network manager. Unfortunately, in essence, you CAN relate. People may not be television network managers, but we have all felt greed and egoism. Think about The Godfather. You may like the movie, but how are you supposed to relate to a mob boss? That's not the point. You are comparing the mob's structure with society's structure; that is how you relate.\n\nIn conclusion, these complaints have no strong basis. At least rent the movie. Or, if you do not want to , check on channel TCM (Turner Classic Movies). They air Network on there at least 8 times a year (with absolutely no commercials).\n\nWatch this movie at least once. I hope you won't regret it. 9/10."

But it isnt shouting because of a gimmick, it is shouting out of REAL ANGER, out of real inner frustration, in which emotions explode to the surface, but in a real life, credible way, with detailed portrayal of all the human insecurities and vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd the characters in this story shout for a reason, because they get squashed by the corporate world of commercial television, which is the profit seeking monster, that will do anything to get higher ratings, even televising a mad man, who isnt mad at all though, but simply says what everybody else is thinking. The leading character (a news reader) in this movie is more of an angry prophet, warning people for the systematic destructive powers of corporate television.\n\nTimeless classic about the vulgarity and ruthlessness of television.Terrific dialogues and great acting performances! I am amazed that it still has such a profound impact on me in 2020, after having seen it several times over the past decades..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sidney Lumet's glorious satire about the lengths TV networks will go to obtain those elusive viewing figures is a timeless drama that is as relevant now than it was when it was made considering the political turmoil we are currently experiencing. Peter Finch plays newscaster Howard Beale who is on the verge of a nervous breakdown after being told he will be sacked after 11yrs of working for the Network. While live on one of his final shows he dramatically tells his audience he will commit suicide on his last show. The executive board are furious and pull him screaming from his chair but viewing figures jump. Executive Diana Christensen (Faye Runaway) pursuades the board to reinstate him and viewing figures soar as his improvised angry rants resonate with the audience. Scrutinising the lengths the scrupulous & manipulative TV company's will go for higher viewing figures Paddy Chayefsky's incredible script sizzles off his pages and on to the screen as a tour de force cast deliver his lines. Peter Finch is superb as the crazed iconoclastic & morbid Beale, who tragically died shortly after filming but went on to win a post-humous best actor Oscar. But this isn't just a one man show, everyone involved is quite simply breath taking. Lumet always seems to get the best out of his actors and it's no different here. Brilliant performances from William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall and extraordinary cameos from Beatrice Straight & Ned Beatty (with two of the best scenes in the movie) make Network an outstanding piece of satirical work showing the manipulative power TV holds over the viewing public. It has to be right if the people on the TV are telling us this, right? Network is up there with 12 Angry Men, Dog Day Afternoon & Serpico as one of Sidney Lumet's best. I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Sidney Lumet is a Hollywood careerist whose imprint on his great corpus of work is so subtle as to be almost anonymous. Apart from being engrossingly valid and entertaining films it is hard to draw a thread between 12 Angry Men, Serpico, Equus, Network, Dog Day Afternoon and House of Games. This is a film maker who has that talent that eludes journalists the capacity to make his work look like it is without comment. And yet of course Sidney Lumet wants to tell us something all the time, he just wants to make sure he doesn't look like he is.\n\nThis film is uncannily prescient. Decades before Jerry Springer and the other tragic bottoms of barrels American TV managed to reach; decades before the drama of Dan Rather's retirement and the feud with CBS and the ratings shifts before and after he left; before 'reality' television became a genre, there was Network. This is hardly a satirical look at the visceral innards of TV management. This is what today's TV would probably not hesitate to pass as a re-enactment of probable fact. Those last two words are admittedly contradictory but the literary tool of the oxymoron here, I believe, is perfectly legitimate.\n\nThe story unfolds at a fourth fictitious nationwide network UBS where veteran newscaster Howard Beale competes for ratings with Walter Cronkite and the rest of the real and existing networks. The ratings keep failing and Beale is staring in the face of his retirement. His depression gives him a nervous breakdown and on live TV, a week before his last broadcast, he announces to his audience that a week later he would blow his brains out on the evening news.\n\nThere's a spine-chillingly accurate telling of this scene. While he's speaking out to his live audience, the crew inside the mixer box completely miss this outburst. They're really only interested in the running order of tapes and graphic cuts and that timing is accurate to fit in with the advert breaks of the affiliates. I've been in one of those mixing rooms a few times. That's exactly how it works.\n\nAnyway Beale is being taken off the air but this is a time of changes in network management and the public's obvious interest in the spectacle of a rigid, cheerless newscaster they've known for 11 years parroting the news now gone completely insane on live TV is no reason to remove him for the new kids on the management. The old guard is represented by Max Schumacher who feels sympathy for Beale because he too is on the way out. UBS has been taken over by a new conglomerate and the heavy financial cost of the news-department needs now to be neutralised by the cuts and control of business-minded, ambitious and young Frank Hackett for whom 'the business of management is management' and news needs to fit under management.\n\nFrank Hackett is the new guard. Him and Diana Christensen. Now there are two characters for the movies. From this film everyone remembers Peter Finch playing Howard Beale 'mad as hell': that over-the-top hysteria that flirts with the limits of the audiences' psychological closure. But Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway are also 'mad as hell'. These are the workaholic, performance-obsessed yuppies we know from every office. In the three-way scene when Hackett fires Schumacher (how well William Holden aged), Hackett's madness becomes transparent. As the prize of promotion to the corporation board is within his sight nothing would stop him: not the need to shout, to bully, even to kill.\n\nBut Dunaway's Christensen is the ultimate yuppie. She is so engrossed by work that when Schumacher cannot take her obsession any more and leaves her he articulates the meaninglessness of her existence. 'There's nothing left in you that I can live with. You're one of Howard's humanoids. If I stay with you, I'll be destroyed. Like Howard Beale was destroyed. Like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed. Like everything you and the institution of television touch is destroyed. You're television incarnate, Diana: Indifferent to suffering; insensitive to joy. All of life is reduced to the common rubble of banality. War, murder, death are all the same to you as bottles of beer. And the daily business of life is a corrupt comedy. You even shatter the sensations of time and space into split seconds and instant replays. You're madness, Diana. Virulent madness. And everything you touch dies with you. But not me. Not as long as I can feel pleasure, and pain... and love.' That's the thing with this film. It's not afraid of words. It confronts the banality of television with the articulation of better cinema. Admittedly this is the world before The West Wing, 24, The Sopranos, Six Feet Under et alia.\n\nCheck out Beatrice Straight's Oscar winning 5-minute performance as the scorned wife of Max Shumacher. Aided by competent writing, she brings out the complete arc of a character married for 25 years and abandoned for another woman within seconds of our first introduction: and we feel we've known her for ever.\n\nSidney Lumet did it again."

There is a point in the movie where the entire story comes predictable and the main plot gets lost in the way-too-much satiric situations. The best thing about the movie is Faye Dunaway, she is a great actress and it's a pleasure watching her the entire movie. In my opinion a good movie has to be universal, that anybody from any culture/historic time can understand it, to me, this movie just tried to impact its own specific historic moment. I also felt the story was stretched more than it needed, they could have cut at least 30 minutes of the movie and made it more smooth and powerful. So far this is the only movie I consider it doesn't have to be in the IMDb top 250 list."

It's right in line with the late 60's-early 70's: anti-system soliloquies design to stir the masses.\n\nIt was probably the best behind the scenes look at television I've ever seen on film. There were almost too many characters from the presidents, directors and others. They even added some ratings talk which was well over my head.\n\nThere were a lot of great performances. I particularly liked Ned Beatty's performance however brief. Some of the dialogue devolved into diatribe and lost its appeal to me. They were entering spoof territory with some of the performances, almost as if they were admitting they were on stage."

In particular, Ned Beatty's \"you have meddled with the primal forces of nature!\" tirade is riveting. The performances are outstanding, with Peter Finch masterfully playing latter-day prophet Howard Beale; William Holden as Beale's friend and associate; and Faye Dunaway as a bitch-on-wheels programming director. As I mentioned in my critique on \"Taxi Driver\", these two films paint a portrait of the world that is as dark and realistic now than 23 years ago. \"Network\" describes a world in which ratings are emphasized over content, and with the amount of cliched sitcoms, reality-based dramas, and talk shows that border on exploitation, the ideas in the film have manifested in the 1990s.

        "review_detailed_main": "1976 should make film-goers respect the difficult task carried out by Academy Award voters. Arguably the greatest year in U.S. cinema history fired off 'Network,' 'All the President's Men,' 'Bound for Glory,' 'Taxi Driver,' and eventual winner 'Rocky' as candidates for best picture. That 'Network' was turned down says much about the quality of film on 1976's ballot.\n\nHowever, it says a great deal about 'Network' that the movie won four Oscars, including three by its cast. The film was an ideal project for director Sidney Lumet, with all but one of the leading roles taken by first choice actors and barely any hitches occurring in Network's spawn. Superb performances from the entire cast and Paddy Chayefsky's bold social commentary were a match made in Heaven.\n\nChayefsky, who earned a considerable reputation in stage, film, and television writing, coined up 'Network' as a parable on broadcasting industry trends: Nielsen ratings becoming the wherewithal for a television show's existence, television entering the hands of corporate powerbrokers, and the absolute flattening of integrity for monetary gain. Few realized at the time, however, that 'Network' would slowly transform itself into a parody of the business as it really is. Since 1976, the original playing field of three major television networks has become overcrowded with 'shock' companies like Fox and UPN, hundreds of cable and digital channels, and broadcasting sources on the Internet. Their economic power wearing thin, networks have found themselves desperate for advertising revenue, turning to 'reality' shows, trash journalism, and other venues of socially unacceptable behavior.\n\nIn 1976, the economic power of television was limited mostly to CBS, ABC, and NBC. In Paddy Chayefsky's semi-fictional America, there exists a fourth network called the Union Broadcasting Systems (UBS), presided over by chairman Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall). UBS ranks fourth in virtually even realm of broadcasting, including its news division. Everything changes overnight, however, when network news anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is sacked for his program's low ratings. One week before a final show, lonely widower Beale announces that he will commit suicide on the air in order to boost UBS's viewership. Needless to say, viewers who were never interested in Beale's program start tuning in and UBS gains free publicity in both newspapers and on competing stations.\n\nJumping right on the situation is programming director Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), a young opportunist in search of an angle. Through the Beale fiasco, Christensen realizes that TV can be used as a magnet for the rages and vulnerabilities of average Americans, drawing viewers to their sets with outrageous fare. This, of course, means giving Beale his own show for insanity-driven rants ('a latter-day prophet') and creating a wide array of programs on terrorist groups, car crashes, executions, occultism, and sexual transgression. In no time, Christensen has UBS on par with the other three networks and takes almost full control of the company's news division from Max Schumacher (William Holden), subordinating it to a 'for profit' role.\n\nChayefsky, not Beale, should be hailed as a social prophet. Some twenty years in advance, the playwright foresaw a television industry that provides shock treatment like jolts of insulin. Engulfed in a mad scramble for ratings and advertising dollars, television has become an instrument of dementia rather than a means of entertainment. Equally uncanny is the purchase of networks by transnational corporations that want matters told from their own viewpoint, as depicted by Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), the chairman of industrial giant CCA who acquires UBS for his own devices.\n\nIf a film-goer hasn't seen 'Network,' he hasn't seen 1970s cinema at all. The film was snubbed for Best Picture, but still earned three acting Oscars by Finch (posthumously, the first actor to do so), Dunaway, and Beatrice Straight, who played a brief role as Max Schumacher's wife, Louise. Paddy Chayefsky received Network's fourth Oscar for best original screenplay. The film is a perfect balance, with no single element of production carrying it; 'Network' is wonderfully cohesive, from acting to directing to cinematography (Owen Roizman) to editing (Alan Heim) to the Beale theme song (Elliot Lawrence) in an otherwise music-less two hours.\n\nThe film, which was jointly released by MGM and United Artists under exceptional circumstances, has been reissued in a two-disc special edition by Warner Brothers with help from Turner Entertainment Company (*whew*). Disc one contains 'Network' with optional commentary by Sidney Lumet and the theatrical trailer. The movie and trailer are presented in widescreen with Dolby-enhanced stereo; French 'dubbing' is included with English, French, and Spanish subtitles. Disc two is jam-packed with supplementary material, including a six-part documentary on the making of 'Network,' portions of a Chayefsky interview with Dinah Shore, and a Lumet interview with Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movie's 'Private Screenings.'\n\n'Network' is presented with the respect it deserves. The film's video and audio are crystal clear, while the trailer is in fairly good shape with darkness and some visible artifacts. Turner's supplementary items cover all facets of the movie-making process and bring deeper appreciation of Network's filming. Of slight disappointment is Lumet's commentary track, which doesn't go beyond what he already mentions in the documentary and 'Private Screenings' interview. This problem is easily solved by listening to the commentary track before watching the second disc. On all levels, this film is required viewing; a true classic.\n\n*** \u00bd out of 4"

Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is a reporter who is getting the boot from his good buddy and chairman of the board Max Schumacher (William Holden) after ratings from his reports go down the crapper. Beale begs to make his final farewell where an epiphany hits his head where no longer will he play by the rules and just tells the truth that people want to hear. Max is fired with Beale heading off as well until the new chairman Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) and an new executive Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) try to bring back Howard after the ratings hit the roof. After Beale hits the roof with his famous \"I'm as mad as hell\" speech, he has his own show in Hollywood where he preaches about the truth from television, commerce, etc,.\n\nThe film was often noted as a satire with Roger Ebert, years later, calling it a prophet saying that without this movie or Beale's messages that the WWF, Jerry Springer or football games wouldn't exist on television.\n\nOr in this generation: Dancing with the Stars, American Idol, Disney Channel, Fear Factor, Deal or No Deal, Are you smarter than a fifth grader?, etc.\n\nIt's true! Many people, mostly Americans, often sit their asses down watching TV channel surfing than reading books, magazines and figuring out why the government hides secret, why their gas and food prices are going up, the effects on social security, thinking of monsters and bad guys as good rather than the cops and politicians who are corrupted, or information that could make those a better person rather than being a flock of sheep.\n\nWatch \"Network\" before you decide to flip to the next station."

But it is flawed because it's radical ideas are not carried along all the way. Maybe its a product of its time. But in todays world, many aspects are dated.

The greedy manager of the channel starts to exploit this for his own gains, giving the man his own show to rant and rave, mouth in froth, as much as he pleases. And the viewer numbers keep rising. But at what price?\n\nIf it isn't clear already, this film is a satire. It takes a hard stance against the growing TV phenomenon of the 70s, peeling away layer after layer of filth, misinformation and bad habits.\n\nAnd I have to admit that it does it very eloquently. It's a wordy movie, famous for its long-winded speeches, in which no mercy is given, no prisoners are taken and no hits are pulled. These are some amazing monologues, delivered by some of the most talented actors of the decade. I salute such skill with the spoken word.\n\nAlthough, it is peculiar how little things have changed. This movie is over forty years old now, but even today the latest generation has been raised by television and media in general. They care about nothing, value nothing, know nothing, and can barely interact with real, living people. No one even plays outside anymore, can you believe it.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSo, is the movie prophetic? Or is it that the older generation will always find something to complain about when the new generation won't do as they say, intent on doing things differently.\n\nStill, if you have to complain about the ruin of the next generation, at least this movie does it with style and panache. Kudos, I say. Kudos indeed."

Viewed as an absurdest depiction in its day of a media and society gone shameless we now actually live in one that celebrates it, courtesy of the plug in drug. Networks now take sides, Fox on the Right, MSNBC on the Left. They believe a more perky personality (Katie Couric) will make bad news more palatable. They spend endless hours on dead blonds and self destructive bimbos. They give the people what they want. Network lays this all out in a comically sardonic film that eviscerates a media whose lost its dignity and sense of purpose.\n\nPaddy Chayefsky's script bristles with sharp wit and biting dialogue that is delivered by a cast giving career performances. Peter Finch clearly steals the show as the messianic news anchor Howard Beale. His \"mad as hell\" speech is one of the greatest in all of film but Faye Dunaway, Ned Beatty and William Holden, in his last excellent role, give superb performances as well. Actor's director Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men, The Pawnbroker, The Verdict) fine tunes the cast so well that actress Beatrice Straight makes the most of the five minutes of screen time she has with an Academy Award performance.\n\nNetwork is a superb confluence of script and performance flawlessly presented by all involved. It may not be a pretty picture but it is a work of art."

His writing is too sharp, too witty, and there's too much of it for today's films.\n\n\"Network,\" released in 1976, could have been made yesterday. It's as fresh now - probably fresher - than it was in 1976, when it was probably a tad ahead of its time. It's a behind the scenes look at a failing network (like any of our big three) which has been absorbed by a non-entertainment conglomerate. Everything is about ratings, share, advertising, and everyone is a commodity.\n\nThe story concerns two old-timers, William Holden and Peter Finch, who have become dinosaurs in their chosen field, network news, with Finch as Howard Beale, in front of the camera, and Holden as Max Schumacher, a producer. Beale is obviously having some kind of psychotic break, because when he announces his retirement on TV, he says he's tired of the bull... etc. and is going to kill himself on the show the following week.\n\nA top executive at the network, Diane Christensen (Faye Dunaway) notices a spike in the flagging ratings and wants Beale kept on the air. He becomes a media sensation - they're talking a 60 share, nowadays we talk 5. But then Howard tries to wreck an important merger deal with the Saudis, and the head of the conglomerate (Ned Beatty) steps in. Howard becomes a downer. The ratings slide. Something has to be done about Howard.\n\nAbsolutely fantastic, with a brilliant performance by Peter Finch,the \"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\" guy, and a marvelous one by Faye Dunaway, a superstar at that time and astonishingly beautiful. They both won Oscars, Finch posthumously. They deserved them. Holden is appropriately worn out, which he was, as a man having a post-middle aged crisis, in love with the obsessive, ambitious Diane, for whom he leaves his wife (Beatrice Straight, who also won an Oscar).\n\nEveryone is excellent, and the film doesn't have a dull moment, but the most satirical scenes have to do with an American liberation army, on the style of the group that kidnapped Patty Hearst, on whom Diane wants to base a show. Today it would be a reality show, but Diane only wants to start the show will real footage of them kidnapping, blowing up buildings, and robbing banks. These underground terrorists become total experts on distribution costs, syndication, and the like - hilarious.\n\nA true classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "Perhaps it was a poor idea, prior to watching the film, to mentally link 'Network (1976)' with Alan J. Pakula's true story of newspaper journalism, 'All the President's Men (1976).' Whereas the latter is an absorbing dissection of the go-getters behind the written media, Lumet's film would probably feel more at home alongside 'Dr. Strangelove (1964),' an intelligent satire that occasionally oversteps the line of credibility, but, because we've gone with it this far, we're quite willing to take those few extra steps. The film is a stern indictment of the unscrupulous executives behind television, and also society's own obsession with mindless entertainment. Diana Christensen and Frank Hackett may very well be miserly, immoral reptiles, but it is ultimately their viewers, us, who drive their crooked dealings. Lumet delicately places the blame on his audience; we are the \"ratings\" for which the networks hunger so fanatically, and it is the crumbling state of our own culture that fuels absurd endeavours like \"The Howard Beale Show\" {thirty years on, I think we can all agree that things have only gotten worse}.\n\nA perfect example of the film's style of satire can be found early on, after veteran news anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) learns that he is to be fired in two weeks' time, on account of poor ratings. The following evening, Beale calmly announces to millions of Americans his intentions to commit suicide on the air in a week's time. The show's technicians idly go about their duties, oblivious to what their star has just proclaimed, before one employee tentatively ventures, \"uh, did you hear what Howard just said?\" The network, in their ongoing quest for high ratings, was so blindly obsessed with perfecting all their technical aspects that the mental-derangement of their leading anchorman went almost completely unnoticed. At first, there is an attempt to yank Beale from the air, but one forward-thinking producer, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), proposes that the network could double their current ratings by keeping him in the spotlight.\n\nPeter Finch, who was awarded a posthumous Best Actor Oscar for his performance, is simply explosive as the unhinged anchorman whose volatile outbursts of derangement are celebrated by a society which, in a better world, should be trying to help him. Beale's memorable catch-cry \u0096 \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\" \u0096 symbolises his revulsion towards the crumbling values of today's society, and, as fanatical as he might be, most of his raves are worryingly close to the truth. William Holden is also excellent as Max Schumacher, Beale's long-time colleague, who resents the networks' treatment of his friend, but does little to interfere. Schumacher's adulterous relationship with the seductive but soulless Diana (Dunaway) consciously follows the conventional path of a television soap opera, ending with the realisation that his affair with the ratings-obsessed mistress is sapping him of any real emotion or humanity; in Schumacher's own words, \"after living with you for six months, I'm turning into one of your scripts.\" Television corrupts life."

        "review_detailed_main": "Much lauded (on this site) and much decorated in its time, I came to this Sidney Lumet movie with high expectations but was left a bit undersold by the time I reached the end.\n\nIt starts off with the great premise of fading TV anchorman Howard Beale's on-air suicide wish, but somehow for me didn't follow through as it could have done so that when Beale (Peter Finch) does meet his demise at the conclusion, it's done in a contrived and ludicrous way at odds with the early promise of realism and consistency.\n\nYes I know it's a satire black as night, black as coal, to paraphrase Mick Jagger, but loses a lot for me by placing sympathetic, human characters, such as Beale and William Holden's news editor character against what can only be described as self-serving monsters, consumed with megalomania, such as Faye Dunaway's programme editor uber-bitch and Robert Duvall's on-the-make interloper, keen to exploit Beale's sickness to their own ends.\n\nSome of the plot works great, particularly Beale unwittingly tapping into the Zeitgeist of mid-70's American disenchantment with his stream-of-consciousness outpourings against all things big and bigger with his celebrated \"I'm mad as hell\" diatribe, but I couldn't get into the Holden/Dunaway romance or the \"Mao Tse Tung Hour\" sub-plot where we're meant to be amused at proletarian revolutionaries rowing about TV scheduling. There's a lot of speech-making in this film and while it's true no doubt that TV people and the very rich speak a different language to the rest of us, I felt alienated by most of what I saw and heard here.\n\nI know we're meant to be all post-revisionist and see Beale's to-camera pieces in the context of latter-day reality TV vox-pops, but really the idea of televising terrorists at work and play, not to mention the mystic soothsayer anticipating news events were ridiculous devices and too divorced from reality then and seem even more so now. Okay, so satire is meant to exaggerate and distort but for me, the film falls off the rails into banality, the more so as it seeks at other points to be so contemporary and relevant that it overloads the screen with references to real-life media people, TV programmes of the day and even background news events.\n\nOf course, high-powered, word-heavy fare like this was bound to be heaven and Oscar fodder for aspiring actors and most of the principals tear into their parts with relish. For me though, only Finch and to a lesser extent Holden, (when he's not self-pityingly analysing his relationship with Dunaway), really seem natural in their parts - the rest is bluster and filibuster. Dunaway gets the the most unintentionally funny scene as she climaxes her passion with Holden only as she recounts her TV rating projections in flagrante delicto.\n\nI have to say in the end that I don't consider this one of maestro Lumet's best, it's haranguing and somewhat overblown approach leaving me cold. I was actually surprised to learn that this wasn't originally a theatre piece first but would perhaps concede that in that surrounding, the message may have come through more distilled and therefore potent than the drunken, out of control vitriol that surfaced on the big screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "With the primacy of reality programming on current primetime TV schedules and the fight for ratings even more virulent with the dismantling of the networks, the vitriol and perceptiveness of Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay for this searing satire resonates today more than ever. What gives the prophetic movie its power is how the story never veers that far from the truth, even in 1976 when the film was originally released. In fact, what may have seemed excessive back then has mostly come true, and that's the beauty of reintroducing this modern classic in a bountiful two-disc DVD package in 2006.\n\nSet in the fictitious offices of the ratings cellar-dwelling UBS network, the multi-layered story initially focuses on Howard Beale, the aging anchorman of the evening news. About to be fired and in a state of dementia, he announces on the air that he is going to commit suicide. Veteran UBS news director Max Schumacher, Beale's longtime friend and colleague, is called in to convince Beale to retract his statement. Instead, Beale goes on a rampage about the nauseating decline of American society. Ratings skyrocket, and up-and-coming programming executive Diana Christensen wants to take control of Beale's show and turn it into an outrageous infotainment show with Beale as the \"Mad Prophet of the Airwaves\". Schumacher and Christensen are at odds professionally but not before entering into a torrid affair which has him leaving his patient wife. The novelty of both the program and the affair, however, eventually wears off, and ratings plummet leading to drastic measures that the network decides to take.\n\nDirector Sidney Lumet certainly knows how to tell a virulent story that teeters precariously between reality and satire and uses Lee Richardson's appropriately stentorian voice-over as the perfect chorus. Lumet also gets superb performances out of a powerful ensemble starting with Peter Finch who captures the visceral rage and psychological decline of Beale in accurate detail. It's a showy role with little introspection shared about his elliptical character, but he makes it work for the viewer. In what turned out to be the best of his late career performances, William Holden guides the only moral conscience the network seems to have, even as he gives into the temptations of a younger woman who only lives for and through television.\n\nIdeally cast, Faye Dunaway uses her cool, collected beauty to great advantage here. What's more, with barely a hint of humanity, she pierces with the sheer venom of Christensen's unapologetically Machiavellian strategies. She has a willing partner in Frank Hackett, the ratings-hungry head of UBS, played with malevolently energetic force by Robert Duvall. In smaller roles that amount to vividly etched cameos, Ned Beatty brings out Shakepearean-level bluster as corporate bigwig Arthur Jensen preaching to Beale on the power of the almighty buck; Marlene Warfield is all anger and commercial savvy as the Angela Davis doppelganger revolutionary Laureen Hobbs; and Beatrice Straight is superb as Schumacher's betrayed wife moving from fury to resignation with aching desperation. Even though the film has the visual look of a television show, it is a true masterwork driven by Chayefsky's brilliant script.\n\nThe DVD package contains Lumet's expert commentary on the first disc. The second disc has an 85-minute, six-chapter documentary produced specifically for the DVD, \"The Making of Network\", which includes participation from among others, Lumet, Dunaway, Beatty, producer Howard Gottfried and Walter Cronkite's daughter Kathy (who had a bit part as a Patty Hearst-like character in the movie). Produced by Laurent Bouzereau, who did similar duties on the recently released DVD of David Lean's \"Ryan's Daughter\", it is chockfull of interesting information about the production and a fascinating historical perspective by Cronkite himself.\n\nIn addition, there is an odd curio, an appearance by Chayefsky on Dinah Shore's daytime talk show when the film was released. He lends intriguing insight into his screenplay, his perspective on television and what he feels the movie is all about, even though Shore and guest Steve Lawrence are intrusively banal with their interjectory comments (Shore's other guest Anne Bancroft has the good sense to keep her mouth shut when Chayefsky talks). The last piece is a career retrospective interview with Lumet on Robert Osborne's \"Private Screenings\" series on Turner Movie Classics. While Lumet's film-making career is impressive, Osborne's rather celebratory questioning really doesn't lend much insight beyond a recital of Lumet's laudatory accomplishments."

But the ratings are huge and network execs Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) will do anything to keep him on the air--despite his sanity.\n\nPaddy Chayefsky's attack on the TV industry seemed like a wild black comedy/fantasy back in 1976. Chayefskey was warning us what TV was becoming and doing to society. Over 25 years later virtually everything he shows us has actually happened--it's very scary to realize how correct he was. Also there's assured direction by Sidney Lumet (one incredible shot shows Finch raving on TV in the foreground and Duvall in the background) and an incredible cast.\n\nWilliam Holden gives one of his best performances ever--you see his pain and confusion as he tries to deal with the insanity all around him. Dunaway (won an Oscar for this) chews the scenery again and again as a network exec who will do anything for big ratings. Duvall and Ned Beatty explode (and yell a LOT) as execs. Beatrice Straight (also Oscar winning) gives a fantastic 5 minute performance as Holden's wife (she won a Best Supporting Actress for being on screen FIVE MINUTES???) . And Finch (his last role--he died before he was awarded the Oscar) goes barreling out of control beautifully.\n\nThe dialogue is great--people don't talk that way but who cares when the script is this good? Great direction, script, acting in a movie years ahead of its time. Spellbinding from start to finish. A definite must-see.\n\nTry to see it uncut (TCM--bless their hearts--shows it that way).

Beales outrage is exploitated, and his exploitation opens the door for the exploitation of Radical political groups, who in turn exploit the powers that be for all they can as well. A nice vicious circle of life as made possible by having access to millions of attention spans at once. In pre movie/tv days information and politcal movements moved slowly, and built over time. Now with Tv a political movement can be started and finished in one day.... but the long term consequences are not taken into account. What happend to the radical political group who was used? Did they or their followers go on to commit BIGGER crimes ala 911? Speculation, or just an example of life cycles that get faster and can fall into chaos even though those in power and those who lust for that power vie with each other for that power. There is a lot to digest with this movie, but some sections seem to contrived, and under developed.

I think it truly falls into a category by itself - call it \"Media\" I guess. The characters and their lives are important, but the real focus of the movie is the landscape of entertainment prospects which drive the story forward.\n\nAll the performances are great, the script is great, the pacing and direction are on target throughout.

Exerting his ornate insanity upon the entranced viewers who innocently stare at their cubic televisions, watching the news broadcast fuelled by media misrepresentation and propaganda. \"Go to your nearest window and scream\", acting as the voice of the working class, benign to the American corporate fundamentals that masquerade the politics of democracy. In an age where leading actors can represent constituencies or states, and businessmen can be presidential candidates for a nation (and successfully winning...), Lumet's timeless satire on conceptualised democracy is one that grows more appropriate with each passing decade.\n\nA statement on the American financial system, where colossal stock markets rule the supposed freedom of the people. Broadcasting networks more focussed on combating against each other for monetary viewership, leading to exaggerated fabrications, rather than reporting the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Exploiting the frail mentality of humanity to feed the greed and lust of \"humanoid\" managers, capitalising on the naivety of man.\n\nNetwork depicts the modern evolution of communicating false truths. As technology evolves, we grow more and more susceptible to the \"truth\" that is conveyed to us. We, much like sponges, absorb the information demonstrated through the porous pixels that we subject our eyes to. Televisions. And through hyperbolised satire, including planning an assassination attempt and coercing suicidal tendencies, Lumet offers a cutthroat insight into broadcasting institutions and the meticulous methods in which networks function. Motivated by stock shares and rating dominance. Pioneering the consumption of propagandist material. Lumet exploits the audacious power of televisions and its communicative abilities, turning an often comedic satire into a transcendental horror feature.\n\nPowered by sterling performances all-round, including the elusively commanding Dunaway, the maddening lunacy of Finch and the smoothly suave Holden, the poetic dialogue immediately captures the attention of its audience. Concisely elaborate with a hint of existential analysis, an ornate lexicon that refrains viewers from tuning out. Lumet's long sumptuous takes, allowing the performances to ironically hypnotise, further extend the reach of its material. Superlative direction that, whilst suddenly throws you into the immediate chaos of Beale's mentality, eases the hectic pace with its scathing power.\n\nThe offscreen affair between Dunaway and Holden was the only underdeveloped sub-plot, reinforcing her workaholic agenda that likened her to a corporate machine than to a human with emotive capabilities.\n\nAside from that, Network absolutely deserves its near-perfect acclaim. A considerably profound illustration of the American system that tantalisingly exposes the fraudulence of promised conceptualised democracy, whilst also enforcing the relinquishment of humanity through television sets. Harrowing times we live in..."

When anchorman Howard Beale's (Peter Finch in an posthumous Oscar-winning role) ratings drop, the network fires him, and he flips on air. So, the network decides to exploit this. And exploit it they do. Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway in an Oscar-winning role) is the epitome of the bitchy, business-obsessed executive woman; she talks about business even when having sex.

        "review_detailed_main": "One can't argue the fact that \"Network\" accomplished what it set out to accomplish. It's bitingly cynical from beginning to end - which is a perfect mirror image of U.S. society in the mid-1970's; a nation increasingly cynical, self-doubting and even depressed after years of a steady diet of Vietnam, Watergate, the energy crisis and recession. Little is missed - but the basic point of the movie is the emptiness of the television industry and the mindless and thoughtless generation the media was producing. As Howard Beale (Peter Finch) points out to his audience, everything they know they know from television, because only 3% of them read books and only 15% read newspapers. So the cynicism was a good match for the society in which the movie was made, and much of the philosophizing was bang-on and even prophetic. The performances - mainly from Finch, Faye Dunaway as the Vice President of Programming for the fictional UBS network and William Holden as the head of the news department were convincing in a satirical sort of way, meaning they're not to be taken too seriously except as caricatures of what they represent. I also loved the irony of the Communist Party and the left wing terrorist group being recruited to help with a new UBS \"terrorist of the week\" show and then being shown discussing the details of the contract they were signing. There's also the very relevant point of the news department being taken over by programming and being used for entertainment purposes rather than real news. (The movie is prophetic in that UBS in that sense is a bit of a forerunner to FOX News!) So a lot of this is quite good and worthwhile.\n\nSome aspects of this don't hold up quite as well, though. For example, although I found it funny (and I'm not even sure why, except that I grew up in the 70's) that \"The Howard Beale Show\" had performed the unimaginable task (for a new show) of rising to 4th in the ratings - behind only \"The Six Million Dollar Man,\" \"All In The Family\" and \"Phyllis,\" I don't know that this would register with viewers today. The power of television has declined I would say in recent years due to the growth of the internet (although the same concerns might be raised about this modern medium.) Still, one can't really criticize a 1976 movie for having aspects that don't hold up well in 2011. The movie was made for a 1976 audience, after all. Of more concern to me (which accounts for the low rating) was an over-emphasis on personal melodrama. That was perhaps also an accurate reflection of the culture of the day, but I found it distracted too much and too repeatedly from the devastating satire of the TV news industry. I also found that - as good as it was as satire - it was almost too much. Howard Beale stopped being interesting to me fairly quickly, for example.\n\nBasically, I'd characterize this as a good example of a good 1970's movie that was made for the 1970's. It still packs a punch, but it perhaps lacks the serious and in depth cultural grounding that it would have had back then."

        "review_detailed_main": "Perhaps one of the most brilliant works of satire to appear since Voltaire's Candide, this film points a damning finger at the treachery of the television industry. Faye Dunaway stars in her fabulous Oscar- winning performance as Diana, a calculating TV exec who's only concern is ratings, ratings, ratings who, without any consideration, exploits a hapless news anchor suffering from a mental breakdown. The film features a variety of other stunning performances, two of which rightfully received Oscars, as a variety of excellently painted characters. While also managing to be blackly funny, this film also shows the vastly negative effects of television on the human condition, most accurately defined in one the film's many classic lines: \"Television is not the truth! Television is a Goddamned amusement park!\" But the true brilliance of the film is the fact that in spite of the film being sternly rooted in the 70s era, it is still relevant today - perhaps even more so as corporation conglomerates continue to gobble up all that we know. But the thing to remember is: While yes it is satire and it is far more over-the-top than real life, it carries with it a striking message. It carries with it the message that television is bad, plain and simple, a fact that now more than ever we need to be reminded of. This film very well hits the mark it aims for and while it does suffer at times from being hilariously unbelievable, this too allows it to hit it's mark. In short, this is a fine film - but be careful, it may have you screaming: \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!\". My rating 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I think it goes without saying that television is everywhere, even when it's not even on. And we can also say that television is purely about ratings, who can get the highest ratings and how many will tune in? Sidney Lumet's eerily prophetic 1976 hit \"Network\" is about the lunacy of the world of television and mass-media, and those behind-the-scenes doing the programming. With top-notch performances from every big-name performer involved, things get rolling when long-time UBC anchor Howard Beale (the late Peter Finch, who received a posthumous Oscar for Best Actor) soon learns from the top brass that he is being fired due to low ratings. On his next broadcast for the network, he announces that in one week he will be committing public suicide live. Rather than have him pulled off the air, the top executives in charge decide to let him stay on the air, and his on-air rants soon become legendary and an instant ratings success. Behind-the-scenes, Beale's best friend Max Schumacher (William Holden) engages in an illicit affair with the unscrupulous program manager Diane Christianson (Best Actress Oscar-winner Faye Dunaway) who will do anything it takes to keep Beale on the air. This is a powerful, top-notch film. Prophetic doesn't even begin to describe \"Network\"; all you have to do is look at reality TV, \"Jerry Springer,\" Charlie Sheen, and God-knows-what-else to see that \"Network\" means more now than it did in 1976. This movie is scary, funny, and dangerous. Howard Beale was right: We're all humanoids, but we're not mad and we're taking some more!\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have watched this movie twice already, and I enjoyed it both times. The first time I was floored by the prescience of the movie and the overall expos\u00e9 on TV-media it does. The second time I enjoyed the less obvious stuff. The second time I enjoyed how almost every scene takes place in those Manhattan office buildings. It is cute; nowadays no-one ever shoots outside a blue-screen.\n\nIt is roundabout way to say that I appreciated the office politics a lot more this time. It is kind of funny that the whole movie's premise hinges on coincidences like one guy getting fired and the other one being in the hospital. However, broadly speaking it is also a way for it to comment on the corporatist takeover of America. Obviously it is very caricatured, as is the rest of the movie, but it does give the movie something else to play with.\n\nAll the events of the movie are set in motion by the corporate chess-game Duvall, and indirectly Dunaway, are engaged in. I think this time around my favourite scene, was Duvall's rant in tuxedo realizing his ambitions are crashing down. Duvall is the antagonist of the movie, but he is so transparent in his love for money it is hard to really hate the guy. Of course, his main motivation is to please the Jupiterian Mr.Jensen. And it is kind of fun to see that for all the power he wields, and all the decisions that affect other people's lives he takes, he himself is also subject to capricious gods.\n\nDunaway plays a far more clever character. One that is charming and ruthless. She plays almost everyone like a goddam fiddle, and it is only Max Schumacher at the end who is lucid enough to see through her. She become almost a kind of Shakesperean figure, the driven genius who is unable to connect with anyone. She is capable of tricking these men but she unable to love them. She is building an empire but she ends desperately alone.\n\nOf course, the movie treats all of this as a farce. It sets up these tragic figures to laugh at them and their short-sighted ambitions, not to pity them. The movie has also a romantic subplot, but it does not really play into the main plot. I feel it is only threre to highlight Dunaway's character and motivations. Yet it gives a bit of personality and humanity to a film that is somewhat removed from reality.\n\nIn essence, the movie's main argument is that network TV will sacrifice their News departments driven by truth committed to facts for sensationalism and entertainment. Sacrifice journalistic integrity for ratings. Of course, it is in a way what happened since the movie came out. It is equally fascinating and horrifying. The irony of course, is when the movie came out it was considered as wild satire, now it seems merely descriptive."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Network\" is directed by Sidney Lumet, who's known for making deep, moving dramas with well-written stories, but doesn't contribute much style to his direction. The film often plays out like a stage play, driven mainly by dialogue and monologues. Don't get me wrong, there is some very good, witty dialogue and monologues, including one which occurs in the scene where William Holden breaks up with Faye Dunaway, who he loves deeply, yet can't share much intimacy, because her life is trivialized by the network she has worked for so many years and caused her to become a slave to the airways. But the dialogue drags down the pace, and so does the overlength.\n\nThe acting is the best incentive to check out this slightly overrated satire. William Holden, who I haven't seen previous to this movie, delivered a fine, subtle performance. Peter Finch is of course the cream of the crop. I don't know much about Finch, so I checked out his biography before submitting this comment. It was sad to find out that he died a year after the film's release and months before he was awarded an Oscar for his performance. In the movie, he plays a hyper, overworked individual who gets so wound up he sometimes passes out from exhaustion. I thought that was just part of his character. Well, Finch gave a memorable performance in which he shouted out his trademark line \"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!!!!\" Faye Dunaway is beautiful and highly convincing in a colorful role as a TV exec who will do absolutely anything to get close to a 50 share in the Nielsen ratings. Robert Duvall is also great. It's funny to see that even thirty years ago he had hardly a shred of hair on his scalp.\n\nI would recommend \"Network,\" though not highly. I probably won't watch it on repeat viewings, it's not a very entertaining movie to watch, but it's well-written and nicely satirizes the television industry without being too overstated.\n\nMy score: 7 (out of 10)"

Time has not been kind to the film, we never had the same TV network competition here in the UK as they had in the States and now most people seem to pop in and out for news headlines and snippets on their phone rather than sit down for an evenings tele watching prompted by your favourite news programme. This is no reason why the film should not work but for me it no longer does. It seems insulting to imagine a nation cheering madly and jumping up and down at the whim of some crazy man. For he is crazy, surely, and the point being that we should not be laughing at the afflicted. But then again, we are told how wonderful the broadcasts are. Unfortunately the dialogue provided is so silly and uninspiring that we wonder how this could ever have ben taken seriously. The 'relationship' between Holden and Dunaway is a case in point. It is introduced to us as a joke and we take it as such, only to realise some way in that this jokey interlude is supposed to be taken seriously. I don't think my Blu-ray disc is very kind to the main participants either. Finch really does look like a madman, Dunaway far too twitchy and worrying and Holden, well looks his age. Shame but this does not seem to have worn too well and it is now hard to believe, even now, how well it is spoken of. I feel prompted to ask those fans; have you seen it recently?"

Who would have believed in 1976 that we'd be able to watch in the future a real life TV show where a journalist sets up a sting operation where pederasts come to visit a young teen only to get arrested by the local police . When you've got Chis Hansen confronting predators with razor sharp put downs and sardonic comments fictional satire becomes a very poor second to laugh out loud reality\n\nThat said it''s always interesting to see a film produced from \" The New Hollywood \" era of American cinema . Director Sidney Lumet had been directing films almost 20 years before he made this but he's best remembered for his 70s films like THE ANDERSON TAPES , SERPICO and DOG DAY AFTERNOON , . Interesting too that these films all contain actors who burst on to the scene during The New Hollywood era and he continues this trend by casting Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall . He also has a sharp ear for multilayerd sound editing which is something he shares in common with another director associated with New Hollywood namely Robert Altman\n\nAll in all NETWORK is by no means a bad film just one that hasn't dated well in relation to the work of the \" movie brats \" of that era TAXI DRIVER , JAWS and APOCALYPSE NOW were absolute landmark movies and still remain compelling movies within their own right . Unfortunately despite its strengths NETWORK hasn't since it chronicles its time to the detail . Does anyone remember last weeks liberation army ? No ? I rest my case"

At the end of the movie, most of the people wanted their money back. The acting was good, but the movie tanked. If this movie was so funny, why did none of the three hundred people in the audience laugh? Dark comedy either works, like Fargo, or it bombs. Network bombed."

Howard Stern, reality shows, 24, Lost, Deal or No Deal, they all owe their success to the same insanity that Howard Beale(Peter Finch)==lam basts throughout this film.\n\nTo really appreciate NETWORK, you must believe that the catch phrase from the film is real and never can be changed about the inner workings of not only broadcast television but when you listen to the insight about life, government and our country and actually ponder the reality of the dialog and how it does play today. That was 1976 after Watergate and the winding down of Vietnam...this is now after 9-11 and the war in Iraq which is dividing us up as intensely as Vietnam did then. So yes Howard Beale and those in today's ilk..\"we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it anymore...\" And when they use the term the \"Arabs\" and their involvement in the media ..it sends cold chills down your spine considering our current war in the Middle East.\n\nPerhaps NETWORK should be required watching prior to entering our voting booths in November and see the results.\n\nBut all in all, I would love a script of the entire dialog to ponder and reflect on ....Paddy did a helluva job and Faye Dunaway, William Holden and Peter Finch made it a cinematic gem not to be missed!"

Peter Finch is also stunning in this movie and defiantly must say that this is Robert Duvall's best performance. The writing by Paddy Chayefsky is very well done and wrote one of the best films about TV. I will say the directing is not that good, really the acting and the writing is the only good thing about this movie but they are so good makes this film a must see."

They send Beale out again to clarify, but instead he gives a stunning editorial rant, and the ratings go even higher. After his rage-filled cry to the viewers telling them to cry out of their windows \"I'm Mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!\" he becomes a superstar, boosting UBS into a top-rated network, inspiring it to create even more wild programs, though their only real interest is high ratings, and if they go down for any reason...\n\nWilliam Holden, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall, Beatrice Straight, and Ned Beatty are all superb, but it is Peter Finch as the \"mad prophet of our times\" Howard Beale that steals the film. Finch(in an Academy Award winning performance) is unforgettable, delivering a searing, mesmerizing performance of insanity, yet at the same time wisdom, because everything he says comes true in the film, and still holds true today, in which television hasn't only matched the craziness of 1976, but far surpassed it(Reality television of all varieties that is cheap to produce yet shameless and lowest-common-denominator trash.) Howard Beale was both a condemner of television, yet a product of it, it made him, and eventually destroyed him, and is just as relevant a symbol of it now as he was then. Thought-provoking and hilarious, this film is a timeless classic satire that has long since come true..."

There's no better way to describe it. It's the rare kind of intelligent movie with a point that also more than delivers the entertainment value. \n\nI don't think it's perfect, however. The story has two main connected threads, and I found the main one far more interesting than the side-plot/love story. I understand how the two aspects reflect each other and converge near the end to reinforce the point of the movie, but that doesn't change the fact that it gave me the feeling that Network was slightly uneven. \n\nStill, this movie is worth watching for a variety of reasons, including great performances by Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway, some excellent writing, and its commentary on television that's more relevant today than ever."

Its cinematic equivalent is Network, one of the highlights in the distinguished career of Sidney Lumet - but in this case, the target is more the relentless pursuit of ratings by the networks.\n\nWhile the focus is originally a news programme, it could have been almost anything. The original purpose of the show simply vanishes, an inconvenient detail discarded by the station, safe in the knowledge that the FCC is a toothless tiger. What brings about the change is the mental and nervous breakdown that befalls news anchorman Howard Beale - a role played to perfection by Peter Finch, for which he deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar.\n\nThe sick man is shamelessly manipulated by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall, against the wishes of William Holden, seemingly Finch's only real friend. All these give virtuoso performances - Dunaway in particular stands out for portraying a woman apparently devoid of human feelings at the office, but capable of love outside it.\n\nFor all the excellent acting - not forgetting Ned Beatty's towering monologue, for which he also received an Academy nomination - this film isn't perfect. My principal complaint is that it feels excessively long, and at times too sprawling and unfocussed for its own good. The ending also somehow doesn't ring true; while the TV execs have been portrayed as money-grubbing scum, capable of almost any excess (including giving air time to terrorists) in search of another point on the ratings, the notion that they are capable of ordering the cold-blooded murder of someone seems too far-fetched.\n\nThose points aside, this is an excellent film. Well worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well I had been waiting to see Network for a long time and it seems this one is not the astute TV satire I was longing for. Was this movie prescient? Not really, it was a clever, yet heavy, analysis of what TV was becoming. Being clever and not showing it, letting the other get the point and find himself better, that's another story altogether.\n\nI never felt involved in the story told, I could only admire some keys scenes with their sharp dialogue and strong performances but . And even in those acting award-winning scenes I was not involved: too clever, too perfect, an idealistic roll of words brought to you by the Clever Bunch, a division of the whole Network. Plus the clever choice to get a documentary look, as in All the President's Men, was from shot to shot on the verge of dumb ugliness.\n\nWhat doesn't work for me in Network? First we do not get personally and emotionally involved with one specific character or another. Howard Beale (Peter Finch) seems to be the first one we should care for before his character arc gears down to his pathetic secondary path. Then the story switches to Max Schumacher (William Holden) but does he really fight for a better network, better news or a better life? No, the grumpy old man groans and moans: he is mostly a passive character. Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) is a go-getter with no spare emotions, Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) is the corporate hatchet man and the rest are bit parts in the tapestry. To cap it all there's a sporadic neutral voice-over narrator (had too much to cut out dudes?) who seems to tell us nobody is that important in the story, only the \u00fcber clever story itself should be the focus of our attention.\n\nFaye Dinaway stands for everything the movie is: too brainy, not emotional enough, focused on what's her job and never taking the chance to change. That the message is so outspoken in Network is arguably the worst part of it, it foils the whole satire. The description of the corrupt little world of TV is so evenly crude, so continuously filthier than life there is no emotional variation in the two-hour show. No escape, no recycling: the rhythm is glued to Howard Beale's career but Howard Beale is not the main character. TV is the superhero here, and eventually TV succeeded in leveling the satire down to an unfunny noisy little show soon to be canceled. Evil wins. The clever guys were so smart as to eek out an inoffensive satire and get away with the awards. I quit."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is well documented that \"Network\" is seen as a scathing indictment to television industry. With its biting satire on American television, and a great cast on top of their game, it is a thoroughly entertaining effort by Sidney Lumet. The film would receive nine Academy Award nominations and would win four including for Best Actor for Peter Finch (Posthumously, in his final role), Best Actress for Faye Dunaway, and Best Supporting Actress for Beatrice Straight. Paddy Chayefsky, the only person to have won three Academy Awards for writing both adapted and original screenplays, would write the screenplay for Network - and would win the Best Original Screenplay for Network. I stand by my opinion, that Network is one of the best written, daring and intelligent screenplays for its time. The story centres around a television network and its eternal struggle with poor ratings. In their desperation they exploit the increasingly deranged ramblings of their anchor (Finch).\n\nLike many have said, the film is extremely prophetic, accurately predicting what will happen in the future. Network seems to foreshadow Reality TV, Social Media sensation, and the likes. While one could best describe Howard Beale (Peter Finch), as a \"mad man\", his ramblings are strangely relevant and accessible to the average person. Even though Howard is clearly under strain and is suffering from some form of mental illness - the viewer really feels sympathetic to his struggles. Diana (Faye Dunaway) plays the ambitious executive who stops at nothing to ensure ratings skyrocket, even if that means that Howards state of mind suffers.\n\n\"I'm Mad As Hell\" speech, is a speech that needs no introduction. It is one of the most iconic in cinematic history, and is as relevant today, as it was when it was first released. What makes Network such a good film, is that it possesses strong direction by Lumet, powerful acting, and an intelligent script. A cool-as-hell parable on evils of the Television industry."

Its observations are extremely prophetic; Network has aged remarkable well.\n\nThe movie may well have seemed far-fetched back in the 70s but the idea of a national TV network going to extreme lengths in order to win more viewers is one that is particularly relevant today when lowest common denominator television is the norm everywhere. And the scene where the Network chief declares that the global corporations are the new nations of the world seems quite an astounding observation considering it was made in a film 30 years old. The references to the counter-culture, however, position the film firmly in the 1970s but this is by no means a bad thing as there is something particularly exciting about films from this period; in many ways the golden age of movies where film-makers were not afraid to make edgy work in the mainstream.\n\nThe acting is truly first class. There is not a weak performance anywhere here, reflected by the number of acting Oscars garnered. As well as Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and Beatrice Straight, William Holden and Robert Duvall could easily have won Academy Awards too. In fact, it is just possible that Network has the greatest ensemble acting of any movie.\n\nIn summary, this is a film that has grown in relevance over the years. It is a fine black comedy about both how power can corrupt and how large-scale corporations are highly sinister and uncontrollable man-made beasts."

        "review_detailed_main": "Network (1976) : Brief Review -\n\nOutrageous take on Dirty and Horrible World of TV Media makes fool out of audience with Insufficient Ending. If you remember Oscar Winner flick 'Spotlight' then you know how Media or Journalism can bring a positive change in society and the other Classic flick involving TV media and Shows comes in my mind is 'A Face In The Crowd' where excessive greed of a popular TV star takes him down. I loved these two films because they had a concrete vision and firm thoughts to end the story. Spotlight brought an Important Issue and spread positive revolution message and A Face In The Crowd showed how bad you will have to pay when you try to fool audience. Unfortunately, Network failed to do both the things despite exploring dirty world of Media so outrageously. It's a story of a Media Broadcast Channel, trying every lousy thing and filthy stuff just to bring Ratings. They just don't care about people and thier sentiments, all they care is only and only High Rating. And after all at the end you see them Killing a Man because he had lousy ratings and still get away with it? I mean how? Why didn't they see any downfall? What actually happens after that horrible murder? I mean how can you kill an innocent man just because you want High Ratings? Why wasn't there any punishment? I couldn't find answers of these questions and that's why i couldn't just Like the film. Even the characters of the film are quite abnormous. The brainy dame Faye Dunaway, doesn't care about her own life and love, she only wants Rating and she is the one who actually kills the man and still get no punishment. William Holden is a man with No Morality, he leaves his wife and family after spending 25 years happily for the dame and at last he realises that he was wrong. So typical and Dumb it is. Rest characters were at least understandable but these two doesn't make any sense and yet end up having most of the screenspace. Actors are fantastic in roles though and 2 deserving Oscars trophies came for them, it's writing that made me reluctant. Screenplay goes smoothly and generates interest but spoiled by the incomplete and foolish climax. I would have loved to see the Channel and those greedy people falling down like a demolishe tower and thier debris but all they had to show was to make fool out of audience. You can't fool audience, neither in the film nor out here. Audience is smart enough to make a right choice after seeing all this pediculous politics and obscene conspiracies, aren't we? In filmmaking there is nothing much wrong, whether is it acting, dialogues, cinematography and direction but the complete and positive ending is missing badly. The outcome post climax in unclear, that's what makes those evil win the battle over us audience which is not at all appropriate for me. Overall, a good attempt but not a Great Film as it is has been decorated since release.\n\nRATING - 6/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite the critical acclaim offered to Sidney Lumets black comedy Network, I cannot say that I enjoyed this film much if at all. Perhaps the advertising slogan summed it best- 'prepare yourself for a perfectly outrageous motion picture'. Network is an absolutely preposterous, unhinged fantasy film, where this satire is based upon exaggerating real issues out of this world. I do not doubt that the films satire has a kernel of truth, and its chief criticisms remain relevant today in this populist infested, corporatist world. But It's brand of satire vulgar, unfunny, and needlessly morbid.\n\nOf course, i will not contest that the movies brand of angry populist outbursts lends itself to fine performances. I think the entr\u00e9e cast of this film is faultless, though I would like to highlight Faye Dunaways, William Holdens, and Peter Finch's performances which were all astounding. Faye Dunaway is an executive who is callous, cold, unfeeling and above all, morally bankrupt. Peter Finch plays an unhinged lunatic rambling about whatever issue crosses his mind, while William Holden plays the only real human with emotions in this film. I find the screenplay to also be deftly written, to the extent that I think the writers can genuinely act as writers for teh demoagogues today. The screenplay is incisive but cogent, conjuring up imagery which easily compels the audiences in the show to support whatever cause it's host was peddling.\n\nBut Network untimely fails because of its ludicrousness. While its commentary on fiery populism and corporate greed remains frightfully relevant today(Peter finch's character for instance is turned into a complete lunatic by the studio execs), I find its approach brass and grating. I don't think anyone wants to hear two hours of angry, meaningless shouting. An audience expects development and movement, and the story moves only languidly. Plot Development in this film is not measured by the progression events, rather by the intensity of shouting and outrageousness of rambling the shows host Howard engages in. That does not make for a particularly fun or interesting time at the theatre. In fact by the end, my eyes and ears were so assaulted by the rubbish going on in my screen that I couldn't care less whether Howard actually dies- so what if he dies in this ridiculous fantasy world? Indeed, the film loses touch with reality by being so relentless in its crusade, that it becomes bad satire. It is not funny and hence does not provide entertainment value, and neither is it incisive and grounded, which would gift it meaning. A good black comedy balances comedy and darkness in equal proportion- think In Bruges or Doctor Strangelove- they are not unhinged fantasty world where the events portrayed have almost no probability of happening.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm afraid Network is meaningless and boring, despite the sharp screenplay and outstanding performances. It is misjudged and biting off more than it can chew. I find it, like the populists it satirises nowadays, just terribly disappointing."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie for the first time in 2014 and I thought it was a great movie. 6 years later I re-watched it and my opinion hasn't changed a lot. I think that this is one of those movies that aged well. Just how far a network will go for ratings by the audience? This is the movie's principal question.\n\nHoward Beale (Peter Finch) is the anchorman of the evening news of UBS news and is slowly losing his mind. During a nervous breakdown he announces that he's going to kill himself on the air and even the soulless people at the network are upset until the ratings increase as in the next broadcast Beale uses lots of profanity. Then they are delighted when they see the horrible scene of a guy losing his hold on reality. And this sort of dumb programming results in even more stupid and pointless shows (such as one that glorifies terrorists and encourages them to film their sick actions so that everyone can see them on TV). The sickest and funniest aspect is that the terrorists were becoming Capitalists concerned with profits from the ratings.\n\nPaddy Chayefsky wrote one of the most intelligent scripts ever and not surprisingly he won the Academy Award for it. The acting is excellent from the leads: Peter Finch gives a great performance as a crazed anchorman and even won the Academy Award for Best Actor tho William Holden was the real lead. Holden is great and handsome as always and Faye Dunaway shines as the woman who falls in love with him despite having a shallow relationship (based only on looks). Robert Duvall is very good and he was probably the most entertaining character in the movie. Beatrice Straight was good too as Holden's former wife although I can't understand why she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as she only appeared for like, 5 minutes in a movie of 2 hours.\n\nApart the few gripes I wrote above I highly recommend this movie as it's like a satire of what networks can do for having always high ratings. And truly deserves its cult status as a classic from the 1970s cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "The television company, which is struggling with the ratings, is taking advantage of the nervous breakdown of the fired host and returning him to the program as a crazy messiah in order to improve the ratings and recover financially.\n\nThe film shows what is hidden on the other side of TV screens and what is at stake. Television, like the whole world, revolves around the profits of large corporations, so not only the truth, but also the bare life of an individual, are only statistics and irrelevant in relation to the profits and political games of the powerful. The screenwriter and director stated that this film is not a satire, but a realistic picture of the world of television and corporate society in general.\n\nIt was nominated for ten Oscars, of which it won four. Besides \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", this is the only movie to win three Oscars for acting, the last one with five acting nominations, and the role of Beatrice Straight is the shortest Oscar-winning role in history, with a total screen time of only five minutes.\n\nAt first, the film may seem too ordinary, unimpressive, but in the second half, the atmosphere thickens, the story and characters gain strength, and dialogues and monologues begin to hit the target mercilessly. I recommend it primarily because I think it is even more relevant today than at the time of its creation.\n\n8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "When the writer Paddy Chayefsky wrote this searing rebuke of the times, few directors wanted any part of it. However, Sidney Lumet an equally brilliant director, took the reigns, their combined effort was nothing short of inspirational. It's a fabulous story and one suited for the age of suspicion, mistrust and social revelation. An elegant and well respected, but aging News Anchorman, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is told he is to be fired and replaced, decides he will commit suicide on 'Live T.V.' His best friend of thirty years, Max Schumacher (William Holden) is bothered, but not surprised as he too is told by Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) that Schumacher's sacred News Division is to be overseen by a more profit driven department. All these changes comes at the behest of the new Corporate owner Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty) who is changing everything because he is now receiving advice from a \"Higher Power\". Taking advantage of this overall shake-up is Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) a power hungry executive who's unscrupulous nature is matched only by her insatiable sexual appetite with anyone willing to become a stepping stone for her on her climb to the top. The movie is a superb adaption of Chayefsky's novel and with it's superior cast assures its status as a modern Classic. A Terrific Movie. ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "What a powerful film!\n\nIt's also extremely cynical and may tempt you to completely give up on society because so many of the pointed commentaries on the media that you'll find in the film still apply today. Especially today!\n\nThis is the story of Howard Beale (Peter Finch), the alcoholic, depressed evening news anchor for the struggling UBS Network. He goes off script one evening and announces he's going to kill himself next week on air. This stirs up an enormous amount of crap as you may imagine, but he is allowed back on the air and as his (obvious) mental illness progresses his ratings increase.\n\nThis is a powerhouse showcase for all the actors involved, but Ned Beatty (as Arthur Jensen) blew me away. He is the epitome of corporate evil! I understand he did all his work on the film in just one day ... and that got him a well-deserved Oscar nomination. Faye Dunaway (as UBS programming director Diana Christensen) depicts a character so loathsome and devoid of -any- redeeming qualities that it must be seen to be believed. And William Holden (as former news director Max Schumacher) is the only character with any moral compass, but even he goes astray.\n\nThere's also a lot of Meta commentary and self-referential bits involving scripts that the actors are themselves playing out even as they get snarky about it!\n\nAnd there's a hysterical scene involving a business meeting with a terrorist group that has it's own TV show (thanks to Diana)!\n\nIt's darkly funny (as in pitch-black), enormously cynical, and riveting.\n\nHIGHLY Recommended!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Plot: At low-rated network UBS, newsreporter Howard Beale (Peter Finch, in an Oscar-winning role) vows to kill himself on the air. The telecast promises to draw huge numbers. However Howard does not kill himself and rants to the audience that he \"simply ran out of bullsh**\". Faye Dunaway, playing a ratings-seeking programmer decides Beale's ranting and raving could draw a great audience and decides to keep him on the air, much to the anger of William Holden, playing an old producer. Holden's objections don't matter because UBS has been taken over by a greedy corporation represented by Robert DuVall. Howard is put back on the air as the \"mad prophet of the airwaves\" and tells viewers all across America to go out to their window and shout \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!\" Soon, Howard gets his own show. But what is UBS to do when the ratings start to drop?\n\nMy Critique: Perhaps the cinema's greatest satire ever. Dunaway, Holden, and Finch give magnificent performances. DuVall and Ned Beatty are excellence as dark, cold executives.\n\nMany films such as \"Easy Rider\", \"The Graduate\", or \"West Side Story\" are called dated. Many say \"Easy Rider\" look ridiculous today. \"Network\" has done something very hard to do. Instead of growing \"dated\", \"Network\" has infact grown even more accurate. Back in the 1970's, \"Network\" could have been considered a drama with a wacky premise. What a difference two decades makes. The idea of an insane man yelling about the problems of the world on television doesn't seem shocking today. FOX already has hours of footage a week described as \"World's Wildest Police Chases\". Does a show with footage of acts of terrorism sound all too far away?\n\nMy Rating : 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "One of finest movies of the 1970s (and arguably the greatest screenplay of the decade), Network has stood the test of time, and with each passing year, the events in this movie become \"the normal.\" Certainly the concept of a rightwing-controlled corporate media, which cares more about ratings and sponsorship dollars than delivering the truth to viewers, crossed the minds of Nixon pals like Roger Ailes and Ronald Reagan, who in 1976 were still reeling from the downfall of their hero, and which to this day is blamed by a certain segment of the U. S. population as being \"part of an agenda,\" as opposed to blaming Nixon and his cronies for their own criminal wrongdoings...but I digress. Ailes and Reagan eliminated the FCC Fairness Doctrine in the final year of the Reagan Presidency in 1987, and that coupled with the Telecom Act of 1996 brought the \"news\" outlet depicted as UBS in this movie to the living rooms of every American, as part of a basic cable package.\n\nThere are so many moments in the screenplay and the movie itself that viewers interested in truth versus sensationalism in the news will nod their heads in complete agreement to. The top-level UBS execs eating their Caesar salads and plotting the then-unthinkable (disowning legitimate news in favor of more ratings-friendly sensationalism) is just one example. Robert Duvall is amazing in this movie, as a corporation loyalist brought in to UBS to wreck all kinds of havoc. Duvall later stated in interviews that he played Frank Hackett (rhymes with \"hatchet...\") as a \"vicious President Ford.\" Faye Dunaway is his equal as a woman so dominated by television that she can't even participate in a weekend fling with her married lover Max Schumacher (played by sad-eyed William Holden) without constantly jabbering about programming, ratings, corporate sponsorship, and the fall's new lineup featuring such sensationalistic soap operas like \"The Dykes.\"\n\nHolden's Schumacher represents the \"old school\" (now \"VERY old school\") side of investigative, fact-finding journalism, personified by the likes of Ed Murrow, Walter Cronkite, and the original 60 Minutes gang. And yes, there was a time when American viewers really cared about the truth and uncovering facts and exposing corporate scandals. Before corporate-controlled 60 Minutes offered such groundbreaking segments on cross dressers in Japan and the Kardashian family, the program, in its heyday of the 1970s and '80s, cut to the core of the truth and exposed corruption - and was the top show in the Nielson ratings week after week. This was before the two aforementioned items of 1987 and 1996 changed the landscape permanently. Now, cable entertainment networks claiming to be news can truly \"make or break Presidents,\" as Howard Beale himself claims during one of his rants.\n\nThere is not one subpar performance in this film. Beatrice Straight won an Oscar for an 8-minute performance--I dare anyone to watch this performance as Schumacher's suffering wife without tearing up. And Ned Beatty - much has already been said about his \"the world is a corporation\" lecture to Beale, and it gets more fitting by the year. Look for a very young Lance Henrikson in his second suit and tie Sidney Lumet film (following \"Dog Day Afternoon\") and Tim Robbins as one of the followers of the \"Great Ahmed Khan,\" a Black Panther type who collides with Howard Beale in one of the greatest film endings in Hollywood history.\n\nA must-watch."

Holden struggles, he tries to do the right thing, he grits his teeth and covers his eyes at what he sees. Holden is positively amazing.

        "review_detailed_main": "Network starts off with a bang! A controversial approach to increase ratings for a T.V. news network soon turns into addiction when the T.V. executives find out the formula to network success. However nice this may sound, it just doesn't always work with it's nagging social commentary on peoples obsession with violence, sex and profanity. What does work is the first half hour or so; so explosive in it's approach, it's just a shame that the entirety of the film can't keep up with the pace.\n\nWhilst Network is very good in some regards, it just out right fails in other aspects. The performances, even the story, stand out the most, but what fails is the repetitiveness of the films themes and the symbolism of peoples underlying obsessions. An interesting film to say the least, but doesn't pull through for this film to become fantastic."

        "review_detailed_main": "This feels like one of those \"I'm 14 and this is deep\" movies. The messages this movie tells feel mishmashed together and as a result seem disjointed. The film mentions current events such as Watergate and Vietnam war are making people more politically woke. And then the main character, Howard Beale, starts to rant about that stuff on his TV platform, saying \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\", so then everyone watching starts yelling it too. So this movie is supposed to be some commentary on how everyone is sheeple and will be persuaded by what their TV says.\n\nNow I'm not doubting that mass media can have a significant effect on the way people behave. But the way people react to the media in this film feels so unnatural that it's hard to take any of the messages seriously. So at the end of the day, it just feels like an early example of one of those memes you'd see on Facebook; the ones that say \"TV screens bad\", \"Computers bad\", \"Books good\". It's boomer humor! Even the main antagonist who's responsible for shaping the Howard Beale Show is depicted a soulless person who's worldview is framed by what she's seen on TV. A supporting character literally says this as if he has the moral high ground, despite cheating on his wife (another staple of boomer humor).\n\nOverall it just seems to be a movie that condescends the current generation because they watch TV sometimes. TV Bad and TV creates bad morals. They also try to throw in stuff about all networks being controlled by corporations; shocking isn't it? Network seems like it has a lot to say, but it's all really surface level."

The story of Network still reigns true today with networks. Everybody wants high ratings and it becomes a brutal, tortured world. Peter Finch's Oscar winning role will be his most famous and one of the last. He died before getting his Academy Award. Faye Dunaway is one of the most talented actresses around and I hear she can be a bit difficult but this role is really a good role but not one of my favorites of hers. I liked her better in Bonnie and Clyde, Chinatown, and later as Joan Crawford in Mommy Dearest. I believe the Oscar was overdue. Dunaway proves that you can be both beautiful, talented, and intelligent as she does in her roles. She always leaves a lasting impression. THe film's two hours smoothly goes by. Actress Beatrice Straight won an Oscar playing William Holden's wife. I was kind of surprised as the supporting because she is in there enough but she does give an excellent performance. With the exception of Dunaway, I believe most of the cast including Straight, Holden, and Finch are gone."

What must surely have appeared to be intellectual cynicism in 1976, today looks more like a no-brainer observation on the seeming lack of morality of the world's most influential medium. That's not to say that admirable TV programming no longer exists, but the power of Network and the brilliance of the performances by Finch and Dunaway is to show how easily the race for ratings can lead to something far more sinister than simple entertainment. Reality TV? I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore."

        "review_detailed_main": "Network was likely to have been conceived by writer Paddy Chayefsky as a cynically satirical film about corporate television companies. They so long had to carry the news departments as a loss leader.\n\nIn Network the corporation could imagine a world where news makes money. It does not have to be reporting events, facts or the truth. You just need a demagogue to tell you to be angry.\n\nNetwork ended up being prophetic. Nowadays you get rich white people on the internet, cable news and shock radio giving you all the reasons to be angry about and they get even richer. Heck they send the maid out to get their illegal drugs because they cannot be bothered!\n\nHoward Beale (Peter Finch) is not angry. He is mad because he is having a breakdown. A news anchor facing declining ratings and a personal life that led him to the booze bottle.\n\nBeale is told by his long-term friend and news boss, Max Schumacher (William Holden) that it is over. The network are firing him. Beale response is to tell the live television audience that he plans to kill himself live on television.\n\nIn a later appearance he has a rant which causes ratings to shoot up. Programming boss Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) sees potential to do a new type of television show with Beale. She even signs up a domestic terrorist organisation to front their own show such as filming their own illegal activities.\n\nCorporate Executive Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) is all for it if the news division makes money. Hackett is the ultimate bean counter.\n\nNetwork was an adult movie when it was released with frank language. People are used and discarded. Beale is only of use if he brings in the ratings.\n\nEventually his rants will affect the corporate bottom line or his ratings will decline.\n\nChristensen has an affair with the veteran Schumacher because he is a powerful old man with knowledge of the world and the news division. To Schumacher she is a beautiful young woman, a last chance to fall in love again and have fun.\n\nOver 40 years later, Network still delivers because its message is relevant. It is also so well acted. British actor Peter Finch did not live to collect his best actor Oscar. He won it posthumously. Ned Beatty almost matched him in his short cameo appearance."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!\" is the famous clip from Network, but there's actually a lot more to the movie that doesn't often get remembered. Political science students join film students by studying this movie in college courses; I should know, since I majored in both subjects. In an era that eerily foreshadows the time period we're living through now, technology is the guide to living, and those in power know that if they control the media, they control the general public. Sure, there's no internet or cell phones in the movie, but the basic concept is the same as things stand today. If you're interested, hundreds of essays have been written about the social commentary of Network, and hundreds more have been written about its endurance through the decades.\n\nIf you're not a political science student, there are parts of this movie that can be hard to watch, so even though you probably chuckle every time you see Peter Finch screaming in a soundbite during a classic movie montage at the Oscars, you should know this is a very heavy drama. The treatment of Peter's character is horrifying, and the feelings he evokes in the audience are probably responsible for his Oscar the following season. William Holden and Faye Dunaway share a pretty graphic sex scene, and while that isn't new for Faye, it feels a little embarrassing to watch a silver screen actor in a bedroom scene. Also, since Bill didn't take very good care of himself, sometimes it's sad to watch his last few movies since he doesn't look very healthy.\n\nKiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence and sex scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I know it's very controversial to actually want a classic film to be remade and, although 1976's 'Network' still holds up in today's world, the problem with social commentary is that it only applies to the time period it was written about. Now, it does feel a little dated and you could almost see the same film being rewritten with social media (for example) being the central theme, rather than a big cable news network.\n\nIn 'Network' a news anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) has, what could be described as a 'nervous breakdown' live on air and he ends up spouting off 'anti-establishment' rhetoric which went against the powers in control of the organisation. Instead of firing him (which they nearly did!) they decide to 'use' him and give him his own on-air 'soapbox' in an attempt to keep their enemies closer and, if possible, control him.\n\nThe other two central characters are played by Faye Dunaway as heartless corporate executive Diana Christensen and a slightly more torn corporate executive played by William Holden, as Max Schumacher. Dunaway is possibly far more memorable as the 'evil' one of the pair, but each have a role to play as they offer both sides of the moral aspect of their actions concerning what to do with their 'pawn' Howard Beale.\n\nThe film is pretty standard when it comes to direction. There's no real neat camera tricks used that make the film stand out and possibly the editing is the only thing that bothered me. The film is quite long and it does tend to drag in places here and there. It's a bit up and down as you get one classic scene which will stay with you forever, followed by one that doesn't really go anywhere.\n\nIf you're at all interested in the media and its recent (well, 1970s) history then you'll definitely enjoy this. There is definitely relevance here as to how one person can start trends in order to 'fight back against the powers that be' only to be corrupted completely by the very people he's trying to make a stand against. I definitely think that a modern remake may be interesting (if it was handled right) and social media would be the subject of how the masses are influenced. However, if the subject doesn't interest you then the performances should make it essential viewing for fans of good cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "When watching Network for the first time some 45+ years after its initial release, it could be easy to write off its satirical criticism of television (especially TV news) as outdated. But think about it deeper and you may realize that it only feels that way because so many of writer Paddy Chayefsky and director Sidney Lumet's proclamations have already come to pass.\n\nFor a very basic overview, Network tells the story of Howard Beale (Peter Finch), a TV news anchor told he's about to be let go. On his next broadcast, he announces he's going to kill himself the following week on live television. Though horror from network execs like Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) and Max Schumacher (William Holden) is the anticipated initial reaction, Howard's rantings draw ratings to the struggling UBS network. So, the media conglomarate makes the decision to \"double down\"--even going so far as to bring in TV drama writer Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway)--to see how far (or how long) they can exploit this newfound success.\n\nIn terms of prognosticating the rise of \"crazed talking heads\" and multi-national corporations taking over news television, Chayefsky & Lumet hit the bullseye. Here in the 2020s, the content--skewering the \"TV generation\"--may seem a little trite, but it's only because we are already on the other side of those concerns. It basically all came to pass (if of course not quite as dramatically as can be attained in a screenplay). But the foresight to make a film like this in 1976 is remarkable.\n\nAnother interesting angle to consider: if bothered by Network's focus on the medium of TV, simply swap in \"the Internet\" or \"social media\" and it works just as well. One of the true beauties of the flick is that it very much recognizes how cyclical media criticism is--one generation's end-of-civilization bogeyman is another's placid instrument and something else is on the hit list. In other words, the themes of Network's satire are far more important than the TV medium itself.\n\nIs Network a top-tier perfect film? I don't think so. It features an odd, off-putting romance between the Dunaway & Holden characters, and plot-wise it takes the \"strike out at anything/everything\" approach without always following all those threads to their logical conclusions. It also takes a solid 30-40 minutes to really settle into its social/tech satire. But when Network works, it is a truly fascinating look at media criticism in the 1970s."

It may be nearly 40 years old now, but it's brilliant dissection of the intellectually bankrupt society a lot of us choose to worship is now more potent than ever. Truly, one for the ages. 7/10"

Also, all the characters have something like a speech (That they repeat several times) saying how the world works according to them. But that is too literal, a character doesn't necessarily need a speech saying what he thinks, he can show it with her actions and the audience will understand. Maybe the plot of this movie was very original at the time but nowadays we all know the crazyness for ratings on TV. There are several much better things to watch about this subject: Black Mirror's episodes 'The Waldo Moment' (Wich is one of the worst for me) and Fifteen Millions Merits, Nightcrawler (With Jake Gyllenhaal being more crazy than Faye Dunaway's character), etc. Finally, the movie is way too long.

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a scene in REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT where Anthony Quinn (who's had his clock cleaned by the up-and-coming young heavyweight contender, Cassius Clay- a.k.a. Muhammad Ali) learns from his less-than-forthright manager (played by Jackie Gleason) that he's no longer a viable candidate for Heavyweight Champion of the World and will thereafter find gainful employment as a professional wrestler. Mickey Rooney, playing Quinn's trainer, feels that Gleason has sold their man out, has kicked him to the curb once he's outlived his usefulness. In the closing moments of the movie, we see Quinn, done up as a caricature of an American Indian, replete with headdress and tomahawk, stomping about the ring before his wrestling debut. Just the other night, I happened across a similarly sad scene: Keith Olbermann, who had spoken Truth to Power for years as a political commentator, was once again in front of the camera (after a prolonged absence)... talking sports. Television can be the most unforgiving of mediums. With Uncle $cam once again flexing his muscles prior to The Department of Offense mopping up the floor with Syria (a tune-up bout for The Big Fight to come, with Iran) and Fukushima hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of gallons of radioactive waste into the ocean (where it'll combine nicely with the oil in the Dead Zone already 50 miles in diameter, said Dead Zone courtesy of our good friends at BP), NETWORK is once again a timely film. Islam may have its prophets, but our Military Industrial Government has ITS profits- thanks in no small measure to The Networks. In NETWORK, when Faye Dunaway suggests getting a psychic to do the news, William Holden's character sensibly suggests they hire a psychic to do the weather. Like most Televangelists, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) \"hears voices.\" \"The People don't want to know the Truth,\" he learns. \"The FCC can't do anything,\" Robert Duvall says: \"We're a whorehouse network.\" Aren't they all? They preach \"high moral standards,\" while appealing in the main to the lowest common denominators. TV is the electronic equivalent of comic books. The only time it's something MORE is when it speaks Truth to Power- which it hasn't done on any of the mainstream \"news shows\" for decades. \"Money makes the world go 'round,\" Ned Beatty tells Beale: \"We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies. The world is a college of corporations inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale.\" That's the Holy Dominion of Dollars, folks. Beale: \"What's wrong with being an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?\" Ask Keith Olbermann."

Yet even though I could see its brilliance, I didn't really enjoy it that much. And forty years later, when I decided to see if I would like it better as an adult than as a teenager, the answer was, no.\n\nThe script is certainly ingenious and often brilliant. An anchorman loses his mind and gains in the ratings, so the network builds on it, creating a whole show around his prophetic ramblings. At the time the show seemed a perfect satire of the news-entertainment hybrid that was soon to take over American news, but now it's also shockingly predictive of the power of articulating blind rage, which ended up giving us a Donald Trump presidency.\n\nIt's clever as all get out, and there are some terrific performances, particularly Peter Finch as the madman and Faye Dunaway as a heartless programmer.\n\nBut there are a number of issues. First off, it's not generally funny. Now, satire doesn't really have to be funny, but what's odd is some scenes are, such as Finch's failed attempt to be less crazy in his second appearance or Dunaway's wildly emotional, date-long monologue about programming. But for the most part, I can admire its ingeniousness while not being all that entertained.\n\nIt also becomes a bit of a dramatic mess in the second half, most notably in a painfully tedious four-minute marriage-breakup scene that inexplicably stole the Oscar from Jodie Foster (in Taxi).\n\nThis is also a movie of monologues. Some make sense, like Finch's prophetic speechifying or Ned Beatty's wonderful moment as the God of commerce, but other times, as when Holden tells Dunaway what's wrong with her, the speeches are fantastically artificial and come across as more essay than conversation.\n\nIt's a brilliant, incisive script, and it's a movie well worth watching. But it's not especially entertaining."

        "review_title": "Seeing the Future: Energizing, Inspiring, Foretelling",
        "review_detailed_main": "The simplest testament to this American masterpiece is that the character of Howard Beale, played rivetingly by Peter Finch, stands out in the majority of people's recollections of the film, soaking wet in his raincoat, looking almost like a raving alcoholic at a bus stop, shouting, \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!!!\" This line has become a part of American dialect to the point where pretty much everyone has a variation of their own. What makes this such a tribute to the movie is that the character, not that he is peripheral by any means, is merely the movie's sideshow-act framework.\n\nWhat is energizing and inspiring about Paddy Chayefsky's script is how slickly it alters its tone. The drama is powerfully written and acted, but it remains up in the clouds with the scenes involving Beale's rants and the Ecumenical Liberation Army, which are gleefully exaggerated. The jargon, pace and personas among the network execs secure a very convincing, documentary realism, but we have no skepticism that the idea that a Howard Beale sort of show would be discussed at the corporate level as the film evokes. And then Chayefsky and director Sidney Lumet creep the realistic network drama over into send-up as well, but with Lumet's subtlety so that in the ultimate meeting where the execs settle on what to do about their quandary, we do not feel cheated into a silly finale because we have subliminally bought into the lunacy. In this sense, I can definitely see why this is Paul Thomas Anderson's favorite movie. All of his films, Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood in particular, have moments that could so easily be ridiculous, but the cynical tone grants them seamless shift.\n\nSeen a quarter century later, Network is like foretelling. And while it seems that I should just be saying that because oh it's such a brilliant movie and it's one of my favorites, it really infuriates me. What Network was raving about via its Peter Finch character and all its edges and points in 1976 caused a great sensation and, as I said, integrated itself into pop culture. Why are the very issues showcased the precise ones that present dire troubles today? Valuable facts or news is today not nearly as important as what makes the viewer panic, or fulfills cheap thrills. We watch and absorb that when Howard Beale, at the end of his rope by the time the film opens, begins to be completely and utterly frank on live television, indicating very alarming points about American society at large, he is a smash hit because his shock value is great for ratings. One of Chayefsky's essential understandings is that the movers and shakers don't really mind what you say on TV, provided that you don't fluctuate their earnings by saying it. Howard Beale demands public fury, he even urges viewers to turn off their TVs, but he only arouses a real reaction when he exposes the network's arrangement to sell their parent company to Arabs. Thirty years later, not a thing has changed.\n\nOpposite this extravagance is the affair between Holden and Dunaway. In what is, from what I've seen, her strongest performance, Dunaway is grippingly befitting as the---literally--- obsessed programming executive. See, the film's satire is not so much laugh-out-loud funny as it is a tongue-in-cheek approach to its subject: She moistens her lips seductively when she imagines boosted ratings, she goes to bed with Holden while chattering about how economically she can buy slots for James Bond movies. Only about three seconds after the sex begins, she has an orgasm while panting about a concept of hers called The Mao Tse Tung Hour.\n\nJust as if not more influential is Holden's performance as a newsman who was trained by Edward R. Murrow, and now sees his beloved news division destroyed by his lover. At the same time, Max is awestruck by her, and purposely has an affair. For him, it is being under the influence with the wrong side of things. I find it funny that Holden has starred in a cynical insider movie about the Hollywood studio system, Sunset Boulevard, and a cynical insider movie about the TV network system, Network.\n\nI don't know if I would have given Beatrice Straight an Oscar for her role as his wife. I mean, she basically has one five, ten-minute scene. But, from the moment she appears she has prepared a compelling rendering of a woman who has put up with an insufferable man to whom to be married for so many years that, even if she feels enraged and deluded, she has already been disillusioned to the idea that he could do what he has done. Lumet underscores the meaning of Max's decision to cheat by showing that he and his wife live in an attention- grabbingly refined residence with walls of books and elegant furniture, which goes beyond contrast to Dunaway's cheap place, which we hardly notice, save for maybe a Singin' In the Rain poster briefly. It is clear that she doesn't care where she lives, because she is restless and undemanding of affection or sensitivity. Her home is in a corner office.\n\nThe film is packed with vivid supporting characters. Not a single person is scenery. And one is obliged to mention Ned Beatty's unforgettable scene as a TV executive whose powerhouse monologue paints him as an evangelical figure, the scene punctuating with a touch of surrealism.\n\nNetwork, from which I can most definitely see where Anderson absorbed a lot of his style and approach, especially in scenes like Beatty's, is seldom considered a director's film, but actually a writer's film, which is one of the rarest things a movie can be. Yet, it is Sidney Lumet's discreet expertise that lets all the interpretation and degrees of energy to live as a part of each other, as one within the same film."

Other top performances are by William Holden and Faye Dunaway, the former as a friend and collegue to Howard Beale and the latter as a soulless TV-business puppet. The plot felt dynamic and unpredictable and I loved how everything wrapped up in the final act.\n\nDefinitely a movie I'd recommend to anyone.\n\n8+/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hollywood and the television industry have long had a love-hate relationship. In the early days of television cinema bosses feared the new medium as a threat to their income, but today the relationship is a much more symbiotic one, with film studios and television networks being owned by the same conglomerates and movies forming a major part of TV schedules. Nevertheless, this close relationship has never prevented the cinema from aiming some sharp satirical barbs at the television industry; examples include \"The Running Man\" from the eighties and Peter Weir's brilliant \"The Truman Show\" from the nineties. \"Network\" is an earlier example of the same phenomenon.\n\nThe film is about a fourth major television network, Union Broadcasting System (UBS), a fictional rival for ABC, NBC and CBS. The network is struggling with poor ratings and makes the decision to fire Howard Beale, the long-serving anchorman of its evening news programme. Beale reacts badly to this decision, suffers a nervous breakdown and threatens to commit suicide live on air. Beale's old friend Max Schumacher, President of the News Division, allows him one last appearance, but instead of the dignified apology for his suicide threat which Schumacher was hoping for, Beale launches into another outburst claiming that life is \"bullshit\". The ratings soar and the management of UBS decide to exploit Beale's antics, billing him as a \"mad prophet\".\n\nThe film missed out on the \"Best Picture\" Oscar for 1976, losing to \"Rocky\", but equalled the record of A Streetcar Named Desire by winning three of the four acting awards. (Scriptwriter Paddy Chayefsky won a fourth Oscar). Beatrice Straight may have been a bit surprised to win \"Best Supporting Actress\" for a brief cameo role, but there can have been little surprise about \"Best Actor\" for Peter Finch and \"Best Actress\" for Faye Dunaway. Finch died before the ceremony, making him the first posthumous winner of an award. (The only other posthumous winner has been Heath Ledger, coincidentally also an Australian). In what was to be his last film, Finch gives an absolutely spellbinding performance, playing Beale as a man who is on the verge of madness and yet who has a certain integrity and clarity of vision which the other, saner, characters lack.\n\nDunaway plays Diana Christensen, UBS's Head of Programming. Whereas Beale is a mad visionary, Diana is sane but totally lacking in vision, except perhaps where profit is concerned. She is mercenary, ruthless and utterly cynical, prepared to do anything that will boost the network's ratings. Apart from her exploitation of Beale, her major project is a series entitled \"The Mao Tse-Tung Hour\" featuring a violent gang of urban terrorists named the \"Ecumenical Liberation Army\", clearly modelled on the real-life Symbionese Liberation Army.\n\n\"Network\" could, in fact, have won all four acting Academy Awards, and probably would have done so had William Holden, who plays Schumacher and gives another excellent performance, been nominated for \"Best Supporting Actor\". I think, however, that it was right that Holden had to battle it out with Finch for \"Best Actor\", as the role of Schumacher is as important as that of Beale. (Indeed, of the two actors it was Holden who received top billing). Schumacher is the one senior UBS executive who realises that there are more important matters in life than television ratings and is horrified by the way in which his friend, who really needs psychiatric help, is being exploited by the network. Nevertheless, Schumacher's integrity is undermined by the fact that he has left his wife to pursue an affair with Christensen, physically attractive but in all moral and emotional matters his complete opposite. Another very good acting performance comes from Robert Duvall as Christensen's equally ruthless boss Frank Hackett.\n\nThe film came out at a bleak period in American history. The country had just extricated itself from a bloody, unnecessary and humiliating war in Vietnam. President Nixon had been forced to resign in disgrace over Watergate, and his replacement Gerald Ford seemed a dull, uninspiring figure. The economy was going into recession. Although 1976 marked the country's Bicentennial celebrations, many Americans felt that they had little to celebrate. The black comedy of \"Network\" fitted in well with this mood of national disillusionment; Beale's catchphrase \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\" summed up how many people were feeling.\n\nThe film sees the state of American television as reflecting the state of American society. A key scene comes when the disillusioned Schumacher finally decides to leave Christensen and return to his wife \"You are television incarnate, Diana,\" he tells her, \"indifferent to suffering, insensitive to joy. All of life is reduced to the common rubble of banality.\" In 2010, when the media have become even more relentlessly trivial than they were in 1976, those words seem as prophetic as any of Howard Beale's ranting.\n\n\"Network\" is a more effective satire on television than \"The Running Man\", which suffers from falling into the trap of becoming what it is satirising and also from the casting of the wooden Arnold Schwarzenegger in the main role. I would not rate it quite as highly as \"The Truman Show\", which is very different in tone, being more philosophical and having an upbeat ending whereas that of \"Network\" is very bleak. Nevertheless, this must rank as one of the finest American films of the seventies. Chayefsky's script is sharp, witty and highly intelligent, forcing us (even more than thirty years after the film was made) to take a long, hard look at where our culture and our society are heading. Apart from Kubrick's \"Dr Strangelove\" this is perhaps the best black comedy to have come out of Hollywood. 9/10"

Apart from the technologies, the themes of the film are still relevant.\n\nSidney Lumet, and Paddy Chayefsky, his scriptwriter, show us the multiple problems of the American television of the seventies, but still current: how to make ratings, how to manage shareholders who only think of gain, how to explain and present anything to make ratings (with here the depressive and suicidal state of a host who is exploited, or also to go until murders). Everything that is presented in the film remains true today for television, but also for social networks that have now become the main source of information and disinformation.\n\nThe narration mixes in a brilliant way the relationships of couples and their intimacies (Faye Dunaway and William Holden, William Holden and his wife) to the economic history of the TV channel with the role of shareholders, then the role of shareholders from outside here Saudi Arabia, the problem of programming and presenting anything to attract the viewer. They are ready to establish a relationship with a terrorist group to create ratings, or even to have a presenter killed on live television to create a sensation, and all this with a seriousness and a brilliant reflection.\n\nThe cast includes Peter Finch, who is very good as a preacher who harangues the crowds in a desperate mode; Faye Dunaway, whose only concern is to increase the ratings, even if it costs her personal life and if it means killing people. Robert Duvall is also great as a boss who is only concerned about his shareholders. Ned Betty is very good in the scene where he meets the star presenter Peter Finch and shows that he is capable of being even more crazy than the presenter.\n\nThe relationship between Faye Dunaway and William Holden is well written.\n\nGreat art. Sidney Lumet must have had a blast putting a gem of a script like this on film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Few Hollywood productions have been as utterly prescient as director Sidney Lumet's cinematic masterpiece \"Network\" (1976), a chillingly serious satire about the television business in the 1970s and where it was ultimately headed in years to come. Written by TV pioneer Paddy Chayefsky, this winner of four Oscars on 10 total nominations provides a comical but cynically disturbing look inside the workings of a fictitious American television network. In telling this story, the film eerily forecast the direction this medium would take in the decades that followed with remarkable accuracy, stunningly predicting such developments as the tabloidization of TV, the consolidation of media ownership, the impact of foreign influence and investment, and the dumbing down, sensationalism and line-blurring of its content in both its entertainment and journalistic programming. It also nailed developments outside the television business with great clarity by focusing on the pivotal role that TV played (and would come to play) in those occurrences. And, even though it's something of a nostalgic time capsule of the period in which it was filmed, the picture has held up remarkably well, even unwittingly providing viewers with an ironic and unsettling metaphor for the ubiquitous rise of social media (with TV serving as a stunningly fitting stand-in). Chayefsky's Academy Award-winning script is positively brilliant, epitomizing what good screenwriting can (and should) be. And its casting is about as good as it gets, earning Oscars for the performances of Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight, along with well-deserved nominations for William Holden and Ned Beatty and noteworthy accolades for Robert Duvall and Marlene Warfield. In fact, I'm stunned that this offering lost out to \"Rocky\" for best picture and that nominee Lumet was passed over for the best director award. Those oversights aside, however, I was nevertheless privileged to view this offering at a retrospective screening in honor of the filmmaker's 100th birthday to a nearly sold-out audience. I'm pleased to see that this celluloid gem still garners so much viewer attention nearly 50 years after its release and that it's attracting the interest of moviegoers of all ages. This is an absolute must-see for avid cinephiles, as well as highly recommended viewing for anyone who truly wants a poignant, insightful look at what's truly going on in the world around them, particularly when it comes to the workings of said world and the selective filtering of information about it. \"Network\" just might deservedly open a few eyes - and raise quite a few eyebrows at the same time."

He is done with society generating sheep who follow TV as their gospel, and people being fuelled by money. He isn't exactly enlightened, but is so finished with society that he has become this charismatic force not to be reckoned with.\n\nI think this film is especially relevant today, as we are dealing with issues even more fatal to humanity that are being decided by capitalism, like global warming and a lot of political issues.\n\nI think this is just about, pretty much a film. The reason for this is because it has a clear message and something to say about society, but it is in many ways a movie because it is quite formulaic like a traditional Hollywood product film. The cinematography isn't exactly stylish, and doesn't hold any difference to any other Hollywood film. It is also quite boring and not gripping at many points in the film, which suggests it isn't exactly filled with inspiration.\n\nI gave this film a 6 out of 10 because of those reasons mostly, and also because a lot of the acting was also stale and boring, with the best actors being Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Network is about a retiring, troubled yet deranged news reporter (Peter Finch) becoming sick with the artificiality of showbiz and at the same time losing his sanity. Yet his trusted colleagues at his network don't see this as an area of concern, but rather a business opportunity. The producers exploit this reporter's state of mind to give him his own show in which he furiously preaches the flaws of society, promoting his viewers to shout of their window, 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not guna take it!'. However, the show's ratings start to falter and the network need to find some way of bringing down the show, no matter how extreme...\n\nNetwork reveals a shocking reality that the television business (or rather the media overall) is evil, partial and false. The peek of satire in the film is Faye Dunaway's character, Diana Christensen. She claims to be inept at everything except her work, she is engrossed in the falseness of the media which influences her own life in which she compares affairs with Vronsky and Anna in 'Anna Karenina' and sees mundane situations as a script.\n\nFinch's performance as Howard Beale was powerful and boundlessly brilliant. He acts as the messenger of truth in the film, a beacon of light in this dark abyss of lies and hypocrisy. His character is worn down by the difficulties of life driving him to derangement and shocking insanity. Finch deserved his Oscar without a doubt.\n\nNetwork is a bold satire of the false nature of the media whilst acting as a truly enlightening experience that is hugely ahead of its time.\n\n8.5/10"

I never thought about blocking of actors until I saw this movie. The story and message are amazing... but so is the blocking! They find really interesting ways of moving actors to new positions in the middle of conversations just to mix things up, change the power play in the scene. Masterfully done really! Cinematography compositions are beautiful... If you have a big TV, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND WATCH IT BIG!! The monologues dished out over the airwaves are prophetic, angry, hilarious, and true. I recommend showing this movie too all kids now to help them see that they shouldn't just believe anything \"the tube\" tell them."

In such a dangerous environment, the money and success and rating of audience are the most important things, people will begin to go crazy. It was not one of the film I liked the most, simply because it was very slow and it didn't touch me that much emotionally, except for the end. I believe that this movie is still relevant because it talks about a very modern problem, where technology and television are becoming the most influent and important things. Unlike films today, it portrays the message in such an uninteresting way with everything being said through dialogue and not told visually. There are many other ways a film can tell its message and story than just talking about it through the characters monologue/ dialogue. Beale was not prophetic or interesting in what he was saying, he was simply just a lost man who didn't know himself, is what it seemed like. I also didn't connect to him as a person or protagonists, as his motivation were not clear or explained well."

        "review_detailed_main": "My review is #240 of 240, so I'm not exactly expecting it to be seen by very much of anyone... and that may be a good thing.\n\nLike most of the other reviewers, I get the forecasting of future TV programming, pandering to the lowest common denominator, etc., even though the early days of cable showed us that the entertainment- and information-driven imperative was still alive in the decade that followed. In the end, of course, the marketing- and profit-driven imperatives won out on most cable channels, as well. Save for AMC, TCM and a very few others, pandering continues to be profitable, and if a network is publicly owned. (Okay; so much for the high cost of capitalism.)\n\nI'm less interested in that than in calling attention to the specific information Chayefsky chose to impart from the lips of his two principle truth-tellers: Peter Finch's Howard Beale and Ned Beatty's Arthur Jensen. The viewer who listens carefully -- and, okay, from an informed perspective -- will hear some of the most accurate \"realpolitik\" ever in a widely distributed, \"major\" motion picture.\n\nBeale's existential angst sounds like his muse was some well-grounded combination of Friedrich Nietzsche and Noam Chomsky on a good day. Jensen's stunning, five-minute disquisition on international corporatism was similarly rooted in accurate and current reality.\n\nFolks given to reading authors like Sartre, Camus, Tillich and Heidegger will hear their views spewing from the lips of the newscaster gone (ostensibly) over the dam. Folks given to reading authors like P. D. Scott, Al Gore, Warren Hinckle, William Turner and Alfred McCoy will hear them in the spellbinding chairman of the board.\n\nBeyond that, the subplot about the network's parent company being in jeopardy of being taken over by the Saudi's who've been keeping the outfit afloat is the stuff of all manner of offshore turkey buzzards coming to roost in early '91 and just about ever since.\n\nChayefsky knocked out a number of interesting scripts, including those for \"Altered States,\" \"The Hospital\" (with George C. Scott) and \"Marty\" (Ernie Borgnine's career-maker), but this would be almost anyone's tour de force. It's right there in a pigeonhole close to \"Dr. Strangelove,\" \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"The Gangs of New York\" for surreal renditions of discomfiting, social reality."

        "review_title": "Brilliant and prescient",
        "review_detailed_main": "Look at the cesspool that is modern television. Who could have ever foreseen this? Screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky and director Sidney Lumet could. Way back in 1976 they produced a film which in addition to being a simply brilliant satire also served as a preview of our modern media world. Anything goes in the quest for an extra point or two in the ratings. You watch Network and you think maybe Chayefsky and Lumet pushed it a little too far, that by film's end they had gone past the point of believability. But did they really? Would what was so shocking in 1976 really be shocking at all today? Can anything really shock us anymore? Something to think about when watching the film. Or, if you don't really want to think about things like that, you can just sit back and enjoy the film. If all you want are laughs Network works on that level too. It really is a near-perfect combination of humor and smarts. Network gives you your laughs. But it gives you a brilliant story too.\n\nSo Howard Beale is mad as hell and he's not going to take this anymore. That's what everybody seems to remember most about Network. Understandable as the character is so memorable and the performance from Peter Finch so unquestionably superb. But this film has so much more to offer. Just look at the cast list. William Holden, Robert Duvall, Faye Dunaway, Ned Beatty. Magnificent performances from all of them and solid support from a host of others as well. Heck, the acting in this film is so good Beatrice Straight got an Oscar for about five minutes of work. Terrific actors working from a marvelous Chayefsky script, all guided by the eminently capable hands of Lumet. Put all that together and it is no wonder Network turned out so wonderfully.\n\nAt its beginning the film appears to be about Howard Beale, the old news anchor about to be fired who rather than go quietly into the night announces his plans to kill himself on-air. This proves to be quite the ratings boost so Beale is kept on the air. The further he goes down the path to madness the bigger a hit this mad prophet of the airwaves becomes. Thrilled about this is programming executive Diana Christensen, a woman laser-focused on her career and the quest for better ratings for the network. To her Howard Beale is a godsend. Howard's old friend, news division head Max Schumacher, on the other hand considers this obvious exploitation of a clearly insane man to be a tragedy. The professional conflict between Diana and Max leads to a personal relationship between the two. But is the emotionless, soulless Diana even capable of being in a relationship? Some of the movie's best moments come in the push and pull between Diana and Max, played perfectly by Dunaway and Holden. The higher-ups at the network, personified most clearly by Duvall's Frank Hackett, make it clear whose side they're on in the Diana-Max kerfuffle over Howard. Money talks and Howard Beale is making them money. This network will do anything for money. Absolutely anything to protect the bottom line. Including getting in bed with terrorists...which may prove useful later.\n\nThere's a sense the film goes off the rails a bit towards the end but if it does it does so willfully and gleefully. Chayefsky and Lumet had a statement they wanted to make and boy does that statement still hit home all these years later. What a story, what performances. Genuine laughs and genuine heart. Everything works. Finch, Holden, Dunaway and Duvall are the four big stars with the meatiest parts and they're all fabulous. But you can't discount the smaller performances either, Straight earning that Oscar with such raw emotion as Max's aggrieved wife. And Beatty with one of the all-time great movie speeches which isn't even the greatest speech in this film thanks to Finch's mad as hell moment. Network has, in Howard Beale, one of film's all-time great characters. But the film has so much other great stuff going on that Howard becomes almost a sideshow. It's a film which is brimming with excellence. Quite brilliantly done."

Some of my favorite recollections are the performance of Robert Duvall, and the scene where Faye Dunaway has an orgasm over a 30 rating. There are many more that can't be fit here.

And as unreasonable and unrealistic as it seemed at the time... nowadays, it is frighteningly reminiscent of modern television. William Holden gives an incredible performance as a producer who sees to what ludicrous extents the network has gone, but is unable to stop it. Frankly, mainstream society's willingness to swallow the sensationalism the network feeds them is more powerful than anything he can do. And therefore, he must sit back and watch it happen. Peter Finch gives an excitable performance as well as an anchorman who has been driven to a mental breakdown, and then becomes the voice of the masses. Faye Dunaway, usually a terribly stagey and unrealistic actress, actually tags her role for once, for which I give credit most to the screenwriter for fleshing out such a solid female character (not always so available). Robert Duvall is strong in his role as a power-hungry executive. And Ned Beatty, proving that he is capable of magnificent acting, received an Oscar nomination simply upon one perfectly scripted and perfectly delivered monologue. In fact, when you break the script down, you find that for the most part, this film is just a series of precise, fine-tuned monologues. And there is nothing wrong with that. No other movie since has come close to hitting upon the subject of media frenzy, America's obsession of television and mass-market sensationalism quite so well as this film did."

It's got an intelligent and quite literate script that the actors clearly relish. And the cast is truly something special, in this story of USB, a failing network that decides to exploit the anguish of its news anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch), who's just been fired. Beale has taken to venting whatever ideas are on his mind, and they think that this is the key to solving their ratings woes. In fact, they go on to do a very damn impressive job of perverting serious journalism with their wacky, cutting edge ideas (they even work hand in hand with a group of revolutionaries who will supply the network with footage of their deeds).\n\nNowadays, of course, the thought of a TV network airing just about anything in order to get attention is not far-fetched at all: it's commonplace. Just consider the scores of lame brained reality shows that have proliferated. So this is one of those interesting films that turned out to be more than a little prophetic. It deals with the whole issue of the \"television generation\", and those people whose lives revolve around the boob tube, whether they work in the industry or not. And now we have an \"Internet generation\", with youngsters obtaining their information online, so the basic themes of this classic film still resonate strongly.\n\nAn incredible lineup of actors does well with their meaty roles: William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall, Peter Finch, Wesley Addy, Ned Beatty, William Prince, Lane Smith, Beatrice Straight, Marlene Warfield. Finch, who received a posthumous Oscar, is the one we're all likely to remember the most after watching this, but given that some of them like Straight and Beatty only have one big scene, it just goes to prove that adage that \"there are no small parts, only small actors\". Dunaway and Straight also won Oscars for their work. Be sure to watch for Lance Henriksen and Michael Tucker in uncredited bits.\n\nLumets' matter of fact style is perfect, and it's clear that he absolutely trusts the material. It's the kind of film in which you may not always notice or appreciate the more technical aspects because the story is so good. Holden and Dunaway shine when their characters embark on a relationship; he's initially attracted to her and interested by her but eventually comes to worry that she's wrapped up so much in her work that she lacks a soul or much of a heart. They just play this subplot beautifully.\n\nWhile the 1970s weren't exactly lacking in terms of great films, \"Network\" stands tall for this viewer as one of the best of the decade.\n\n10 out of 10."

The wonderful cast rise to challenge of their superbly written roles, led by Faye Dunaway, incarnating an emotionally-stunted ratings-chaser; William Holden, in his last great role, as a compromised news exec; Robert Duvall as a ruthless corporation man; and best of all, relishing his long diatribes against the system and delivering them with all the passion at his command, the great Peter Finch, in his last-ever role - what a way to go!\n\nThese days we may have to pinch ourselves to remember that American cinema could hit as hard as this.

That \"Rocky\" beat \"Network\" in the Oscar best-picture race is no surprise: Hollywood has always preferred illusion to cold reality.\n\n\"Network\" is a stinging reminder that scintillating dialogue and first-class acting are still the hallmarks of great cinema. Chayefsky's script is searing in its contempt for the dead weights in the entertainment industry that drag everything down to their own, dead level, a reproach that is more relevant than ever in 2002. In any case, brilliant performances by Holden, Finch, Dunaway, Beatrice Straight, Robert Duval, and Ned Beatty make this film a joy."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!\"\n\nI have always wondered where the bold declaration, which has become a cultural phenomenon, came from. This week I got the answer and I can't understand why it took me this long to discover this absolute gem!\n\nNetwork is an amazing blast to watch. It is a crazy satire, an outrageous farce, and it is of Messianic proportion. The screenplay is masterclass and I can't remember the last time I watch something and be awed by so many bombastic words I have never known, words like 'Ecumenical' and 'cocksmanship'. Throwing big words and high concept around can easily make a film alienating faster than a speeding bullet, but it never once reaches that level. It is blisteringly intelligent and skewers the television industry and the sucker audience mentality with finesse and dark comedy. I just love how the movie shifts gears like a well-oiled machine. Most films identified with a single main narrative thread but this one moves around so many with a blink of an eye and every narrative thread shines. The cast is just stellar and the acid quotable lines spewed out with such intoxicating venom. The movie is not perfect but this is a perfect demo of how to make a perfect imperfect movie - not every thread needs a closure when everything else is done so well. The last scene is such a shocker that I couldn't believe it, but the dialogue is so stirringly chilling that I took it all in and nothing beats Faye Dunaway anchoring it to send it home. Masterpiece!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Many people are dissatisfied with the news media, claiming either that it parrots the prevailing neo-liberal positions on key issues of national importance, or, for some more conservative citizens, that the media is hostile to conservatives and that it is fundamentally impossible for conservative ideas to be considered fairly within the non-FOX news landscape. Not many movies have seriously considered the role of the media and the dynamics between the media and society and the relationship each has on the other.\n\n\"Network\" shows that even 35 years ago, some of the key concerns people have about the media today resonated. Perhaps more serious critics have stronger concerns than the stronger critics 35 years ago, but the fundamental concern that the media might be abused by those wishing not to inform the public, but by those wishing to blanket the media landscape in meaningless, self-aggrandizing messages, to brainwash the masses in 24-7 soft news has obviously been a concern for some time.\n\n\"Bulworth\" was a compelling movie in that it depicted a public figure who felt he had nothing to lose and so he felt free to expose the hypocrisy and incestuous nature of the relationship between the media and politicians. Warren Beatty's senator in that movie had the bully pulpit necessary to demand the attention of the media and even when it became clear he was not thinking in terms which conventional media and political figures might be comfortable with, his truth-telling was so searing, so self-evidently honest, and so funny, that it was the sort of comment that the media wanted to cover anyway.\n\n\"Network\" addresses the dearth of truth-telling in the media, the hunger by execs and suits for empty spectacle as opposed to substantive informing, and once again, the person who speaks the truth about the falsehoods which typify media programming might be considered not completely mentally balanced.\n\nIt is the sort of dark comedy about the media that one does not see very often. In the film, an aging network anchor-Howard Beale (played with an intoxicating blend of clarity and lunacy in the sort of dream role many actors must wait years-if they ever get the chance-by Peter Finch) is fired by craven network executives Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall as the most villainous of network execs) and Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway in a stupendously well-deserved Oscar turn as a woman who is more \"alpha male\" than many network exec alpha males). However, shortly after receiving the news, Beale says, live on the air, that he will kill himself on the news a week from that day. The executives are at first of course apoplectic at Beale's seeming insanity, but when they see the audience reaction to his madness, they consider how they might capitalize on it.\n\nBeale becomes a hit, speaking about the possibilities of self-actualization and happiness, but when his star fades, as all do, network execs are no more sympathetic than they would be for anyone else whose show has become less popular. In the meantime, long-time news division head Max Schumacher (William Holden playing, with a great deal of heart, a sympathetic but concerned (which is to say a true) friend of Beale's) is the conscience of the film, torn between allowing his friend to make the most of his opportunity to speak some truth on the network news, but increasingly worried about the extent to which he is simply another pawn in the game network executives play with programming.\n\nThe script for the film is one of the most subversive, darkly amusing ones which has ever made comment on the media and Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar for original script is fully deserved. Sidney Lumet's direction is exemplary and the comment on the vacuity of television and its deleterious effect on society was true in 1976 and has become even truer in the intervening years. Again, the acting-most especially by Finch, Dunaway, Holden, and in smaller parts by Marlene Warfield as a black Communist revolutionary who is hilariously well-aware of how much money she is entitled to, Bill Burrows as the perpetually shocked TV director of Beale's show is of the first order, and the script combined with such stellar acting is what makes this film such a powerful, acidic commentary on the narcoleptic power of TV."

        "review_title": "A film about dark side of the media and consumerism anchored by dynamite performances",
        "review_detailed_main": "During parts of \"Network,\" you have to wonder if it's a joke. The exploitation of a lunatic news anchor/prophet for financial gain with society just buying right in? Nuts. \"Network\" can definitely be viewed as an extreme and an unlikelihood, but that's not to negate its powerful message and frightening ideas about media, consumerism and society in general.\n\nHoward Beale, played by Peter Finch, the first posthumous Best Actor winner in Oscar history, (which adds an all-too-freaky layer to the film's effectiveness), is about to retire from reading the news after ratings have bombed and he's become disenchanted with the industry. On air, he promptly announces he will, in a week's time, blow his brains out on the 7 o'clock news. What first becomes a PR nightmare for Beale's station, UBS, evolves into a godsend when Beale goes on the air to apologize but delivers an impassioned speech rousing Americans out of their funk with his war cry: \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!\"\n\nThe dominoes begin to fall for various minds behind the network as a result of Beale's sudden fame. The first is Diana (Faye Dunaway), a tough-as-nails producer from the programming side who crosses over into news with ideas of sensationalizing it. She creates \"The Howard Beale Show\" to capitalize on the media spotlight on Beale and seizes success on his coattails. Dunaway creates in many ways a terrifying portrait of a woman who seems part robot in that she's only emotional when it comes to her singular purpose of making high-rating television. Her love affair with William Holden's middle-aged Max Schumacher, a casualty of the network's new direction, serves as allegory for old and new generations of media. Not exactly a believable relationship, but a fitting metaphor. A famous actor from Hollywood's golden years, Holden fits in his role perfectly. He paints Max as a pitiable lost soul.\n\nOther personalities include Robert Duvall as Frank, the in-between for UBS and the media company that owns them and Ned Beatty as Jensen, the man upstairs. Interestingly, \"Network\" has nothing to do with the journalism side of a newsroom but the business side. Paddy Chayefsky's powerful script at its most fundamental level shows the dark side of the media, the business side, the side with a flagrant disregard for the ideals of journalism.\n\nWith a lot of dialogue, \"Network\" could not have been in better hands than those of Sidney Lumet. Lumet gets the most from his actors and adds an extra power to the many speeches throughout the film. Beatrice Straight barely appears in the film yet steals a scene in the middle. She plays Max's wife, who goes off on him when he says he loves Diana. It's a riveting scene with brilliant writing, but does Straight win Best Supporting Actress without the help of Lumet? \"Network\" contains a great deal of screaming and shouting yet little of it comes across as \"noise\" because he handles it so delicately.\n\nThe ensemble really carries \"Network\" on its bizarre ride. The likelihood of a news anchor going on TV and successfully convincing Americans to open their windows and shout that they're \"mad as hell\" seems implausible, but the media has changed so much since 1976, more so than the changes the film depicts from the \"good old years\" of broadcast news up until that point. News anchors were the final word back then, but with the Internet, news and information can be found by the consumer. A sequel or maybe more like a follow-up to this film could be even more harrowing.\n\nChayefsky's knock-out script suffers a tad from pacing, but few films are so packed with ideas worthy of day-long discussions on end. There's so much to think about between the various relationships between the characters and what's at stake for each of them and how blown out of proportion everything is. One of the many scenes that puts it all in perspective is during contract negotiations for a show Diana has put together that would follow a Communist liberation group on its terrorist escapades. There's a huge argument between members of the group amidst the network employees and so the leader fires his gun to get them back on task to talk about subsidiary rights. It shows how ridiculous the whole show has become as everyone wants a piece.\n\n\"Network\" serves as a cautionary tale on numerous levels. It starts as simple as news programming and grows as large as big business' control on the world and its governments. Lying beneath the surface for all of it, however, lurks what can happen when personal interests guide important decision-making as it effects what the general public will see. Major media does not have as much control on what the public sees and hears as it used to because there are more outlets for obtaining the news, but the economic troubles of news media in our time has not made it any less dependent on selfish corporate interest.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"

Protests against testing nuclear weapons; 4. Protests about a crooked President; 5. Protests about environmental destruction. This show is also a protest, not about any particular thing, but about the bringer of ill tidings: TV. It implicitly longs for a simpler time when we could just plow a field, toss down a few seeds, and spend our evenings reading verses from the family Bible by our kerosene lamp. This movie, like all melodrama, requires a villain. Is it the bellowing network chairman (Ned Beatty), the cold-hearted chief (Robert Duvall), or the ambitious female programmer (Faye Dunaway), adept at sex but incapable of true love? We can count on the hero (William Holden) to point the finger at the guilty party before the utterly preposterous conclusion. The WGA decided that this was the tenth greatest screenplay in the history of cinema, which tells all we need to know about the WGA and the people writing for big bucks in Tinseltown. The AFI decided that this was 64th among the 100 greatest American films, which tells us all we need to know about the AFI and movie experts in general. This picture is famous for it's shout from the demented newscaster (Peter Finch): \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!\" Mad about what? TV is the big enemy of movie theatres; an informed electorate is the big enemy of the ruling elites. This film serves our Hollywood betters by condemning both at once."

Exceptional casting, great acting, spot on directing, and one of the best scripts ever written. Twenty minutes in we understand that this is a different sort of film, one that has really never been made before. It lays bare the truths of what we all know, but refuse to face. It illustrates how corporations, and governments which are run by corporations, are stripping away our freedoms and peace of mind in exchange for........what?\n\nThat's the question we ask ourselves when watching this film. What exactly are we getting in return? Momentary escape from our reality? That's really all I can think of.\n\nThis is the most subversive and revolutionary film to ever come out of Hollywood. Subversive to the power structure of government, to corporations, and especially to the powers that USED to be in Hollywood. The new Hollywood regime would never allow a film like this to be made today, and if someone did make it, it would be killed in distribution to the corporate owned movie theaters.\n\nThere has never been a film quite like Network, and it can't ever be followed up w/ a sequel because everything is exposed w/ razor sharp clarity."

A quarter century later, in this post September 11 world, we can look back with a little perspective. What happened that day which changed the world forever, was also the highest rated television show ever. The evil ones knew that and planned their attack accordingly. No one should call Chayefsky a visionary, but this whole attitude, which Sidney Lumet captured beautifully, was no secret. Viewing this movie again today is almost eerie."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Network\" is an extremely well-acted satire on the television industry which at times feels like it's spinning out of control. The big name cast includes Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, Robert Duvall, Ned Beatty, and Beatrice Straight. All give excellent performances in \"Network\", which is about a fictional TV network (UBS) that is far behind the three big TV networks in ratings (CBS, NBC, and ABC; long before Fox, UPS, and the WB networks hit the air). The executives at UBS try to do anything to get their network some good ratings, which includes giving their insane news anchorman (Finch) his own show. This is the movie where Finch says that famous line: \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!\" A classic line in movie history. Finch won a posthumous Best Actor Oscar for his portrayl of the crazy newsman who cracks up during his newscasts. He's good, but I think the best performance in \"Network\" is turned in by Dunaway as the heartless programming executive who comes up with some of the wildest ideas in turning UBS into a hit. When Dunaway is on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of her. She's a very strong prescene throughout this movie. She deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for her work here. Straight (\"Poltergeist\"), who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this movie, gives the shortest Oscar-winning performance in film history with her 5 1/2 minute appearence as Holden's scorned wife. Another Oscar went to Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay. While \"Network\" is strongly acted most of the time, there were moments where it felt like the movie started going over-the-top. Most of the characters in this movie spend alot of time yelling and shouting at one another and after a while it got on my nerves. This doesn't happen during every frame of its two hour length, but it happens quite often. For example, Ned Beatty's big scene. He does a great job, but the scene is so laughable because Beatty goes so overboard. Duvall goes over-the-top as well in many of his scenes. But so do Dunaway, Holden, Straight, and (of course) Finch. Despite this minor setback, \"Network\" is still a very good movie.\n\n*** (out of four)"

Simple as it may sound, it doesn't begin to explain how funny and how cynical this movie is. Finch is great as the prophet Howard Beale, whose legitimately insane (and profane) ramblings draw huge audiences, as is Dunaway, as the highly-driven programmer behind Beale's show. Holden is also good as the depressing ex-news dept. head, whose friendship with Beale is strained by Beale's new-found insanity. The Oscar-winning dialogue ages very well in this day and age of \"World's Most (fill in the blanks) Videos!\" I can actually see someone right now putting a show like Beale's on the air if it drew good ratings.

Written by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by Sidney Lumet, this film could have starred Steve Guttenberg and still been interesting. But with an all-star cast including William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and Robert Duvall, as well as Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight who received Oscars for their performances, the film takes on an incredible value.\n\nThe story probably seemed ludicrous in the 1970s, but in the 1990s, well, it still does. Or rather, we want it to. But ignoring our sentiments about television, it's pretty believable. While UBS had the Mao Tse-Tsung hour, Fox is airing When Animals Attack and The World' Scariest Car Chases. They're certainly not too far from Max Schumacher's (William Holden) sarcastic creation \"The Death Hour\".\n\nThis makes Network strike remarkably close to home and quite effective. But the real skill of this film comes from two performances: Peter Finch as Howard Beale and screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky's tour de force.\n\nFinch gives a performance that's absolutely believable, and frankly, it's eerie that he managed to. Beale represents a man so brainwashed by his medium that he actually buys into the fact that life begins and ends on television. Of course, this makes the end all the more funny.\n\nThe script, although laden with vulgarity, still maintains an honest quality. Scenes such as Beale's meeting with Ned Beatty and most of Beale's monologues are so real that they scare the viewer, yet make him or her chuckle out of mere terror.\n\nIf nothing else, watch the beginning and the end, because as Lumet's tradition dictates (watch Dog Day Afternoon if you enjoyed Network), the beginning is witty, and the end, well, it'll shock you, but still leave you with a disturbingly black comedic ending.\n\nI'd give Network 10 out of 10, although I'd recommend that you see it more than once before passing any major judgments on it."

Evangelical programs and right-wing political pundits are pretty much the same thing - angry people spouting paranoid nonsense. Why would it suddenly become a national fad when an even more boring newscaster does it in a less lucid way, other than for short-term novelty appeal?\n\nThe rest of the film is a satire about how shallow the television business is. The television executives try to manipulate aspects of their programs in order to get more views and advertising revenues in an unethical way while attempting not to step on the toes of the rich and powerful.\n\nYes, we know, we know. Everybody knows this already. Was this news in the 70s?\n\nMore significantly, as a satire it falls flat. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not new. It's not even outrageous. The cold executive lady who has no qualms about dealing with terrorists or showing footage of violent acts was maybe supposed to be an outrageous parody of something, but this type of behaviour at least by now seems normal in the media world and probably always has been.\n\nThe only interesting part was the romance between the middle aged TV executive and the younger female executive. There an interesting idea is briefly hinted that the younger of the pair is part of a \"TV generation\" that is shallow and self-centered because she grew up with TV - that instead of seeking human connection she thinks of her life as a TV drama.\n\nNow that's a fascinating concept that seems to have extreme relevance today when the world of social media might be taking the generation that is growing up with it (or possibly has grown up with this by this point) to new lows of alienation, coldness, and shallowness.\n\nUnfortunately, it's only tangentially explored in a few lines of dialogue.\n\nOhh, and the Pax Corporative speech the head executive gives is a brilliant summary of globalization and the central role of corporations in the globalized era. Quite prescient for the time, still relevant today. But then again, it's just one speech.\n\nHonourable Mentions: The Laundromat (2019). A rather educational movie that SHOWS how corruption and tax evasion works in the contemporary age through drama. It doesn't try to be cute or funny or satirical. Apparently Hollywood is incapable of making a decent cohesive satire - so just DRAMATIZE actual events and show them literally."

As for the fictional Howard Beale Show, it has been airing in the United States for many years now under several different titles (The Morton Downey, Jr. Show, The Jerry Springer Show, etc). \"Network\" is a prophecy that has been fulfilled. Adding to its air of melancholy are those fainting spells with which Beale closes his fiery sermons. Whenever I watch the film, I am always reminded that Peter Finch, who won a well deserved posthumous Oscar for the film, dropped dead for real only one day after appearing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like Catch 22 before it, Network pulls you into insanity by way of showing the insanity of the sane. Moment after moment the movie gets weirder and weirder but everything seems real enough. It begs the question does life imitate art or the reverse. With all the reality shows, like Cops and Survivor, and the real world. All the shows about shows, MTV doing the history of MTV. And all the brainless action and mindnumbing stupidity on TV ie WWF, XFL, Jackass. One has to ask the question, was Network talking about television then or was it forecasting television now? The movie does have strong intones of prophecy. Furthermore there's another strong point in the movie, the dehumanization of individuals by conglomorates. This point is brought down crashingly hard hear as it is in Fight Club. First it was social groups, then the church then the nations (as in Catch 22), and now the globilization brought about by the conglomorates who preach the gosphel of the almighty dollar. The only option is suicide or the complete and total rejection of society as a whole. This movie at turns is satire, drama, propaganda, farce, surrealism, and societal commentary. It is finely portayed by all of it's actors. \"I've seen the face of god\" \"You might be right\" It is well scripted given the complexity of the subject matter. And there is a fine fine performance from Tim Robbins. But I'm left wondering about the whole William Holden/Faye Dunawaye part of the movie. Was it actually happening or was it all part of a some new reality drama for the Network? Who knows? 10 out of 10"

The acting is superb, Finch, Holden, Duvall, and especially Faye Dunaway, she blew my mind. And Ned Beatty gives a hilarious, and at times terrifying performance. The movie is constantly shocking you with the lengths that these people will go to get a hit show, to further the Network. Like Howard Beale, this film has alot to say, and almost all of it is true!"

Faye Dunaway is superb, in an also Oscar-Winning Performance. William Holden is commendable. Bobby Duvall is excellent, as ever. Beatrice Straight's brief yet Oscar-Winning performance, deserves a mention. Ned Beatty manages to leave a lasting impression.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Network\" may have been a popular film, a film thought to be as real as it gets. This is a story of a man gone mad and exploited by Network TV; a classic story about the evil media and big corporations thirsty for money via ratings. But \"Network\" has aged and so has its message. Yes, it's a well done film. Sidney Lumet knows, and I think few will doubt this, how to direct. The performances are great, though I'm amazed that Holden didn't win an Oscar, while the ever-annoying Faye Dunaway did. Dunaway's performance, though in my assessment not marred by the empty, selfish character she plays, is lost and confused and simply fake. I didn't find her believable. And of course Peter Finch is great as the TV prophet whose descent into insanity is marketed by the Network.\n\nThe film is a satire. The story is interesting though it has been done over and over again - I've seen more movies about Media exploitation than I have about the Holocaust or other world events. Talk about Film exploiting Media. Still, it's one of the first and hence it was so popular. But is it good? Well, it's got a great script. It's so literary and witty and teeming with colorful adjectives. And it's also loud, sometimes irritating and in the end jumps to an improbable conclusion. Several improbable conclusions.\n\nConsider the final scene between Holden and Dunaway. Paddy Chayefsky's words, the screenwriter, present him as a man who has been burned by a relationship with a career-oriented woman who doesn't have time for the emotions of a man. So he has Holden deliver what seems like an eternity of a monologue about the emptiness of Dunaway's character and her madness. Two things: 1) this is already self-explanatory from the beginning of the film rendering this ten-minute redundant harangue a waste of time and 2) Dunaway, who is a hardcore woman and is detached from reality, doesn't respond but listens attentively. Where the hell is the protest? By listening to Holden attentively the script suggests that she isn't as empty as Holden suggests, but rather, there is some deeper connection between their characters. Otherwise she would just kick him out and not get depressed by his words, far less even listen to them.\n\nAnd, while I understand that the goal of any satire is to exaggerate events to comment on reality, the last shots of the film are plain ridiculous. Yes, they fall in line with the film's message, that the media is completely exploitative and we're just sorta fine with that. But it's not grounded in any reality. It's improbable. And that's a severe loss for \"Network.\" A satire with a similarly shocking ending, Kubrick's \"Dr. Strangelove,\" succeeds admirably precisely because it makes its improbable ending seem dangerously probable, if not inevitable.\n\n\"Network\" has a good conscience in mercilessly attempting to portray the cutthroat world of media exploitation. And, despite the ridiculous ending and some dialogue, it's not bad in getting the message across. However, it's just simply nothing new and its theme been explored far better in documentaries like \"Bowling for Columbine\" or fictional films like \"Natural Born Killers.\" \"Network\" is, above all else, old."

        "review_detailed_main": "Network is, for my money, a very nearly perfect movie. If there is a defect, it is the sound quality. In every copy of Network I've ever rented, owned, or otherwise seen, the mixing has, in places, been downright abysmal. Faye Dunaway's speech at the UBN stockholders' meeting is the place that first comes to mind--the audience applause sounds more like a jetliner warming up. There is also a point, I think around the beginning of the third act, where a narrator's voice-over is pretty much drowned out by the sound of an airplane landing. But these are minor distractions, really, from an otherwise-stunning film. If there's a major drawback to this movie, it's that it goes over some folks' heads: The dialogue is very smart and comes very quick. The humor is often subtle and allusive, meaning that, for instance, you might need to know who Patty Hearst is, or have a clear understanding of Marxism, to get some of the jokes. Also, this is a film that does not fear to violate the three-syllable rule. Words like \"ecumenical\" abound. But if you're a reasonably intelligent person and you like directors like Quentin Tarantino, or writers like David Mamet, who are not afraid of language, then you will probably love this movie. A second caveat, however, would be that Network packs a strong political punch. If you do not agree that television is the antichrist, then Network may seem to be a trifle loaded, like a piece of propaganda. Even if you don't, however, I would still not hesitate to say that you, like everyone else, ought to see Network. It is a film that deserves a response."

I am amazed every time I watch this at how Paddy Chayefsky predicted everything television would become in the 90's and beyond. To the viewers of this film who think that Network isn't relevant today or that it's dated, I ask - do you watch television today? Do you see how sensationalistic it has become? Do you not recognize what networks today would do for the sake of ratings? That is what this film is about.\n\nI also may be one of the few people who laugh out loud at this movie. As dark as it is, I think it has some of the funniest situations and lines in film: terrorists arguing about distribution rights and royalties like they are Hollywood players; the director and control room staff who completely ignore Howard Beale when he announces that he will kill himself live on the news; the fact that they turn the evening news into a variety show! Pure comedy.\n\nFor the record, as good a film as some people think Rocky is, I think Network was robbed of the Oscar for Best Picture. Rocky might have been a good, \"safe\" crowd-pleaser of a movie, but Network is a brilliant, incisive piece of filmmaking that should have been recognized!"

This film comes with the reputation of being a prophetic film. It does seem eerily prescient when it comes to a ranting, raving man spouting on the ills of the world. I imagine this guy being on Fox News telling everyone how the secret elite is running things and playing on the anger and fears of the common folks. This is just a small portion of the narrative. It has a corporation taking over a news division and turning it into a tabloid circus. That sound familiar. The world we live in now seems like it came from this like the writer had a crystal ball. I know that many people have probably said that about this movie. It's very true.\n\nNow this movie is still a satire. It is a lyrical satire. The dialogue flows like poetry. There are several scenes that are two people going back and forth with their ideas about shifting the perspective of news. They find a way to play on people's emotions. It is no longer about the facts as if it ever was. It is now firmly in the camp of editorials, soothsayers and pseudoscience. It's presented as a circus. Everything becomes for profit. A man's mental well being is up for ratings.\n\nThe main reason I still consider this a satire even though it reflects a lot of our times, the people are not really people in this. They are constructs of ideals. They speak in poetic flowing tones. The tete a tete between the former producer and the new producer who start to see each other is beautifully written and just sounds like music to your ears.\n\nI read somewhere that Aaron Sorkin considers this film to be a major inspiration on his writing and it shows. The Newsroom has a lot of these vocal patterns to them. They speak in a certain rhythm that is like music to your ears. The characters are over the top, almost like cartoon characters. You can enjoy it from a distance. I did enjoy it from that distance. I chuckled at the outrageous ideals and then felt that ping of uncomfortable pain that comes from knowing how true this is now.\n\nI really got some kicks from this film. It was a really well done dark comedy. It has superb performances playing caricatures and having the movie recognize this before such a thing was really in play was golden. I recommend giving this one a watch. I give it a B."

Just remember when you watch it, this was 1976. 1976 for God's sake! I remember it creating a stir at the time, but could anyone have realized how astonishingly prescient Paddy Chayefsky's brilliant script was?\n\nYou've probably read the plot outline a dozen times, so I won't go into too much detail. Peter Finch plays Howard Beale, a middle-aged newsreader who is sacked after a long stint with a floundering network. Teetering on the brink of a breakdown he announces on air that he will blow his brains out live to air in two weeks time. At the same time, Faye Dunaway, playing a scarcely less psychotic executive who has the idea of a weekly reality show following the exploits of a terrorist group latches onto the idea of exploiting Beale's mania to boost their flagging ratings... and then things just get crazy.\n\nthe number of quotable lines from 'Network' is almost without limit. Duvall, Dunaway and Holden are all great. So is the rest of the cast, right down to the extras. Peter Finch is riveting as Beale.\n\nThere is plenty of satire, too. The scene where a bunch of TV exec's are sitting down trying to negotiate distribution and payments for the 'Mao Tse Tung Hour' with a group of black Marxist terrorists is hilarious.\n\nThis movie should be taught in schools, and probably is.

I must say it wasn't quite like I figured it would be.\n\nI'm a fan of 70s, early 80s movies, that period produced some of the best social criticism, which in my mind is very important part of movie making. A few days before Network I watched The China Syndrome which I can now say I liked a lot better than Network. They're very similar movies in many ways. Network wasn't bad, but it's so overwritten, underlining and exaggerating it didn't feel that genuine.\n\nI can see how Network may have been sort of groundbreaking when it was made. It poked it's own industry in the eye. I've always found this a bit difficult equation. The studio executives may feel purified after producing a movie like this, but it will never be 100 % genuine if it doesn't change anything and everyone knows the TV/movie industry has not redeemed itself since the 70s. On the contrary, we have much more crap coming down the tube. Only the content may not be as sugarcoated as it was back then, but it sure is sensational in a tabloid way and aimed to make profit.\n\nIt's weird, eye-opening and kind of sad to watch these social commentaries from 30-40 years ago and compare them to todays world. Not much has changed really, generations seem to \"figure out\" the same things over and over again. Howard Beale says \"there is a generation that never knew anything that didn't come out of this tube\". That exact same thing was said all the way to 90's and 00's (until the web took over).\n\nEven tho this is not the most genuine of all movies, there isn't this kind of commentary anymore. There are no movies like Soylent Green (1973) which took rapid population growth into focus. We have now almost doubled since 1973 and the problem hasn't gone anywhere. We need movies like they made back then.\n\nGetting back to the movie, the casting and acting in the movie are pretty good with one minor thing to complain. Looking at William Holden in the movie, I thought he looked much older than he actually was and probably should've been. He was called \"middle-aged\" many times during the movie, but to me he looked to be nearing the age of 70. Only later I learned he wasn't even 60 when the movie was shot. The same thing bugged me a bit with Eastwoods Breezy. Holden looked much older than he actually was.\n\nAll in all kind of fun and even sharp social criticism, but not very subtle or a 100 % hit anymore. Howard Beales gospel is nowadays all over the web and facebook statuses. Being only a toddler back when this was made I can't say how this affected the world, but it's effect may show even today."

        "review_detailed_main": "In this day and age collateral damage of mass media productions seems to be taken for granted. While condemned, the fallout is eventually silently accepted, and the circle of criticizing and continuing the same way as before just confirms the tragic truth behind commercialism. Ratings are paramount, entertainment at all costs, sensationalism is what the masses lust for, and individuals, who die due to exhaustion in Survivor shows or are publicly humiliated by prank calls and driven to suicide, are part of the system. All that and more was already anticipated in the brutally outspoken 1976 satire \"Network\" written brilliantly by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by grandmaster Sidney Lumet. Was the picture visionary back in the days? Actually it was a reflection on the on air suicide of an anchorwoman suffering under depression. Nothing has changed. It's still all about ratings and money. Are you fine with that?\n\n\"Network\" with its startling performances (Peter Finch, Robert Duvall, William Holden, Faye \"television incarnate\" Dunaway), the shockingly dark and cynical script and splendid all around direction is as relevant today as ever, and it's the ultimate film about the amorality that permeates TV business. It is not to be missed, as it will teach you a lesson. It grabs you by the throat, no doubt, it chokes you, doesn't let you go, long after you've seen it. Alas, it's just a movie. If a film like \"Network\" despite its head-on collision course against the system cannot bring a change, maybe it at least contributes to help you consider altering your own viewing habits. No need to get \"mad as hell\" like the film's principal character Howard Beale, but a decisive \"I'm not gonna take this anymore\" will do to confront a mass media machinery with your individualism. To end with the last blood-curdling words of Christine Chubbuck: \"In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in 'blood and guts', and in living color, you are going to see another first \u2014 attempted suicide.\" The film's Howard Beale insisted to be a real person. Christine Chubbuck in whose honor the film was written was one. May she rest in peace."

How far TV would go for good ratings - the theme of this movie is ageless and is very relevant even today. If You think a channel wouldn't go so far to put another Howard Beale on air you probably never seen TV.\n\nOverall, i was involved into \"Network\" from start till finish. It isn't only about TV, it also shows people working there and their personal lives and how their jobs affects their lives. It doesn't go deep in that direction, but still it is very compelling story. Performances in \"Network\" are more then first rate - there 3 Oscar winning performances in this movie and two more - so in total 5 Oscar worthy performances. Writing was also superb as well as directing. This is a very good movie in all direction, relevant even today."

Taking equal swipes at narcissism, feminism, capitalism, commercialism, political radicalism and desperate idolatry in the context of mankind's cruel exploitation of itself, the quality of the script elevates screenplay nearly to the level of literature. The many rhetorical diatribes, which some may find heavy-handed, are delivered as if soliloquy, entertaining (and often parodic) as dramatic device, yet each containing biting truths. Lumet's direction is tight, and Holden, Finch, Duvall, Dunaway and Ned Beatty (yes, Ned) all are in top form. As poignant as A Face in the Crowd, as iconoclastic as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and funnier and more evenly paced than writer Chayefsky's previous Oscar effort, The Hospital, Network isn't just for misanthropes and malcontents-- anyone with a wry sense of humor and a keen sympathy for the fate of Western civilization might enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "The magical year of 1976 that gave us masterpieces like Taxi Driver, All The President's Men and Novecento also gave us Network, one of the most prophetic movies ever made.\n\nWhen Howard Beale, a mentally insane TV anchorman with falling ratings, announces that he's going to commit suicide live on the last day of his job, he suddenly becomes a media sensation and the surprise hit the flagging network needs to improve its ratings. Diana Christensen, head of the network's programming department, convinces her boss, Hackett, to allow her to turn Beale into a modern day prophet to articulate the American public's anger, cynicism, and disenchantment with Vietnam, Watergate, the recession, etc.\n\nBeale is a good and prescient example of networks co-opting counterculture: as he stands on a stage, with a church window behind him, delivering his rants, he doesn't understand that he's but the puppet of a network that has turned indignation and radicalism into fashionable entertainment. There's absolutely nothing different between Beale and all our modern-day radicals who've sold out to vested interests while thinking they're working outside and against the system. But this is just one of the most prophetic ironies of the movie.\n\nThere are more. It wouldn't take a stretch of the imagination to expect one day networks to kill people for ratings, like the movie suggests. The recent scandal surrounding Rupert Murdoch's News of the World newspaper already point us in that direction: they didn't kill anyone, but they sure as hell had no moral qualms interfering with police investigations that had human lives at stake. Just give the media time, they'll turn this movie's prophecy reality.\n\nBut perhaps the best prophecy of the movie comes in the form of the speech delivered by the CCA chairman, Arthur Jensen. After Beale informs the audience that UBS network has been bought by CCA, a conglomerate owned by Saudi Arabians, Jensen calls Beale to his darkened room where he explains to him how the real modern world works. \"There are no nations. There are no peoples. There are no Russians. There are no Arabs. There are no third worlds. There is no West. There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars. Petro-dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars, reichmarks, rins, rubles, pounds, and shekels. It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today.\" This is but one part of the speech but it's one of the most accurate things ever written in cinema! And it's hilariously delivered by Ned Beatty, who on account of this single scene got himself a much deserved Oscar nomination.\n\nIn fact this movie is full of great acting from start to finish, the cast imposes respect: Robert Duvall, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, William Holden, and Beatrice Straight, a fine mixture of veterans at the end of their illustrious careers (Finch in fact died shortly after the movie and received an Oscar for his performance as mad prophet Beale), and excellent young actors who had been carving names for themselves for the past decade. Sydney Lumet draws legendary performances from all of them. His minimalist style, without flashy camera angles and music, allows the viewer to focus the viewer solely on the actors delivering Paddy Chayefsky's brilliant lines back and forth. I've seen his three Oscar-winning movies, and this is Chayefsky's crowning achievement, a black satire that did nothing less than predict the modern world."

What a decade! And Network is one of its crowning achievements. If you haven't seen it, it can be described as a black comedy. Think of Being John Malkovich or Fargo. What has to be talked about first and foremost, and what has to be praised, is the incredible acting. Whoever was in charge of casting for this movie should have won a special mention oscar. Everyone, no matter how small their role is perfect. Consider Beatrice Straight, who plays William Holden's wife. She is barely on screen, but has one great scene, and she won an academy award. Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall are other standouts. The movie is serious and charming at one point and then it can be completely over the top. That's its beauty I think. The scenes all mingle so well together that the movie just flows so smoothly. I havn't even mentioned how hilarious it is yet.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The first casualty of war is the truth\". It's often the case that the first casualty of everything is the truth. Opinion, slant, bias: we add them to stories as soon as we hear them, even if we do so inadvertently. It's almost as if reality exists without and for us to take it in it must be processed and truncated into information that we can understand... and this is never going to be an accurate representation of the real. It's not common that a huge effort is made to resist this irresistible phenomenon and, more often than not, plenty of consciously-added changes are made. The credulous and malleable have always been receptive to facile, convenient messages and our herd mentality means that all but the most stubborn will eventually be worn down and submit to the accepted truths of their societies. This is as true today as it was before verbal communication, but the potential audience for such messages has arguably increased with the advent of new means of communication: language, the written word, the printing press, television, mass media... and the internet.\n\nGetting back to the film, it was made before the modern internet existed (its precursor, the ARPANET was only declared operational in 1975). If anything, Network is more relevant today than it was in 1976: the internet may be open to everyone (so it's not a handful of TV execs deciding what you see) but it is as much a source of disinformation as it is of information. The plethora of poorly-informed individuals shouting their opinions from the routertops is not unlike the street preaching scene from The Life of Brian. Information and freedom are great things but if you aren't circumspect and check your facts then you could be a victim of the global misinformation flu (which could mean anything from you repost some made-up story on facebook to you send a guy in Scamdonia your bank account details). Racism, prejudice and all sorts of other assorted bits and pieces are part of the make-up of each individual and these are exhibited for all to see in the opinions that they spread (\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.\" - Oscar Wilde). Also from Mr Wilde: \"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\" Those who disseminate the news, whether by word of mouth, in the newspapers, on television or on the internet should consider such words before they commit thought to medium. As you see in Network, many are perfectly aware of what they are doing, and don't care, so it's more important that those on the receiving end filter the information that they imbibe carefully.\n\nWhere Network is particularly relevant in modern life is how information is controlled and distributed. Internet censorship is becoming a bigger issue with each passing year. The great firewall of China may not be coming to an exchange near you any time soon, but it is worth being cautious of the various \"legitimate\" reasons western democracies are increasingly using to control the lines of communication. Some of these reasons are not things people can really argue for (e.g. child pornography in Australia) but it is legitimate to question the need to control the ability to communicate. Sure, pursue criminals who commit crime, but the slow erosion of the freedoms of the internet because of copyright infringement, online bullying and so on shows that the people in charge don't know what the internet is about. \"Technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral\" (Kranzberg's First Law of Technology). The internet is what it is and can be used to control or to freely spread information. In its current state it is up to the reader to decide. Hopefully there will be no need to remake Network in future to warn about the internet as a tool solely for use by those in control.\n\nNetwork is a film both of its time and ahead of its time. Like Nineteen Eighty-Four, its message will always be relevant as long as we continue to communicate. Only if this ceases to happen will the film start to feel dated. Then all we're left with is a wonderfully-acted, well-written and entertaining film!"

It does get stuck in your head no matter how many times you watch the film, and it appeals to a lot of people.\n\nBut a lot of people forget- and a lot of people who only know the film from that one quote simply don't know- that this quote was said by a news anchor who had, to put it lightly, gone insane and was being exploited by his news team. It's strange how a limited sample can skew one's perspective. But it is not nearly as strange as some of the going-ons in this film.\n\nThere are some movies that stay them same as they age. There are some movies that get worse. But only a select few get better; and this is one of them. At the time, it was a piercing satire of what was happening within the world of television. Now, it is something far more powerful: a piercing satire of what has happened within the world of television. IT no longer deals with the cutting edge or the hypothetical. If this movies came out today, it would be more timely than half of the standard studio output.\n\nThe television studios in this are cutthroat, caring about nothing but the ratings. If they can pull a 20 share, they will put anything on the air. They will showcase the ramblings of a man who has clearly gone insane and should be getting psychiatric help. They will broadcast the endeavors of communist terrorists. The only thing they will not do is allow anyone to insult the business arm of the company.\n\nI know not if these ideas seemed outrageous in the mid-70's, but I do know that they are not outrageous now. This is the kind of stiff that makes me glad television is slowly dying.\n\nThere is one character who starts off opposing the big corporations and their backhanded deals, but by the end of the film, she is right in their back pockets. Witnessing this complete turn, I started to realize how depressing this film is. It is not depressing in the typical way; this is not Requiem for a Dream (love that title, by the way). No, it is depressing because it is probably one of if not the most cynical movies I have ever seen. If this were done with incompetent hands, it would be whiny and adolescent. But under the masterful hands of Sidney Lumet, who also directed 12 Angry Men, it becomes a deep, piercing bullet of satire.\n\nIf nothing else, Peter Finch's performance as the newsman-gone-mad makes this whole film worth it. There is a reason that he got the first posthumous Oscar. This gives the film as a whole more heft; since he is so convincing, you see how useful he is to the networks, and become more immersed in the tragedy of all that is happening.\n\nThere are millions of people like me who, whether they realize it or not, want to see a film like this done this well. If you're among them, do yourself a favor and check it out."

While Network's wry humor is very sharp and truly sore, it's the sympathy I had for Howard Beale, Peter Finch's character, that got me. Actually, the movie's obvious flaw is that the aspect that is focused on, which is the political satirical one, is underdeveloped, or let's say that all small changes that happen don't make the story any better, instead, they made the satire less sharp, and made me less interested in the story.\n\nBy contrast, the character of Beale is continuously developed, and it's character arc is painful to witness from the very beginning to the end. However, what really made me engaged despite the semi-hollow main plot are two things:\n\nthe first thing is the intelligent dialogue; it should be listed in top 10 movie dialogues of all-time. It easily can trick us as the plot is very well-developed.\n\nThe second thing is the characters, not only Howard Beale, but almost every character is a three-dimensional one. Specially when I was totally invested in all the characters, and how couldn't I with, maybe, the greatest cast ensemble performing the roles? Of course, Peter Finch is great, and balances very well between his moments of wrath, and his moments of psychopathic coldness. But, c'mon, his performance is far cry from De Niro's in Taxi Driver, which is arguably the best performance in film. The performances that standout for me are William Holden's as Max Schumacher, he really deserved to win the Oscar, and Faye Dunaway's performance as Diana Christensen, which I think this is her best performance ever even better than her performance in Chinatown , and, fortunately, she took the Oscar for this role as the Best Actress in a Leading Role. Robert Duvall also, and as usual, gave a terrific performance. Needless to say, the entire cast is phenomenal!\n\nI want to say that I love Sidney Lumet direction. He always shot the conversations in his movies in a way that make us feel they actually happen in real life, and 12 Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon are the finest examples. But in the case of Network, there are some scenes that don't need to be shot this fast, they needed a little more focus, a little more dramatic feeling. The result is some scenes that could have been more effective if they were less rushed, also, there are some acting, which is great, that seemed to be over the top. And that's just because the direction, not the acting itself, except one scene in which the acting was really hammy. Also, the ending is rushed, but it's very shocking. With that being said, Lumet established a disturbing atmosphere, that due to it, nothing in this movie would have worked.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed watching this movie that left a bitter taste in mouth, because of nothing but its accuracy which made it very relevant nowadays. And despite all its major flaws, Sidney Lumet made a satirical drama that still one of a kind.\n\n(8/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "\" I am mad as hell.....\" . Well , well, well this is what everyone catches from the movie. There are some more which I was able to get hold of. First things first, I guess the best actor for the movie should have gone to William Holden ( Max Scahumacaher) instead of Peter Finch. The reason.... Peter Finch was portraying a cranky guy who is an angry messiah and also has eloquence as one of his strengths. I do not think he did have to do much change in any emotion he had to display because they had to be simply put, the emotion of an eccentric guy. ... William Holden shows the crisis which he is going through both in his personal life and professional life and how one crisis effects the other. That transformation alongwith his natural vulnerability towards Love and in the end walking over the one whom he loved back to the one who loved him is awesome. But amongst everyone, the most thoroughly deserved Oscar is for Faye Dunaway. Have seen Shabana Aazmi do a minuscule bit for the movie \" Main Azaad Hoon\" but nothing like Faye Dunaway. She is mean, very business like and always hooked on to rating even in her most intimate times. The great thing in the movie which Sidney Lumet has achieved is giving everybody their screen space and coming out with knock out performances by everyone. Paddy's screenplay is one of the best which I have ever witnessed in a movie so very much focused on Drama. Actually speaking, we could have had a stage play on this screenplay as well, its that good.\n\nOne disaapointment, this movie lost out to guess which movie in that year.... ROCKY. And guess amongst others which was the movie which was competing with it... Taxi Driver....\n\nNevertheless, a good movie because guys like Lumet had the courage to pick up such topics as TV ratings and the system associated and make movies out of it and I guess I would give it 8/10...\n\nAvinash.\n\n9:31 AM"

        "review_detailed_main": "1976 was a great year for film: it was the year that saw the release of Taxi Driver, All the President's Men, Rocky, The Omen and Assault on Precinct 13. Network is amongst them and the 49th Academy Awards were one of the most tightly contested ever.\n\nThe UBS network is a struggling TV company and it's News division has low rating. The anchor of the seven o'clock news, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), is sacked because of the falling rating and goes live on air to say he going to kill himself live on air in two weeks. The rating sky-rocket and Beale is given a free-reign to rant about anything he wants, but his best friend Max Schumacher (William Holden) quits when he see the company are exploiting him because of his descent into madness. Within the upper of epsilons they only care is profit and ratings, with the President of the network, Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) and Head of Programming, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) leading the charge. They turn the news into a showcase for the \"Mad Prophet\" and turn into a circus. At the same time Diana starts to develop more edgy programming, include a program about revolutionary terrorist group and embarks on an affair with Max.\n\nPaddy Chayefsky writes a really clever screenplay about the battle between the management of program makers and the owners of media outlets only care about profit and ratings. Program makers want to have independence, owners care about advertisement and sponsorship. They turn news from being an important institute and public responsibility to something cheap and commercial. It is still an issue now with the idea of tabloidisation and the decline of Chinese Walls (where the editorship and ownership are meant to be separate from each other). Network would be even more poignant because the nature of television today is looking to make cheap reality shows looking for different types of people (e.g. a open homosexual and a homophobe) just so they could exploit an easy conflict. There is no intelligent in this type of TV and ownership looks for a easy profit and shock rather then quality, which Diana and Hackett represented.\n\nThe acting is great, particular from Finch, Holden and Duvell. Chayefsky wrote a very witty script with great: but the actors made it even better by playing their roles absolutely seriously, they don't know they are funny. Finch is really believable as a man descending into madness and being used. He certainly did deserve an Oscar nod, but I do think Robert De Niro and Holden were very deserving to win as well. Duvell is an actor I generally really like and he was effective as a corporate man who only cares about profit. Dunaway's character is intelligent but cold character, always looking for ways to increase ratings regardless of ethics or taste, like getting a psychic to predict the news and treat news like it was entertainment.\n\nSidney Lumet is a great director, he knows how to handle drama and made sure that Network was a fast, well pace film with no moments of boredom. He was able to mix the drama with the witty lines whilst ensuring the themes about the media are in full view. Lumet ensures that Network is a well crafted drama with comedy, a great satire."

She try to focus all the interests of the film on her own weak character, she don't have the knowledge or the skills to pull off this role, she just pretend, and learned well her lines, and thats it.\n\nAgain i wish they have chosen someone more suited to this role, because the entire idea of the film is great, but the execution is lacking for me. One of the worst feeling aside watching a bad movie, is a movie that could have been great, but is just average because of the presence of actors that can't act as they belong in a movie."

The performances: all in synch with one another. Not a Fay Dunaway fan. May be the miserable characters she plays influences me. She did her empty-spirited and empty-hearted persona well. Peter Finch's last film and William Holden had just a few more to go. The Oscar went to Finch but a win for Holden would've been just as well-earned. Ned Beatty was pretty horrifying, too. Beatrice Straight was fine as the tossed-away wife, but an Oscar for 6 minutes on the screen is a typical absurdity of those award dispensing fools, especially when any one of the other 4 nominees should have won. Spilt milk and sour grapes. Chayefsky was a brilliant writer and Lumet a good director. Etc.

And, dare I say it, of those films listed, this is his best of all.\n\nI loved the Ecumenical Liberation Army, a very clear parody of the Symbionese Liberation Army, who were also mentioned. A news network working hand-in-hand with a terrorist group in order to boost its ratings? Priceless.\n\nBut the key speech of the film comes from Arthur Jensen, the prophet of corporate cosmology (Ned Beatty): \"There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars... It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today... There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon.

        "review_detailed_main": "Network (1976)\n\nSo audacious and loud, and so contradictory, with a sense of hopelessness and empowerment at the same time, it's impossible not to be enthralled. At least sometimes. William Holden is alternatively funny and sad as an news exec, and he makes a powerful central figure, even though the ostensible lead role is the more outrageous and really compelling newsanchor played by Peter Finch. It's Finch who made famous the mantra, shouted by all kinds of people as the movie progresses: I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore. Great stuff. Makes you wish it were true.\n\nAt least that part of it, the people power stuff. The rest of the plot is really an indictment of the corporate nature of television news. It's a prescient complaint, as the three networks were gradually consumed by three larger, and more insidious (if not downright evil) multi-nationals. (Specifically, CBS is in a complex joint ownership with Viacom, NBC is owned by General Electric, and ABC is owned by Disney, which is on the Dow Jones.) Of course, one wonders if the machinations behind the scenes (deals with corporate boards and \"the Arabs\" mainly) were as selfish, or more selfish, than depicted.\n\nBut no matter. The idea is clearly fiction, pushed over the top to make a more general point about the falseness of television news and the gullibility of a public either oblivious or willingly duped. Of course, that's only part of the story. There is truth in news, too, either on the surface or gleaned from the coverage, and this isn't really dealt with here. The point of the movie is to highlight what was still a relatively new idea, of a news world unreliable because of the people behind the scenes. (Whether or not that's true.)\n\nOf course, the other point is to entertain, and it does that without a hitch. It's a great movie on several levels, and it's a flawed movie on several others. As much as Finch and Holden impress, Faye Dunaway sometimes overacts and rings false. The camera-work, lights, and blocking are all worth noting--even simple situations (people in an office) are handled with a great sense of space, movement, drama, and plain old beauty. It's a gorgeous film. See it big and turn up the volume. It's that kind of movie."

It is immensely entertaining and easily one of the best black comedies I've seen in a long time. Network exaggerates a lot, but is sadly a testament to most television networks in that most of them do anything for better ratings. Find out what the people like and give them what they want. With an impressive and talented cast and a capable director, Network is a solid, well written film with few problems and a lot of satire.\n\nFrom the first few scenes, I thought Network would be one of those preposterous, unbelievable movies that would have me rolling my eyes at the idea of it being considered a classic. I was wrong. The film does very well in its purpose of showing the lunacy that goes on behind the scenes of television. We have a news anchor who goes crazy and, when ratings skyrocket, his well-being is the last thing that anyone is worried about. The characters here all seem to get caught up in making this fictitious television network the hottest thing on the tube. It is exaggerated, yes, but it makes a firm point and does so in a satirical manner that leaves the viewer satiated.\n\nProbably the best thing about Network is the wonderful, wonderful dialogue. Every word is sharp and it contains some of the most quotable lines in the history of cinema. Most notably, the famous, \"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!\" delivered rather brilliantly by the late Peter Finch (who, deservedly, won a posthumous Oscar for the role). The rest of the cast is equally brilliant, especially the always-delightful Faye Dunaway, who plays a woman obsessed with getting to the top. William Holden, Robert Duvall, and Ned Beatty are all solid in their roles as well.\n\nThere's never a dull moment here and, although the ending was a bit extreme, the film makes its point in a way that is both amusing and thought-provoking. Even though it's over thirty years old, Network is still relevant to today and, aside from the lack of cellular phones and personal computers, is not in the least bit dated. I have a feeling it'll also become one of those films that becomes more rewarding with each additional viewing. Here's a DVD I can't wait to add to my collection.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's all about ratings and telling the people what they think they want to see, in Paddy Chayefsky's,`Network,' a biting satire of television and those who program the beast, directed by Sidney Lumet and starring William Holden, Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch. In the world of the television corporate news division of a major network, the prevailing attitude is `I don't care what you've done for me in the past, what have you done for me lately,' and so, as veteran newsman and network programmer Max Schumacher (Holden) discovers, it's out with the old and in with the new, as Diana Christensen (Dunaway) steps in with some radical ideas of how to bolster ratings, including giving a group of terrorists their own show. But the boldest move of all comes with decision of the network hierarchy to keep anchorman Howard Beale (Finch) on the air, even after he announces (on the air) that he is going to commit suicide during the next broadcast, which of course, sends the ratings through the roof overnight. Working form Chayefsky's intelligent, well crafted screenplay (for which he received an Oscar), Lumet presents a scything commentary on the whys and wherefores of the decision making process behind what America watches that is hilarious in it's very absurdity; so absurd at times, in fact, that it is just too close to reality. And though the situations in the film are exaggerated, of course, it makes you stop and consider that in many cases fact is-- in truth-- stranger than fiction. It also makes you wonder what the 6:00 newscast you watch every night is really all about: Is it a conveyance for information, or merely entertainment? To bring it all to life, Lumet assembled an extraordinary cast, many of whom give memorable performances that are the highlight of the film, beginning with Holden as the jaded newsman who, late in life, is trying to figure out how it all fits together and works. He perfectly captures that sense of earnest futility and confusion into which Max's life has descended, and the stoic acquiescence with which he resolves it. Dunaway, meanwhile, pulls out all the stops and turns in a dynamic performance-- her best next to her portrayal of Bonnie in `Bonnie & Clyde'-- that earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. She skillfully brings out all of the energy and zealousness of the character, and leaves no doubt about the direction in which Diana's career is headed (that would be up!) and woe to anyone who gets in her way. She plays it all beautifully, and through her, Diana becomes the very personification of female prowess. And, not to be outdone by his co-stars, Finch turns in a memorable performance as the veteran anchorman at the end of his rope who adjures his viewers to go to their windows, open them and yell the now classic line, `I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!' which has such a profound effect on those watching that Beale soon becomes a so-called `prophet' of the airwaves. It's a brilliant portrayal of a man lost in despair and struggling with a loss of faith in everything he has held sacred his whole life that deservedly won him the Oscar for Best Actor. The supporting cast includes Beatrice Straight (Mrs. Schumacher), in the role that earned her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, Robert Duvall (Frank Hackett), Wesley Addy (Chaney), Ned Beatty (Jensen), Arthur Burghardt (Ahmed Kahn), Bill Burrows (TV Director), John Carpenter (Bosch), Jordan Charney (Hunter) and Kathy Cronkite (Mary Ann Gifford). There is much in this film that will strike a chord of recognition with the audience, because it concerns a medium with which practically everyone living in America today is familiar. In the final analysis, rather than condemning television and the powers-that-be behind the programs, `Network' is more of a wake-up call-- not only to those who decide what we see, but to those who watch it-- to accept responsibility for what is being served up with impunity and ingested without question every day. It's an entertaining, albeit caustic, film with a moral, from which no one with a conscience is exempt. I rate this one 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The UPS network is a television network that suffers from a lack of viewership. This led to the layoff of a group of their employees, including the great media night news presenter, Howard Beale, and this led to the events of a psychological impact on Beale, so he promised that he would commit suicide in front of the camera the next day.\n\nThe conditions and conditions of the network changed after Beale's decision to commit suicide in front of the camera the next day. The film takes us through the changes that occur to the network after this incident. How did Howard get the situation to the brink, how does the network deal with the crisis, and how do they benefit from the incident, or in a more correct, how do they exploit it to increase the number of views and return the network to the most powerful television network in America.\n\nThe film focuses on 4 characters, the first character is Diana Christensen, a character who doesn't care about high principles in the media and tries in various ways to do anything, even if it is bad, in order to make the network gain more views, a character that surprises you a lot because of her orientations. The second character is Howard Beale and the internal factors that led him to stand in front of the camera, fragile and mind-bending. Is it personal or is the network related?\n\nThe third character, who are the members of the network and the fate of the company, what are the things they will do in order to save the network from collapse and raise viewing rates and ratings, even if at the expense of harming others, literally anything?\n\nThe last character is the viewers. How do they want to attract viewers to the network as long as possible to ensure higher profits and the viewer to stay for as long as possible? This requires many things that you will see in the movie.\n\nWhat I liked about the film is that the film was able to mock companies, criticize societies, and focus on the weakness of people through its story and not through direct messages. The highest number of views.\n\nWhat we see now in the media in the 21st century, we see that this is true, although the film says that it is based on fictional events. How do the minds of the media founders play with the minds of the viewers through the television screens that reach every home? It was formulated well. Are people only looking for entertainment, even if it is at the expense of harming others? All these ideas and questions are employed in a coherent story and seen through its complex characters."

        "review_detailed_main": "As part of mass media and the primary source of communication in the society, broadcast companies such as television and radio play a pivotal role as ISAs. They are mostly in the private domain, operate through persuasion (or in more intricate terms, through ideology) and are founded by material existence (broadcast stations and outlets). In the film, UBS is a seemingly ordinary television company which is considered as the \"fourth network\" (after CBS, NBC and ABC) and is radically losing in the ratings game. As a consequence, the opportunity that the executives of the company took illustrated the rabid measures that each partakes on to rate and subsequently profit from such programs. The industry initially depicted was that on a deteriorating streak, it is close to being shut down out of bankruptcy. So since every program on television is expected and assumed to sell good in both the audience and advertising markets, immediate program-cutting and redeveloping measures would surface. This is where to which came the idea of taking advantage of certain situations to supply the network with the profit needed for survival. Primarily in this instance, the sacrifice of responsible journalism in exchange of skyrocketing ratings through a novelty news show. There is an apparent depiction of the anchorman whom the network wanted us to believe was a critic \"denouncing the hypocrisies of our time\". In due course, he was portrayed as a puppet merely used and controlled to satisfy the audience's viewing pleasure. He was the industry's tool to regain its impetus and to redeem itself from being salvaged by low ratings and relatively lower advertising density. He was the sacrificial lamb, a test run for trial and error. He was materialized as a media product that is packaged to influence the audience but in reality, was cut off his own mental and emotional stance. What we could suppose in this film is that the ability of an ideology to persuade people into succumbing to certain beliefs was extremely obvious on the part of the anchorman and also on the role of the audience as the receiver. Both were lead into believing that one complex and profit-motivated idea is a projection of the truth \u0096 a truth that is tangible and impersonal. The capacity of the television industry to maneuver the faith of one person or social group into the creation of a hyperreality is a succulent perpetuation of an ideology built to transform and subject the society to a monocentric faith."

The film is most likely better suited as a satire concerning the television industry today than it was 30 years ago. Anything that could boost ratings is thrown in and although the script intentionally goes too far it doesn't seem too unlikely that money driven corporations would go this far to further their status.\n\nThe actors are not good here, they're brilliant. Faye Dunaway is perfect as the station's television programmer who will go to any lengths to ensure good ratings (and I mean ANY). She overacts, sure, but hits precisely the right heights to create a character like no other. A heartless and manipulative bitch never looked so appealing. Peter Finch excels as the \"mad prophet\" and William Holden plays the only sane person who has to good sense to get out while still mostly intact by the madness."

        "review_detailed_main": "Network is a successful movie who brings out the best of the excellent cast - Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, William Holden, by providing them with the best lines on screen EVER.\n\nPeter Finch played Howard Beale, a TV news anchorman, who was forced to retire because of poor TV ratings. By announcing he would kill himself exactly one week later right in front of the TV, he became a household celebrity and his fame was fully exploited by Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway). She gave Howard Beale to host an out-of-the box news show which became an instant hit.\n\nHoward Beale, as the guru of life philosophy, talked wisdom on the show. He touched the hearts of the people and the scene he told everyone to open the windows and shouted, \" ...., I'm not going to take it anymore!\" was unforgettable. It was a dark rainy night, and neighbors simply shouted their exasperation across the streets.\n\nUnder the excellent script and unusual lines, the characters were brought to life. Peter Finch was exactly the mad man he was supposed to be. He was disillusioned off the show. Once in the spotlight, he was transformed into the wise man who inspired. Faye Dunaway was the beautiful talented workaholic who, as she described herself, failed in marriage but excelled at work. William Holden was the righteous man Max Schumacker in work, as far as how he wanted to save Howard Beale from being madder, but experienced his mid-life crisis in personal life. The lines for Mrs. Schumacker secured Beatrice Straight her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBut I had underestimated the pivotal role Arther Jensen (Ned Beatty). I was just telling myself he did not look like the top man of a conglomerate which toke over the UBS TV network. Yet at his meeting with Howard Beale in the grand conference room with dimed lights, his powerful voice hypnotized Howard Beale and made a lasting effect on Beale, the new TV show and the fate of both. Who is the great master of influence afterall?\n\nThis is a great movie who pulls off an unparalleled success in all aspects. The director and the script managed to tell in just more than 2 hours the people, the syndicated TV era and ratings, politics between the takeover man and the TV network. A modern movie never to be missed."

Yet in this day and age of JERRY SPRINGER it couldn't be more relevant. This is about as compact a movie as you'll ever find with nearly every scene working on both a intellectual and humorous level. Will appeal most to those who ever had to endure bad tv or felt 'run over' by the system."

And the fulminations in the boardroom are comparable to what had to have gone on at NBC this year. And doesn't the programming sound something like Fox would love to put on? In addition, this film has one of the great ensemble casts ever. It took three of the four acting Oscars for 1976. From top to bottom, the acting is first-rate. Ned Beatty only had a single scene but it was one to remember. Robert Duvall is so viciously amoral as the head of the network ... his portrayal is comparable to his small part in \"Apocalypse Now\".

As over-the-top as Faye Dunaway's character might seem, she's actually a bit tame by Real Housewives standards, and even Peter Finch's suicidal maniac isn't as shocking as some of the suspects in police documentaries.\n\nBeatrice Straight received a surprise Supporting Actress Oscar for a brief performance, which created the same type of controversy as Luise Rainer and, later, Judi Dench. However, Straight's scene berating William Holden is one of many electrifying moments in \"Network\". In fact, many believe Holden and Finch should have tied for the Best Actor Oscar, a la Streisand and Hepburn in 1968, but Finch's death before the awards ceremony tipped the statue posthumously in his favor. Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lumet are as brilliant as the performers, giving \"Network\" the kind of all-around kudos reserved for films such as \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"The Silence of the Lambs\", or \"The Last Picture Show\". Sometimes, there are so many great elements in a masterpiece that it's not possible to give trophies to every deserving participant. \"Network\" is important, compelling, groundbreaking, and as unforgettable as Finch's battle cry."

It's so dark it can hardly be considered a comedy. The film is \"Network\" and it is 25 years old.\n\nThe relevance of this film to today's society is frightening. For the time it was made, American cynicism toward government was at an all-time high. \"Network\" must be a response to the shocking TV Americans suddenly found themselves subject to-first the news coverage of Vietnam, then Watergate. Suddenly the war was in your living room, and you felt a duty to watch it. The news media was (and still is) on a determined quest for truth and you felt an obligation to hear what they had to say from one day to the next. This film dealt with the public's perception of the news media as it had evolved up until that time. The film's creators could see how the lines were beginning to blur between news and entertainment. The reality-based, shocking material seemed to draw the highest ratings. The network of `Network' goes so far as to support the terrorism it is reporting.\n\nThere is a more historic context for this kind of news-for-money tactic. William Randolph Hearst invented news to sell newspapers. His \"yellow journalism\" conjured the 1898 Spanish-American War. Hearst's newspapers published cruel editorials on President William McKinley-months before McKinley was assassinated. Can there be any doubt that \"Network\" was inspired by both sides of the Hearst coin--mistrust of the government AND mistrust of the news media?\n\nWas this the advent of 'reality TV?' Was this film anticipating the news-starved world we live in today?\n\n\"Network\" is an example of a film that would be impossible to get made today. The greatest films are documents of their times, but are also prophecies, containing decades-spanning, enduring truths. This film is both."

This film functions like a black hole, sucking us along its inevitable spiral toward Ned Beatty's climactic speech about the death of Democracy and the emergence of Corporations as the new World Powers.\n\nPaddy Chayefsky isn't saying \"TV is evil\"--TV is simply one example of capitalism's power to erode the cultural dialogue and rob us of our humanity. As in his screenplay for \"Hospital,\" Chayefsky is condemning the influence of money in those institutions which affect human lives the most, e.g. health care and the media. TV could be a massive educational tool; if you really reflect on the power of the medium itself, its global accessibility and reach, it's staggering to think what we've turned it into. Airwaves that belong to the public have been converted into endless advertisements for corporate sponsors, whether in 30 second spots or full-length \"branded\" content like MTV, which sells \"trendiness\" to an entire demographic of youthful consumers.\n\n\"Hospital\" predicted the damaging effects privatized healthcare and frivolous lawsuits would have on our nation's medical institutions; \"Network\" displays the same eerie prescience about our mass media. Reality TV is the least of our concerns; take a look at Fox News. Millions of people are being misinformed daily about significant world events because a corporation with a bottom-line agenda is selling branded propaganda as \"fair and balanced\" news. If democracy is impossible without an informed electorate, an informed electorate is impossible without unbiased media--hence the current political crisis in America.\n\nIn \"Network,\" Chayefsky is tying the political impotence and pent-up rage felt by Americans in the 1970s post-Vietnam and Watergate to mass media (TV being its prime component), but he's also using this lens to capture much larger issues, such as the corrosion of humanity in the modern world and capitalism's responsibility for much human suffering.\n\nThese are the issues \"Network\" is grappling with, and if you can get over the silly Holden- Dunaway romance and the somewhat dull direction, there is a lot of terrifying brilliance to behold here. Paddy Chayefsky was an immensely talented writer, but the screen rarely does justice to his words. For my part, I'll take a flawed but brilliant film like \"Network\" over a dozen slickly-produced \"Titanic\" clones, which look incredible but offer only the most banal observations about the human condition."

It tells the story of Howard Beale (Peter Finch) who explains on national television that he has just been fired and he will kill himself in two weeks, live on television. At first no one really hears what he has to say, but this provides the reason that he can stay on television. We see how far a network, or the moneymakers behind the network, wants to go to make that money, to get people watching. Those people involve Howard's friend played by William Holden, Holden's sort of mistress played by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall as the man with the strings.\n\nThe story itself sometimes goes a little too far, although in a time like this, may years after the film was made, we are not really sure. The ending seems almost inevitable on one hand, on the other hand it seems a little exaggerated. May be the exaggerations are good here just to show very clearly how far people are willing to go. It goes over the top the way a movie as 'Wag the Dog' goes over the top. It does this for a reason and succeeds in what it wants to say.\n\nThe performances are memorable, Peter Finch's the most of all. His way of playing a man who seems very bright and very mad at the same time is terrific. 'Network' has its flaws, but it works so well we are willing to forgive them."

Following Peter Finch's Oscar-winning performance as news broadcaster Howard Beale, we see him go from being fired by the UBS Network to being brought back after a threat to take his own life on national TV leads to the company seeing this as an opportunity to generate ratings while saving their company from financial ruins, which leads to a stage play story of epic proportions. Finch delivers the performance of a lifetime representing the pawns who spearhead the over exaggerated storylines the higher ups want the American public to know as news, whereas Faye Dunaway and William Holden deliver truly amazing supporting roles as producer Diana Christensen and host Max Schumacher as the former is a highly ambitious woman looking to go to the most extreme of lengths to boost her career trajectory, while the latter is the more level headed human who sees the dangers in spewing fake news and exploiting his friend to generate public outrage and better ratings. The biggest plus this film has going for it is how much it never feels like a film and just real events captured as they become increasingly more dark, with the film becoming more colorful and brighter on the surface to show the superficial image that mass media companies portray to the public, and this film is an accurate depiction of the clickbait heavy news circuit of today's times that feed on the emotional outrage of regular citizens while also showing the dangers of falling victim to the system of systems which strips one of their individuality and humanity. One of the best films of both of the 70s and of all-time."

That quote is said by Howard Beales, perhaps the most memorable character of the movie. When people think about this movie, most of them think about the antics of Howard Beale in the movie. His character is associated on a real-life scenario where some news reporter committed an on-air suicide. We shall talk more about this character later, but this film is more than just about Howard Beale. This is a scathing satire about the decline of actual news reporting. The theme is simple and it leads into today's news reporting. They just report what people want to hear, not actual stories. If ratings are bad, you can say goodbye to reporters, newscasters, programs, etc. and they will be replaced no matter how good they are. What the movie does very well is conveying those themes to the audience. The movie wasn't kind to the route the future of news reporting was heading.\n\nOne incredible part of the movie which stood out to me is the screenplay. The film was written by Paddy Chayefsky and it was one of the four Oscar wins the film earned. He really understood the news business and he once said a quote which provided an inspiration for the movie, I believe. He said, \"Television would do anything for a rating\u0085..anything.\" Unfortunately, that holds true today. If a critically-acclaimed show gets poor ratings, it will probably get canceled despite the strong reviews. It was more or less the same in the 1970's, but more with the news. Chayefsky also brought across a point saying that you can do anything or say anything you want on television, but if you threaten the profits of the networks they will end you. This was a very good inspired screenplay that set up the base for the movie.\n\nSo let's discuss what this film is about. In the 1970's, extreme violence headed by terrorists were the source of the nightly news. Meanwhile, the corporate structure of the UBS Television Network was in the midst of a drastic change. Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is an aging news anchor who has poor ratings and the network decides to fire him. Beale reacts by saying on-air that he will commit suicide. That causes his ratings to skyrocket to high levels and he is changed as he becomes a preacher of a sort. We see how this affects members of the corporate team such as Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and Max Schumacher (William Holden).\n\nAs with most if not all films directed by Sidney Lumet, the performances are all great. I was wowed by Peter Finch's portrayal of Howard Beale. He became some sort of a drunken preacher and my favorite scene is right after he said the famous quote from the opening of this review, he told his viewers to go to their windows and shout \"we are not going to take it anymore!\" There was a shot that had people shouting out their windows in the apartment buildings and I found that to be some comedic gold. Finch was fantastic and he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. In fact, he died shortly after this film's release and he was the first actor to receive a posthumous victory. Even though most people remember Finch as Howard Beale, this film is centered on the exploits of Diana Christensen whom is played marvelously by Faye Dunaway who was previously in 1974's Chinatown. This film had more focus on women, which I love to see from a 70's film. She would do anything for ratings- even if it means meeting up with terrorists. (that scene featuring her and the terrorists in a meeting was weak, however). William Holden continues his long Hollywood career in this film as the elder executive who is mesmerized by Diana despite her ruining his news division and begins an affair with her. He was very convincing. Also convincing was the portrayal of Max's wife, Louise whom was played by Beatrice Straight. She won an Oscar for Supporting Actress despite getting only five minutes of screen time. But she delivered a heart-wrenching, emotional speech to her husband after she found about the affair and because of that speech, I believe she earned her Oscar statue. In addition to getting caliber talent for the leads, Lumet stacked up his supporting cast very well. He was able to get the likes of Robert Duvall and Ned Beatty to make very convincing cameos.\n\nI enjoyed Network to a large degree. It was a sensation when released it 1976 because it earned ten Oscar nominations. In terms of the themes, it holds up incredibly strong. In terms of production design and cinematography, well you can tell the movie is forty years old. What stood out to me is Paddy Chayefsky's classic screenplay, Sidney Lumet's fluid directing, wonderful acting performances across the board, and the messages that are very influential today. Despite the antics of Howard Beale, this film is women-focused and I love that. But also see this movie for Peter Finch's incredible performance. This movie is angry at television and will forever be. After all, networks only care for their ratings not the content. Instead of delivering news and heart-warming stories, news are all about terrorists and violence. Nothing much has changed in that regard since 1976. While not the best movie of 1976, it is worth the watch.\n\nMy Grade: A-"

The writing can seem faintly pretentious, but this is out of the recurrent demand stories contain the same quips as realism. This isn't a Thomas Pynchon story, but it also isn't meant to give a glimpse of the 'true' business world of television broadcasting like The Newsroom was crafted to do. To best explain what epitomizes this film: It's redolent of Kurt Vonnegut's theme in the novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, but a greater emphasis put into Eliot Rosewater as both a resonant demagogue and more estranged to his surroundings. This is in the protagonist, but the supporting actors compliment him so much more as the story expands. If you can give the time, absolutely give Network an honest viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Network is a film of very rare proportions. It was released over thirty years ago, yet despite all the changes that have come into the world over the years, there is still a place for it in the annals of American history. The story is that of a fictional television network that is sinking deeper and deeper in the fight for ratings. Realizing he is going to be fired soon, veteran news anchor Howard Beale, in a remarkable performance by Peter Finch, goes on the air and announces he will commit suicide on his last broadcast. Both shocked and excited at this once in a lifetime opportunity, the VP of Programming (Faye Dunaway) and an executive of the network (Robert Duvall) decide to exploit this and use it to boost ratings.\n\nWith a story of this magnitude and intensity, the acting must be top-notch in order to give a feel of realism. Every single acting bit is incredibly well-done. Finch, Dunaway, and Beatrice Straight all won Oscars for their roles, and the cast also includes great performances by Duvall, William Holden, among many others. The script by Paddy Chayefsky is brilliantly satiric as well as realistic in its portrayal of television as a hollow, influential medium that can alter the mass majority of people's views. Some of the great scenes are Howard Beale spilling on live television his true feelings about the medium and how it has corrupted a whole generation, and you can see Chayefsky just having fun with writing a monologue like that. Sidney Lumet directs with solid steadiness and the entire movie works as a satire on television and a relevant look at the effects of it. See this movie if for no other reason but to understand what television has become."

Oscar-winner Peter Finch gave a spine-tingling performance as mentally disturbed anchorman Howard Beale. Oscar-nominee William Holden should have shared the Academy Award with Finch for his portrayal of Max Schumacher, a network executive suffering severely from a midlife crisis. Academy Award winner Faye Dunaway provides a stellar performance as cold-hearted programmer, Diana Christensen. Robert Duvall's solid performance of power-hungry Frank Hackett is notable as well as Oscar-nominee Ned Beatty's portrayal of a maniacal corporate executive. Beatrice Straight received an Oscar for her limited yet unforgettably powerful role as Max's hurting wife.\n\nNetwork's finest aspects are four potent monologues. Each are delivered with such ferocity and prowess in acting, leaving the viewer overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of the writing. Mr. Chayefsky's award-winning screenplay is an absolute delight for those interested in a rich and significant screenplay."

Now, while the movie acknowledges other stations such as NBC, ABC and CBS, it focuses on this one particular network- a fictitious TV station called U. B. S.. Max Schumacher (William Holden) is the narrator, and as it starts with an announcement that a long time faithful employee, by the name of Howard Beale played by Albert Finney is going to be fired from his news casts since it has very low ratings in comparison to other news networks. The person who was supposed to break the news to him was his long time friend and producer of the news network is Max. Once Howard gets informed about his dismissal or his firing from his news post, he decides to speak out his mind on his very last day on the air. And then once the ratings went up, UBS managers, lead by Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) and Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) wanted to milk this for what it's worth by giving Howard Keel his very own syndicated television show. What happens next is a mirror image how networks work, reminiscent of the talk show hosts circuit work between ex-talk show host Jay Leno, Conan O' Brian and David Letterman. It also reminds me how executives are able to dictate the kind of information that is coming out, such as Rupert Murdock who owns Fox News employing well known affiliates to pass out Republican rhetoric- Bill O'Reily is a prime example of this which is paying someone enough money to say and do whatever it wants. Some of the things I was wondering about as I was watching it, is whether Howard Keal had a contract with UBS, and what was that like. And one thing \"Network\" didn't address is that as soon as Keal had his very first show, where was the people who were supposed to dictate on him on what he can and cannot say for viewers are almost completely oblivious what he does off hours. A winner of four Oscars, including Best Actor for a Leading role for Peter Finch and Best Actress in a Leading Role for a Leading Role for Faye Dunaway out of ten nominations."

Finch is still great here, but Holden's understated performance is the true heart and soul of the film. Beatrice Straight, Ned Beatty, and Robert Duvall all do strong supporting work here.

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie about 30 years after it was made and amazingly, it still felt relevant today and seemed like it was made for today's audience. Now that is a movie for the ages!!! I believe this movie was a landmark film back when it was first released in 1976. It dealt with many problems relevant and visible with the TV industry back then, practically the news. It talked about how the industry only cared about ratings, how uncompassionate and realistic it was (taking away people's job when they lose popularity even if they have worked many years) and how greedy it was (creating news by funding different groups that could tear the fabric of society). These issues still remain prevalent in the industry even to this day, in some form or another. Ratings still count, even more people lose their popularity over night (all those \"real\" TV stars comes to mind) and although better nowadays, there are a lot stories that prove to be made up and a publicity stunt just for ratings.\n\nAnother thing about this movie was its witty observation of today's generation and of the society and rallying the people for change. Who can deny that the younger generations today learn their life from Bugs Bunny? Who does not feel that war, with so many images of war on TV nowadays, is as interesting as a 6-packs of beer? Who can say that they do not try to imitate scenes or lines from movies and TV that they saw? These observations are a wakeup call to society, telling society to change its value, with the rallying cry, \"I am mad as hell, and I won't take it anymore!\" Do not be the TV generation. Have some feelings! Have some compassion! The most incredible thing was how this movie is prophetic in a way. It predicted the next moment in \"trash\" TV, fulfilled by the introduction of \"reality\" TV in recent years. Although the example of Howard Beale was too extreme back in those days, his fall, rise and then the extreme fatal fall narrated in the film did not seem far off today. The wave of reality TV today felt like it was fulfilling the prediction that the movie posed forward. Look at the comparison and you would see that there are uncanny similarities. Reality TV feeds into the egos of the contestants and many of them, with the sudden fame, begins to act like maniacs, like Howard Beale; and just like Howard Beale, the more insane they act, the more the audiences love and encourage. When they lose the appeal, the network see no more use of them and dispose of them, \"killing\" them off, just as the same fate as Howard Beale. The death of them on TV is really the death of them in real life, as most could not accept the loss of fame and the audiences in real life could not accept them as part of their society. The TV personnel and the real personnel are in such contrast that ordinary people just could not handle and label these reality stars as outcasts. The movie is really saying that reality TV shows would kill many innocent people. Remember Najai \"Nitro\" Turpin of the \"Contender\"? Or Sinisa Savija of the Swedish version of \"Survivor\"? These 2 committed suicide just months after their cast off.\n\nThe movie could not be the revelation that it is without the great acting by the main characters. Peter Finch stole the show with his portray of down-on-his-luck news anchor Howard Beale. His ramblings were classic, and his observations still hold true. William Holden was solid and though not spectacular, he provides the only sane voice in the movie. Faye Dunaway gave what I consider the best performance of her career, in the role of the power hungry TV producer. Beatrice Straight and Ned Beatty, though having short screen time, each gave a rather memorable monologue and stole the screen with their short time there.\n\nLast thing I am going to say about this movie is that even the lives of these actors fulfilled the prophecy of tragic ends put forth by the movie. Peter Finch died of a heart attack while championing for his Best Actor Oscar selection. William Holden died within 5 years after the film was produced. Faye Dunaway had never been in a movie as good as this and her career died off in the 80s. Who remembers Beatric Straight and Ned Beatty after this film (except for film buffs)? In a strange way, these people \"died\" off following their success. Maybe the movie was not as extreme or controversial as it seemed back in those days."

There is no reason to miss this Motion Picture, as its messages remain true even 32 years after its release, and even more so now that television news stations are more popular and sensational than ever. NETWORK works on so many levels that it is difficult to convey; it is a satirical piece dealing with the impact of television on audiences, and the lengths that major networks would go to in order to gain higher ratings. NETWORK also works as a dark and brooding comedy, with little to laugh aloud at, but a lot for the more intellectual viewer to chuckle at while pondering the meaning of some of the events.\n\nSidney Lumet assembles an all-star cast, and more importantly, manages to draw an all-star performance from his actors/actresses. It is no surprise that this film garnered five acting nominations at the Oscars, and in my opinion, there were a couple more that could have been included. Peter Finch delivers the performance of a lifetime, as does Faye Dunaway, and they both deserved their wins (Finch's was posthumous). It was unfortunate that William Holden had to compete against Finch for the Best Actor prize, because Holden's performance was easily the second best of the year, and deserved some accolade. Ned Beatty also received a nomination, but the real surprise was Beatrice Straight's nomination and victory. I say surprise because her name wasn't really being bandied about, but after watching the scene where her character confronts her husband, it is difficult to think of a more brutally honest and heart-wrenching female performance from that year.\n\nSidney Lumet was nominated for Best Director, as was NETWORK for Best Picture, but the film lost in both categories to the John Avildsen's excellent and iconic ROCKY. Deservedly, though, NETWORK managed to walk away with the Best Original Screenplay statuette, for a script that was honest, intelligent, brilliant, and timeless, and contains a number of smart and outstanding quotes that are still applicable in today's society.\n\nLike I said, NETWORK is not to be missed. If your life has been influence by television in any way, you owe it to yourself to look at this one; I bet you won't be able to watch it just once. It is a fast-paced, frank, and clever breakdown of the technological and social marvel that is network television, and one of the few films (and perhaps the best) to examine the relationship between news and entertainment; truly a film way ahead of its time.\n\nNETWORK gets 4 stars (out of 4) and 9/10. Should enter my Top 150 at #112. Unreservedly recommended."

To say that shows like the Mao Zedong Hour (the Ecumenical Liberators' show) 'would never be on television' is missing the entire point. Nowadays, we compare what happens in the real world to what happens in the movies and television. We don't need something exactly like the Mao Zedong hour on TV now to prove that this movie is telling the truth about things; what's on TV has already screwed us up enough.\n\nAfter 9/11, how many times did you hear people describe the catastrophe as \"something like what's in the movies.\" Well where do you think the movies got it from!?!? Reality! What's real is no longer as prominent as what we see on the screen, because we see the screen more than we see the real. Shows like \"When Animals Attack\" may not screw people up in small doses, but the fact of the matter is that shows like that are all we see today. That's it. Animals attacking people, people attacking people... and none of it is staged, supposedly... it's all real life. But what's the difference, really? What's real to us is what's on the screen. It is the hyper-real. Better than real. A replacement for the real.\n\nThe soap opera romance was supposed to be a soap opera romance, because that's the only type of romance that exists. This is a pretty general statement, so take it with a grain of salt, but then again, try to think about a relationship you know of that doesn't fit this mold. Are there any relationships out there that aren't as made for TV as the next? Is everything made for TV? Or is it made BY TV?\n\nI offer no explanation of these phenomena, only the angles that this movie was produced from. Granted that Reality TV as we know it wasn't in existence at the time Network was made, but Paddy Chayefsky was just that ahead of his time. Network is satire. It is brillant satire. If you don't get it, then you don't get satire."

        "review_detailed_main": "Network is a very intense movie. It has notable performances, a critic to the TV, the American society, the free-market system and more: it shows the spiritual misery of the modern human beings. Peter Finch incarnate Howard Beale as a news reader about to retire, and his character of madman who receives some kind of messages from far beyond, put him in that old idea that the crazy and the drunken always tell the truth. In the empty and hypocrite world showed in Network, the madman is not only a hero who tells the truth and sees far beyond the usual ability to look. He is also a dangerous man and a threat to the balance of the prevailing world order. About this subject is very interesting the change in the movie that shows the speech of Beale an its implications. Hypocrisy is the language of this powerful movie to deliver his message."

        "review_detailed_main": "When this film was made in 1976, it was considered satire. A groudbreaking film that was not only excellently acted but well written and directed as well. Today, this film is something that is much more. Today, Network is the perfect interpretation of not only how TV business is run but all forms of media entertainment. As a person trying to work up the media food chain, I truly learned how Robert Duvall's character thinks and without a hitch, Duvall acts it to perfection. A man who is only trying to appease his boss while trying to make money for himself as well. Of course as the old saying goes, the crap goes downhill and the film shows this to perfection with the help of excellent acting. Faye Dunaway as the TV exec who just wants a 30 share is deserving of her Oscar as she shows her agressiveness to achieve her dream in more than just the office. For William Holden, he does a great job as the person who tries to fight for what is best for not only his best friend but for news. Then we have Peter Finch, his excellent performance as \"The Madman Prophet Denouncing the Hypocracies of our Times.\" As he slowly deteriorates, he performs a perfect role as he simply speaks his mind about \"social truth.\" Now what makes his character the closest thing to a modern tragedy is the truth about his character. A mental mess who in turn becomes a major piece of the corporate ladder.\n\nLooking at it with eyes that I seen now, this film is more then just satire. It was a social study that's spot on with the for-telling of the future. With the conglomerate's that own TV now and the messages that are expressed, whether it's for Fox or CNN. The message will be clear once you see Network and the if you are any bit socially aware, this film will scare you and for that this film deserves its place in history."

This film is one that film geeks should behold. It's a magnificent film with strong acting, excellent writing, intense dialogue, and great cinematography. I didn't know what to expect, but I got a masterpiece.\n\nSidney Lumet's film is about how a former broadcaster, Howard Beale begins to rant and rave and the network uses those rants for their benefit in order to solidify their ratings.\n\nThis film is the perfect one to use to teach acting. Peter Finch is very powerful in this role and it's a shame it was his last. He even won the Oscar posthumously which was a first back then. William Holden does an excellent job as Alex, Beale's friend. Faye Dunaway is very, very good here and she captures the essence of her character.\n\nOverall, this movie is really something to behold. It's one of the best broadcasting films I have seen and the messages are made clear here. The end of the movie is also very shocking and unexpected. It's a powerful film for sure. I rate this film 9/10."

It is supposed to be William Holden but it's split with Faye Dunaway and there's also enough Peter Finch, who happens to be the most memorable, to prevent it from just being about those two. Still I wouldn't go as far as to say he's in a leading role, though his 'mad as hell' tirade is the high point of the film.\n\nWhile aspects of Network are still relevant most of Chayefsky's message has become passe. It's a product from an almost more innocent time when tv and media were more concerned about simpler things like ratings."

        "review_detailed_main": "Howard Beale is an old newsreader for the not-so-successful channel UBS. His view ratings are dropping dramatically and the bosses have all agreed to cut him loose, all but Max Schumacher, the head of the news broadcasting, who is an old friend of Howard. After hearing of his forced retirement he decides to say goodbye in a different way: during his last 'performance' on TV he, instead of reading the news, informs the viewer he's going to commit suicide. The bosses of UBS are furious, but a newcomer and professional b*tch Diana Christensen sees a great commercial hit in this new way of dealing with the news today.\n\nThis main story forms the base of a magical dark comedy and drama picture directed by Sidney Lumet. A star cast filled with established actors received in 1977 the important prices at the Academy Awards, winning both the Oscar for best leading actor, won by Peter Finch in his role of the exuberant television prophet Howard Beale and the Oscar for best leading actress, won by Faye Dunaway, playing the professional business women, creating a prototype of modern television. Somehow Beatrice Straight even won the award for best female supporting actress, as the aging woman of Max Schumacher. Besides these, you got William Holden (Max Schumacher), Robert Duvall (Frank Hachett) and Ned Beatty as Arthur Jensen, all in good form.\n\nApart from the terrific acting the movie delivers a great, but dramatic story of the evolution of the media system into a real killer machine (signified by Dunaway's character). In the beginning the story is quite funny and entertaining but when Howard has his first strike, you know this is more than a game, it's reality, just like Howard prophecies. Then the channel gets more and more aggravated, the public is aroused and evil has won the war, 'cause that's what the media has become: a bloody battle for money. The last shot of the film, when Howard has been shot by the communist revolutionaries (I even recognized Tim Robbins as one of the shooters), is bitter and absolutely horrifying. The prophecy has become reality.\n\nThis weird mix of comedy and drama is just the way I feel about modern television: I can laugh with it because of its stupidity, but on the other hand it is sad that more than a half of the population of my country (Belgium) is watching this crap. The comedy of the movie is sometimes achieved in tiny things. I love the fact that Howard is from the start of the picture on saying he's going to kill self because of the system, but in the end it is the system that kills him. Powerful filming and strong acting create a bitter good film. Just go and rent or even buy this one!"

The movie purports many messages about television, but specially ratings. When long time, respected anchorman, Howard Beale is fired, (the late great Finch) he announces live, that he's gonna kill himself on t.v., this sets off ratings to fly through the roof in coming weeks, where once weekly, we follow Beale's qualms and issues on his own show, where shockingly heartless reporter (Dunaway, in a dynamic sexy performance) sees this as a shot for her own personal success, while bedding network executive, William Holden (lucky him), which later complicates his marriage, while also being supportive to long time, friend, Howard. When ratings start to drop, the network, sees Finch, as a threat, who refuses to quit, where in this whole scenario, the main message in this film is telegraphed. Ratings pay, and bugger who gets in the way. I found young lass, Dunaway, as someone, I don't I'd particularly like in the real world, but the movie is the real world, with a great script and acting, as well as that memorable movie's favorite line. The whole great movie plays out beautifully with an impactful and shocking climax, you first question, how. But when thinking about it, as in reality, it's not far from what really would happen, and that's the scariest thing about this movie. Watch for a young Two And A Half Men, female favorite. A flawless movie, with director Lumet, as his peak. Engaging 2 hour plus, entertainment. Robert Duvall as Dunaway's boss is very good too."

This movie is the cinematic equivalent to a Dream Theater album by the Progressive Rock band.

I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell, 'I'm as mad as h e l l and I'm not going to take this anymore!!' I want you to get up right now, sit up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell: 'I'M AS MAD AS H E L L AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!'\" -- Howard Beale\n\nPerformances are great across the board, and it's little wonder several of the cast members here either won or were nominated for Oscars. Best of all is of course Peter Finch (who sadly was awarded it posthumously in 1977); he comes across exactly like a man possessed by some higher power in his own mind. There's a tinge of the theatrical about him, but in a way that suits the milieu of TV as described as \"showbiz\" by Diana. Faye Dunaway's Diana herself is perhaps the finest work by this actress. She seems to be on some eternal personal brainstorm of morally bankrupt but inspired ratings-seeking ideas forever restlessly bubbling to the surface. While William Holden's performance as Max initially seems sidelined by these two grand standers, he later comes into his own, bringing with him a rich seam of old-fashioned humanity and humility to the ever-expanding circus.\n\nNetwork, made some 40 decades ago, remains a model of bold, outrageous satirical comedy, with sterling work by one of the strongest dramatic ensembles in the history of film. The bravura, Oscar-winning performance of Peter Finch alone - at once funny, frightening and haunting - makes the movie must-see viewing.\n\nNetwork is the last film to date to receive five nominations for acting Oscars.\n\nIt is one of only two films in history to win three acting Oscars (awarded to Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and Beatrice Straight). The other is A Streetcar Named Desire (1951).\n\nPeter Finch was the first person to win an acting Oscar posthumously, and remains the only one to win in the lead category.\n\nThis was the first film since Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) to win Oscars for both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBeatrice Straight's performance holds the record for the briefest ever to win an Oscar."

Sound familiar? Sometimes I have to see an older film like this to realize how little things have actually changed in the last fifty years in the media. This, and the current trend of shock/reality TV, make this film seem especially poignant today.\n\nI especially enjoyed Faye Dunaway's character - her entire persona embodies\n\neverything that is bad about television, yet she herself is not necessarily bad. She is just a functioning realist with no regrets.\n\n\"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!\" It's so amazing how such a meaningful phrase quickly becomes a gimmick and loses all meaning.

That being said, the movie does have its share of flaws: namely, the monologues are sometimes shrill and ill-conceived and the humanity of these characters are sometimes sacrificed to make a satiric point. We are treated to some extraordinary performances from William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and Robert Duvall: Holden had never been finer, in my opinion. Ned Beatty gives a memorable speech regarding the domination of multinational corporations and currency and a borderless globe, echoing the champions of globalization today. A fearless satire like this would never get greenlighted today, which is a shame."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is timeless. It is very similar in nature to Orwell's prediction of the future, but instead of Big Brother, here we have the current state of the media. I find this film to be more relevant to the cutthroat and downright ridiculousness of today's media, than I do to television. The network Howard Beale worked for exploited him for ratings, but it also showed how far the media is willing to go to get a \"story,\" whether it's manufactured falsehoods or a ratings grab. Network shows that the media doesn't care about people or it's own employees, which is true today. An excellent movie with an excellent script, and superb performances by Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, William Holden, and Robert Duvall. This is a must see movie."

It gives you a perfect insight of television, what happened beyond what we see in the screen from the comfort of our living room. This movie taught me what an environment of television might be like, the joy, the rush, the stress and the conflicts that might entail. It is also a clear example on how television affects people and the way it has an instant impact on people's way of living and thinking. As the movie is based on a television network, it deals with everyday life situations, such as love, betrayal and success. Everyone can easily identify with the characters making us feel they're real."

Finch is firing on all cylinders as suicidal newsreader-turned-mad prophet of the airwaves Howard Beale, richly deserving his posthumous Oscar. While Dunaway as a ruthless, ratings-driven programmer, and Holden as the film's all-too fallible conscience are similarly great (and also won Oscars)."

In some respects, it appears that the TV show sort of brings the message of Network full circle, becoming, in effect, the TV spin-off of the movie. It's just wonderfully and oddly ironic that Network is now, in effect, a TV show.\n\nAs I watched the TV show, I was reminded of how remarkably true Network was in forecasting the future of television. The TV show, at least the first episode on 9/18/06, paled in comparison to Paddy Chayevsky's brilliant and outrageous script. And the actors . . . well, some of my current favorites are in the TV show (Timothy Busfeld, Judd Hirsch, Bradley Whitford, Matthew Perry and others), but who could ever approach the performances of Faye Dunaway, William Holden and Peter Finch? I'm going to consider the TV show a tribute to the classic -- and Network is a classic, perhaps one of the very best movies ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Network\" from 1976, is an award winning dark comedy drama that brilliantly captures the essence of media manipulation and societal decay with razor-sharp satire and unparalleled intensity. Directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring a powerhouse performance from Peter Finch, the film dives deep into the corrupting influence of television and its ability to shape and distort reality. The screenplay, penned by Paddy Chayefsky (Oscar winner), is a masterclass in biting dialogue and prophetic insight, delivering a narrative that is both painfully relevant and darkly humorous. Finch's portrayal of Howard Beale, the unhinged news anchor who declares he's \"mad as hell, and not going to take it anymore\" is nothing short of electrifying, earning him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Actor. The film's ensemble cast, including Faye Dunaway (best actress Oscar), Robert Duval, Ned Beatty, Beatrice Straight (best supporting actress winner) and more, contributes to an unforgettable experience that examines the moral and ethical decay within the media industry with fierce originality. With its scathing critique of media sensationalism and its prescient vision of reality television's rise, this remains an enduring classic that not only entertains but also compels viewers to question the very nature of truth and authenticity in an ever-evolving media landscape. More timeless than ever, and given the insanity and lies of modern day mainstream media, this epic remains, without a doubt, one of the greatest movies ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "The greatness of a movie depends on its ability to move a human being into a particular state of mind, whether emotional or intellectual that is up to the creator of the script. But alongside that, is the fruition of the vision, which is attained by the means of the director, production crew, designers, composers, and of course, actors. Network is a movie that attains greatness on all levels. Actually this movie's moved me to think that in its substance and presentation that it could be successful as a work of theatre. I'm not talking about a below-mediocre rendition, but if it was consistent with the script, could produce what great plays have to offer. This movie makes no claim to great special effects or sweeping landscapes- just a great story based on Chayefsky's vision of the world of television.\n\nThe signature line of this film is \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.\" When it comes to the world of television, I think the viewer holds his/her own destiny in their remote control. The story revolves around a suicidal news anchorman, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), who's reaction to being fired leads him to, first, reveal that he will commit suicide on the air, and second, to expose the demented philosophy of the cut-throat environment of television. The premise of Chayefsky's script is an examination of the ethics of the programming in the television industry. In my opinion the independent television viewer gets what they tune in to, the decision is theirs to make. And to be \"as mad as hell\" means that the viewer sees no other alternative than sitting in front of the tube and taking only what it has to offer. And as morbid as it sounds, I think that the occurrence of such a Beale-like figure would produce the same reaction in reality. Can't you envision the \"enraged\" masses of people rallying behind such a loose cannon, who is virtually telling them to \"get mad\" about something that they already have means to overcome. This movie touches upon the ideas of the current censure trends and will surely produce a anger inside oneself. This movie is unlike anything produced in Hollywood, with exception of the rendition of Ayn Rand's Fountainhead, because it based only on ideas. The content of this movie demands that the viewer to bring along their rational mind.\n\nChayefsky has created a treatise that leads the individual to evaluate ones relationship to the television set. Is it your guide to the outside world? Is it your entertainment? Is it the teacher of your political and spiritual philosophy? Has it given meaning to your life? If you have answered yes, \"you should be as mad hell\". Don't take it anymore-- click it \"off\"."

The satire about the television network industry was far before its time but was out and out brilliant in several ways. First and foremost, the cast is one of the best right up there with THE GODFATHER. Faye Dunaway, and William Holden lead an exceptional cast as the producers of a news show anchored by Peter Finch that becomes an overnight success when Finch's character, who we learn was fired at the beginning of the film, threatens to kill himself at the end of his last broadcast. Dunaway is ambitious and perfect in every definition of the word; Finch is stunning as a psychotic broadcaster turned prophet; Holden depicts class and depth as a network executive; and other players, including Robert Duvall (new network executive) and Beatrice Straight (as Holden's wife who struggles to maintain her dignity after learning of her husband's infidelities) prove what great supporting roles can do. Paddy Chayefsky's play is absolutely flawless with biting satire, wit, and deep drama in every scene while director Sidney Lumet captures the world of the television industry with subtle perfection. Dunaway, Finch (who died just after the film wrapped), and Straight won Academy Awards for their roles, the second film to win 3 acting awards in a year.\n\nRating: 8/10"

        "review_title": "Incredible piece of prescient cinema",
        "review_detailed_main": "American cinema in the 1970's revealed a more personal, \"gritty\", and quite often profoundly moving. This was in part due to the \"changing of the guard\" at the studios that began happening in the 1960's. The Moguls that had created the studio system, and also the golden age of cinema, were leaving, and the studios were being sold off to corporations that had no connection to the cinema industry. This led to a multi-million dollar industry being run by companies such as Coca-Cola; therefore, the studios were being run by people who did not know what makes money. Fantastically for the new film makers, this led to a certain amount of freedom, and produced some of the most challenging and interesting films. It seems to me that this all occurred simultaneously with some interesting social and political challenges in the real world.\n\nIn the media throughout the 1970's, there were many stories about political kidnappings (such as the well-known Patty Hearst kidnapping that had the world gripped through the bizarre change in the newspaper heiress and socialite who eventually became a member of the terrorist gang), and of course the biggest political story of the decade, the Watergate incident. This latter event highlighted the inconsistencies of political power, and (along with the JFK assassination in 1963) almost essentially created the conspiracy theory - and the modern political conspiracy was born, and is now a popular part of culture. So it seems incredible today that under this atmosphere of paranoia, and particularly with the corporate mergers of industries, that Network was made - a film that is mainly about a television network that is going through changes after a corporate merger/takeover.\n\n\"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!\" This is the mantra of Howard Beale (Peter Finch who won a posthumous best actor Oscar for this role), anchorman of the UBS Evening News, who at the start of the film, is told that due to poor ratings, he was to be fired. On his next broadcast, Beale announces that he will kill himself in a live broadcast next Tuesday. This of course creates a bit of a media sensation, and the interest in the anchorman extends, making the network executives take notice. This leads to the freedom for Beale to have a platform in which he berates the consumerist world, along with the machinations of the financial and media industries. Whilst the \"downfall\" of Beale's psychology seems to be the main event in this film, he is simply a protagonist that gets the narrative going. the main focus here is the relationship between news executive, Max Schumacher (William Holden) and the younger programming executive, Diana Christenson (Faye Dunaway). This relationship is essential to the narrative. This is where we discover that she will stop at nothing for the acquisition of ratings and therefore money, and that Max, whilst obviously enjoying his affair with the young woman, is fundamentally concerned with Beale's well-being.\n\nThis last point raises an interesting question about the nature of sanity. Whilst the money-men in the executive offices simply look at the ratings boost, and care less about the content, Max is worried that his friend is losing the plot. Of course this would be easy to say when we see Beale, soaking wet and dishevelled, ranting in a seemingly frantic manner. However, the fact that he is voicing opinions that were very popular at the time, shows that maybe he has in fact had enough of the machinations of the \"system\".\n\nTo say that the film is still relevant today is an understatement. In fact, much of what occurs in the film has become very much an everyday reality. So it could be argued that the film was an incredible piece of prescient cinema. Network has an amazing cast, and all performances are first rate - particularly Ned Beatty's small role, where he informs Beale of the future of industry which is stunningly shot also. Network should be celebrated in the same way that other films of the decade are, such as Taxi Driver (1976). It has utterly relevant social commentary, and rings as true today as it did 35 years ago - perhaps a depressing thought, highlighting that nothing has really changed, and that in fact, we are living in an unchanging civilisation that has only one obsession: Money.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

Peter Finch plays Howard Beale who upon hearing of his termination, decides to let things loose at air. Problem is that his show becomes the highest rated on T.V and Faye dunaway will do anything to keep him. The film has a subplot involving Dunaway and Holden as lovers but this is really Peter Finch's movie as he has the most memorable lines (\"i am angry and i am not going to take it anymore\") and scenes from the movie(His death scene is especially ironic and funny as the narrator says he is the first person ever killed because his show had low ratings. Memorable lines (\"There is no east, there is no west\"), brilliant acting makes this film a classic.\n\nPremise: Howard Beale fall, rise and then fall from television.\n\nNetwork was nominated for ten Academy awards and won four.

Taking equal swipes at narcissism, feminism, capitalism, commercialism, political radicalism and neo-religious idolatry in the context of mankind's cruel exploitation of itself, the excellent script-- as contemptuous and surreal as the institution it portrays-- elevates screenplay nearly to the level of literature. The many rhetorical diatribes, which some may find heavy-handed, are delivered as in soliloquy, entertaining (and often parodic) as dramatic device, and each containing raw, biting truths that not only define the moment, but serve to inform the greater narrative by giving unfettered voice to each of the major players' point of view, however extreme. Lumet's direction is tight, and Holden, Finch, Duvall, Dunaway and Ned Beatty (yes, Ned) all are in top form. As poignant as A Face in the Crowd, as iconoclastic as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, grittier than Broadcast News and funnier and more evenly paced than writer Chayefsky's previous Oscar-winning effort, The Hospital, Network isn't just for the misanthropic and the malcontent-- anyone with a wry sense of humor and a keen sympathy for the fate of Western civilization is free to enjoy."

Well, it's the year 2003 now and with the highly formulaic and flavor-of-the-week TV trends like \"reality\" shows, \"Network\" rings true. In fact, the movie seems prophetic in nature because it even hints at the mad dash to develop a totally insane \"reality\" show that crosses the line into the criminal.\n\nGreat movie which would be a classic even without its revelatory nature."

        "review_detailed_main": "****SPOILERS**** Howard Beale is given his walking papers and told that he has two weeks left as UBS nightly news anchorman after hosting the news for over ten years on that network the reason: Lousy Ratings. Depressed Howard gets drunk that night with his good friend and UBS News manager Max Schumacher, William Holden.The next night on his news show Howard stuns the TV audience and those in the studio by saying that on his last day as UBS news anchorman he'll end his career in broadcasting by blowing his brains out live on network TV. The rating for Howard's news show hit the roof the next few days.\n\nInstead of getting Howard help, who was having a breakdown, the honchos at UBS manager Frank Hackett, Robert Duvell, and program director Diana Christensen, Faye Dunaway, saw a hit in Howard's unstableness and decide to give him a new show \"The Network News Hour\". On the show Howard can act out his \"visions\" about what is really happening in the world around us and what can be done to change whats happening for the better of all mankind. As it later turns out with Howard's truthfulness on the show that this is not exactly the entertainment that UBS top executives wanted.\n\n\"The Network News Hour\" shoots to the top of the chart but despite the phenomenal ratings, the show take in a bigger share of the TV ratings then ABC CBS & NBC combined. It's telling the people what those in power don't want them to hear, how their being fooled and manipulated by those who are manipulating them.\n\nPowerful and informative movie years ahead of it's time that watching it now has a much more powerful effect on you then if you saw the film back in 1976 for everything it brought out then in fiction has become a fact now.\n\nThe owner of UBS the the world-wide corporation CCA has it's CEO Authur Jensen, Ned Beatty, get Howard alone in his study at CCA headquarters and lays down the law to him in whats the right thing to say as well as do on TV and in the public arena. That destroys Howard and his show by him later telling the public that they, like himself, can do nothing to stop the suffering that those in control are inflicting them with and have to learn just to live with it.\n\nThe show \"The Network News Hour\" dips in the rating to where it's at the bottom of the heap but Jensen refuses to have the show canceled. He then maniacally puts Hackett and those who he's in charge have Howard assassinated on his show on live TV to keep the network from going under. With that Hackett and those working with him careers from going under as well.\n\nOne only has to watch TV and the TV news now to see just how ahead of it's time Network was and appreciate it in how it showed not only the reporting of the news on TV but the un-reporting of the news behind the news by the then, as well as now, TV networks. Peter Finch received posthumously an Academy Award as best actor so did Faye Dunaway as best actress as did Beatrice Straight for best supporting actress as Louise Schumacher Max's long suffering wife. who Max was cheating on by having an affair with Diana. The scene where Max confesses his affair to Louise was almost as effective but nowhere as flamboyant as the scene with Howard losing it on the air in living color. Howard in a state of intense and uncontrollable anger and indignation whips up millions of TV viewers all over the country about the state of the news and how helpless he as well as they are in effecting or changing it. Howards big and unforgettable moment in the movie comes by shouting at the top of his lungs \"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\". Millions of people watching Howard lent Howard a hand or better yet a voice and thus blew the roof of the theater, where the movie was playing, off."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the US during the Post Watergate-Vietnam War era it seemed like much of our culture was coming apart at the fringes. If not it was definitely revealed in Television. Network may the the first movie to ever take a scathing crack at the corruption of Media mavens in TV Stations, but the theme as implicated here extends to corruption of shareholders, media moguls and the powers that be that control and manipulate them.\n\nHoward Biel, played by the legendary Peter Finch, is a washed up News anchor who has been informed his position will be terminated due to ongoing low viewer ratings. He shares an evening with an old buddy, Max Shumacher, a powerful executive from the UBS station. Together they lament the bygone glory days of TV and how they're lives have changed. Hopelessly depressed from anger and exhaustion, Howard Biel decides to announce on air to the public that he will commit suicide. The ratings practically skyrocket overnight. Mr. Biel revitalizes his waning charisma for all the wrong reasons. This is recognized by an ambitious new Program developer, Diane Christensen (Faye Dunaway). She sees this as a golden opportunity to lift UBS out of its rut and to boost ratings again. This is basically what the movie is about, written by Paddy Chayevsky. TV media will shamelessly exploit any person(s), entity or idea just for the sake of improving its stock value. Sensationalism is good whether it's negative or not. She sells her idea to the station's President, FRANK Hackett (Robert Duvall). At first Hackett, Shumacher and the other execs are appalled by lukewarm on the idea, but they later realize that any news is good news as long as it boosts ratings. This is an intelligent film that captures the essence of corporate survival with all of its backbiting, wanton ambition and calculating cruelty where people's jobs are measured in accordance with what they can bring to the financial tables. Faye Dunaway is stunning in a role she was born to play. She exhibits all the qualities of ambitious vixen: cold, calculating, gorgeous and ruthless. William Holden gives an Oscar Worthy performance as the ill-fated executive who is torn between staying with his wife and having an affair with the manipulative Christensen. Peter Finch gives a bravura performance with admirable emotional range. He was awarded the Oscar for best actor posthumously due to his untimely death just weeks before the Academy Award shoe in 1977. Each of the main characters has a moment where they display a histrionic tirade including Robert Duvall and Ned Beatty, despite his brief screen time. Lofty speeches with moralistic underpinnings are frequent throughout the plot. It's as if you are watching a Shakespeare or Ibsen play. It may be a feel a bit over the top, but it's done well and the plot never lags.\n\nBlack comedies had their inception in the 1970's and I think this may be due to our country's growing cynicism and deteriorating faith in the system. But whatever the cause may be, Sidney Lumet's direction and Chayefsky's screenplay get it right for the most part. It is also true to say this film was prescient in its dismal view on society; we see many exploitative forms of entertainment today that are similar in principle as the ones shown in Network. Although this movie uses hyperbole the concept is credible. I am incredulous to the notion that a Program would collude with a Terrorist group for the sake of boosting ratings. I'm certain that couldn't fly for it would be too problematic in our country where law and order would have to intervene.\n\nAfter 40 years Network is still relevant and can be extrapolated to how we view TV today which can make us so mad that we can't take it anymore!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I first saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it several times since. Paddy Chayefsky's dark satirical story about a fourth place network's news department was nominated for 10 Academy Awards for 1976 and won four. It was the most nominated film cast in Academy history with five nominations for Peter Finch, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Beatrice Straight and Ned Beatty. It tied 1951's A Streetcar Named Desire that won Oscars for Viven Leigh, Kim Hunter and Karl Malden with Oscars for Peter Finch as Best Actor, Faye Dunaway as Best Actress and Beatrice Straight as Best Supporting Actress. William Holden as Max Shumacher, the head of the network news could have likely won the second Oscar of his career had Finch not died of a heart attack two months before the Academy Awards. Finch earned his Best Actor award for his portrayal of aging news anchor Howard Beale Stage actress Beatrice Straight, who did a lot of television roles but very few film roles in her career won Best Supporting Actress in a small on screen role as Louise Shumacher, the wife of the head of the network news for her passioned emotionally drained delivery of of some of Chayefsky's best dialog in the movie. Faye Dunaway won Best Actress as Diana Christiensen, the cold calculating Vice President of Programing. Chayefsky won for Best Screenplay the third Oscar of his career. He had previously won for another black comedy, 1971's The Hospital and for the tender drama Marty in 1955 adapted from his stage play. Director Sidney Lumet made his cast go through long grueling rehearsals as if they were doing a stage play which paid off in their interpretation of Chayefsky's script. Lumet had been a master director of human emotion with such films as Long Days Journey Into Night, The Pawnbroker, Fail Safe, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico and although nominated for Best Director he lost out to John Alvidsen for Rocky. Other nominations included Best Picture, Best Editing for Alan Heim and Best Cinematography for Owen Roizman. This film falls a little short for me but I would still give it a 9.0 out of 10 and recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "When thinking about the turmoil and the struggles that face us out in the real world. When, sometimes, you think that you have seen it all. When the controlling powers of the government, the corporate world and the press, continue to feed the paranoid masses the fact that they control the world, you are never surprised when something unbelievable becomes the believable, and of course, in the end, you are not surprised, because nothing surprises you anymore. That is what Network is able to show us. That no matter what we have seen in the news to this point in our lives, there is always something that will top that. The continuing struggle to be the best, in this case, the best of the media, can take an ugly and harmful turn. That in their attempts to claim as much money, power and accolades that they can, could turn a man into a pathetic, driveling, prophet that the people will follow in the masses.\n\nThis movie captures them all - greed, power, lust, competition, evangelism, sacrifice, betrayal, infidelity, corruption and evil - no matter the cost to others. The story given to us is near perfect and the unbelievable turn the film takes, actually, a couple times, is what enhances the corporeality of the story. It was also interesting to see how competitive Hollywood (in the theaters), still was with Hollywood (on the television), at this point in their 30 year (as of 1976), long competition. It really felt that the movie wanted to pummel the idea into our heads, as to, how destructive and evil television can be.\n\nThe acting in this movie reaches omnipotence, and every character is just riveting. The four main actors, Dunaway, Holden, Finch and Duvall are at the highest pinnacle, that Hollywood can offer, as well as the supporting cast (especially Ned Beatty). I did enjoy seeing a young (uncredited), Lance Henriksen cameo and a Ken Kercheval (of Dallas fame), sighting. I thoroughly enjoyed the directing and if it wasn't for some weird jump cuts and a continuity issue (wardrobe malfunction), with Dunaway, I would have gone totally A+ with this. What you get here, is a great time, on a Sunday evening, at the movies, and a lesson in why Hollywood is great.\n\n9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."

The plot takes place at a major television network, where ethics fly out the window in favor of good ratings. The film has a certain post-apocalyptic feeling to it, in the way that the human race just seems to have gone completely off its collective rocker and everyone is in defense mode, caring only about themselves to survive. It's either that, or just good ol' fashioned greed. Faye Dunaway's character is downright ferocious, while William Holden as Max seems to be one of the few left with any integrity whatsoever. Peter Finch plays a great crazy guy and delivers the film's most famous line, \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!!\" Although, for some reason the scene in which this line was delivered did not impact me the way I hoped it would, but the overall story was much more interesting than I expected. There's not much to offer in the way of costumes, sets, etc., but if you're looking for a great character movie full of tremendous acting, this is one of the best."

But, I watched another film by Network's screenwriter, Paddy. Chayefsky, called The Hospital before finally watching Network. I can't help but wonder if George C. Scott, the star from the earlier film, would have played Peter Finch's role had he not burned his bridges with the writer by feuding with him on set. It's hard to see a role with an angry, screaming mad man and not see Scott as the actor for it. Yes... I think it might have been a better film with Scott. But Finch, obviously, has the role of his life here and performs the hell out of it.\n\nThere were moments when I was distracted by Chayefsky's writing. I knew Faye Dunaway was a love interest for the much older William Holden as soon as she steps foot into his office. But at least her character is a career woman on equal footing with Holden and not a patient relative with the head of the hospital like in the Scott film. And, it's William Holden. Somehow, the shadow of his younger self makes the pairing believable. At times, Holden's character Max serves as a walking thesaurus. I learned new words from this film. And I love Victorian novels so that's saying something. Chayefsky's calling cards are obscure language, inconvenient May/December romance, and black power background characters judging from the Network and The Hospital. And the actors playing the revolutionaries given a stage on television are so good that I want to spend more time with them at points in the movie. The actress gives such humanity to her misguided character that you wonder if she could have really made it in life if she hadn't met that Ahmed guy.\n\nI should give a plot summary, but I'd rather not spoil anything for a first time viewer. Definitely a must see but it kind of implodes by the end... kind of like the whole network and Howard's life."

It felt a little too much like a sermon from someone who doesn't understand that the alternative to our reality being shaped by what we see on the screen is to create our own. In a way, that was what happened to Howard Beele.\n\nGiven all that, though, it was well acted and the script was not too heavy handed to make this film a classic that holds true even today, perhaps especially today. Faye Dunaway was perfect in her role of an emotionless woman who only cares about the ratings of her productions, while William Holden somehow managed to bring to the screen an exponent of decent values and responsible emotion.\n\nBottom line: a great satire on media consuming society and a movie that you should definitely watch."

After that the film becomes a wild fantasy of program planning run haywire, with the tube turning into an asylum for soothsayers, terrorists, and other assorted lunatics. Unfortunately, the outrageousness of the scenario makes it difficult to take seriously, and the timely warning of media manipulation soon degenerates into a series of shrill tirades by man-of-reason William Holden and mad-as-hell prophet Peter Finch. Chayefsky clearly had an axe to grind, and not without good reason (or sufficient entertainment value), but only after several decades of debased TV entertainment is it possible to appreciate just how ahead of its time the film really was."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a 1970's review, who's author I'm at an unfortunate loss to recall, it was prophecized that Network would be a huge commercial smash. Imagine that! Could a movie like this woo modern crowds who labor under the belief that by simply being enjoyable a movie is worthy? No. There is a pleasant lack of what in modern terms could be considered \"commercial appeal\", in fact there is not even a score to manipulate our emotions as the director sees fit, which alone merits praise. Our latter day Athenian crowds squeal like indignant pigs when their vices are questioned (\"If you don't like it, leave America\"), but regardless it should be done in the spirit of satire, at least. How wonderful then that Paddy Chayefsky does an extraordinary job. Yes, maybe the message will fall on deaf ears, as another review has stated. Perhaps we have embraced Jerry Springer as \"a crazy uncle\", and badly staged sex scenes on tv still makes us grunt like pigs in estrus; as long as there are people of reason, the truth of Chayefsky's indictment will not fade away. I believe that credit for the success of the picture can be divided equally among the Writer, the cast, and the director( yes, Hollywood folk out there who read this. The credit should not be the director, the cast, and then-lastly-the Writer), who perform their duties with the skill much lacking in the younger filmmakers of today. *sigh* Now if only ageism could be abolished in Hollywood, the teen demographic utterly forgotten, and innovative ideas given their day instead of being rewritten to be safe, yawn inducing cliches by illiterate \"writers\" with an eye toward a new Lexus.... Enjoy this crown jewel of cinema that could only have been made in the 70's, a great decade for movies. It did not earn Best Picture, of course(Rocky did) which I'd call it a crime, but given that the Academy of Motion Pictures has also awarded How Green Was My Valley Best Picture in the same year as the release of Citizen Kane, never gave Hitchcock an award, nor Stanley Kubrick, and among other laughable deeds gave Julia Roberts an oscar over Ellen Burstyn, the academy has rendered itself obsolete in mine eye."
