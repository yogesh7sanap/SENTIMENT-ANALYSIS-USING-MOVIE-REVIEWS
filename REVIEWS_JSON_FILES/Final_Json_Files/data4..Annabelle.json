I loved The Conjuring - this is nothing like The Conjuring. At all. It's a blatant cash-grab and a terrible one at that.\n\nThere is zero tension throughout this movie. Zero suspense. Everything is reliant on close ups of the dolls face to \"creep\" us out and really long periods of time where NOTHING HAPPENS. Literally, it's about this couple that we do not care about and their stupid problems which we care even less about. I don't know if they were trying to build suspense in these scenes but in order to build suspense you actually have to care about the characters. Or at least have, you know, suspense; a lingering sense of danger. This had nothing. And holy hell that ending.\n\nThe positives of this movie: The lead girl is beautiful. She's easy to look at. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. That's it. The characters are horrendous and the acting is even worse. Seriously if you're going to make a movie this awful at least have the decency to take an acting lesson or two. It's a dreadful watch. Please, don't waste your time with this cash grab sh*t stain. Don't give them the satisfaction. Watch something good like Sinister or 1408 - haunting movies done right."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start off by stating that as a devout Horror fan with a special liking to ghost stories, haunts and exorcisms, I have really enjoyed The Conjuring. Therefore, my anticipation towards this pseudo- prequel is to be understood, as well as my disappointment...\n\nPerhaps it was the fact that James Wan was only an executive producer of this film that has made it wreak of mediocrity, especially compared to the first. Most of this film's components are exactly that: mediocre. The acting lacked the charisma and screen presence of Patrick Wilson (Ed Warren in The Conjuring), though I must say that Alfre Woodard (Evelyn) and Tony Amendola (Father Perez) were certain light spots. The story feels like it came out of an automated template machine given the basic \"create me a mediocre haunting story\" order, and again, compared to The Conjuring simply doesn't make the cut.\n\nSo why the slightly generous rating? For a few reasons:\n\n1) Say what you will, that doll is one of the scariest, creepiest and most horrifying things I have ever seen both on screen and in life. Whoever created that doll's exterior should be either given a reward for being a genius or committed to a mental ward for being sick in the head (and I say that with the utmost respect, that doll is a work of art). Unlike The Conjuring, Annabelle gives the doll a lot more well deserved screen time.\n\n2) The cinematography is at its best with the quick shots, giving the audience sometimes less than a second to realize what they're seeing. Showing demons, ghosts and such evil presences in that manner really adds to the fear factor in my opinion, for Hollywood is yet to realize how to portrait a demon that is scary for those of us who aren't religious Christians (and I say that with no disrespect whatsoever to Christians or Christianity). I like to use Insidious (another Wanderful masterpiece, if you haven't seen it stop reading RIGHT NOW and go see it) as an example - the one thing really lowering that excellent film's level is the demon shown there. In Annabelle, demons are shown, but for a snap shot, leaving much to imagination which serves to add to the scare gauage.\n\n3) Plot actually gets pretty intense towards the end, but only towards the end.\n\nSo all in all, perhaps had I watched this film before The Conjuring I would have been able to be more objective, but seeing as how I am unable to ignore it's shortcomings - I give it 6.5, meaning you should definitely watch it (especially if you liked The Conjuring) but you shouldn't expect it to meet The Conjuring's level."

        "review_detailed_main": "There were only two, count em', two well constructed and (more importantly) scary sequences throughout this entire HORROR MOVIE (the home invasion part and the elevator bit). If that fact alone is enough to get one person not to watch \"Annabelle\", then I've done my job as a critic.\n\nIf you went into \"Annabelle\" wanting to see something along the lines of \"Child's Play\" or at the very least, a doll-centric horror movie where dolls are either animated in some fashion or at the very least, trip someone as they walk down the stairs, then you will be savagely disappointed. On the other hand, if you were a fan of the small snippet of Annabelle's story shown in \"The Conjuring\" and wanted a terrifying and in-depth origins story, then you\u0085will be disappointed as well.\n\nSynopsis: With an engaging set up, set against the rampant cult-phobia of the 60's, \"Annabelle\" is the story of a couple living in California who begin to experience paranormal occurrences after the husband gifts his pregnant, doll-crazed wife a doll, that soaks up blood faster than a Bounty paper towel. After that, the plot falls pretty flat by turning its focus away from the scary doll element, as the story becomes 10% \"Rosemary's Baby\", 20% every single haunted house movie ever and 70% watered down scares.\n\nAside from the fact that not for one second did I care about any of the characters here, for the most part director John R. Leonetti (the director of photography of \"The Conjuring\") does a lazy job of \"conjuring\" up scares. For about 80 minutes of this 98 minute film, every single scare follows the ultra uncreative quiet, quiet, quiet, LOUD, formula. About 20 minutes in, it becomes obvious that Leonetti is either just going through the motions or doing a rather poor job of plagiarizing much scarier films.\n\nFinal Thought: Much like the countless throw away, straight to DVD Disney animated sequels to come out of late the 90's and early 2000's (Pocahontas 2: Journey to a New World, The Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea, Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True\") \"Annabelle\" (a prequel) is nothing more than a soulless money-grab from this particular production company, attempting to feed off the success of \"The Conjuring\". No mention of Ed and Lorraine Warren (real life paranormal investigators from \"The Conjuring\") no James Wan (the director of \"The Conjuring\") and not one doll-induced scare, all seemed to have a hand in making \"Annabelle\" a strikingly forgettable film. I mean, in \"The Conjuring\", the Annabelle doll is only used in all of three scenes, but due to some smart direction, those are some of the scariest potions of the movie. In \"Annabelle\", the titular doll is used throughout and it's not even a little bit creepy. What gives?"

Sadly this is not the case. The movie was boring and predictable. The worst thing was that they have this terrifying creature-object-thing to make good use of and they failed miserably at using it. I'm genuinely disappointed at the reuse of the same old washed up horror storyline. How'd this script even get approved??! booo!

        "review_title": "As a horror film, Annabelle is technically effective but lacks a good story and the finesse of a seasoned film maker.",
        "review_detailed_main": "As a prequel and spin-off of The Conjuring \u2013 2013's highly effective horror film \u2013 Annabelle does what it promises, even if it does so one jump and one jolt at a time. But that's all you get, jumpy scenes done to perfection, with little or no atmosphere and a story that disintegrates before it reaches a satisfying conclusion.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of The Conjuring and older sibling Insidious (both films directed by James Wan), is the cinematography and how it wreaks havoc with the viewer's peripheral vision. By this I am referring to events occurring off-center, or in some corner of the screen that is oblivious to on-screen characters but very obvious to the viewer. Consider a scene where a mother watches over her new born baby. The scene is shot in the living room where the right half of the frame is composed of the mother and her baby and the left half is a hallway that leads to other rooms in the house. Without shifting focus from the mother and child, we see something or someone lurking in the hallway behind; something that shouldn't be there in the first place. While this tactic is nothing new to horror-thrillers, it works for the whole purpose of inducing dread, thick and slow, before the actual jolt hits a few seconds later. The scariest scenes in Annabelle are made up of these moments, and at times we are left guessing what lurks in the corners. And is probably why cinematographer John R Leonetti of those preceding films is tasked with directorial duties in this film, while Wan himself is bumped up to producer. Leonetti plays it safe by treading down Wan's beaten path but without any surprises of his own.\n\nPlaying the aforementioned mother is Annabelle Wallis (freaky coincidence?) as Mia Gordon. Mia has a doll collection, one of which is the titular vintage doll gifted by her medical student husband John (Ward Horton). After surviving a horrific attack from a satanic cult, the Gordons have new guests that won't leave. At first Mia starts seeing things and becomes increasingly paralysed by fear while John begins to doubt her sanity. It's a stock approach to crying wolf in horror movies. It takes a while to dawn on them that something has latched on to Annabelle, making the doll a conduit with increasing intent on harming them and their new born baby. Consultations with a librarian and a priest reveal far greater implications, thus leaving these young parents to ward off hell by going right through it.\n\nOn one hand, the look and feel in this film is a copy-paste version of Insidious, but concentrated with sporadic moments of numbing fright. We've seen it before in classic horror films \u2013 young parents who must literally go through hell to save their child's soul. It's the same concept here but effective enough for a low budget horror film. Like a stern disciple, Leonetti is on par with Wan's technical approach. Cinematography, hair raising sound design (including deliberate moments without sound), and some decent tension will garner a few screams from the audience, but that's about it. On the downside, there isn't much of a story for a script based on real events and don't even expect anything along the lines of an animated '\u00c7hucky' doll. It's not about what the doll can do but about what's in the doll -If only they had built on that frame of thought. After some well-timed jump scares in the first half, all we are left with is a murky conclusion owing to underwritten supporting cast members whose inclusion leaves the ending stale and cheap."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the first, rather scary, scene in the Conjuring, featuring the Annabelle doll, I wondered, what kind of woman would ever buy a doll that creepy looking? Apparently no one. Since the real Annabelle was in fact a simple Raggedy Ann doll. This movie purports to tell the whole story behind the doll, almost none of which conforms with reality (meaning the \"true\" story as it was given to and told by the Warrens). We meet a bland, prosaic young couple about to have a child. The wife has a doll collection decorating the child's room (Before she knows if it's a girl or boy), and the husband buys her the Annabelle doll, which is supposedly an expensive collector's item meant to match two similar dolls. Following an attack by two cult members who lived next door, the Annabelle doll becomes possessed, doing usual ghost things like operating a sewing machine, and record player. Later, she seemingly tries to kill the baby in its womb, contradicting the later explanation that the doll is a demon host looking for an innocent soul. Luckily, a kindly mystical black woman owns a nearby bookstore with a well-stocked occult section. The wife and her friend discover the name of the cult to which the neighbors belonged, but use absolutely none of the information to defeat the doll. In fact, there are many threads that dangle and go nowhere. We meet two children who seemingly draw pictures of the baby being hit by a truck, and then the children are never seen again, and bear no relevance to the plot. The fact that the mystic new age black woman is willing to go to any length to protect this bland white family may strike some as offensive, especially since it appears nowhere in the actual story. Like most films of this nature, it is practically an advertisement for the Catholic Church and Christian religion in general. The Warrens also investigated the Amityville story, whose victims were also Catholic, and the book featured an introduction by a Catholic priest. Essentially, these stories say, for better or worse, that Catholics are the religion feared by the devil, and the only ones capable of eliminating supernatural threats from demons. The Warrens, in fact, keep the doll in a case protected with a cross, and blessed by a priest. As for the movie itself, it features a couple good jump scares. There are a couple scenes strongly reminiscent of Japanese horror (Dark Water and the Grudge especially). I've seen this type of movie done better and much worse. I have no idea why the R rating, except possibly the religious iconography and injury to a priest and pregnant woman. But honestly, this could play on television barely edited, if at all. You can definitely wait for this title on video."

I'm a fan of the Conjuring as it was a film that made me think the art of a horror movie is back.\n\nFirst off... this isn't made by James Wan... it's made by it's filmographer so off of the bat you're probably going to get some cool scenes but perhaps lack of character development. The budget of Annabelle is $5 million (that's 1/4 of what the Conjuring cost). Let me tell you the script is the weakest part of this film.\n\nThe movie starts off slow... this is where the film should really get you into the characters but there isn't much here, it's generic. It's the weakest part of the film. You have your standard couple... man goes to work, woman stays home and experiences weird stuff. The problem with this is that it's hard for you to bother to relate to the characters. This kind of kills the film for me. There were actually a lot that could have been explored but they didn't touch like the kids in the apartment.\n\nNow the good. There is very little CGI - perhaps none. It's all old school. This is something that anyone could actually film.... chair moving, oven is on, someone standing there. It's good. It works. There's a great scene here with a baby. Are there enough scares? Not really. The pay off for the film felt like they might have fixed the movie for censors but even though the film is Rated R.\n\nThere's a lot missing in this film. It's not horrible. It's worth a rental. It's your average horror movie."

There were a lot of missed opportunities where genuinely scary things could be done.

        "review_detailed_main": "Quickie Review:\n\nMia (Annabelle Wallis) and John (Ward Horton) are a happy couple who survive a home invasion by two satanic cultists attempting to perform a ritualistic murder. Following the horrific events, they start experiencing supernatural occurrences involving a doll owned by the couple. Let the horror begin\u0085 or not. Annabelle is the clich\u00e9d example of bad horror movies. It is cheap in all respects, cheap acting, cheap story, and most of all cheap scares. Avoid this movie unless you want to fall asleep like a baby, which is obviously contradictory to this movie's objective.\n\nFull Review:\n\nFor those who don't know, Annabelle is a prequel/spin-off from the movie The Conjuring directed by James Wan. The Conjuring was a great horror movie that kept me up at night, at least for a little while. So I was more than looking forward to Annabelle for a good scare this Halloween season. Instead I was hugely disappointed and felt I wasted my time.\n\nUsually with my reviews I start with the positives, so here they are: haunting creature's design is interesting, and\u0085 oh there is this one other freaky scene. That's it, that's all I got.\n\nThis movie was so bad that I felt like I was watching a parody of horror films. This movie could have been called Scary Movie 29 and it would've made more sense, but no, we have Annabelle. So let's talk about the acting shall we. Now for horror movies I don't need Oscar level acting, of course not. But they at least have to be functional enough to convey some kind of concern or fear. Instead the actors are more wooden than the doll we are supposed to be scared of. This brings me to the scariness of the film, or lack thereof. There are literally two scenes that were genuinely creepy and unique, but both of those combined comes to about a 1min in the total run time of the movie. The rest of the scares are all horror clich\u00e9s like staring long at the doll with creepy music, or woman walks past a doorway, or now it's a little girl walking a past a doorway. Even the way they place the shots of the scenes are so obvious that you already looking at the spot you know the \"scare\" is supposed to come from.\n\nAll in all this is just lazy filmmaking. It's as if they took a bucket, filled it every basic horror trick, and dumped it on the big screen. I have litmus test for the effectiveness of these movies: do I leave the lights on longer than I should before going to bed and/or do I need to watch some comedy show episodes. Annabelle fails on both, that's also considering I walked home alone in the dark because my bike was broken. So if you looking for a good scary movie or even good movie in general, avoid this at all costs.\n\nCheck out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "We have met the creepy vintage doll Annabelle before in last year's excellent and very memorable horror film \"The Conjuring.\" She was just the front act there, showing up only at the pre-opening credits sequence. This year, we get to know Annabelle more and how she came to be demonically possessed.\n\nThe setting of this film is in the 1960s in a California suburb. Young couple John and Mia are expecting their first child. One day, John surprises Mia, who was a vintage doll collector, with a huge antique doll with painted ivory face wearing white satin dress adorned by a red bow. It just so happened that same night, crazy satanic cultists attack their home and there was resulting bloodshed. However, since that night, there was no more peace in John and Mia's household, especially after she gives birth to their daughter, Leah.\n\nI liked the throwback look of this film, with its faded color palette and meticulous production design. The architecture, interior design, fashion, hairstyles, television shows, pop music all captured the era so well. Even the look of cutie baby Leah was vintage, like the Gerber baby. These things also contributed to the scariness factor because of the limitation of technology that the characters have on hand.\n\nA big part of the success of \"Annabelle\" as a horror film is the effective lead performance of coincidentally-named Annabelle Wallis as Mia. The character's name Mia, I am guessing, is a tribute to Mia Farrow, who was the star of a horror classic of the 1960s, \"Rosemary's Baby.\" The stroller Mia uses for Leah sure looked like Rosemary's stroller which is seen in posters of that old film. Ms. Wallis has an elegant beauty and her acting was sympathetic without becoming cheesy.\n\nWard Horton plays Mia's husband John, who is a medical student, which makes a convenient excuse for him to be a skeptic and always on call during the night, leaving Mia in the house watching television or working on her sewing machine. Veteran actress Alfre Woodard is the only familiar face in the cast, and she plays their helpful neighbor Evelyn. Her character though had a story arc which probably the only negative thing I could say about this film.\n\nJohn R. Leonetti, the cinematographer of \"Insidious 1 & 2\" and \"The Conjuring\" makes an auspicious directorial debut with \"Annabelle.\" He learned very well from his his previous director James Wan, who sits as producer of this film. You can see he has the eye for the perfect views for the most effective suspense and surprise.\n\nI liked the cinematography that employs camera angles that give you the point of view of the tormented victim so that you too do not know what will happen next. The suspense could be so intense so many times, with the excellent editing and splicing of scenes together accompanied by a swelling crescendo of music. The timing for the big jump scare was effectively surprising most of the time, even you were sort of predicting it to happen already.\n\nThis is a film which may divide audiences as to whether it could match the successes of \"Insidious\" or \"The Conjuring.\" As it is, I liked \"Annabelle\" more than I thought I would. I was expecting the worst, since I hated how the Annabelle doll looked and I can't imagine anyone wanting one like it in their house. However, the film managed to transcend that limitation and actually create genuine scares that worked."

        "review_detailed_main": "Annabelle is one of those horror movies that has the formula that we are all used to. A lot of jump scares. The acting wasn't great, but I did like the story. It had better cinematography that most horror films. There were a lot of shots that were pleasing to the eye. It is not nearly as good as The Conjuring, but its worth watching. The doll is pretty creepy throughout the film. The one thing that killed it for me is that you did not really feel attached to the characters. I think they could have done way better with the casting. In the end, you didn't really care what happened to them. Overall, Annabelle is not as good as The Conjuring. Wait till you can red box this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen a great many horror films, far more than is probably healthy. I have seen some excellent ones, many good ones, a great many terrible ones, but remarkably few boring ones.\n\nThis, most definitely, falls into that last category.\n\nAfter rewatching the excellent Conjuring again I decided to go through the whole series in release order, and what a fall from grace!\n\nThe characters are so two dimensional even the familiarity of clich\u00e9 is largely lost. The father basically doesn't need to be in the movie, he brings so little to the proceedings. The mother never feels desperate to save her family. The priest held so much potential but again was effectively pointless. Of them all, I wanted to see more of the bookshop owner, but again, too little too late.\n\nThe effects, such as there were, were OK. The lift scene was pretty good, and the girl running through the door scene (if you've seen it, you know it) was very well done, but everything else was... boring. Long, lingering shots of a doll (that doesn't move). Occasional glimpses of a demon\\devil\\monster (that was unthreatening). The occasional child giggling far off, because why not; babies are known to giggle like 5 year olds.\n\nEven the setting was lacking. The Conjuring *felt* like the 1970s. This film just proves you need more than a few old background cars and a knackered radio to give that vibe.\n\nOverall, this felt like two films: The first 40mins is a haunted house movie, the next 50mins is a monster movie, and neither of them are scary or particularly well done. I could have excused a great deal if I'd been given characters I could root for or sympathise with, an antagonist to fear or hate, or even effects to be impressed by if I was really desperate. This gave none of that.\n\nHave I seen worse horror movies? Yes, absolutely. But it's a rare thing to find one that made me seriously consider giving up half way through."

Annabelle gives an adrenaline rush to your body with few scary scenes and spooky moments. Only I wish , it could have been more.\n\nMysterious things begins to fall on a couple once they move into the apartment. Sooner they seek help from the Father of a nearby church offers to help them resolve the happenings and ward off the evil that is scaring their daughter to death.\n\nFirst time director, John R. Leonetti does a fine job . The story is mediocre along with loose screenplay. I felt that there were some chilling moments in the film but not enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Couple of scenes will give you a jilt - The scenes where evil starts unraveling on the family , the moment Father enters the house and realizes the evil spirit latching on the family and finally the climax scene has been filmed brilliantly. Cinematography is good. Art direction is enduring. Editing is just about okay. It is Annabelle Wallis who is the soul of the film. She is fill of expression and gives in a great performance thoroughly supported by Viola Davis.\n\nOverall , a spooky thriller which has some scary scenes to entertain you along with decent direction and outstanding performances. Decent 2.75 / 5"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay folks. This not an Oscar film for sure. It is also not ground breaking by any means. Hell the only thing even remotely true about the film is the first maybe three minutes. This is every horror movie you have ever seen rolled into one. One minute you feel like your watching Rosemary's Baby. Then Rosemary is in the Amityville house. The next moment here comes Chucky with even a little Helter Skelter thrown into the mix. But everything I could say that is wrong with this film is exactly why it works. it embraces its cheese factor. Even revels in it at times. The film has some great scares and in a few cases some real interesting ones. It is just simply a lot of fun to watch with a lot of people. So much so, when Annabelle reveals herself fully you find yourself really into it. I thought the ending was weak but by the time you get to the end it would be very hard to raise the level suspense any higher. There is a scene with a sewing machine and Jiffy Pop which I think should go down in horror movie history for the right way to build suspense. It was funny listening to the audiences nervous giggles as something was about to happen. Go to this as entertainment and nothing more. Nothing deep here. Very little real here. It is based on a true story. However, based is a very loose word here. Three minutes is based upon a true story. Just good October fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Annabelle is a very simple horror film that follows the doll Annabelle from the film The Conjuring. While The Conjuring was a powerhouse of a film, Annabelle seems like a quick cash grab from the producers and studio. This film doesn't have the same feeling that directing icon James Wan brings to his horror films. While the film is not a total wash out, it might not be for everyone. The following is my review of Annabelle.\n\nThe film was written by Gary Dauberman, who is only known for his much smaller direct to home video horror films. In Annabelle you can clearly tell Dauberman wasn't playing with a full deck of cards. The story follows Mia(Annabelle Wallis) and John(Ward Horton). This young married couple is about to welcome their first child into the world, when John brings Mia a gift. The gift is of course the doll. From this point onward things start to go haywire for Mia and her family. The priest comes in, and you have heard it all before. Nothing new or exciting at all. The film holds pretty well together for the most part, and moves by very quickly, meaning it doesn't really drag on it spots. While it clearly doesn't have the energy of a James Wan horror film, the pacing and characters work well overall. Of course characters as always in a horror film have to make questionable decisions but, that is to be expected. Overall Gary Dauberman gets a barely passable grade for this film.\n\nThe film was directed by John R. Leonetti, who was the Cinematographer from The Conjuring. This is also the first major film he has directed in seventeen years. This film relies mostly on jump scares to get the audience into this. A seasoned horror fan like myself doesn't fall for that kind of gag. Other than the jump scares there is nothing that will make you scared of this film. For a film that takes place in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the film fits perfectly with nothing out of place, fine detail. That adds a great element to the film. The Conjuring takes the cake in that regard if you want to compare the two outings. The acting just over average. Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton work very well together, and the secondary actors fill other voids nicely. For a genre that mostly offers up awful acting, this film should be proud of delivering something that is not poor. At the end of the day this film is simply filler until the next Conjuring movie, and Leonetti took the paycheck as he knew it was going to be a giant success. Leonetti does a passable job with Annnabelle but, he is nowhere near the legend that is James Wan.\n\nThe film was scored by Joseph Bishara, who not only scored The Conjuring, but also worked on the James Wan film Insidious and Insidious 2. The score in this film is not as good overall as The Conjuring but, Bishara still delivers some creepy music throughout the film to keep up the tension. So, overall Bishara completes this spin off film with flying colors.\n\nIn closing, Annabelle at the end of the day is a horror film that is meant to fill time before The Conjuring 2 is released next year. Taking a character from that film and spinning into it's own film was smart by the producers but, it leaves an overall average feeling in my opinion. Fans of the genre will rush out to see this film on opening weekend, much like I did. Others who may not be that into this genre or maybe didn't enjoy The Conjuring should sit this one out. A home video rental or stream is the best bet overall in my opinion.\n\n5.4/10"

ALSO! the scene were she drops her keys and the stroller goes rolling in the street and once the stroller gets hit she all of a sudden has her baby in her hand.... so many scenes were this movie just did not have any common sense. They could of had a better director do this movie because this movie was a waste of time I'm glad I watched it online through a website that was free rather then going to go spend my money this weekend to watch the film in theaters. this movie was awful and that's just my honest opinion."

Really liked both 'The Conjuring' films so watched 'Annabelle', which has garnered a lot of comparisons to especially the first film (having been released before the second, though saw 'Annabelle' after seeing the 'Conjuring' films) hoping it would be in similar vein, purposefully not reading too many reviews (those read disappointingly indicating otherwise).\n\n'Annabelle' unfortunately turned out to be a disappointment. Have definitely seen far worse films, horror and overall (it's not even one of the worst of 2014), 'Annabelle' is not irredeemable. It sadly has a lot of faults that makes it a very lacklustre film, and if briefly comparing it to 'The Conjuring' it is nowhere near being in the same ball park.\n\nIt is a shame because it does start off very well. It is creepy to start with and the Manson-esque attack is unsettling and staged very well. It looks good too, nicely shot and the set design and late 60s setting are both beautiful and atmospheric to look at.\n\nSimilarly well done is the score, which does have many haunting moments. The titular character has moments of creepiness.\n\nUnfortunately, there are times where she could have done with more expression. 'Annabelle's' biggest problems though is that when it goes downhill, which it does do rapidly far too early, it is not scary, nor is it particularly interesting. Tension and suspense is nowhere near enough and the too infrequent scares are obvious and going-through-the-motions like. Didn't feel much palm-sweating or heart-stopping here. Much of it is basically formulaic storytelling, that is also on the dull side, and a constant ticking off of predictable shocks and familiar genre tropes, the type of scares the film is over-reliant on having no build up or suspense.\n\nFurthermore, 'Annabelle' has a banal script that has no flow or substance and direction that suggests their heart was not in it or at ease with the material. The pacing on the most part is perfunctory and the acting has little distinction, not amateurish but nobody stands out. The characters are not easy to engage with with so little development or much personality, while the ending is one big rushed anti-climax and things do get ridiculous and silly as the film progresses to an increasingly intensifying degree.\n\nConcluding, lacklustre. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't say that Annabelle is a good film. There's nothing original about it. But I can say that I found it to be fine and pleasant to watch. Sure, there are a number of well executed scares, but its 1969 setting and cinematography by James Kniest provide it with a dreamy quality. Annabelle isn't about gore. It's that rare film these days that aims to scare you by building dread with patience and restraint. Director John R. Leonetti should be applauded for this. The best executed sequence occurs at the beginning of the film when we get to see what happens to Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John Form's (Ward Horton) neighbors through their bedroom window. On the downside the script by Gary Dauberman just doesn't have enough good material for the film's 99 minute running time. Just like in The Conjuring (2013) there is a buildup of scares until the shocking ending, but in Annabelle this becomes repetitive because the scares are practically the same. This didn't bother me much though because Wallis and Horton are charismatic enough actors to make us care about Mia and John. I definitely liked them more than the characters in The Conjuring. It's not hard to realize that Annabelle is influenced by Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. While it's not as good as that 1968 film, Annabelle is still a good time at the movies and I recommend it. The film may seem like a cash grab after the success of The Conjuring, but Leonetti and the actors turned it into something enjoyable."

It really keeps up the scares and frights and tries to keep them at a good pace throughout the movie.\n\nNow this is by no means better than The Conjuring but it is pretty close. The doll is terrifying and I imagine a lot of people won't be looking at their dolls the same again after watching this."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's Thursday night and you know what that means. Yes, it's time for another movie review. The month of Halloween begins with a blockbuster kicker, with the first horror movie of the season, Annabelle. With James Wan pulling out of the director chair, his legacy has been left open for other directors to take over. Well open season is over, for the infamous doll of the Conjuring has now got a movie of her own. Can Wan's big shoes be filled, or has the train of good horror movies run out of steam, leaving us again with Hollywood knock offs.\n\nLet's get down to the question you want answered. Is Annabelle scary? Well for this reviewer the answer is\u0085 kind of. Like it's predecessor, this movie is a combination of jump out at you scares and creepy, paranormal activity. Blended together in decent harmony, audience members will get a nice variety of ways to make you squirm in your chair, and possibly scream. For this reviewer, the creepier aspects involved objects turning on randomly, or the random trail of pictures dropped by a devious shadow. Such random acts seem silly, but it's the subtle play of light, a thing you catch off to the side that really penetrates your core. We've all been spooked by something in the corner of our eye and this movie plays on it.\n\nLike Wan, director John R. Leonetti also is not afraid to have his monsters come out during the day. Yes, no manner of light can keep the creatures at bay, again removing a barrier that we normally turn too. Yet this movie takes it one step further and takes the creature out of the residence. Most movies keep the spirit isolated to one area, but Annabelle's wrath escapes out into the open, following our heroine and her cohorts around. This may not affect some, but for a few latecomers to the theater, they were not happy to lose that comfort. Such alterations in haunting strategies is what the horror world has needed, giving it a little extra kick to the scare factor that many films in this genre have been lacking.\n\nOf course the creepiest thing in this movie is none other than the doll herself. As I mentioned a year ago, Annabelle has the design that will chill just about anyone to the bones. In this movie we are given an exponential increase in that factor, the seemingly innocent doll being scarier than the thing tied with it. Her cold lifeless stare has a menacing glare to it behind those, pristine blue eyes. The charismatic grin holding a comfortable welcome laced with malice and evil and all of it is wrapped in a porcelain white package. What adds a little more scariness to it, is seeing the doll wind up in the strangest places. As the trailers state, it starts with a simple change in poster, but gradually turns to her ending up in the weirdest places that will make you cautious in your own room. Throw in the fact that her features morph over the course of the film, eventually into movement and well you get some factors that might have you screaming \"Oh snap!\" into the air.\n\nWith all these factors you might think this movie is the scariest thing I've seen. Unfortunately that is not the case. The first reason is a big one, the trailers have shown you most of the scary scenes. That's right, a majority of the jump out at you moments and creepy happenings have been laid out for you in all their details. Sure there is a little editing to cover things up, and you haven't heard the spine tingling music that adds a little spice, but you'll see most of the moments coming. A second factor to the lack of scariness is that once again the camera foreshadows when things are going to jump out at you. The cessation of motion, the sudden quietness, they are still the classic factors to give away the \"surprise\" they had planned. Finally the third factor is the actual denizen that is using the doll. For the last year we've wondered what invisible tormentor was behind Annabelle, and in this film it is revealed. While the revelation was incredibly creepy, the actual look of the beast paled in creepiness to the doll. Yeah, the make up and special effects are good, and it's hiding in the shadows helps add a little edge, but one can see the aspects that inspired it's creation.\n\nWhat else does Annabelle have to offer? Well the story is not that bad, for writer Dauberman has done a nice job tying in character development with the horror aspect of it. However, the plot of this genre has lost the ability to be unique, and we have seen this tale told in previous movies, though the ending is halfway decent. As for the acting, they did a good job for this film with Annabelle Wallis being the main star of the show. Wallis does a great job playing the wife driven to the point of delusion, balancing her expected screams and whimpers with a decent dialogue. She impressed me even more with her delivery of her lines, the wavering voice a nice touch to emphasize the terror she faced.\n\nAnnabelle is a decent prequel filled with the elements that made The Conjuring the ride it was. While the movie has been ruined by the trailers, this reviewer would say to give this a shot. Again, it's not the best installment I've seen, but it provides a good opening for the month of horror. My scores for this movie are:\n\nHorror: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0"

        "review_detailed_main": "When you see films advertised \"from the producers of\" or \"From the makers of\" it means virtually nothing. \"From the director or writer of\" is a different story. All the other taglines just are discussing where the money comes from. In other words, James Wan's creative talent is absent from this attempt to make something of the Annabelle story that opened the Conjuring. I think most everyone knows that the doll is more or less inanimate in the film which is a smart move. After 3 decades of Chucky walking around with knife in hand, doll's have lost their ability to scare on their own. So a back story of demon possession and such was brought into play. Annabelle Wallis who plays the main character Mia is an excellent actress , but in this role she is about as forgettable as they come.If you want to see Annabelle Wallis do some great work watch Peaky Blinders on Netflix. The third best TV show ever behind Breaking Bad and The Wire.\n\nI was not familiar with Ward Horton but thought he was good in the role of her husband. The biggest name in the film is the talented Alfre Woodard who is wasted in what has to be the most illogical and poorly written character in the film. She runs a bookstore that has lots of books about demons and the devil, so you figure she may make the story a bit more interesting. No such luck, the writer manages to even waste that angle. Her fate is to be the centerpiece for the lousiest horror film finale in years. Her actions and fate are ridiculous.\n\nThere is an obligatory priest that played by Tony Amendola that sets up a couple good scares. And there are 3 or 4 times that you will probably jump, but 2 or three of those scenes are in the trailer. Usually a reviewer will say of a weak film, wait till it hits DVD, but my recommendation for Annabelle is if you want to waste you time on it, pay to see it in the theater where the loud sounds and the big screen will deliver a couple good jolts. If I had rented this film on DVD I would never have finished it. There will be a Conjuring 2 next year, and like it's predecessor, it will probably be a great film, but any similarity between this and the Conjuring, begins and ends with an inanimate doll."

Soon after that scary things start happening to them. The wife is a typical dumb horror movie character and much of the movie consists of scenes of her alone in the house hearing a noise and then going to check it out only to be frightened by a jump scare (The lights in the house don't work because of course they don't). This happens multiple times throughout the movie. There is one legit creepy scene involving a demon in a dark room but other than that it's pretty pointless and bad.\n\nThis is typical B horror trash which is cheap to make but for whatever reason people flock to see it in the cinema so it makes a ton of money. Because this was cheap to make and it made money there's now sequels. Buy a sandwich instead."

Not 100% sure why I think it was more of a portable case so they can carry around to take on lectures . and feed naughty kids to . They wore protected gloves and said a prayer then lifted her from its place and placed into the other case then said another prayer. It was a interesting watch but not much to it and only lasted around 8mins, I was expecting a bit more, example a bit of history and background of the doll & story, and maybe a closer look of the doll before putting it into its case ..\n\nNow let's be fair we all have some interest in supposedly true stories like these . I say supposedly because I'm referring to ghost \\ possession \\ haunted etc stories like Amityville horror etc where stories of serial killers we know are true and did happen . Now to me I honestly don't believe the whole Annabella story and there no real proof to back it up except the owners story ...and what they say\n\nNow if you don't know anything about the story films like these slightly irritate me because it had no real connection at all about the doll except the film was based on a doll and really used Annabella name to cash in and get a wider and bigger audience. And if you don't know that then you would walk away from the cinema thinking this was the story... After all i had to once explain to someone paranormal activity wasn't true .. But she wouldn't have it because at the end before titles it gave a brief outline of the story as if it was true and because of that she believed it was true otherwise why write that at the end ..face palm\n\nThe film itself was half decent and watchable but several element's of the film annoyed me , like for starters scare tactics .. Was there any ? Where the music suddenly BOOMs making you reach for the remote control ready to turn it down..and making you jump in same way as if you walking along street and a friend jumped out from nowhere and loudly shouted boo, NO need that's not scare tactics more of giving you a bloody heart attack tactics, a horror will scare you and keep you edge of your seat on what's happening with atmospheric music in the background. Several scenes reminded me of other horrors like Exorcist and omen where she was pushing the pram with the child in, she had both hands on the pram, then suddenly bent down to pick her keys up that she dropped, while doing so the pram rolled into the road and got hit by a truck.. But that's OK the child was safe because she had hold of it in her arms close to her chest. was this some sort of magic trick to impress pen & teller I like to know if it fooled them in how she did it.\n\nPersonally if I was to watch a story based on something true like a doll , I would watch a independent film of it than a Hollywood film for several reason, but main reason being is the makers of the indie film would research the story and try to stick as closely as they could to supposedly the real facts, where the Hollywood film would put there own spin on it and exaggerate to suit themselves ."

It's does nothing new, relies entirely on jump scares which aren't scary and has weak performances from everyone except Tony Amendola, who is good. It's also full of plot holes and has a confusing ending that completely contradicts what the film has established. The worst entry in The Conjuring franchise so far."

        "review_detailed_main": "this movie is very under rated. And no... it isn't perfect; but this is a great prequel to the Conjuring. People went into this movie expecting James Wan's genius, only to realize by the end that this isn't directed by James Wan. However the directer still did a great job. The movie takes it's time with getting you attached to the characters and you want them to survive. The scares in this movie were much better than i expected but unfortunately the trailer spoiled a few of them. Returning to my summary: the overall ratings and critics reviews are severely under rated. I believe this happened because people saw Annabelle and thought \"Oooh The Conjuring 2\". The movie is not perfect but it was entertaining which is more than i can say for many another \"Horrors\" I have seen and it was epic to find out the origins of Annabelle."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Annabelle\" is a spin-off of the 2013 hit \"The Conjuring\". That film was so successful and critically acclaimed that you honestly cannot blame the producers for wanting to squeeze the formula like a lemon and exploit every possible side story or creep-factor that can be exploited. As far as I remember, the porcelain doll Annabelle was simply a piece of eerie scenery in the original, but barely one year later it thus received its very own and hyped full-length feature film. It's certainly not a bad idea, but they overlooked one small but important little detail: \"The Conjuring\" was directed by James Wan, and he just happens to be one of the most gifted young directors of the new millennium. Wan has an incredible eye for sinister atmosphere, and all his horror films (\"Saw\", \"Dead Silence\", \"Insidious\", \"The Conjuring\") are intense & horrifying. John R. Leonetti, on the other hand, is a decent cinematographer but a very mediocre director. Under his leadership, \"Annabelle\" is hardly more than a standard ghost-movie with predictable jump-moments and lukewarm scares. In 1970, in California, John and Mia live in a peaceful church community and are anxiously awaiting the birth of their first child. The loving husband he is, John managed to purchase a large porcelain doll for Mia's collection, and it promptly receives an honoree place in the baby room. Shortly after, members of a deranged satanic cult invade their home and one of them is shot dead by the police whilst holding the Annabelle doll in her arms. I reckon you can easily guess what happens next, right? Although linked to \"The Conjuring\", \"Annabelle\" feels more reminiscent to the original \"Child's Play\" and one of the numerous movies about the crimes committed by the followers of Charles Manson. In \"Child's Play', prior to dying, serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) transfers his soul into a toy doll via occult spells, but here this seemingly happens automatically with the porcelain doll. The crazed Satanists are more than obviously modeled after the Manson Family members that murdered actress Sharon Tate and her friends. There are a handful of noteworthy sequences, but Leonetti focuses too much on the spooky doll's face rather than on plot development. Even the best sequences are derivative, like the little girls foreboding drawings, and the climax is extremely unsatisfying. Who is this Evelyn woman, anyways?"

I also loved the 70s vibe, and the lead actress Annabelle Wallis playing Mia was also excellent.\n\nthe movie had its shares of scares, jump out of your seat surprises but nothing over the top, it might not be as scary as people might be expecting and hence some of the negative reviews here from other users. However, I thought the movie was well balanced and relied mainly on story and character rather than being overtly scary, which was perfect in my opinion and it what made it so good and successful in my eyes.\n\nI highly recommend this, a good Horror film to start October with and prepare for Halloween. go watch it"

In fact, I preferred Annabelle to The Conjuring because it wasn't overrated, which I felt The Conjuring was.\n\nMost of the reviews for this film were negative, so I went into it expecting it to be another clich\u00e9d, occasional-jump-scare type film that seems to be just like most modern horror films at the moment. Luckily, it turns out these reviews were wrong, and it turned out to be quite a good horror flick with some effective scare scenes. There aren't any well known actors in it but they actually do a decent job. Annabelle Wallis was the best actor for me, playing the lead role of Mia.\n\nThere are some really cool original ideas to build the tension in this film, my favourite being the elevator scene, which really made you feel on edge.\n\nOK, there are some moments in the film that are a bit slow and sometimes they resort to a cheap jump scare if something hasn't happened in a while, but overall Annabelle delivers exactly what you'd want from a pre-Halloween horror film. Don't watch this film expecting to see a perfect story line and amazing acting, but do expect to see some pretty cool tense scenes and a decent scare now and then."

The amount of either jump scare and suggested are well balanced making it enjoyable to watch, in a nutshell the ambiance that is settled is disturbing and is supposed to be.\n\nOnly blind spot the actor play that can be qualified as not as good as the overall execution, briefly said if you're looking for a good scare and potentially the better horror movie of 2014 this is a serious contender.\n\nMake your impression as well and go see it, definitely worth it"

The actress Annabelle Wallis act so good, I've never see her in a horror movie and she makes a great work. When I saw the doll I think how much she is ugly, \"God have Mercy of your Soul\" is the slogan of the movie, The priest (Tony Amendola) act better than \"The legend of Zorro\" and the others movies who act. In The Conjuring the haunt is a horrible witch, something more human. In the Annabelle the things are more scary and creepy with a mysterious demon with a black and creepy face."

        "review_detailed_main": "*sighs* Just when you thought they were going in a positive direction in horror movies after The Conjuring. This. Is a biiiiiiiig step backwards. James Wan and Leigh Whannel's involvement in this flick was limited to only as producers rather than screenwriters and directors as they did The Conjuring. Yeah, you can see the problem can you?\n\nSo, the story. A wife and husband are living in a house and the wife is pregnant and is only days away from giving birth. Suddenly, the wife is attacked by crazy people who are part of a cult that are influenced by an evil force. An evil force that seems to be coming from\u2014you guessed it, Annabelle the doll. The mother then gives birth to their baby and as the doll stays with the family, more and more supernatural incidents occur.\n\nOh man, where do I begin with this? First of all, that's not even what the doll looks like in real life. Google it and see what how inaccurate it is. And the biggest problem of all? These jump scares are SO clich\u00e9d and so predictable, it is nowhere near entertaining in the least. The characters aren't even that interesting or not event that intelligent. I know people have to be stupid in horror flicks, but they are so dim-witted, you can't get behind them. ESPECIALLY the husband. Oh GOD, he is so absent minded, you just want to smack the hell out of him and yell \"GET A CLUE!\". And the design of the doll is so over exaggerated, it comes off as corny. And that's another problem: They place the doll next to the crib of the baby and seeing how (unnecessarily, mind you) creepy enough as it looks, why would they place it next to their child?! No normal functioning person would find this doll charming or cute! That thing is nightmare fuel! And on another note, the writing is awful. REALLY awful. There's one scene where the wife just randomly says out loud what's going on. Like, \"oh no! There's got to be another way! I have to find another way!\". What, is she narrating a comic book?!\n\nThe film falls really hard because unlike The Conjuring, where they heavily relied on atmosphere to build up the suspense until the scare itself in a clever way, they just throw in jump scares in your face over and over. And they're SO repetitive. It's one of those scares when it's a fake-out and then five seconds later, BAM it happens. Tired of it? Don't worry, there's like 50 others to sit through.\n\nUgh. So yeah, this is just another horror movie with nothing to offer, nothing to be entertained by and nothing to remember. The characters are idiots, the script is clumsily written, the scares are mundane, and the plot is clich\u00e9d to the bone. You want a good scare? Read the actual stories behind Annabelle. They are actually really eerie. So, if you're looking for creativity and scary fun, skip it and be more afraid of Barbie dolls."

Admittedly the doll was freaky and would scare me if I came across it but the film kept trying to provide cheap thrills.They could have made this film so scary if they wanted to. The storyline slightly reminded me of the film chucky, the only difference is, is that chucky is actually good."

An extremely boring movie that barely made me jump and lost a lot of the creepiness from The Conjuring. The acting is just so plain and bland just like the scares. The movie doesn't even actually explain everything that is going on in a manner that makes sense. There's demons and then a grayish looking creature and a lot of it isn't explained. It's like the director just said put this in there and this... and this. The ending isn't satisfying either. There is no reason to go pay for this movie. Seriously. Don't waste your money. Wait until it comes out on blu-ray or something. The writing was also very odd at times... With Anabelle you're left with a bad taste in your mouth..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Going into this film, I had heard a lot of excitement from folks simply because it was a prequel to The Conjuring, and James Wan was producing and John Leonetti directing. Having not yet see The Conjuring, I can only remark on Annabelle as a generic 'horror' film - knowing very little about the actual events on which the story is based or how it fits into this grand lineage of recent horror films.\n\nI should have known I was setting myself up for disappointment when the girl at the box-office said The Box Trolls was a scarier film, and sadly after watching, I whole-heartily agree with her. Annabelle was bad, not in that Paranormal Activity way, but it was about as boring and uninteresting. Being a seasoned fan of the horror genre, I'll admit I had reasonable expectations coming into this movie. Going off the trailer you have a creepy porcelain doll, some apparent possession angle with demons,and a well established producer/director in James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Dead Silence). What followed for the next 98 minutes was just a pitiful attempt to mash so many elements from other, more famous horror films together with something that resembled a story.\n\nThe story, or lack thereof, is basically that Mia and John are the clich\u00e9d horror characters of a late 60's possession film that have all of their hopes and dreams set out before them. Mia is about to have a baby and John is about to start his residency to become a full- fledged doctor. John then gets Mia a creepy doll and the horror shenanigans ensue. (Supposedly)\n\nSpecifically Mia and John's neighbors are brutally murdered by satanic cultists and Mia is subsequently stabbed in her pregnant belly by one of the attackers. Although the baby is fine, the neighbor's daughter (one of the attackers) ritualistically kills herself and her tormented soul is somehow swept into none other than the creepy doll John gave Mia as a gift.\n\nI'm really at a loss after reading some of the other reviews that are praising this movie for things like character development, a suspenseful story, 'genuine' scares, and being the perfect movie to start the Halloween season. This movie has none of that. The story is horribly clich\u00e9d and just tries to reinvent movies like Poltergeist, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and Paranormal Activity into one. As for character development, you need actually need characters that you grow to care about that aren't simply a bad caricature of someone that'd likely be in a horror film i.e. the doubting husband, the occult-friendly neighbor, etc. I was just hoping that someone would have a gruesome death to distract me from twiddling my thumbs .\n\nAlso if you're looking for a 'scary' movie you've come to the wrong place. There are a handful of 'jump' scenes that are few and far between, and none of them are anything more than gradual silence followed by a jolt of unnecessarily loud audio. It was quite an annoyance to a few of the folks in the theatre that had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom.\n\nRead this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website"

The film was inspired by a story of a doll named Annabelle told by Ed and Lorraine Warren. The movie isn't as good as i was expecting due to some bad acting, a mostly bad final act and it's visually flat. However it has a great, full of tension and well directed scene in the middle of the film, and a solid and entertaining first half. It isn't very scary or remarkable but it's still an entertaining ride.\n\nRating: 6."

Eschewing modern CGI tricks, all the scares are old fashioned. Trouble comes to John and Mia after he gifts her a new doll for her collection. As mentioned, the dialogue and 60s setting feel a little forced, but the overall spooky tone, along with the religious overtones, create a solidly effective mood piece, landing us somewhere between The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. We won't confuse this with a genre classic, but it's an exciting chapter from The Conjuring universe. If you enjoy the more spiritual side of horror, this is recommended."

The story behind this doll and all that demons' stuff does not make sense even for a terror movie.\n\nFell really short of expectations..

I'm not going to crucify James Wan because he was not the director of this mess of a film, but he does have a hand in the crime because he produced it. He's not the murderer nor did he plan the crime, but he did drop off the murderer at a location where the murderer could hide the body."

I feel nothing for them, which creates my first big dilemma as in a horror you kind of need to give some what of a dam what happens to your protagonists to feel unnerved and scared 'for' them right?\n\nAnnabelle, the titular doll, is kinda creepy. But that is literally all. And obviously she's not the original style of doll the story is based on either. This movie is droll and predictable that I pretty much could pre-guess every minute of it. I know it's based on \"experiences\" relating to the Warrens but as I don't care for them I really was left feeling nothing at the end of this one.\n\nI went into it expecting very little luckily so wasn't under any false illusions.

A young couple who recently discovered the wife is pregnant with her first child experiences a home invasion that involves a doll being left behind. They fortunately survive the incident but move and try to do their best to keep the stress off the wife for the rest of her pregnancy. Unfortunately their new friend, the doll, isn't going to make it easy for the female to get over the incident.\n\nThis movie is directed by John R. Leonetti (The Silence) and stars Ward Horton (The Wolf of Wall Street), Annabelle Wallis (Malignant), Alfre Woodard (12 Years a Slave) and Brian Howe (The Pursuit of Happiness).\n\nThe opening sequence and circumstance is tremendous, well executed and really gets the dark cloud over the film early and sets the tone for the entire movie. The horror elements are honestly minimal throughout the movie but when they are done it's very intense and sharp. The cult storyline in this is very well established and there's a scene with the father towards the end that reminded me a little of Evil Dead.\n\nOverall most of the horror elements are subtle but well done. This is an above average addition to the horror genre that fell short of hitting the quality of The Conjuring. I'd score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend seeing it."

The film follows the harrowing experiences of a young couple, Mia and John Form, as they are terrorized by supernatural forces linked to the doll.\n\nThe movie successfully creates a tense and eerie atmosphere, leveraging its 1960s setting to evoke a classic horror vibe. The performances, particularly by Annabelle Wallis as Mia, are solid and help ground the film's supernatural elements. The cinematography and sound design also contribute effectively to the film's creepy ambiance.\n\nHowever, \"Annabelle\" struggles with predictability. Many of the scares rely on familiar horror tropes, which can make the plot feel formulaic at times. While it offers moments of genuine tension, it doesn't quite reach the chilling heights of its predecessor, \"The Conjuring.\"\n\nOverall, \"Annabelle\" is a decent horror film that provides some spooky moments and an intriguing backstory for the titular doll, but it may not fully satisfy those seeking more innovative scares."

That isn't to say it's particularly original because it isn't. It does borrow from other movies and peddles some clich\u00e9s. Alfre Woodard's character, for one. One part I loved was when the woman didn't want to go back to the house after some freaky stuff went down. That's very refreshing. Usually in these movies people return to the house over and over no matter how scared they are. Of course that was somewhat undone by her being cool with keeping the creepy Annabelle doll that pops up after being thrown away."

The suspenseful build ups and scares are often nothing new but the film successfully keeps its atmosphere throughout. Though not being blown away, it is a very well made movie and a fine prequel to The Conjuring. Too much of The Conjuring was given away in the trailers. The trailers for Annabelle I ignored intentionally and because of this, a few of the scares jolted me here and there. The film also isn't what many expected or wanted it to be for other reasons, 'Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?'"

The movie plays out very similar to Insidious, so if you enjoy that one, you will enjoy Annabelle.\n\nDo not compare this movie with The Conjuring, it isn't similar to that one much at all. People consider Annabelle to be the sequel, but in reality, it's more of a spin-off. They are making The Conjuring part 2 after all.\n\nWhen I went to go watch this movie, I lost excitement after reading the negative reviews - most of them saying the movie was boring and nothing happened. To my surprise, the movie wasn't like the reviews at all. I enjoyed the movie, and something DOES happen throughout the movie. You won't be sitting there waiting 30 minutes for something to happen.\n\nMy only complaint with this movie (many people didn't like this either) was that the doll didn't really move. Many others expected it to be like Chucky, but in actuality, the doll was being \"haunted\" and there are demons involved. If you watch this movie expecting it to walk around on its own and killing people, you will not be content. However, if you're into creepy dolls or enjoy jump-scares, I recommend this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a follow-up to The Conjuring (and featuring another case allegedly investigated by supernatural investigative duo Ed and Lorraine Warren), the fictitious versions of themselves are sorely lacking in this film. It doesn't feel like a follow-up to The Conjuring. It begins with a scene that's briefly included in The Conjuring and it ends with a brief reference to Ed and Lorraine Warren, but other than that it feels disjointed, something that wants to fit in but will never truly belong in The Conjuring universe no matter how hard it wants to.\n\nAnnabelle is a slow-burning story about a mother's love, essentially. It's surrounded by a cliched ghost story that, while visually impressive and with scares and tension that is successfully executed, doesn't live up to its predecessor. The acting was fine, and the story was entertaining in the moment but it's nothing particularly memorable.\n\nThis is a film that was a lot of fun in the theatre but now, with the ever-expanding Conjuring universe in perspective, it's really the outlier in the group. Not a bad movie by any means but, considering it's marketed as being part of a bigger universe that fits together perfectly without this entry, it so evidently doesn't belong. It feels as though Warner Bros. wanted to profit off The Conjuring by pumping out a sequel as quickly as possible, so quickly that they couldn't get the actors for Ed and Lorraine on board so they wrote them completely out of the film, which is really the biggest downfall it has. Had a little more time and effort been put into the writing of the script, alongside a little continuity with The Conjuring and the films that would follow, this could've been a much better entry."

Violence is high, people almost get killed and sometimes people go to the hospital. There is some storyline which makes it have a good balance of horror and mystery. Honestly it's only rated R for violence and gore, no swearing. I rated this movie 3/10 because it was just lacking storyline and plot."

        "review_title": "There are good scare scenes, sponsored by the incidental sound boost, and a captivating story, but the plot is flat, and there are few surprises for the fans ofthe genre",
        "review_detailed_main": "Annabelle, the film, is not concerned with continuing the events explained in The Conjuring, but rather with investigating the origin of this omen impregnated in the toy. That is, it is a 'prequel', with events preceding those already seen. This is how we discover the truth about the facts surrounding its creation. After all, when it was said that she had belonged to a girl whose parents were murdered, it forgot to mention that they had been killed by her own daughter, who at the time was no longer a child and had left the family home to join a Satanist sect. With this new information, therefore, it is better to understand the logic behind so much disgrace.\n\nAnnabelle Higgins and her boyfriend, both fanatical believers, after murdering her parents break into the neighbors' house, and in an attempt to repeat the same crime are killed by the police. She is hit with the doll in question in her hands, and her blood spills onto the toy. That's enough for the curse to perpetuate. The plot follows the couple who survived the attack, who are expecting their first child. One day, John (Ward Horton) presents his wife Mia (Annabelle Wallis) with a rare doll, which soon becomes an ornament in the child's room. Traumatized by the mysterious sect's attack, John and Mia decide to move house to forget the past, but a wave of evil events follows the couple. How to unravel the unknown and fight the demonic forces caused by a simple doll? That's what they're trying to discover in this tense spin-off.\n\nJames Wan, responsible for \"The Conjuring\", took on the role of producer, as he was involved with \" Furious 7\". John R. Leonetti, who has taken care of the photography for The Conjuring and the two films in the Supernatural series, takes on the direction of \"Annabelle.\" The director respects the story previously told by Wan, maintaining the constant dark mood of the plot. Your camera architects extremely effective sequences, even when working the clich\u00e9s. Televisions and radios turn on and off by themselves and doors slam mysteriously, but there is a certain class in the way Leonetti records such phenomena. Despite not getting rid of the accentuated sound scares, the filmmaker succeeds in balancing psychological suspense with trash horror, fundamental for the good performance of the film. Aided by a montage that never lets the rhythm of the film drop, in sync with the powerful soundtrack by Joseph Bishara, Leonetti also brings visual proposals that cause anxiety in the viewer. A sewing machine can turn into a highly dangerous instrument, the basement of a condominium can be terrifying and a physical attack from a demon can surprise you.\n\nIn addition to making reference to Wan's work, Annabelle composes small tributes to horror classics, from Rosemary's Baby to Scream. Roman Polanski's film, for example, appears in several moments of the film, which names its protagonist in honor of Mia Farrow, places its characters in a building (with basements and elevators) and uses the classic baby carriage as a narrative element. In the midst of these \"eater eggs\", Leonetti manages to work well with the static presence of the doll, preventing it from becoming a murderous toy. The film even flirts with deeper issues, such as motherhood and the strength of the bond between mothers and children. Noble intentions that come up against the limitations of the cast. Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton try to make the public care about their fate, but it's her best use for showing how her disorder gradually grows. Horton barely knows how to balance the dramatic moments and has few relevant scenes. Tony Amendola and Alfre Woodard provide a good counterpoint to the plot. Amendola represents religion (incidentally, it is interesting how the film shows the religiosity of the characters without fanaticism) and Woodard could be better used as Evelyn, the mystical book seller.\n\nHowever, there is never, at any time, the creation of an atmosphere of horror in the least satisfactory. This is because, as much as we spend most of the film following Mia's daily life, we know little about who is actually saved some small hobbies. On the contrary, her personality is non-existent and her actions always reflect her \"mother\" status. John suffers even more from this lack of development, and were it not for the constant mentions of hospitals, it would be easy to even forget where he is at all times. It is imperative for horror films to develop their characters well, otherwise, no matter how many dangerous/terrifying scenes they contain, the audience simply won't care. What happens here is just the presentation of a couple we should root for without, however, being given a reason to do so, so the whole cinematographic experience is uninteresting.\n\nSomething rarely happens in Annabelle. Even the amount of jump scares, a technique known to try to supplement this lack of an atmosphere of terror, is limited. The construction of tension seems to boil down to close-ups of the doll. The film lacks not only a better script, but also James Wan's excellent technique for creating unsettling sets rather than the constant sense of boredom that the work often conveys. Unlike The Conjuring, in which scares are built in a natural way, Annabelle goes against the grain, betting on easy scares and doesn't convince in several points of the script: with the appearance of the false priest with Annabelle's eyes, or the insistence on personify the devil, who looks more mischievous than behind a soul. Even within mythology, that being doesn't make sense: one moment he seems to want to kill Mia, the next he wants her soul - which should be given freely.\n\nThe narrative drags on and has characters that just disappear. And they didn't even need to be there. The scene where Mia meets two children is only for the character to think that the macabre drawings were left by the neighbors. But the clear mention of what Annabelle did with her scary messages in the first movie was enough. Gary Dauberman's screenplay tries to apply a psychologist's tone to a story that we know a lot in advance is horror. Less is more: showing Mia as an unseen child stalker would be more psychologically disturbing.\n\nThe doll becomes obsolete and look, it disappears from the narrative at times, losing its minimal function of bringing the devil towards the massacre of a family. The doll barely interacts with the story and at least does not enter into the embarrassment of carrying a knife and attacking the characters. She is purely an object to attract evil wherever she is. A kind of devil's puppet. So it's okay to evoke all the clich\u00e9s. Unlike the film that serves her as her starting point, The Conjuring, Annabelle can't get carried away and lingers too long in minor and uninteresting aspects. There is also the priest who feels the presence of evil, the occult book reader who has a mysterious past, children who vaguely represent a kind of evil, in short, all the conventions have been used, which is not a problem, but they do not favor the narrative's progress in any way.\n\nIt would be unfair to say the movie is all bad. In the first few minutes, the couple's relationship is well built; there is a parallel with a moment to historically situate the film - the crimes of the Mason family -; and the director knows how to position the camera, especially at the beginning of the second arc, when he starts using vertical traveling - up and down - representing, on an unconscious level, the presence of the supernatural. However, it's important to know that the story is completely fictional (if you believe the other actually happened): The Warrens have no record of how Annabelle ended up in the hands of the then owners. And that's interesting, because an original story would increase the possibilities, having only the tie that Annabelle would be in one piece for the next movie. Or not even that, it was just a little more daring.\n\nThe main success of Gary Dauberman's screenplay is to make Annabelle terrifying from the beginning of the film, possessed or not. The sense of danger is always present and the doll works well as a receptacle for evil, without necessarily having to move to show the damage it can do. The obsession with close-ups in Annabelle's eyes is chilling! If, on the one hand, the screenwriter is quite happy to reuse clich\u00e9s organically and bring new dreadful conflicts, \"Annabelle\" slips into its third act, with a solution too easy, perhaps to reinforce the intention that it could also become a franchise. Furthermore, the long-awaited pair of demonologists does not appear, it is just cited. But then we can even forgive, since the story is told before the case referred to by Ed and Lorraine Warren in \"The Conjuring\". Furthermore, the impression we have at the end of the screening is that the original feature is more impactful.\n\nAs much as Annabelle is a derivative of Evil Summons, she ends up sharing few of its qualities. An extremely predictable and uneven script accompanied by uninspired direction resulted in a boring and forgettable film. The feeling that remains is that the film was only released to try to cash in on the success of its precursor is inevitable. There are good scare scenes, sponsored by the incidental sound boost, and a captivating story, but the plot is flat, with elements common to the style, and there are few surprises for the more experienced in the genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by John R. Leonetti, \"Annabelle\" stars Annabelle Wallis & Ward Horton as a young couple in Southern Cal suburbia in the aftermath of the Manson murders (1969-1970). The focus is on the former who's pregnant and gives birth in the first half. Meanwhile their house and, later, apartment is cursed and it's somehow linked to their creepy-looking vintage doll and a couple of Manson-ish occultists who invade their home in the first act. Tony Amendola plays their priest while Alfre Woodard is on hand as a concerned book store owner.\n\nThis movie surprised me. I thought it was going to be a silly killer doll flick, like the Child's Play franchise, but that's not the case. While there are elements of a ghost story, this is more a demon tale; and the details to this effect are commendable. The movie's austere with a couple of genuinely scary episodes, particularly the basement/stairwell sequence. The CGI 'monster' is effectively realized and wisely not overdone.\n\n\"Annabelle\" shows how the Manson murders were the death knell of the 'peace & love' counter-culture movement. Hippies would never be viewed the same after the horrific Tate murders of August 8, 1969. The drug-addled Woodstock took place just days later and it was indeed 'three days of peace & music,' but The Altamont Speedway Free Festival in early December (less than four months later) put the kibosh on the hippies' idealism forever. It's a shame too, as they had a hold of something real underneath their drug-obsessed fog (not that all hippies were druggies, but it was certainly the norm).\n\nIf I may put forth a slice of personal philosophy, this movie illustrates how demons are viewed as the epitome of what is scary in modern culture. Yet the bible shows them SHRIEKING IN HORROR at the mere sight of the Mighty Christ. More than that, they BEG HIM not to torture them and throw their filthy backsides into the Abyss! Read it for yourself in Luke 8:26-31.\n\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 99 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles. WRITER: Gary Dauberman.\n\nGRADE: B+"

But I kinda of liked it yes it does have some terrifying scenes in it Which scared me so baldy. but this is what horror films are suspend to be about having jump scares. I would give this movie an 8/10 in my book but the Demmon was scary looking that I could not sleep, so I diced to give this movie a 7/10 instead just to be honest and truthful which is what I am trying to bed.\n\nit's a good horror film and one of the better horror films I have seen in a while\n\n7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Having the doll do absolutely nothing must have saved them a LOT of money. There are so many close ups and camera panning towards the doll and all that to see her do a big NOTHING! After the third time panning towards her face, there should be a running bet. Maybe she will blink, or sneer or maybe do the Macarena. Really, I would like that because the Macarena scares the *beep* out of me. Old people swinging their hips, that's like inviting death to dance with you.\n\nThen they throw a generic looking demon with a very familiar face and horns. I could have sworn I've seen that demonic face somewhere. What's that movie starring Harry Potter but with horns? And guess what, he's moving the doll all over. That IS a spoiler that shows how the doll is able to levitate. The movie just gave us a spoiler, can we sue them???? So if there is a sequel and the doll starts floating around and doing the backstroke, there must be a stage guy there doing the work, just dress him up as a demon so he will look like part of the movie, right?\n\nAnd the actors were not able to save the movie even if they wanted to. Wooden acting, blank facial expressions. We have cookie cutter Ken and Barbie in a perfect life, and what's more perfect when they meet the first stranger in the movie who became a friend and this NEW friend is willing to sacrifice her life for the white Barbie because she feels guilty about her own daughter's death. Oh yeah the stranger-turned friend-turned willing sacrifice-turned soul now belonged to the devil is black, so check that list. And there ain't gonna be any mother daughter reunion there you know, it's a totally different zip code. I'm sure wherever the daughter is, she's shaking her head thinking 'That's not what I meant you are supposed to do Mom. You could pray more for my soul, that would actually help and do some charity work or something. NOT give your bloody soul to the devil!\"\n\nBack to Ken and Barbie, could you act a little bit more distraught when you thought your baby is lying dead on the floor instead of smothering him in your chest possibly killing him in the process? Shouldn't the first thing you do is check his pulse, give CPR and then maybe at the same time realize that you are french kissing a freaking doll? And Ken! You have perfect hair, the perfect job and I love a doctor who spent his time sleeping beside a patient's bed. And who didn't think that Ken and Barbie had the WORST reaction time in history? Did you count how many seconds it took for any of them to react when they hear something? How many seconds did it take for Ken to stop and think and think again when he hears his wife scream? Can someone take his soul please? Oh wait, he would take too long at the window to jump. Probably couldn't figure out if he should land on the front or back, which would be prettier? Barbie didn't disappoint at the window scene. She took long enough for black stranger to form a crazy idea in her head. Barbie is probably hoping for that. Let the stranger-turned friend-turned willing sacrifice do the jump. Maybe Barbie is smarter than we realize.\n\nOverall, not worth to be included in any horror list. Best buried and forgotten or in Hollywood terms, rebooted.\n\nPS. They started the movie interviewing the 2 girls who had the doll. Shouldn't the movie be about them?"

Surprisingly good film finds the right balance between suspense and character development, keeping clich\u00e9s to a minimum, while offering several effective scares and nicely filling in the back story to the doll, which leads right back to \"The Conjuring\"."

I'm loving this new trend of seeing the monster, which is proving to be ass scary as not seeing. it help that their were some cool camera movements going on to increase the fright\n\nBut honestly the hype over this movie out weighs it.It's definitely a fun scare, I had points when I was jumping out my seat, but the hype was not worth the outing. catch on DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "Released back in 2014, Annabelle is a movie that got a lot of attention in the horror genre. Based off the story of the original Annabelle doll, locked away in a museum for the occult, director John R. Leonetti brings to life one of the most iconic haunted doll stories known in history.\n\nI am utterly terrified of dolls, and I think that might have been why I found this film as scary as I did. I was surprise to find it had quite a low rating on IMDb, especially with the sequel just coming out before I watched the film. I fully believe this deserves a slightly higher rating than what it got.\n\nFirst of all, Annabelle Wallis was an absolutely amazing actress and stole the show completely. She did a spectacular job and she was easy to relate to; it was easy to feel the fear she was going through throughout the film \u2013 especially the basement scene. Following Annabelle, I am more than eager to go through her filmography and find more of her acting skills. She was just wonderfully talented.\n\nUnfortunately, this film does rely on a lot of old tricks of the paranormal genre. The seeing things, the writing on the wall, the demon chase up the stairs, and although terrifying, I would have loved to see more from this that wasn't the same as everything else in the genre. I feel like the directors and script writers could have done a lot more development with this. I am aware they were following the original real life story of Annabelle, but they could have enhanced it, made it a little more scary and not just another trope.\n\nThere were cons and pros about this, and unfortunately, there were quite a few more cons than there were pros. However, this was still quite a good horror film, for the current age, and I'd definitely recommend this to those who enjoy being spooked."

The doll itself, even though it looks nothing like the actual doll, is creepy (if not a little too clich\u00e9). The atmosphere of fear the doll pours out makes the scares all the more jumpy. I jumped several times in fact.\n\nWhat I wasn't too keen on was the Insidious demon like creature you see throughout the film. I thought it took away from the creepiness and gave it less mystery and more showy.\n\nOther than a few flaws it is a pretty decent film, but nothing as good The Conjuring by any means."

There are a lot of modern horror films (and even a number of older ones) that rely on fake music scares. This movie is the pinnacle of the worst of that. I jumped once when the music abruptly changed. The reason I jumped was not because the film was scary or even atmospheric. It was just the cheapest trick I can remember seeing in a long time. It also felt like an \"action sequence\" in a stale film that builds nothing out of nothing. The only reason this movie will be noteworthy in the future is when people say this was \"Alfre Woodard's worst film\" to those who think she has none. What in the world was she thinking? The only true mystery of this movie for me is why anyone does like it. It is a rushed sequel that insults the previous film."

The relationship between John and Mia doesn't exist - they're a couple yet the scenes between them are awkward; the acting is atrocious in this film. The so called horror scenes are generic, cheesy and short-lived, toppled with repetitive music we've heard time from time. Legitimately half this film (no joke) is wasted on slow zoom ups on Annabelle's face. And of course, this film just had to have an irrelevant scene of a girl in a white dress with long black hair - have western movies not gotten past the whole concept of the Ring? Stop obsessing over that idea and make your own!! This film lacked content, acting, a story line, characters I gave a crap for and genuine scares. Waste of money."

No. But its definitely skip-able, even if you want to watch everything in the 'Conjuringverse'."

        "review_detailed_main": "Heavily marketed as a spin-off of 'The Conjuring', 'Annabelle' aims a bit too high for its own good. Nevertheless, it still proves to be a perfectly competent modern horror flick, with more than a few effective scares.\n\nFocusing on a young family in 1970's America, 'Annabelle' depicts their struggles, initially against a murderous cult, then the titular doll who has been possessed by an otherworldly entity.\n\nIt was good that the creative team at least attempted to flesh out the main characters, trying to give them substance and warmth as opposed to making them the usual one-dimensional, sex-crazed teenagers. However, a lot of the dialogue-driven scenes that strive to do this are poorly-written and awkward. That being said, these do still help the audience empathize with their situation.\n\nThe film's structure and build-up in terms of suspense could have been more refined (particularly in comparison to 'The Conjuring'). Whereas preferably I thought the film should have begun with smaller, quieter fright sequences that proceeded to build up to something larger across the course of the narrative, 'Annabelle' instead pounds the audience again and again, only to die down for another five minutes. This does kill a bit of the film's potential momentum, but ultimately this structure is redeemed by the sheer effectiveness of some scenes.\n\nBeing directed by a previous cinematographer, many of 'Annabelle''s sequences are highly inventive and frankly, terrifying. Shadows and obscure camera angles all assist in this cinematic creativity, making sure that you'll never look at bedroom doors or stairwells the same way again.\n\nThough it does sometimes falter in terms of its dialogue or its narrative structure, 'Annabelle' gets by on the brilliance of some its fright scenes. Though by no means as good as 'The Conjuring' or any of the horror genre's classics, 'Annabelle' is still a worthwhile experience for those who want a decent scare. Or several."

It spends no time establishing what is terrifying these people the way Paranormal does - which generates the psychological thrill as the audience pieces it together with the characters. The acting is mediocre AT BEST. Basically you saw almost all the scary parts in the previews and the actual plot(s) are disjointed and make no sense. Both the villains in the movie and its connection with The Conjuring are non-existent and clearly they are hoping to suck in some ticket sales in by name dropping \"The Conjuring\" Could I do better? Yep. You better believe it. My advice, save your $$, rent it if you must see it."

The murder scene of their neighbors (done by their daughter) which is also used in Creation is kinda unexpected and when you think about it - kinda improbable. Especially what they were to do next. I guess there are many small details in this one and later in creation that does not really fit... but overall when you watch the films, you don't think about them.\n\nThe librarian was an interesting character.

In ten years we won't look back at this movie as a game changer, but I will remember it like a fun movie. Isn't it enough to reach at least a 6.0 average or a 50 in metacritic score? I think yes, specially after i see on this website that horror masterpiece hardly reach 6.0 and that being part of marvel cinematic universe give a movie the right to at least a 7.0. Do me a favor, before you give a vote to an horror movie stopfor a second, thuink to your previous votes and ask yourself if you are being fair to the movie or just misjudging a gente.\n\nTo comment the movie i think is a nice add to the conjuring universe...if this is the lowest entry( as a lot of people say) is the signal of how much quality, despite the clear commercial intentions, this movies are bringing on screen. The movie look good and the plot, even if not really original, is a good mix of \"influences\" and is not boring or cringy. Some scenes are really creepy and some jump scares are really good( yes jumpscares are not necessary a sin), but the general atmosphere of the movie is not too much haunting so you will walk out of the cinema without paranoia and nigthmares( if you don't sleep with dools in the room)."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Annabelle\" is a captivating addition to the Conjuring Universe that delves into the sinister origins of the infamous Annabelle doll. Directed by John R. Leonetti, the film successfully weaves a tale of malevolence and terror, offering a satisfyingly chilling experience for horror enthusiasts.\n\nAt the core of the film's success is the unsettling presence of Annabelle herself. The doll becomes an icon of fear, exuding an eerie aura that sends shivers down your spine. The premise of a seemingly innocent toy housing a malevolent spirit is inherently terrifying, and the film capitalizes on this concept brilliantly.\n\nThe performances by Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton as the unfortunate couple caught in the doll's grip are commendable. Their escalating fear and desperation feel genuine, enhancing the viewer's emotional connection to the unfolding horror.\n\n\"Annabelle\" excels in building suspense, often relying on atmospheric tension rather than jump scares. This approach allows the dread to simmer, creating an enduring sense of unease that persists long after the credits roll. The film also weaves a connection to the larger Conjuring Universe, providing fans with intriguing backstory and nods to the Warrens.\n\nThe production design deserves special mention, as it effectively recreates the 1960s setting, adding an authentic layer to the film's supernatural occurrences. Additionally, the use of practical effects and eerie lighting contributes to the film's overall effectiveness in delivering scares.\n\nWhile some may argue that \"Annabelle\" doesn't reach the same heights as \"The Conjuring\" films, it still stands as a formidable entry in the horror genre. It successfully explores the origins of an iconic horror figure, offering a well-crafted and spine-tingling tale that leaves you looking over your shoulder, wary of seemingly harmless objects. For fans of supernatural horror, \"Annabelle\" is a haunting journey into the world of malevolent spirits and is well worth the watch."

The movie is also pretty clich\u00e9' and falls into a typical cheap haunted house trick with nothing surprising or genuinely scary here. However, the music here is impressively done and really adds the suspense feel to the scene quite effectively. The GORE here is kept at minimum and it could have just been rated PG-13 instead since it doesn't really used its R-rating that effectively enough. Overall, this is an overall disappointing prequel (thanks to the trailer) to The Conjuring that's clich\u00e9', lack of any effective scares, with mediocre acting, and decent story. >>C<<"

However, it a huge letdown the First time I watched it. I guess that, like so many others, I expected a possessed doll. The real version of Child's Play's 'Chucky' sort or less.\n\nBut after reading \"The Demonologist\", which contains a complete chapter about the real story of Annabelle, I realised that the doll was never possessed by a demon. According to the Warrens, demons do not possess dolls or other lifeless objects. They only possess people. The doll was merely an instrument used by the demon. It manipulated the doll.\n\nSo I decided to give the movie another chance, and it was actually way better than the First time I watched it. I was more able to understand the story that the movie makers were trying to tell.\n\nOf course, other than \"The Conjuring\", less and less in this movie was truly base don the real life story concerning the Annabell doll. The real doll was a Raggedy Ann doll, not a porcelain doll.\n\nThe characters in the movie are merely fictional and not base don real people. Many events were made up for the movie, they did not really took place.\n\nBut I really enjoyed the movie this second time!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I honestly don't know where to begin. I went into this movie with low expectations that were met, now I figured this movie was likely going to be dodgy in terms of plot and I was correct. The first thing to consider if you plan on seeing this movie is, have you seen The Conjuring? If not, watch it first because there a couple of significant references that you probably won't completely understand without the back knowledge. Personally I think for a 'scary' movie to be considered scary it has to make me think or at the very least stick to my mind after I leave the cinema and Annabelle did neither. One of the many issues I had with this movie was the beginning and end of the movie as there was room for a nice link and the director/writer failed to create an in depth connection between the two. I believe if they had would have boosted the story significantly, I'm not sure if they are planning on making another movie to explain all of the stuff they missed in that sub-story but even if they do this movie was proof enough that it probably wouldn't be worth mine or anyone else's money. My problem with this movie may just be because I'm a stickler for detail, like I love it and that could be why I am so frustrated and annoyed, I mean there was SO MUCH POTENTIAL! I have so many questions that have been left unanswered, like please give me more information (I won't say what kind of information because no spoilers). Side note (before I forget) : It's 2014 why does the 'scariest' part of the movie look like they have had paint dumped on them? (You'll understand me if you watch this film.) Now to reference the summary of this review I need to point out the jump scares. The jump scares were the best part of this movie (even though most of them only appeared when the movie hit its half way point) as they gave me a good laugh as the people around me in the cinema squealed or jumped in fear, personally there was one in particular that the director did a very good job with and it was one of the highlights of the movie for me (maybe it's because little kids are creepy as hell...hint hint). One thing I really enjoyed in this movie was a scene that is within an elevator, this was a great part of the film as it had most of the people within the cinema laughing, me included, so if you decide to watch this movie that is the scene to look out for. In this movie there are multiple scenes that seem significant but really aren't, the was two characters in particular that I thought were for sure going to play a bigger role than what they did but they were shown only once and were never really referenced again, there characters were pair of children that had potential, much like this movie, that was never met. Now if you are just looking for cheap scares then I recommend you watch this but for people who want to be really scared, or enjoy their horror/thriller movies to be summed up nicely with little to no holes in the plot then I would not recommend."

        "review_detailed_main": "Annabelle is the type of horror film you'd expect to come out around Halloween. Its cheap, somewhat creepy but especially, its forgettable. Coming off of the genuinely creepy and disturbing The Conjuring, Annabelle tries to cash in on scares we've seen before, plot points that are filled with holes, and acting that is wooden and melodramatic. Despite these lackluster qualities, Annabelle can certainly turn up the notch on creepy atmosphere but can't exactly capitalize on it the way James Wan did in The Conjuring. As a stand alone film, Annabelle can certainly wet your appetite for horror but stands so much in the shadow of its predecessor that its hard to really enjoy the potential of it all. The story tells the horror behind the now legendary doll that had us all gripping our theater seats last summer, turning what was originally a 10 minute story arc in The Conjuring into a feature length film. As one could assume, it becomes tired and exhausted after the first thirty minutes of the film. The story then tries to rehash The Conjuring, pitting a family against supernatural forces and blah, blah, blah. Quite honestly, I would have enjoyed this film much more if director, John Leonetti took some risk and changed up the storyline up from the original. But no, they MUST stick with what worked before. Something that worked for one film, doesn't necessarily warrant a complete rehash of it just substituting a demon for a doll. My problems with this film are seemingly endless as I write this review, pulling more and more negative out of it all than I can the positive. At times, Annabelle shows glimpses of promise but they are all crushed with familiar scares, shoddy acting and hollow writing. John Leonetti is no James Wan, that's for damn sure. Overall, Annabelle results in more of a sequel to A Haunting In Connecticut or James Wan's Dead Silence than to the superior and masterfully made The Conjuring. While you'll most likely get a couple jump scares out of it, Annabelle is a mere after thought and a nail in the coffin to whatever hopes the studio had in turning The Conjuring into a franchise."

Leonetti Review O sweet a creepy doll movie, that's a prequel to the conjuring one of my favorite horror films, I mean what could go wrong. Holy crap was this the most disappointing horror movie I've seen since the nightmare on elm street remake and seed of Chucky. This film revolves around a woman who is being haunted by the evil spirit of a woman named Annabelle that has possessed her doll and wishes to take her newborns soul. It opens with the same opening as the conjuring and you can hear ED Warrens voice talking to a victim of the dolls evil deeds. The film then cuts to what supposedly happened before those events occurred before but I felt like their a lot of unanswered questions like how did they end up with the doll, the woman played terribly by Annabelle Wallis says it disappeared at the end so she could not have been the one to lock it up and leave it for her daughter. The father named John who is portrayed even more terribly by Ward Horton doesn't serve diddly crap, he's just there can't act and I don't like him. The one plays the pries however I actually liked him, I don't know I guess I have weakness for priests in this kinds of movies. The visuals are kind of cool, I mean there the best things about this movie, which can me kind of suspect that the director is only good with visuals and not storytelling cause the story just left me with questions that I would suspect answered in this movie. The one cool thing is when you see the doll movie cause man that is one ugly creepy looking doll. The ending piste me off a bit cause it felt like the first three Chucky movies but only with a baby and the doll not even almost succeeding or at least I don't think it was close to succeeding. Annabelle is a film that I saw no trailers or commercials for cause I had high hopes but those hopes went down the drain but had some nice visuals so I'm giving Annabelle a two out of 10."

I often go into new horror films at the cinema never expecting too much but for some reason, even though I have seen countless crap horror films, I still go whenever a new one is out. I wasn't expecting too much from Annabelle, I hadn't seen any trailers, read any reviews and had seen very minimal advertising for this movie. All I knew, when I entered the cinema, was that it is a spin off to the Conjuring. I was a very big fan of the Conjuring and it is one of my favourite horrors in recent years.\n\nThe film is set before the Conjuring and tells the story of how the doll Annabelle becomes possessed and how it effects its first owners lives. It starts with the doll moving around on its own, popping up in different places and slowly moves on to much more less subtle and more haunting things.\n\nAnnabelle has a similar feel to the Conjuring and even the Insidious films. It has similar styles with similar music and builds its tension in a way that you sit there watching it thinking 'have I seen this before?' Now don't get me wrong, Annabelle won't win any Oscars, it is far, far from perfect but it does offer some good jumps, good scares and an average storyline which is decent enough for a 90+ minute horror flick.\n\nThe problem with these films, which is a problem with most modern horrors, is that they are so clich\u00e9d that it becomes tedious and D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu like. The tension builds, the nervy music begins the camera pans around and you are simply waiting and expecting something to happen. Nothing ever seems to be out of the box or unexpected. There are some ways that I believe this movie could have ended and the director could of took a few risks and took a different approach but once again the director opts for the easy way out and follows the clich\u00e9s.\n\nThe Acting also leaves a lot to be desired, the main leads are not very convincing, especially the character of John Gordon. The Character Evelyn is trying too hard to be mysterious and it carries on for so long that you lose interest and don't really care about this woman and her story. The script is not great and some of the dialogue is very questionable.\n\nOverall, Annabelle offers some good jumps and does its job well enough to warrant viewing it. I wouldn't say you should rush to the cinema for this one buy is certainly worth a watch when it comes out on DVD/Sky Movies.\n\n7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Story: How a raggedy Ann Doll turns into something more than just raggedy and the trouble it creates in the lives of a couple pretty sums up the plot line of \"Annabelle\".\n\nHorror Elements: Let me begin by saying that I am one of the millions who went in expecting a conjuring-par movie. But what I found was a horror movie which became a victim of its own success. The hype created around its making was not completely satisfied as the best scenes were revealed in the teasers and trailers and some of other horror elements turned out to be, for the lack of better word, predictable (like injury from a sewing machine, baby being the centre plot and some more).\n\nBut I am not going to deny, yes the movie did have some of its own horror elements (the carpet-moment, noises-on-top moment) but they were just not enough to satisfy the thirst. Lack of too many characters, lack of an in-depth into the cult mentioned, lack of in- depth about the said demon, presence of demon in very few frames all let to an ending which felt more like abrupt than like an end. If anything the popcorns jerked inside the tub but none of it overflew while for \"the conjuring\" almost all of it spilled with some of them flying to the back seats.\n\nThe absence of the stewardship of James Wan was felt on the whole. With a few more gripping elements in the early half, the movie would have become more likable but still far from the conjuring-effect.\n\nIn short Conjuring-2: Victim of its own success."

        "review_title": "A far inferior prequel to 'The Conjuring', this is a cash-grab exercise in mediocrity that trades in cheap scares than any genuine fear or tension",
        "review_detailed_main": "Whereas 'The Conjuring' rode on a wave of overwhelmingly positive test screenings to secure a prime release date in summer last year, 'Annabelle' seems to have taken the opposite route. Screened late or in some territories never for critics and audiences alike, it almost seems as if the producers want to keep the movie locked up \u2013 like the real-life 'Raggedy Ann' doll of the same name from which this was inspired \u2013 in a glass cabinet. And yet, the reason for their reluctance to unveil 'Annabelle' in the same way that they did for 'The Conjuring' is plainly simple once you've seen the former.\n\nFirst things first, 'The Conjuring's' James Wan doesn't return to direct 'Annabelle'; the Malaysian-born director serves only as a producer here and instead has relinquished the reins to his director of photography on the former, John R. Leonetti. Neither is 'Annabelle' scripted by the writers of 'The Conjuring', who \u2013 if it's any relief to fans of the original \u2013 are returning for the direct sequel 'The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Poltergeist' due next year; instead, that credit falls here to Gary Dauberman, whose filmography before this consists of dubious direct-to-video titles like 'In the Spider's Web' and 'Swamp Monkey'. The point we're trying to make? Don't expect the same pedigree as 'The Conjuring', because there just isn't.\n\nIt's unfortunate that 'Annabelle' gets immediately compared with the far-superior 'The Conjuring'; on its own, 'Annabelle' is a pretty average genre exercise that should satisfy those looking for a horror fix; but when you lay it next to 'The Conjuring', then this in-name prequel just is utterly inferior, and probably no more than an attempt to cash in on its predecessor's success to get more people into the cinema. Heck, they couldn't even get Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga to cameo in the scene where their characters, Ed and Lorraine Warren, frm 'The Conjuring' are clearly referenced.\n\nSince 'The Conjuring' is set in the mid-1970s, 'Annabelle' sets itself about a decade before, when medical school student John (Ward Horton) and his wife Mia (Annabelle Wallis) are a young couple living in a quiet suburban neighbourhood and expecting a baby. Mia is a doll collector, and Annabelle is John's surprise present to her to complete her antique doll collection \u2013 though why one naturally wonders just why anyone would want a creepy looking thing like Annabelle in their home. Anyhow, on the night they learn of the Manson family murders (Google that if you're keen for more information), their home is invaded by the daughter of their next- door neighbour.\n\nA Satanic hippie best described as a crazed demon worshipper, she and her boyfriend have just murdered her parents before proceeding to try to do the same with John and Mia. But the police arrive, and in the melee that follows, her boyfriend is shot dead while she slits her throat such that her blood gets into the titular creepy doll. None of this is a spoiler, since you already can see most of it from the trailer. After some weird and dangerous things happen in that house (from the usual moving of furniture to slamming of doors and leading up to the kitchen catching fire), John and Mia move into a new apartment in a new town, where John is to complete his residency.\n\nNeedless to say, Annabelle follows them to the new place, and while John is away, proceeds to terrorise Mia as well as their newborn baby daughter. Who do the couple turn to? Well, as clich\u00e9s go, John looks to a local elderly priest (Tony Amendola), while Mia confides in the eccentric black woman (Alfre Woodard) who runs a bookstore down the street with a convenient occult section. The entity responsible for the paranormal activities? It's a demon; and before you can say 'exorcism', Father Perez (conveniently) turns into the eager exorcist who tries to rid the demon from the doll \u2013 and if you need any clue as to how that turns out, well just re-watch the opening sequence from 'The Conjuring'.\n\nNone of what happens is particularly scary in and of itself, because instead of the nice slow-burn type of atmospheric dread that 'The Conjuring' traded in, Leonetti insists on hitting his audience over their heads with repeated 'boo!' scares which are akin to the genre's junk food. Yes, if you're well versed in the genre, this is more about things jumping out at you at various moments \u2013 accompanied by appropriately sudden sound effects \u2013 than any genuine tension or fear. It is cheap to say the least, and lazy if you compare it against the well-crafted sequences which made 'The Conjuring' such a success in the first place.\n\nIt doesn't help that Dauberman's script plagiarises elements from all the horror classics we've known \u2013 from the helpless mother to her logical companion to the local priest who doesn't need a permit from the Vatican to decide he wants to take on the demon to the peculiar black lady who actually knows a thing or two about the demonic stuff she keeps ranting about. There is nothing here that transcends genre mediocrity, and Leonetti's reliance on the frights of the lowest denominator doesn't help one bit.\n\nLike we said, though the producers of 'Annabelle' would gladly like for their film to be related with 'The Conjuring', that association is a double-edged sword. It will get fans in no doubt, but whether it leaves them satiated in the same 'scared stiff' way 'The Conjuring' did is clear \u2013 it won't. What that means in terms of goodwill for 'The Conjuring' franchise in general is still suspect; but here's something we do know \u2013 'Annabelle' is no 'Conjuring', and at its best, is a thoroughly mediocre genre exercise that is good for Halloween but little else."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Annabelle\" certainly doesn't reinvent the horror genre but it's still an atmospheric, diversified and gripping movie that quickly grabs your attention and will haunt you until the very end. This movie has a better pace and no dull moments compared to \"The Conjuring\" but it's not as intense and scary as \"Insidious\" for example.\n\nI like the fact that the movie includes a little bit more than the usual supernatural elements. When the satanic cult members assassinate an old couple and attack the two main actors, the movie quickly starts to be really gripping. When a fire breaks out and menaces the pregnant main actress, most viewers were also on the edges of their seats. The haunting scene leading to and involving a stroller smashed by a truck is also very intense. It's a good thing that the entire movie doesn't only play at one location and only involves supernatural phenomenons.\n\n\"Annabelle\" convinces with its steadily growing sinister atmosphere, a credible acting performance, a solid camera work without any unnecessary shaking, fitting sound effects and an atmospheric soundtrack. This movie includes almost no blood and gore effects and no obvious special effects. These elements make the scenario feel closer to some classic pioneer movies of the seventies. The realistic tone of the film also makes the movie more intense and easier to get into for most people.\n\nEven though the movie avoided a few stereotypes such as an exorcism, some parts were still highly predictable: the scared housewife nobody believes in, the wicked demon trying to take possession of a child's innocent soul and the heroic actions of an old pastor attempting to save a young family and community members are elements that horror movie fans have seen numerous times before. That's why the movie lacked some originality and ultimately tension towards the end as the ending was also quite predictable.\n\nFans of traditional horror movies or more recent outputs by James Wan and his colleagues should watch this movie at the cinema as they are likely to enjoy this film. This movie isn't the best of the year but still a professionally executed and highly above average horror flick. I still hope that the next movies made by the makers of the last few horror blockbusters are going to write a more courageous script for their next project."

I pre watched it before he did and I have to say it is hands down, THE most boring horror film I've ever seen. Firstly, the couple are not believable at all. Very bland, vanilla and boring. The doll is used just for close up camera shots of her face coupled with creepy music. I actually got bored while watching and wrote this review! Annabelle: Creations was much more creepy and horror genre than this. Give this one a miss and just watch that instead. It's a paint by numbers doll movie which hits all the wrong notes."

        "review_detailed_main": "A large vintage doll, possessed by a demon bent on reaping a fresh new soul, brings death and disorder to a young married couple in the early 1970s. The scares and jolts seen in its predecessor, The Conjuring, aren't nearly as prevalent this time around, to the point where one begins to relax or even doze off.\n\nAnnabelle is about the events leading up to the events that lead up to those in The Conjuring. Mia and John Gordon (Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton) are about to be parents. John is harried by his stressful life as a med student, and to make up for aloof attitude he locates and purchases an old, large doll for his wife, who's been searching for the doll for years. But this fairly tale story is quickly shattered when, in the middle of the night, the Gordons are attacked by a crazed duo who injure the pregnant Mia before themselves dying by bullet or knife. One of the attackers is the estranged daughter of the Gordons' neighbors, the Higgins, who have also been slaughtered. The Gordons move to a new place, as would we all.\n\nConfined to bed rest for the final month of her pregnancy, Mia experiences some strange happenings. She hears whispers. She sees things. She nearly dies in a kitchen fire. It's the doll, I tell you - it's always something material. How else would a demon house itself while waiting for a soul to take? It's just logic. In any event, John and Mia enlist the help of their local priest, Father Perez (Tony Amendola), who is himself badly injured when he attempts to take the doll into his church for safekeeping. Yes, it's clear to all that demons are at work here.\n\nWhile watching this, I waited and wondered for the good stuff to come, the genuine scares. The first hour or so contains little of what might be considered a scare. It's not that the frights are inexpertly presented, it's that there aren't any to speak of. A lot of exposition appears instead. I began to hope that this would all be a setup for a cathartic finale.\n\nMia becomes friends with a local bookstore owner, Evelyn (Alfre Woodward), who also lives in the Gordons' apartment complex. Coincidentally, Evelyn had lost a child following an auto accident for which Evelyn feels plenty of guilt. This becomes important during the finale, which is over almost before you know it's begun.\n\nThere's some nifty sleight of hand in Annabelle, but since everyone in the movie (as well as the audience) agrees wholeheartedly that the demon does exist and that Mia isn't imagining things, there's no real suspense to be found. Even husband John goes along with things eventually. Such an understanding husband. Because everyone knows in their heart that these weird things are actually happening, there's no ambiguity about whether Mia is losing her mind. She's not.\n\nShort on horror and long on talk, Annabelle is a medium-low heat setting on a gas grill. Your food will get cooked eventually, but you may fall asleep waiting for it to come to its inevitable conclusion."

        "review_detailed_main": "A demon that has possessed a porcelain doll terrorizes a pregnant wife an her husband in sunny Santa Monica California.\n\nAnyone who saw Peaky Blinders will know that Annabelle Wallace, a fresh face in the industry, has talent. She brings much of the same mellow composure and grace that make her as beautiful inside as out; the kind of pure soul that is perfect for the haunting. There are times however when her refinement is so great that she seems not very impressionable. It's not like the movie needs a scream queen, but she fails to summon much fear or motivation from it.\n\nAnnabelle is only an hour and a half long, but it feels substantially longer. The first half of the movie, is often so light in tone that it feels like a 60's soap opera that just happens to have horror devices. Director John Leonetti lets the movie drag along without a clear sense of direction. IF nothing else, at least he has a good eye for framing. The photography, which has a wide lens feel, is a blessing to a movie that is full of cursing. The best shots in the movie are the static framings that squeeze two or three rooms into the picture. These moments work by daring the viewer to search for what is not there. Absence is always more intimidating than presence.\n\nFor the most part, this is not a scary movie. There is too much chaos and the images hinging on boo moments are all gimmicks that we have seen before; the self moving doors, phonographs, ghosts in white sleepers, the black biblical demon. The all thats missing is the cat jumping out of the shadows. The catalyst for all this unnatural mumbo jumbo, The doll who looks like an ancestor of Chucky. Leonetti likes to linger on her face just long enough to make you suspect that her eyes are gonna spring out of her skull. those who don't get goosebumps will probably find these shots somewhat amusing. The film gives you enough down time to contemplate how anything with a face like that could ever end up on the market."

        "review_detailed_main": "I came to this movie very excited. After the promising a plot story and amount of horror being shown in The Conjuring that was just plain awesome, I expected Annabelle to have more or less the same amount of horror quality being shown\n\nGetting straight to this movie, it had a really interesting concept on the origins of how the doll was possessed. Not what I had expected since I thought she was going to be something like Chucky from Child's Play. Instead the Annabelle is more like the gateway boundary between and our world and Hell itself\n\nAll the actors equally acted well for their part in my opinion but there wasn't one who stood out the most to me. I expected the Warren couple to make an appearance in this film but apart from a few references in the film, they never showed up. It could really have changed the outcome of the events it they had did arrived to help\n\nThe aspects of the film here in terms of camera works and editing of the film were well shot and put together to help make this into a good film but nothing unique and it just help flowed the movie to go forward. I expected some flashbacks in between the scenes and show us a little bit of maybe how certain things turned out to be the way they are. But for this film, the lighting and sound of the film was what made it really great. There will definitely be moments where you feel like you want cover your eyes or look away\n\nMy favorite scene which I'm sorry that I just have to tell (but you guys can already see it in the trailer) will have to be the transition change of the little Annabelle girl running up into the room that the character Mia was in and instantly turns into an adult monster like Annabelle after bursts through the door while still chasing after her. That shot in my opinion was done to perfection\n\nOverall, not really as scared as I'd hope it to be but it lived up to the potential. However, this movie in my opinion definitely could not match up to The Conjuring. I'd give it a 6 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "A couple begins to experience terrifying supernatural occurrences involving a vintage doll shortly after their home is invaded by satanic cultists.\n\nDirector John R. Leonetti Writer Gary Dauberman Stars Ward Horton Annabelle Wallis Alfre Woodard\n\nAnnabelle Wallis and her acting in the film Malignant 2021 lead me to seek out this film . I heard it was no good .But after seeing Miss Wallis tremendous performance in the latest James Wan flick , I figured how bad could the film Annabelle be with her beauty and talent...... well she delivers here too !\n\nWallis reminds me of the incomparable Audrey Hepburn.\n\nCoincidentally, Annabelle is the first name of the actress who plays title role of Mia.\n\nI must say, the early home invasion/cult murders sequences were quite harrowing. I like a period piece and the director nailed the 60's time with the props, cars , sets and costumes were rather well done bring you into the time period .The images of Charlie Manson and his f - up Helter Skelter playing on the Television in the back ground , set the ominous tone of this flicks opening act . For me ,what makes these types of films more compelling is the claim Annabelle and Conjuring films are based on accounts that paranormal researchers claim to be true. I think this movie got a bad rap . I think it is because it came out after the freaky Conjuring . Expectations were set at a very high bar. I classify it as a guilty pleasure type of horror film . And I rather enjoyed the ride. Maybe I am perseverating just a bit ,but Annabelle Wallis is just fascinating and pleasing to watch on screen .\n\nThe doll wasn't as central to the story as one would expect, rather it was more of a symbol of evil in the film. The occult mixed with biblical entities of evil , namely the word \"Belial\" that can be seen in a book on the occult . Belial is a term occurring in the Hebrew Bible which later became personified as the devil in Jewish and Christian texts. This type of horror is guaranteed to get under my skin every time . 6.8/10\n\nTrivia\n\nThe movie portrays the Annabelle doll as a porcelain doll, but the real Annabelle doll is a large \"Raggedy Ann\" doll. The Warrens had a special case built for Annabelle inside their Occult Museum, where she resides to this day.\n\nThe baby mobile hanging over the crib plays the same tune as the music box from The Conjuring (2013).\n\nThe real Annabelle doll was given to Donna (a college student at the time) by her mother in 1970. She and her roommate Angie noticed that the doll would move subtlety, then within a few weeks became fully mobile moving from one room to another while they were gone.\n\nEllen DeGeneres lived in the apartment used in the movie. While promoting Annabelle (2014) in her show, she explained that: \"The apartment in the movie was my first apartment that I moved to in L. A. That was the building I lived in, where they shot the movie. I was watching it going: 'That looks familiar', and it was my building. It was scary back then too.\"\n\nThe characters names 'Mia' and 'John' refer to the lead actors in Rosemary's Baby (1968): Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes. This movie is also about a young well to do couple in a luxury apartment having a baby in combination with satanists going for mother and child. The frequent noise of the neighbors in a adjacent apartment is a nod to the same movie.\n\n\ud83c\udf83 October 31 days of Halloween viewing 2021 \ud83c\udf83\n\n1. The Forever Purge F. T. V.

The writing is full of bad clich\u00e9s that even a good horror film would avoid. This movie is filled with loud lazy jump scares that are so predictable, the movie became a joke.

And a lot of people had hyped this movie up to being so much, which really made it seem like a must watch movie. And when I finally got around to seeing it, I ended up being disappointed on so many levels.\n\nThe story is a shameless cash in on a part of the popular \"The Conjuring\" movie in a vague attempt to bring life to the semi-creepy Annabelle doll displayed in \"The Conjuring\". It was weak soup boiled on a stripped down bone.\n\nThroughout the course of the entire movie I was waiting for something scary to happen on the screen. But nothing happened. Nothing! At best, the movie could muster a semi-creepy part with the basement / elevator / stairwell segment.\n\nSure, the doll itself is a bit creepy, but not to a point where it becomes scary or disturbing. And having a devil, demon or Satan himself crawl around on the ceiling was just slapping the audience in the face.\n\n\"Annabelle\" was a massive disappointment in so many ways. I love horror movies, but \"Annabelle\" belongs in the lower scale of scares and enjoyment value. If you enjoy a good horror movie with a properly though through storyline and containing scares, then your money is most definitely better spent elsewhere."

        "review_detailed_main": "Look, I mean how many horror sequel/prequels have ever been good? Let's count. Dawn of the Dead was good, Evil Dead 2 was good, and Aliens was good. Three, by my count. But honestly, these films are all over 25 years old, and Hollywood can't even get original horror movies right these days (at least not often). How on earth is a quick cash like Annabelle going to be any way decent?\n\nWell, miraculously, even if it doesn't compare to the films I already mentioned, Annabelle is a very smart, clever horror film, that manages to create a lot of suspense, only bringing out the big scares after enough of it has been generated. If you've seen The Conjuring, it's comparable. The films feels similar in style, but somehow a lot tighter; it's been pared down quite a bit. What that means is that a lot of the opulent, almost overwhelming atmosphere of that film is gone (and it's missed, if I'm honest), but is instead replaced by shorter, sharper shocks, with a lot more focus on the main story and the characters (who are unusually well defined and acted for a horror movie, especially the two female leads; for once, these people don't act stupid, and don't feel like stock horror movie victims - hurray!).\n\nSpeaking of the story, it's actually pretty decent. I'm not going to ruin it, but it's engaging if not exactly amazing. It does its job just well enough so that it feels like more than just an excuse to scare the audience, or get a bit more mileage out of the titular doll from hell. The scares are very well crafted. One or two are a bit hammy, but for the most part a lot of horror films could learn from this one. One particularly masterful sequence involves an elevator and had the whole cinema holding their breath; you'll know it when you see it. Another part - totally unmentionable without spoiling but spectacularly creepy - pretty much raised the roof.\n\nFilms like this aren't ever made to be high-art, they're made to get a specific reaction from an audience, so when a film like this does come around and turns out to be well crafted and fun, it's a rare treat. It's not perfect, but then I didn't need it to be to enjoy it. If you're planning to go see it, ignore the negative reviews. It's a treat."

I've seen my share of scary movies and I have to agree this was pretty darn scary.\n\nMother hen and goose, the jump scares are effective! 'Annabelle' is creepy as hell. Remember Annabelle - the crippled girl from 'Annabelle: Creation'? Well, she's back as Annabelle Higgins - named after the family who adopted her at the end of the aforementioned film. She's in the movie for just a little while - as a crazed woman who is a member of a cult - but plays a big part in the movie.\n\n'Annabelle' never really gets completely out of control like some films of this genre. The haunting is for most part very subtle, but there are some seriously scary and disturbing demonic images that will give you gooseflesh. Do not let young children watch this! Adhere to the age restriction, because this is guaranteed to give them nightmares. Even some adults might not be able to watch this creepy tale of possession.\n\nThe acting was very good; especially Annabelle Wallis as Mia (Yup, the lead actress is actually called Annabelle!!). I believed her desperation, fear and concern every step of the way. The doll itself didn't really play a big part in this movie. There were moments when I felt they included scenes of the doll simply because the film is named after the doll, but in fact there really was no need for the doll at all. The demonic presence would have sufficed, and was a lot scarier since the doll was actually passive. Nevertheless, 'Annabelle' is a great addition to the 'Conjuring' universe."

        "review_detailed_main": "While still possessing the same style of Conjuring, this is obviously a less exciting endeavor. The direction is a bit simple and rigid, borrowing much from old horror movies and surprisingly not enough sharp tension from the franchise. There's a merit on making it elementary, creating atmosphere of novel enmity for example, but the movie feels lackluster and mediocre instead. It still has some few good moments, although they timid or a given considering the blaring sound effect or repetitive close up on the doll are eerie by themselves.\n\nStory revolves around a married couple who struggles with unfortunate events all the while on the verge of delivering their newborn. It's a good setback to draw sympathy, albeit it's rather similar to Insidious and admittedly executed not as well. Annabelle Wallis as Mia Gordon and Ward Horton as John Gordon are serviceable and convincing enough as young parents, but they appear monotonous at times. There's not really much leeway as the plot progresses, those who have seen this kind of movie will probably foresee what the next scenes will be. Conjuring followed this formula too, yet it had much more impact and unless there's more intensity in future flicks, this recipe grows old quickly.\n\nThe style and placement of camera are pretty unique, it allows audience to guess what lies in the corner. This kind of cinematography persists, mainly because the director also works on Conjuring, The problem is Annabelle lacks the disturbing gripping moments of the same style. There is no increasing terror or swooping fright, the scares themselves are quite mild in comparison. Harrowing soundtracks help immensely as well as the screeching noise or screaming infant, these are things that ooze fear even outside context so having less horror even with their aid is a little underwhelming.\n\nWhat frightening about this style is the fear of unknown, after it manifests it loses steam. No one wants to see tug-of-war with demon. Annabelle doesn't bring any tense build-up nor does she explode in big climax. There can only be some much they can squeeze from the doll close up and screeching voices. If it wasn't for the Conjuring marketing, this will be remembered as another average horror film, or perhaps it would've been better that way."

Not enough is done to sell a character's action. And the optics of the act are terrible given about 400 years of context.\n\nBut the direction and set pieces are pretty good.

God knows what reason. The doll itself resembles a mad clown donning partial makeup while staring fiercely into the pits of hell... And where else would you put such an antique horror but facing a newborn child's crib within an otherwise innocent bedroom...\n\nThat's skipping ahead. By the time the couple, via 1969 during the Manson Family cult-killing period, bring new life into the world, Annabelle has already summoned likewise hippie freaks and eventually, The Devil himself rears his formidably horned face, an image way too familiar at this point - a ghost with white sheets would probably be scarier, or at least more mysterious.\n\nA hybrid of ROSEMARY'S BABY, POLTERGEIST, and THE EXORCIST... especially the rip-off conclusion... ANNABELLE has a few worthy jolts: But you can sneak up behind someone in a Disney film and cause the same reaction. The problem are the characters, so uninteresting and paper-thin that the time between spooks is more boring than necessary...\n\nAnd worst yet, the doll doesn't have enough to do: A conduit into the Netherworld is okay if the vessel is normal to begin with, but with a namesake antagonist so creepy, why invite anyone else to the party?"

At some point the daughter of the couple returns home and her and the other members of her cult do some very bad things.... and that leads to a demon possessed doll named Annabelle. The couple starts to experience mysterious goings on once they're baby is born and they've moved to a new home. With the help of a priest and a friend (Alfre Woodard) they try everything to keep their family safe and get rid of the evil. I really liked the actors and thought they did well with their roles. I liked Woodard's performance a lot, she was a very sentimental character, a newfound friend of Mia that helps them fight the demon. Annabelle Wallis (what a coincidence lol) was very good as Mia, the new mother who is the first to notice these satanic occurrences. I also thought that ward horton was convincing and a good pick to play the loving father/husband of the endangered family. The movie has some genuinely frightening moments. One of those moments being when Mia sees the demon in human form, that scene was scarier to me than anything in the conjuring or in the rest of Annabelle. I was scared more overall by this film than the conjuring. If you like a good horror movie, I suggest Annabelle. The ending is good too, meaningful in a way. 8/10."

I was expecting something along the lines of CHUCKY but, fortunately, the doll isn't possessed, it's just a gateway for a malevolent demon in search of a soul ...someone else's, of course. There's a few good \"jump scares\" and the entity is sufficiently menacing but, like its predecessor, the kind of chills the filmmakers are aiming for doesn't come from gore or CGI, more's the pity (for me, at any rate).\n\nIt was produced by James Wan, THE CONJURING's director, and directed by its cinematographer in the obvious hope lightning would strike twice but one film of this type was probably enough. That said, ANNABELLE isn't bad, especially for a seasonal film, but a third entry (and I hear it's coming) would hold no interest for me without a higher body count dispatched in explicit fashion. Gimme gore dammit, even if it's just a little and my imagination will take it from there. That said, not everyone feels the same way so \"milage may vary\"."

I didn't have many expectations for \"Conjuring\" and I was pleasantly surprised. In this case, and knowing that this film came more or less following that one, I expected something with some quality, at least... but that's not what I found.\n\nThis film is a horror story created around a vintage doll that is supposedly inhabited by a demon. The film even starts well and promises a lot, but gets lost along the way. I don't know what was worse... the script was weak, with a boring and illogical story, the scares are predictable (we foreseen it ten seconds in advance, no exaggeration). But perhaps the worst of all is the absence of any tension or suspense, that sense of danger or threat that makes even the stupidest horror movie basically work. The film never manages to build that and I just watched it with the emotion and interest of those who go to the grocery store to buy some fruits.\n\nThe cast is weak. Ward Horton and Annabelle Wallis are the only actors with material to show some talent. Despite that, I cannot say that I saw a dramatic show. The material given to the actors is bad and none of the character has been well developed or stands out. The film was directed by John R. Leonetti, who is good at cinematography and should stick to it (the few films he has directed, including this one, do not inspire me to try again or recommend it as director). He was responsible for the cinematography of \"Conjuring\" and, as a result, these two films have a very similar look, which indicates that he left his stamp on the visual style and camera work here.\n\nIndeed, cinematography is very good, perhaps one of the strengths here. With an excellent balance of light and shadow, it knows how to give this film an elegant and, sometimes, sinister visual beauty that, unfortunately, the script does not follow and ends up without any practical use. The sets and costumes, very much like the 60s, also look great on the screen. The soundtrack is good, but not surprising."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Annabelle: A Creepy and Tense Thriller\"\n\n\"Annabelle\" is a horror movie that delivers on its promise of chills and suspense, but it falls short of being a truly exceptional addition to the genre. Directed by John R. Leonetti and released in 2014, the film serves as a prequel to \"The Conjuring\" series, aiming to explore the unsettling origins of the infamous haunted doll.\n\nThe film opens on a promising note, setting a gloomy and eerie atmosphere from the very beginning. The old-fashioned setting, complete with vintage furniture and dimly lit hallways, adds to the movie's overall creepy ambiance. The story centers around a young couple, John and Mia Form, who experience a series of bizarre and terrifying events after receiving a vintage doll as a gift.\n\nThe cast's performances are generally commendable, with Annabelle Wallis as Mia and Ward Horton as John effectively portraying the growing dread and helplessness that befall their characters. Alfre Woodard, who plays Evelyn, a bookstore owner with a connection to the supernatural occurrences, adds depth to the supporting cast. However, despite the cast's efforts, the character development leaves something to be desired. The audience is given limited insight into the characters' motivations and emotions, making it difficult to form a strong connection with them.\n\nWhere \"Annabelle\" truly shines is in its ability to create tension and deliver heart-pounding scares. The movie employs classic horror techniques, such as well-timed jump scares and ominous sound design, to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The eerie presence of the doll and the sinister events that unfold around it contribute to a sense of impending doom. Moments of suspense are well-executed, and the movie's pacing allows for a gradual buildup of fear.\n\nThe film's visual effects and practical makeup are worthy of praise. The malevolent entities that haunt the characters are visually unsettling, effectively sending shivers down the audience's spines. The movie wisely avoids overusing CGI, relying instead on practical effects to create a more authentic and unsettling atmosphere.\n\nHowever, \"Annabelle\" is not without its flaws. The plot occasionally suffers from predictability, and some of the narrative choices feel formulaic, adhering closely to horror movie conventions. Additionally, the pacing could have been more consistent; while the movie effectively builds suspense, there are moments when it drags, causing the tension to wane.\n\nFurthermore, the film's attempt to tie into \"The Conjuring\" universe sometimes feels forced. While it's commendable that \"Annabelle\" seeks to provide context for the doll's origins, the connections to the broader cinematic universe can distract from the story being told within the movie itself. This reliance on franchise-building elements occasionally hampers the film's ability to stand on its own merits.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Annabelle\" is a serviceable horror movie that succeeds in delivering moments of genuine fright and unease. It benefits from a strong atmosphere, effective visual and practical effects, and well-executed scares. While the character development and narrative choices leave room for improvement, the film achieves its goal of providing a chilling viewing experience. If you're a fan of supernatural horror and don't mind a few familiar tropes, \"Annabelle\" is worth a watch for its ability to elicit shivers and keep you engaged throughout its runtime."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a prequel and spin-off of The Conjuring - 2013's highly effective horror film - Annabelle does what it promises, even if it does so one jump and one jolt at a time. But that's all you get, jumpy scenes done to perfection, with little or no atmosphere and a story that disintegrates before it reaches a satisfying conclusion.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of The Conjuring and older sibling Insidious (both films directed by James Wan), is the cinematography and how it wreaks havoc with the viewer's peripheral vision. By this I am referring to events occurring off-center, or in some corner of the screen that is oblivious to on-screen characters but very obvious to the viewer. Consider a scene where a mother watches over her new born baby. The scene is shot in the living room where the right half of the frame is composed of the mother and her baby and the left half is a hallway that leads to other rooms in the house. Without shifting focus from the mother and child, we see something or someone lurking in the hallway behind; something that shouldn't be there in the first place. While this tactic is nothing new to horror-thrillers, it works for the whole purpose of inducing dread, thick and slow, before the actual jolt hits a few seconds later. The scariest scenes in Annabelle are made up of these moments, and at times we are left guessing what lurks in the corners. And is probably why cinematographer John R Leonetti of those preceding films is tasked with directorial duties in this film, while Wan himself is bumped up to producer. Leonetti plays it safe by treading down Wan's beaten path but without any surprises of his own.\n\nPlaying the aforementioned mother is Annabelle Wallis (freaky coincidence?) as Mia Gordon. Mia has a doll collection, one of which is the titular vintage doll gifted by her medical student husband John (Ward Horton). After surviving a horrific attack from a satanic cult, the Gordons have new guests that won't leave. At first Mia starts seeing things and becomes increasingly paralysed by fear while John begins to doubt her sanity. It's a stock approach to crying wolf in horror movies. It takes a while to dawn on them that something has latched on to Annabelle, making the doll a conduit with increasing intent on harming them and their new born baby. Consultations with a librarian and a priest reveal far greater implications, thus leaving these young parents to ward off hell by going right through it.\n\nOn one hand, the look and feel in this film is a copy-paste version of Insidious, but concentrated with sporadic moments of numbing fright. We've seen it before in classic horror films - young parents who must literally go through hell to save their child's soul. It's the same concept here but effective enough for a low budget horror film. Like a stern disciple, Leonetti is on par with Wan's technical approach. Cinematography, hair raising sound design (including deliberate moments without sound), and some decent tension will garner a few screams from the audience, but that's about it. On the downside, there isn't much of a story for a script based on real events and don't even expect anything along the lines of an animated '\u00c7hucky' doll. It's not about what the doll can do but about what's in the doll -If only they had built on that frame of thought. After some well-timed jump scares in the first half, all we are left with is a murky conclusion owing to underwritten supporting cast members whose inclusion leaves the ending stale and cheap."

And when I mean forced, I mean it seems like the director and writers was just making stuff up as they go. It might have worked for a few minutes in \"The Conjuring\" but for a full 1 hour and 30 minute spin-off, it really really really drags. The only thing topnotch about this movie is how predictable it is. Overall, this is a waste of time, especially if you are a horror fan.\n\n2.3/10"

Annabelle pulls out the normal, clich\u00e9d stops, closing doors, rocking chair sound effect, child laughter, an oblivious husband, and, of course, an all knowing priest while adding nothing new to the genre. Nothing here felt surprising at all, it didn't even feel like it was well done either (unlike The Conjuring which was extremely clich\u00e9d as well, but so very well put together that it was good). As for the story, it just seems to make no sense why the family would continue to own that doll after it was found in the hands of a murderer and then suddenly reappears after being thrown out.\n\nPerhaps the biggest issue with the movie is that the doll itself just isn't effective enough or that we don't see enough of the demon using it as a conduit. Movies like Child's Play (where the doll had a personality and was unpredictable) seem to be more intense because the dolls are more of an actual character rather than a portal for the supernatural. I will leave you with this final thought, the 15 minutes or so that Annabelle is featured in The Conjuring are FAR more harrowing and chilling than the whole 90 minutes of Annabelle."

However, it's not horrifying in any sense of the word. There are just two scenes that are really scary in the movie. The rest of the movie is not terrifying at all. The movie is extremely predictable. Except for one scene, the jump scares in the movie are very obvious. So, the viewer does not jump out of his/her skin. A note on the performances. Annabelle Wallis is very mediocre as Mia. Wallis' expressions do not show genuine fear of whatever is happening around her. Maybe I would have gotten more scared if, she would emote with her eyes instead of just screaming hysterically. Ward Horton is effective as John. Tony Amendola is impressive as Father Perez. Alfre Woodard is good as Evelyn. Eric Laden is great as Detective Clarkin. Annabelle is not a must watch. However, if you're a fan of The Conjuring, watch it.

This spin off, Annabelle, however... unfortunately this one was kinda weak, not in the same class as the other two. Now I'm just hoping the sequel, Annabelle: Creation, will be an improvement.\n\nSomething about this one just didn't work that well. I guess, one problem would be that the scares seemed over-reliant on some of the same repeated tricks: flickering lights, or some machine turning on when no one's around, or sounds of a baby crying, or something appearing in the room behind a character. The movie repeated these tricks so often that throughout the movie I actually found myself constantly correctly guessing what kind of trick is going to be coming next.\n\nAnd everything felt a little too static. In other words, motionless, if you know what I mean. The premise does revolve around a doll, of course, but for too much of the time in this movie, the scares are supposed to be coming from nothing that's visibly moving on screen and that just ends up kind of unexciting.\n\nThere was also a problem with some underdeveloped characters and potential plot lines that go nowhere: The kids on the stairs, the noisy upstairs neighbors, the bookstore owner whose occult connections were barely explained, etc.\n\nI should end with some positive though. Annabelle Wallis is pretty good at acting scared and has no hint of her real-life English accent when she speaks, so let's all applaud her acting talents.\n\nAnd the best moment in the movie involved a child running towards a closing door. I won't say anymore, except that it was a great scene and I'm really astonished that they managed to achieve that shot, however they did it."

Chucky from Child's Play was way scarier, Annabelle is nothing compared to him. This movie was so unoriginal, I had to force myself to keep looking at the screen.

It's rare to find a scary movie these days that is actually scary. The movie isn't ground breaking but it is extremely creepy and had everyone in the theater jumping out of their chairs. It was also effective in building suspense and there were a couple of scenes that were so creepy that you could actually feel the terror that the character was feeling. I left the theater feeling like had just live through the experience myself. The cinematography and a surprisingly good performance from the female lead really draws you into the terrifying situation. Personally, I don't care how the movie provided the numerous jolting scenes, the fact is that the entire audience was jumping and screaming the whole time. We were all laughing at ourselves as you know that it's coming, yet you can't help but be jolted. I recommend seeing it in the theater so that you can enjoy the ride with others. It's similar to riding a daunting roller- coaster multiple times, you know what to expect but you still scream every time . It's not The Conjuring but it still works. Annabelle made my heart race in anticipation consistently throughout the movie which is highly unusual in today's horror genre. It's a solid, absorbing 90 minutes of entertainment that doesn't rely on gore tactics. I highly recommend it."

Her face was a blank mask no matter what emotion she was supposed to be portraying. I just didn't care what happened to her at all. Not to single her out though- the acting was atrocious across the board, especially the priest who gets called by the couple. The only exception was Alfre Woodard, who played a book shop owner (AND who also very wisely chose not to be listed in the cast credits!!) I really love slowly building , intelligent horror like the Conjuring or the Others- if you do too this move will disappoint."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's 1969 and the Manson family is in the news. Dr. John Gordon (Ward Horton) and his pregnant wife Mia (Annabelle Wallis) move into a Santa Monica house. He buys a vintage doll for her collection. They are attacked by a Higgins cult couple. The police arrives just in time. Strange things happen and the kitchen burns. They decide to throw out the doll and move to an apartment in Pasadena with their daughter Leah. Somehow the doll is in one of the boxes and Mia decides to keep it. Strange things continue to happen. Father Perez (Tony Amendola) and Evelyn (Alfre Woodard) try to help the young family.\n\nThe last half of the movie is a struggle. At least the first half has the sewing machine. They're able to squeeze some tension from that prop. The gimmick is that Annabelle needs someone to voluntarily give up their soul. It makes the victim a pretty weak character. Essentially it preys on the weak and vulnerable. It's not scary. It's kinda pathetic. The movie relies too much on things moving in the background and other less than effective scare tactics. It adds nothing original."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Annabelle\" (2014) is a prequel or a spin off, call how you like it to a great horror film \"The Conjuring\". Sadly, in terms of quality and chills, this movie is far from \"The Conjuring\".\n\n\"Annabelle\" story is very simple and generic even for a horror movies - trust me you saw this kind of plot hundreds of time before. The acting was very wooden in my opinion, especially by both leads. Directing was OK, but just OK, because at the running time 1 h 35 min this movie dragged a bit there and there, and if horror movie drags, this is never a good sign. There were some chilly moments, but far and in between, and all of the were created not by a mood, but by simple silence and then \"gotcha!\" moments - dull.\n\nOverall, \"Annabelle\" is not the worst horror movie, it's not. But it's a very poor prequel to a very good horror flick and poor movie itself. It's not particularly scary, it's badly acted and overall, you can skip this flick."

        "review_detailed_main": "'ANNABELLE': Three Stars (Out of Five)\n\nPrequel to the 2013 hit supernatural horror flick 'THE CONJURING'. It's said to be based on another true haunting, investigated by Ed and Lorraine Warren (the paranormal investigating team that the first film revolved around). This tale deals with the back-story of the doll named Annabelle (which was heavily featured in the original movie). The film stars Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, Tony Amendola and Alfre Woodard. It was directed by John R. Leonetti, written by Gary Dauberman and coproduced by James Wan (the director of the original movie). While it is frightening and creepy enough, at times, it's still not nearly as impressive as the original.\n\nThe movie begins, in 1968, with two young women, and a young man, explaining to Ed and Lorraine Warren how they think their doll 'Anabelle' is haunted (it's the same opening scene as 'THE CONJURING'). The story then flashes back to a year earlier, 1967, when a young couple, named John (Horton) and Mia Gordon (Wallis), are newlyweds and expecting their first child. John gives Mia a vintage doll as a present; that she adds to her collection, in the baby's room. Some time later the couple is attacked in their home, by satanic cult members. They're rescued by the police, but then strange supernatural occurrences begin happening; all involving the doll 'Anabelle' (which was the name of one of the cult members).\n\nThe movie is really slow paced but that's often to be expected, with this type of film. It does have that classic 60s and 70s thriller style to it and the frights, and creepy imagery, are done really well. I don't think the two leads are nearly as charismatic, or likable, as Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga (Ed and Lorraine Warren) in the first movie. The story also isn't as compelling or genuinely frightening. Just as a stand-alone horror film it's pretty decent but when comparing it to the original movie it definitely falls a little short.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/SWKktTowhSI"

From the moment you see the doll you can tell it is evil and to be feared. However the story and story development are not as good as \"The Conjuring\" but it contains much more jump scares and scary moments. Unfortunately though you are left with a few unanswered questions after watching. Definitely worth a watch though, even if you haven't seen \"The Conjuring\" yet but be warned,there were lots of people screaming in the cinema when I watched. 8/10 a great horror film, just in time for Halloween."

I love scary movies, and while some of them aren't great, this one is special for a few reasons.\n\nFirstly, it's really good at making you feel nervous and scared throughout. The way they control the speed of the story and use quiet sounds is creepy. When I saw it in the cinema, I felt scared the whole time, which is perfect for a scary movie. Also, the way they filmed it makes even simple parts feel spooky.\n\nAnother thing that makes 'Annabelle' different is how it's connected to other scary movies like 'The Conjuring.' And let's be honest, that doll is now famous in scary movies, right? It looks really creepy, and the way they use it in the movie to make you scared without using too many sudden scares is impressive.\n\nMy kids and I watched it on niudy.net, and after the movie, they were scared to even go to the bathroom! Haha, we all got so scared at some parts, it was funny."

Reading about the real doll is scarier then this movie. The only people this movie might scare are children. Not even worth watching on Halloween not even in a dark room all alone. you won't be scared one bit. Best to watch a scary movie made a long time ago when scary movies were actually scary. I watched this with my mother and brother both said this movie was not scary and they watch scary movies a lot."

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...something about a doll.\n\nI would have a serious job on my hands trying to spoil any further plot development because I didn't notice any. Let me try...OK, a few doors slam of their own accord (shudder!)... Some curtains start mysteriously blowing about in a way that seems excessive considering the apparent weather conditions outside (yikes!)...There is some screaming (aaaiiiieeeee!)... The end.\n\nThe main crime this movie is guilty of - apart from the lead actress being as ineffectual as a lettuce leaf when trying to act scared - is that it's no FUN.

        "review_detailed_main": "My friend and I considered watching 'Annabelle' on the big screen. But we put off our visit to the cinema and decided to wait for the DVD instead. It turned out to be a good decision. While 'The Conjuring' did nothing new to the horror genre, it was still a solid movie that hit all the right notes. When a spin-off about the creepy doll was announced, I was suitably expectant, though fully aware that the movie might fail to impress, as most spin-offs generally tend to. As horror movies go, the plot is straightforward; happy family \u2013 Quiet life \u2013 Bad purchase decisions \u2013 Trouble comes knocking. The actors are serviceable at best. Ward Horton simply exists to play the supportive husband whose duty is to innocently wonder if his wife is losing her mind. Alfre Woodard is the sympathetic neighbor who seems to have the right answers. But it is the leading lady herself who stumbles. Annabelle Wallis who plays the role of Mia Form is hard to empathize with. Throughout the movie, with deranged satanic cultists, ghosts and demons running around, she remains largely composed. A horror movie's biggest draw is its ability to depict the abject terror of its protagonists and for someone whose life is threatened by supernatural forces beyond comprehension, our leading lady manages to retain an air of aristocratic primness as though the things happening to her are as bothersome as milk gone sour. The movie could have made good use of the fear of the unknown. Instead it puts a face on everything and offers simple explanations for every occurrence. The doll itself manages to lose its scare factor by the end. This, in my opinion, is the movie's biggest drawback. Rent it if you'd like something that doesn't tax your mind."

Turns out there are good moments in this film, but I do understand other moments that made audiences believe to be one of the worst movies they've seen.\n\nI like the characters and their personalities. I love the suspense of the scenes. I also like how the film didn't rely on jump-scares to bring the horror out of the narrative. And lastly, I loved the romantic chemistry between Mia & John and how they genuinely care for each other.\n\nNow for some critiques. The film does focus a lot on Mia perspective. I really do wish John could experience more of the paranormal activity other than the beginning scene when he fights against the possessed neighbors. Evelyn's appearance felt like she came out of nowhere and tries to get involved with the Form family. Probably just me. And there were some horror scene that felt a little dragged too long than it should've been.\n\nOverall, I didn't think it was bad. Agree or disagree, just give it a chance to be good."

I though the story line was near perfect for what the film had to achieve in its ending, the story was quiet overall but very sharp when it had its moments. And this is something that personal preference takes the reins with. I think the story would have got overcooked with much more than what was there in terms of horror \"Action\".\n\nAnnabelle Wallis did very well in this movie too I think, a very well cast character, light and serene always makes for a better main character in these types of movies for me.\n\nI see this movie as a movie all of it own that just happens to explain a small part in The Conjuring rather than a spin- off.

They also stole a lot from other movies to make this one which is pathetic. The Annabelle doll exists in other movies just so people know. I wont spoil because its some scenes in this movie that shows it.\n\nWell if you want to watch a crappy movie about some doll that kills, then watch it i guess. There are way better \"doll-killer\" movies out there like Childs play and all those classics.\n\nThis was hyped for nothing and i was extremely disappointing. I hope the people that made this movie watches this review and realize how bad it was. I'm sorry I've seen pretty much every Horror movie out there and this is just beyond bad.\n\nDon't waste your time. I'm serious."

        "review_detailed_main": "A couple begin to experience terrifying supernatural occurrences involving a vintage doll shortly after their home is invaded by satanic cultists.\n\nAnnabelle is produced by James Wang and directed by his preferred cinematographer of choice R.R Leonetti. This movie is kind of a sequel to The Conjuring and I absolutely loved The Conjuring. Actually Leonetti was director of the photography on Insidious 1, Insidious 2 and The Conjuring; which all three movies happen to be one of my favorites horror movies of all time. Annabelle is the creepiest looking doll I've ever seen in my life, who ever thought to bring it into their house? Really... Who on earth would put that thing in their baby's room? No one sain for sure. This movie is based on jump scare after jump scare. The horror is obvious, you know something is going to happen. There were not that much of suspense building over the film though and the construction of the scary scenes. In fact, the film making doesn't properly fit the tones of sound effects that are supposed to make you feel something very scary is happening. My favorite scene is the elevator/staircase sequence which is really cool. For the first hour of the movie nothing really scary happen, it's just some pretty creepy close up of the doll. And then, that's when all the real scary things properly start to happen, we can actually see the demon: that's cool. Finally in this film mostly all the characters were not that great. They are all flat and lifeless; narrating the story of a perfect couple with a cute baby on the way and money which comes from god knows where. Unsurprising.\n\nOverall Annabelle is a bit disappointing as it was so predictable, it's not as close to be as good as The Conjuring."

Is it a haunted doll, or is the area around the doll haunted? Are we supposed to be scared of the doll? Is the doll dangerous?\n\nIt also made me reflect that so many of the jump scares would be so much more effective if they weren't always accompanied by abrupt notes on the soundtrack. It's like a laugh-track on a lame sitcom. If it's scary, we don't need the movie to tell us so.\n\n\"The Conjuring\" is no masterpiece, but this makes it look good."

        "review_detailed_main": "Annabelle had a lot to live up to after The Conjuring - a film that breathed new life into a thoroughly played out genre. Unfortunately, it did not do so, and has endured an inflated amount of bad press as a result. The key to The Conjuring's success was a combination of truly well-crafted scare sequences, together with an engaging narrative and cast of characters. Director John R. Leonetti recaptures the first of these two components very well in Annabelle, but unfortunately falters with the latter.\n\nBoth movies follow a formula that involves long periods of potentially terrifying situations turning out to be completely mundane, before then following through with the terror when sufficient tension has been built up. Annabelle uses the same fantastically executed visual and audial techniques to attempt to build this tension, but an audience will only feel a sense of dread if they actually care what happens to the characters on screen.\n\nIn a word, the characters in Annabelle are bland. As a result, the long periods in between jump scares tend to end up feeling similarly bland - which is never a thing you want 50% of your runtime to be described as.\n\nThe blandness is far from unbearable, however, and encased within it are some incredibly well crafted scenes. The home invasion near the start of the film is scary as hell. The elevator sequence is unforgettable. The eponymous doll herself is perpetually creepy, and the moment we finally catch her in motion is perfectly harrowing. Speaking of dear old Annabelle, she is featured sparingly but just enough to retain her fear factor, and I cannot stress how good a choice it was to avoid turning her into a Chucky-esque creature that walks, talks and murders on-screen.\n\nThroughout all of these shiny and not so shiny moments, our peripheral vision is bombarded with endless potential hazards - teasing us with the anticipation of a scare at all times, with a successful pay-off pretty much every time it actually follows through. The film is undoubtedly scary. Many people will argue against this point, but these same people tend not to be phased by any Horror media and thus set unachievable standards for 'scariness' (which is entirely subjective regardless).\n\nOverall, the two sides of the Annabelle coin come together to make a somewhat average film, but a must-see experience if you are a horror enthusiast!"

        "review_detailed_main": "ANNABELLE is another derivative horror film, very similar in look and tone to THE CONJURING, of which it is a spin off. The predictable story sees your usual happily married couple come into possession of a creepy doll and who subsequently find themselves menaced by ghostly events at their home.\n\nNeedless to say this is a very traditional haunted house movie with nothing in the way of originality or freshness to recommend it. Mainly the film follows the wife as she's spooked by various apparitions and creepy stuff going on. The cast is made up of the usual priests, doctors, and disbelievers, and the scares are inevitably of the CGI-enhanced variety. When did modern horror become so passe? Well-telegraphed scares and endless supposedly creepy dread does not a good film make. Annabelle Wallis, who was quite dreadful in PEAKY BLINDERS, is equally unsympathetic here and ANNABELLE as a whole is a chore to watch."

And, if you have a phobia of dolls like I do, then you will most likely be frightened by it too! Either way, it's definitely worth watching, so get it on DVD (it's only a few quid) and enjoy yourself."

        "review_detailed_main": "Conjuring was one movie in the horror genre that stood out for its narrative and treatment in horrifying the audience to the maximum with its visual and sound effects though story wise it was the same thing of possession that we have seen numerous times in films. But it served the ultimate purpose of frightening the audiences. Now we have a prequel following up The Conjuring as Annabelle begins before the incidents unfold in Conjuring. About Annabelle, the film is watchable and scare the viewers but somewhere, the zing or the X factor is missing here to make it a memorable, well crafted and an effective horror flick. So this an average film when compared with some classic horrors.\n\nJohn and Mia are a happily married young couple expecting their first child when John gift Mia a big doll. But they are in for a nightmare as strange things happen in their life once this doll enter their life. Yes you guessed it right; this doll is possessed creating havoc in John and Mia's life that continues after Leah their baby is born. Rest every thing is a predictable drama with familiar climax and series of events that we have seen and is quite common in horror flicks.\n\nThe film has few moments that will scare you but those are very limited to make Annabelle a highly engaging film. No comparisons can be made between Annabelle and Conjuring as the latter is far ahead of the former in many aspects. But as a separate movie, Annabelle is passable with least of expectations.\n\nThe actors who portrayed John and Mia were good in their respective roles. A lady character enter John and Mia's life at the fag end of the movie and it was a nice performance from her though the role was small. Last but not the least, Annabelle the doll deserves a special mention with that smiling but haunting looks. On the technical side, visual effects were OK along with good sound design.\n\nOverall, without a comparison with any of the classic horror movies and conjuring, Annabelle is passable and qualify to be an average film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This terror film is not spectacular but is very effective. The filmmakers certainly know how to play well all the audience buttons. John and Mia are a young white couple living in the Los Angeles area in the late 1960s. John (Ward Horton) is an upcoming doctor. Her blonde wife, Mia, is a homemaker, and is expecting her first child (well played by Annabelle Wallis, who is in fact English). Everything seems to going well for them. One day after they settle in their new suburban home, John gives Mia as a present an over sized doll. Very soon, creepy, sinister things will start happening to them.\n\nThis is a sort of prequel of a well regarded horror movie I haven't seen, called The Conjuring. But there are also references to many previous horror movies, like Chucky (only instead of a he doll we have a she doll), the Exorcist (the family soon gets the help of a priest that is an expert in fighting demons), and Rosemary's Baby (Mia, whose name almost certainly wasn't chosen by chance, is heavily pregnant). In fact, Rosemary's Baby is not the only reference to its director Roman Polanski: soon the couple will become victims of a Manson-style family (and in one part of the movie, she is seen watching a TV news item about the real Charles Manson). John Leonetti directed. Also with Alfre Woodward (playing the noble black character)."

Leonetti's film centred around one of that films creepiest plot points of haunted doll Annabelle is an atrocious horror effort that looks to tick of every clich\u00e9 in the horror book while portraying a wholly uninteresting story.\n\nBy now it is somewhat expected that most horror films play out to some sort of seen before plan but Annabelle does so little to distinguish itself from any other such title that after half an hour or so you're wondering if anything or anyone will do something to save this film from the doldrums. In saying this one of the most shockingly scary elements to the film is just how effective its first 15 or so minutes are and for a while you'd be right in expecting the unexpected and enjoying Annabelle's success. From this effective and terror laden opening act however things slide rapidly downhill into a shoddily edited and staged story that forgets to provide either the chills, thrills or scares to even stand in the same room as its fine parent film.\n\nCalling this film Annabelle seems like a marketing ploy in false advertisement as after this promising beginning, Annabelle takes a back seat to haunted prams, evil bookshelves, Alfre Woodard looking for a pay check, possessed popcorn, societies of the Ram and various other insidious strands that all fail to scare or resonate. The filmmakers here clearly didn't know how to make a 90 minute movie about a haunted doll and their subsequent ideas can't really stand on their own from Annabelle Wallis's troubled housewife and enthusiastic seamstress Mia and her doting husband John played by the frighteningly bland Ward Horton through to any of the side characters this is a film that needed some more interesting distractions if Annabelle herself was going to be such a half-baked and underutilised device.\n\nIf you're looking for some scares why not just watch the Conjuring again as I'm positive even a re-watch of James Wan horror would provide more intrigue and chills than Annabelle could even dream of. A shoddy excuse of a cash in, let's hope the second Conjuring journey is a whole league better than this nasty piece of trash, but then again what really did we expect from the director that bought us Mortal Combat: Annihilation?\n\n1 evil bag of popcorn out of 5\n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check into -\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "As recently as the last half a century, dolls have been mostly used in cinema and in pop-culture for their looks. It is very questionable to who ever constructed such toys would think they excited kids, rather than creep them out. When referenced, the most notable creation people remember is Don Mancini's Child's Play (1988) series starring Brad Dourif as the infamous Chucky. Another one that comes to mind would be James Wan's Jigsaw from the Saw (2004) series. Even Billy from Dead Silence (2007), who was also headed by James Wan had their share of memorabilia. Then when Wan's The Conjuring (2013) hit theaters, viewers were briefly introduced to Annabelle,...another doll with some serious attitude issues. So what is the story behind this new addition and is it uniquely different from that of our other doll counterparts? Mmm...tough to say. It has its moments but more often than not, it comes off as a standard affair.\n\nThe Annabelle doll, like many others, was once just a collector's item. Unfortunately, the period of time at which it was made is the problem. During the late 1960s, a normal family is attacked by a group of cult members for unknown reasons and along with that the doll becomes possessed. Gary Dauberman's first theatrical screenplay isn't bad, but it also isn't anything special. The fact that after seeing this movie, the background to why Annabelle needs to be kept in a glass case at the Warren's is so important is clear. But other than this, the writing lacks clarity - specifically on cult rules. How does one possess a doll with such ease? Who actually possesses the doll? A newly created demon? Or the individual who possessed it in the first place? All of which these questions get relatively skimmed over with explanations like - \"Crazy people do crazy things\" or \"Cults summon demons\". These are very generic answers, considering the pace at which it runs.\n\nCast wise, the family played by Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton put in believable performances but do not stand out. Even veteran actor Tony Amendola (better known from Antonio Banderas' The Mask of Zorro (1998)) plays his typecast role - a priest. It's nice to see him, but again, nothing new. The most likable character of the whole group was Evelyn (Alfre Woodard), a local bookstore owner. Evelyn had charm and character arc that was far greater than the rest. It's characters like these that viewers need more of. When it came to visual style, the majority of it was average to slightly above. James Kniest's cinematography is frequently flat. John R. Leonetti's direction is standard on most cases too. This is unfortunate due to how many horror films he's worked with in the past as the director of photography. This includes, The Conjuring (2013), Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013), Piranha 3D (2010), Dead Silence (2007) and Child's Play 3 (1991),....even Jim Carrey's The Mask (1994). In fact, there was a scene that could've been used as a twist ending but was then ignored. That would've been more horrific if it had ended like that.\n\nThe violence is there but it is also very dry. I'm not sure if Leonetti was going for the \"less is more\" approach but it didn't work. Considering the scares aren't effective either because the Annabelle doll does barely anything. The movement of the doll is even more restricted and rigid than Chucky, Billy or Jigsaw. The only thing creepy about it was its face and never ending stare. Even eye movement or creaky head turning would've helped the doll feel more intimidating. The only elements that go above and beyond their mark are some tense scenes, special effects and music. The best scene to the movie is located in the attic. Whenever a baby cries,...its a bit unsettling. The special / practical effects look decent although what is given isn't frequent. Composer Joseph Bishara's music is alright. He does include emotional and creepy tunes, which involve heavy cello and piano. It's bit more effective than The Conjuring score he made a year before, even though it does borrow from it because the stories are connected. Is it a decently made movie? Assembly wise yes,...as an experience? Not if you seen movies like this before.\n\nIts connections to The Conjuring (2013) does give some insight but its own origins are bit cloudy. It's made professionally all the way down from its acting, special effects and music but it is rarely effective at being scary. Its execution is derivative at almost every level."

        "review_detailed_main": "The eerie antique doll Annabelle featured in The Conjuring gets the titular cinematic treatment to attenuating effect.\n\nA spin-off from The Conjuring, the film Annabelle tells the unnerving back story of the possessed and disturbing doll.\n\nA humdrum couple whom is pregnant is readying the baby room for their imminent arrival. Mother-to-be Mia has an affinity for vintage dolls and receives rare Annabelle from husband John on the night her family is viciously attacked by satanic cultists.\n\nAbout the only thing that scriptwriter Gary Dauberman does get correct is the chilling scene where the cult members attack the Gordon residence. The circumstances of the event were well thought out, appropriate for the time period and moderately unexpected. Unfortunately this is the only horrifying scene of the entire film.\n\nAnnabelle straddles the line between homage to the supernatural thrillers of the 70's and uninspired rip-off of the supernatural thrillers of the 70's. The scares are far more feeble and ineffective than its peers, either because they are incredibly clich\u00e9 or just lamely repetitive. Any hope for truly unsettling scares are overlooked and post-production unnecessarily adds the deafening and notorious string sound effect at every opportunity.\n\nDirector John R. Leonetti relies on loud sewing machines, loud record players and doors randomly closing for the regular frights of the film \u2013 all of which are just no longer scary anymore. The direction manages to lack all ability to add mood and tone. Leonetti is not opinionated nor deliberate in his styling and does little to assist in the few scares that are in the film.\n\nPerhaps Annabelle suffers from overly high and unrealistic expectations. I can't help but feel that if the production companies New Line Cinema and The Safran Company had not rushed to capitalize on The Conjuring's success and waited for a better script and more qualified director that overall a better film would have been produced.\n\nFor FULL reviews of RECENT releases, please check out our website."

        "review_detailed_main": "Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!!\n\n**queue intro music**\n\nTonight's movie review is the supernatural horror flick Annabelle (2014), a spin-off/prequel to the first Conjuring movie in the franchise. The story is set in the 60's and revolves around a soon to be doctor John Form and his pregnant wife Mia Form who seem to live a normal life, until John gifts his wife a rare, vintage doll named Annabelle. This is when their happiness is short-lived, first their neighbours get slaughtered and straight away their home is invaded by a cult of satanic worshippers and one of them dies in the nursery while holding the Annabelle doll. After the incident, strange and terrifying events start to occur around the couple. The couple realise they face a doll of great sinister power, a conduit of evil and put their faith to each other to find a way to defeat the evil presence. The cinematography of this flick make the story flow through with suspense due to the quick shots, which gives you less than a second to realize what is happening in the scene and levels up the scene fear factor when a scary looking doll pops up. The story in itself - its predictable until the very end, it gets pretty intense towards the end, but only towards the end. The character development, in particular the neighbour at the couple's new apartment played by the lovely Alfre Woodward, is the only let down, great acting but really all the actors don't have much to play with. Woodward's character helps make the story more interesting such as finding out the cult known as the Ram and the nature of the doll is to look for a soul as a new host. The doll does usual supernatural things like operating a sewing machine and playing a record player while both are switched off, but the annoying bit the story sometimes feel forced. In the movie, there are several inconsistencies and unresolved plot points. For instance, the possessed doll seemingly attempts to harm the unborn baby, which contradicts the explanation that the doll is a vessel for a demon seeking an innocent soul. A helpful mystical woman, who owns a bookstore with occult knowledge, assists the main characters. They discover the cult responsible for the haunting but fail to utilize this information effectively against the doll. Additionally, there are subplots involving children drawing disturbing pictures, but these threads are left unresolved and do not contribute to the main storyline. Overall a scary film in the franchise - whoever made up the Annabelle character should be examined and congratulated by making dolls scare a bloke in his thirties 6/10."

Especially because I've already before seen Annabelle Comes Home, which uses the same tricks, like the rocking chair, and banging on the door. Good thing about this movie is that the special effects are ok. There aren't much cheap looking cgi monster moments. I liked the lead actress (called Annabelle Wallis!). She makes this movie somewhat good. The male lead guy Ward Horton is more wooden. The script could have been better. The priest character didn't have much use and the ending could have been better.\n\nThis is one of those movies that are entertaining to watch once but I doubt I'll ever have a need to see it again."

Everyone else seems like they are more convincing as an actor/character except for her.\n\nShe isn't \"bad\" but she wasn't good enough in most scenes.\n\nAs a director I would have said \"CUT\" and re-took just about every scene asking for more emotion out of her.\n\nIt's still worth a watch. I believe from the plot, setting, decor, technology it's supposed to take place in the late 80s. She also feels way to modern as a character and doesn't have the look from that period in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "A young couple in Santa Monica find their lives turned upside down when the husband John (Ward Horton) buys her a rare vintage doll in order to complete his wife Mia's (Annabelle Wallis) doll collection. However, John unwittingly purchases a doll that has had a satanic curse put on it by a satanic cult and both the satanic cult and the doll reek havoc on the couple and their new born child.\n\nAfter watching this film I was surprised to discover that there was quite a big difference between the rating of this film and the Conjuring (at the time of writing this review Annabelle has a user rating of 5.4 and The Conjuring has a user rating of 7.5). Whilst, I'm prepared to accept that The Conjuring is perhaps slightly better overall I really don't feel that Annabelle is much weaker in comparison.\n\nThe directional style of this film is excellent and very much reminded me of Wan's style in The Conjuring (I didn't realise it wasn't Wan till I saw the end credits). Some may argue that Leonetti is aping Wan here, but I personally don't care as long as the film moves along a reasonable pace, and in the case of a horror film provides me with some good atmosphere and a generally creepy feel about it. Leonetti achieves this objective by providing long suspenseful sequences - although a lot of what you see here isn't original very little of it feels cheap or gimmicky (the only parts that did were the demons randomly appearing out of nowhere).\n\nThe main failings with this film lie with the characters and the story; the couple in particular are rather bland and lack any sort of chemistry (this aspect is less important in horror films, but it's still better that it's there than not being there). Whilst Wallis showed on occasions that she could be good, Horton was just dull and wooden. The story isn't quite as strong as it is in The Conjuring and sometimes the creepiness of the doll and the frantic set-pieces are needed to make up for its shortcomings.\n\nDespite seeing it all before, this film did enough to work for me and the tight running time of 85 minutes means that it never outstays its welcome and never really became boring. It's far from perfect, but I think that a lot of people are being unnecessarily harsh on this prequel."

The Conjuring was a success, amplifying terror tenfold. Annabelle is the prequel, following the doll's dark beginnings to ending up in the hands of the Warren family. Annabelle's been rushed in to, scoring no originality and a story anticipated from a mile off, proving that truly terrifying horror movies are a thing of the (recent) past. It's very similar to Deliver us From Evil, The Woman in Black, Sinister and Insidious, with glimpses of Paranormal Activity. Watch the latter two for greater scares."

The attack scene at the beginning was cool and there were some segments in the film that were genuinely creepy. Here are the negatives. This has to be some of the worst editing I have ever seen. It does rapid cuts which make no sense story wise and makes some scenes linger way too long. The rest of the cast's acting ranges from mediocre to terrible. The father actor is either not trying or trying too hard. The character Evelyn is established halfway through the movie but she has no character and you can't get behind her. When she sacrifices herself at the end of the film, you don't feel for her because she has no character. The tone is really inconsistent and the cinematography is bland and boring. The camera work is also terrible. The type of camera they use changes every couple of scenes and it looks terrible. Overall, the plot does not work. Annabelle provides a handful of creepy scenes with a good lead actress but fails in every other aspect of a good film and fails to do what The Conjuring did right."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Annabelle' is the disappointing and bland prequel/spin-off to 'The Conjuring' and while that was an intense scare-fest that breathed new life into the haunted house genre, this flick however falls flat on almost every level with its thin premise that lacks any sort of tension or suspense, forgettable performances and most importantly zero scares resulting in a dull and generic viewing experience.\n\nThe Plot = A young married couple John (Ward Horton) and Mia (Annabelle Wallis) starts experiencing terrifying supernatural events after purchasing a vintage doll after their home is invaded by satanic cultists.\n\nThe only positives I could give this movie is that it does feature a somewhat unsettling atmosphere, and the opening 15 minutes are quite effective as it does have some creepy moments, but the rest of the movie quickly falls apart with its sluggish pacing, predictable story beats and awful jump scares which you can see coming a mile away. The movie just gets very repetitive and monotonous very quickly and leads to a very poor climax which ends everything on an already sour note. There's just no style or substance to the production as everything just looks cheap and uninspired. The direction by John R. Leonatti is very standard and lacks any style or flair, it's just very basic like the entire film itself. A very disappointing 2nd entry in 'The Conjuring Franchise' after such a promising start, but thankfully things do recover after this.\n\nThe performances are a mixed bag with Ward Horton giving a very bland leading man performance, however, it doesn't help that this character is badly written. Annabelle Wallis gives an okay and naturalistic performance, but again suffers from bad writing for her lack of character arc. Alfre Woodward gives the only compelling performance in her role and does manage to inject some much-needed life into this awful flick, but she's not around enough to save this awful flick.\n\n'Overall 'Annabelle' is just another cheap cash grab horror flick designed to cash in on its brilliant predecessor. This is awful and disposable and nothing more."

I enjoyed the colors, attractive / handsome characters, and the general atmosphere of the movie; however, like most modern horror movies I didn't find it all that scary. In fact, half of the time I was yawning and couldn't care less about what happened to any of the characters. I've seen way too many horror movies to be scared by something like this. I was startled twice, but none of the scenes that were supposed to send chills down my spine worked for me. I liked this movie more than The Conjuring because of the bright colors used in Annabelle. The Conjuring, although very well-acted, is one of the most clich\u00e9d and boring movies I have ever stumbled upon. I know most people will disagree, but it had nothing new to offer other than the same old stuff we had seen in dozens of other Exorcism movies. Now I don't want to bash the Conjuring in this review, but I can't help it, because Annabelle has tried to follow the same pattern as the Conjuring, and as such it seemed like a rip off, although the Conjuring was really nothing but a rip off of dozens of similar Exorcism movies from the past. In my opinion, Annabelle is a good way of killing time, but if like me you've seen too many horror movies, don't expect to be frightened by it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Conjuring Universe is honestly one of the most financially and culturally successful \"shared universes\" out there, and even today - over ten years after the original film in the series - reliably brings audiences in.\n\nAnnabelle (2014) was the first of these movies and while I like that the shared universe exists, this movie in particular is one its weakest entries and feels like a cynical cash grab. I'm sorry.\n\nIf you went into this movie expecting a film to expand upon the lore of the 21st century's most iconic creepy doll, you'd be sorely disappointed. In a lot of ways, Annabelle feels like an extended episode of a horror anthology. Not much really happens, we learn nothing about the titular character, and the film often feels like spooky ideas are thrown at the well ad nauseum for the purposes of seeing what sticks. (Yes, I know we EVENTUALLY learn about Annabelle, but I'm reviewing this movie as if those don't exist)\n\nNarratively, there's really nothing going on here. There was a moment where I suspected - given all the cult talk in the movie and the inciting incident - that Annabelle Wallis's husband (I really don't remember her or his characters' names and it doesn't really matter) was part of said cult and that's how why he gave her the doll in the first place, but alas, this movie is so boring and paint-by-numbers that it doesn't even want to do that.\n\nI can't stress enough how listless this movie feels; there's nothing about it that makes it remotely special or interesting, it's full of cheap jump scares, and worst of all, seems cynically designed to create a good trailer more than anything else. BASICALLY, everything The Conjuring (2013) wasn't."

The last one that made me feel uncomfortable was The Conjuring. Being that this is the prequel to that one I was looking forward to this. I will admit that this one scared me more than that one. This one is very psychological and doesn't have to rely on over the top jump scares or gore to get to you. This is also not cartoonish like the Child's Play movies. This one has a real story and you get invested in the characters which makes the horror aspect work that much better. Horror fans will love this one but if you are easily scared I would avoid this.

Coming in, I saw the somewhat negative reviews and had low expectations as a result. In that respect at least, Annabelle did well in it's mission.\n\nFor starters, the movie is shot very well. Cinematographer James Kniest and director John Leonetti deserve props for some really quality shots especially in some of the opening sequences. There are some really good long shots in this movie as well, where the shot will be on something scary or intimidating and instead of cutting as any other film might do, it stays on said shot creating tension and good scares on occasion.\n\nSecondly, the movie does contain some moments that made me shudder or almost cover my eyes, which I give the movie a ton of credit for. The main villain of the film is designed well and really gave me the creeps especially during one sequence close to the climax. You'll know the one when you get to it.\n\nHowever, aside from those positives, the film does have many faults. The acting is mediocre or even just plain bad at times. During the climax, when the actors are supposed to really show their best stuff, I was very underwhelmed to say the least. The climax was lame too, with a weak resolution that doesn't make any sense and scares that couldn't live up to some of the quality scares of earlier in the film.\n\nThe movie falls into a lot of tired clich\u00e9s as well, which is unfortunately something that is to be expected now in horror films. Overall the film really didn't do anything new in terms of scares, plot or even characters, you've seen it all before.\n\nIn conclusion, despite it's many faults, I would recommend it. It certainly can scare you and sometimes the movie can really get you drawn into the action. I'd say check it out but don't expect it to blow your mind."

        "review_detailed_main": "A welcomed spin-off to 'The Conjuring', considering its sub-plot involving the titular wretched doll certainly terrified many, if only it was handed to a more experienced director. Leonetti, who helmed such masterpieces like 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' and 'The Butterfly Effect 2', falls trap to the many pitfalls that plague low-budget horrors. Gone are the stylish suspense driven camera techniques that Wan confidently possessed, now replaced by lacklustre direction with two featureless leads and a second-rate script. No wonder Annabelle looks worse for wear, bless her! A husband grants his wife a collectible doll, which is soon possessed by a demonic presence summoned by devil worshippers who raid their home and attempt to attack them.\n\nA few terrifying scares that prove to be somewhat effective, notably the storage floor sequence and the introductory home invasion scene, which illicit one or two satisfactory jump scares. A demon's face barging its way to the front of the camera did nearly force me to change my underwear. Yet despite the promising horror aspects, no matter how infrequent they were, the story with its repetitious slow pacing and mundane dialogue was enough to make anyone fall asleep cuddling the titular doll tightly dreaming the words \"please just end it, end it now\". Wallis was insufferably boring with her constant whining and screaming, succumbing to the outdated \"distressed damsel\" trope, that I can only assume she was hired just for her forename. Horton was just as bad, portraying the most useless husband possible. But it's fine, because he just kept smiling.\n\nThe plot itself lacked any mystery or suspense, mostly due to the way it was structured. It revealed all the details within the first act! Only to then conclude with an impeccably dumb soul trade thing that really made no sense, but by then I didn't care. The quality rapidly degraded as the runtime continued on, almost resembling a cheap dollhouse for Annabelle to reside in. To date, it is the worst \"Conjuring Universe\" film."

John pulls out the porcelain Annabelle doll as a gift for the new baby on the way. After a home invasion by a deranged man and woman causes the death of their neighbours and attack John and Mia, they move out of their suburban home and in a luxury apartment in Pasadena. The movie makes sure we notice that the blood of the dead home invader goes into the doll when she kills herself.\n\nOnce at the new apartment, we see the regular day to day life of John and Mia with their newborn Leah. John goes to work to work each day while Mia stays at home and watches classic soap opera General Hospital. Very 60's housewife vibes which makes sense since that is the era this film is set in. Not before long, Mia starts seeing shadows at the new place, electronics start turning on and off without her touching them, and the woman who tried to kill her appears to her more than once. All seems to be connected to the Annabelle doll and the two deranged people who were a part of a satanic cult that invaded their home at the beginning of the film.\n\nAnnabelle is a wonderful horror film. It doesn't rely on gore and CGI effects and let's the small things matter most. We get demons standing in plain sight which viewers have to catch out of the corner of the shot. And once you see the images it has major impact. There are some really good chase scenes between the demon and Mia throughout the apartment complex which were very well done. We don't see much of the doll moving around like Chucky would, and I'm really grateful for that. Less is more, and the things we don't see are sometimes scarier than the obvious in films like this.\n\nI really enjoyed Annabelle Willis' performance as Mia. She gave me some serious Dianna Agron vibes ala Glee and character Quinn Fabray. Willis had great chemistry with on-screen husband John played by Ward Horton who did an equally good job in this movie. Alfre Woodard was a nice addition to the cast as well with her supportive role of Evelyn, the neighbour who takes a liking to Mia.\n\nAll in all, Annabelle is a pretty scary horror film that did very well at the box office for good reason. Highly recommended\n\n8/10"

The movie has a very predictable sequence, unimpressive storyline and not so frightening background score. The Conjuring had created large expectation for Annabelle with its own brilliantly researched surprise elements, good cast and relatable fear. However, Annabelle even fails to come across as an ordinary horror flick if not being a prequel to The Conjuring. Probably James Wan should have directed the prequel himself!"

I've watched it as of late 2023 and thank god for that. Truth be told, The principal reason I've watched it was to figure out the horror angles individuals go crazy about which honestly overlooked the main issue a lot in this film.\n\nAside from the film simply being about a possessed doll that goes berserk mode for no obvious explanation whatsoever there are issues inside this film.\n\nActing is simply mediocre, more often than not it's so plain and clear the entertainers just retained a specific line and convey their exchanges with next to zero exertion. Likewise, who sane would get a doll like this that looks unpleasant and be like \"Correct, this should be in my child's room\"\n\nRundown: If not for this couple's outright awful nurturing and all-out inept mentality absolutely no part of this would have occurred. There are a lot of scenes in this motion picture that you simply need to punch the screen and shout at them for doing the most exceedingly terrible in the given circumstance.\n\nWould it be a good idea for you to watch it?\n\nI'd say watch the first in the alleged establishment just for the sake of it and afterwards don't bother with the following installments."

It's classic, sometimes subtle horror, with really well placed jump scares (and I've watched a lot of horror movies). It's definitely not a splatter nor a thriller nor a teeny-screamy, so don't expect one. This is a movie of a young family that is haunted by evil. The characters a believable, good-hearted and intelligent, and a hard crack for the evil forces that haunt them. It's ending doesn't come as such a surprise - thus only 9 stars - but it will keep watchers on the edges of their seats anyway. I'd recommend it for mature viewers, that love classic horror."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every once in awhile a horror film uses a doll and it comes in all different ways. The classics like Poltergeist or the 2013 The Conjuring used it as as an element and not as a main plot device. The first type of doll movie that used a doll as a main character was Magic, a ventriloquist with a young Anthony Hopkins as the magician. It was in the 80's with the first Child's Play that changed the doll concept somewhat. Yes, he was another killer but the doll named Chucky was so revolutionary because he was a character and was actually given something to do. Due to the fact he was a children's doll, this made him even more creepy. Following after Chucky, there were similar dolls films like the Puppet Master series or Dolly Dearest which were clear inspirations for those to follow. Horror director James Wan is famous for following the trend of dolls in the 2000's with the torture film Saw, Dead Silence and of course The Conjuring. The doll concept is one that is hit or miss in films ultimately .\n\nBased off the The Conjuring doll Annabelle, Annabelle is a prequel to The Conjuring and showcases the doll before the events of The Conjuring. Set in 1967, the couple of Mia Form (Annabelle Wallis) and John Form (Ward Horton) are expecting their first child together. John gives Mia a doll she has been looking for as a pre-baby present and for the nursery that has been set up for her. You could definitely say that Mia is fan of dolls as the room is essentially a nursery filled with close to a dozen dolls. After a vicious attack at the house by people from a cult, the doll eventually becomes possessed from the cult member Annabel Higgins. The possessed doll is then ready to kill.\n\nBeing that The Conjuring was set in the 70's, it makes total sense as to why this film was set in the 60's. From the style including cars, houses, hospital and even showing an interesting clip of Maryland Manson, a infamous killer during this time, all of these are all examples of the 60's timeline being used. At the same time, the 60's aspect makes this film seem so silly. When is the last time you ever heard of woman during pregnancy on bed rest by a doctor? It is also so cheesy watching a couple trying to get reception on an old television. The baby is in an old baby carriage makes which me really question if this is stealing from the classic Rosemary's Baby.\n\nAnnabelle ultimately along the way is a horror film where we should care about the characters. The couple surely is likable and going through the exact opposite of what they should be going through when trying to have a baby. The couple are too simple in substance though and really I didn't feel much sympathy for them unfortunately. The local book store owner Evelyn (Alfre Woodard) plays an original character which by the last act turns into a very predictable character and meets a very cheesy ending.\n\nIf we boil it down to just one thing, the biggest problem with the film just might be the doll itself. The doll does have an interesting look and feel with its design and color. That said, we are never given an explanation of what makes this doll so special and why the mother thinks it is so. For the most part, this doll is sitting around in the background of scenes and really if we didn't know, this doll could be looked at as just a random doll in background shots. Not in any shape or form does this doll provide any types of scares. Not even small jump scenes.\n\nIn the end, Annabelle is a big disappointment. The Conjuring was a film that was just asking for us to have this prequel because that movie made the doll so intriguing. We weren't asking for this type of prequel though as this movie is very boring, choppy, and lacks ideas. Annabelle is a film that will go down as one of the biggest misses in horror in quite some time.\n\nIn the end, Annabelle is a big disappointment.

It's like watching someone walk through a haunted house, except they are brainless and you can't help them. Basically, pain.\n\nHonestly, just save your time and watch one of the other, better films in the Conjuring universe."

After this attack by the members of a satanic cult who violently attack the couple, the blood and terror which spilled all over the house are not the only thing they leave behind. The couple starts to observe some terrifying supernatural occurrences that involve a vintage doll.\n\nI expected more from this movie and had high expectations because I had previously watched the movie \"The Conjuring\" and since there was a connection between these movies I had some expectations from it. I did not notice the budget of this film before I watched it which is only $6.5 million something that's obvious in the whole duration of the movie. There are not so many scary scenes and the few they are in this film they are old school, they do scare you but I expected more because I compared it with \"The Conjuring\". I liked the plot which was simple and gave us some information regarding the connection of this movie with \"The Conjuring\". I liked the interpretation of Annabelle Wallis who played as Mia and she was very good in this role.\n\nTo sum up I have to say that \"Annabelle\" is an interesting movie for anyone to watch. It's a good average - medium horror movie which introduces us to this satanic vintage doll and makes us expect even more in the future. I recommend it to everyone to watch it because you will have an interesting but not so much terrifying time watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is by far the weakest movie I've seen from The Conjuring franchise, which I almost expected seeing as most of marketing seemed to be riding on the creepiness of the Annabelle doll they have created.\n\nThe plot of this movie left a lot to be desired, but the whole story seemed like exactly what it was, a spin-off. I felt no real connection to any of the characters, and to be honest, I couldn't have cared less if they lived or died. The rest of the franchise has put a lot of emphasis on character development, but I didn't feel any of that in this movie.\n\nI don't have much to say about the acting, which I suppose is a good thing. Great scream-queen material from Annabelle Wallis, which could have saved this movie if they had given me even the slightest reason to care about her character.\n\nAs with the rest of the series, the look and sound of this movie is top quality, and you can tell there is a lot of expertise that goes into the cinematography and sound design of this movie. I thought the scares were one of this films best qualities, with a few moments that really made my jaw drop, but unfortunately there were too many lulls between these moments to keep my full attention throughout.\n\nWith all that being said this is a perfectly competent horror movie that is more than worthwhile if you are a horror fan, and absolutely not one to miss if you are a fan of the Wan/Flanagan brand of horror."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie could have been much better if we had some decent actors. They can act, they just can't act well. The only cast members who could act were the shop owner, Evelyn, played by Alfre Woodard, and the neighbours played by Kerry O'Malley and Brian Howe. The neighbour's dialogue was a bit off, but they can still act. The parents were dreadful in my opinion. They were \"acting\", and it ruined everything.\n\nThe script was okay. It could have been better. I think there was realism there, just not enough, especially the dialogue between the parents. Perhaps it was just their acting that made their interactions so contrived. Maybe if the acting was better the script wouldn't seem so mediocre.\n\nI did like a few of the scares. Scares do not have to be original to be scary, just as long as they are well formulated and executed. There were startles that worked really well. It's hard to be truly original these days. There are more movies being produced than ever before.\n\nWhat else can I say? I can't remember the score, so I suppose it was neutral, and the cinematography was good. I didn't find anything creepy about Annabelle. I do not find dolls scary. Nor do I think Chucky is scary. Actually, I never saw Chucky because it looked ridiculous. This movie only appealed to me because it was advertised in relation to The Conjuring. They got me.\n\nOverall, a disappointing film with a dumb doll at the antagonist."

Classical story of a thriller. In addition, the trailer revealed many things about the movie, so I knew what was going to happen in some crucial parts of the movie just by having watched the trailer.

Now, what is scary is obviously different from person to person. But one thing I think everyone should be able to agree on with this film, is that being scary is at least the goal of the writers and producers. A lot of films under the category of horror, don't necessarily have fear as their primary goals. For example, movies like Cabin in the Woods, which are comedies with a horror theme.\n\nIn contrast with the rest of The Conjuring series, this film starts a bit slower, and gets stronger towards the end. Also, the intensity of the story line isn't on the same level. In my opinion, this gives Annabelle a slight advantage over The Conjuring, since I become desensitized to threats on screen if they become too intense."

Whilst I didn't think it was as bad as some have suggested, 'Annabelle' certainly doesn't come close to reaching the same heights as 'The Conjuring' did, which was a seriously scary film.\n\nThe scares in 'Annabelle' are few and far between and quite predictable, but there are a few scenes that do make you jump. Unfortunately, one of 'Annabelle' main flaws is its failure to build up any sort of tension, which is partly down to its thin plot. Most of the film felt quite tame, even the ending which was something of an anti-climax. Maybe this film has been judged too harshly by comparing it to 'The Conjuring'. It's not a bad horror film, but I expected more."

Essentially Rosemary's Baby meets Child's Play for the Paranormal Activity generation, this sees a young Californian couple firstly caught up in a \"Helter Skelter\" spree by their next door neighbour's cultified estranged daughter and then \"menaced\" by a demonic doll she may have invoked before her passing. Cue slamming doors, possessed sewing machines and feral hobs as first-time mum Mia (Annabelle Wallis) comes under constant attack in both their Santa Monica starter home and Pasadena apartment. The actors are good but the lack of story line makes it boring.Altogether the movie has ONLY 2 terrifying scenes.And yes-THE DOLL-which only flies once in air.\n\nWell..You can skip this movie and watch others like The Conjuring,MAMA,The Cabin in the woods,etc.\n\nSo from me a 2 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all I am not against The Conjuring and The Insidious, I liked both movies when I watched them first time, but that is the problem that those movies didn't attract me to watch for second time though The Conjuring is a lot better than The Insidious but still not as creepy and scary than Annabelle.\n\nLike any normal IMDb User, I had very low expectations from Annabelle because of such low rating as my ratings always matched with overall ratings but this was one of exceptional case when I surprisingly liked the movie against low ratings.\n\nI couldn't find any problem in this movie. Genre wise it was hell scary and did everything to me which a best horror movie does to its viewer. Gave me Nightmare as I finished it at 2:00 am, increased my heart rate to almost 100 BPM and even next day I was in Annabelle Zone.\n\nSome scenes were really terrifying including Sewing machine scene, climax scene, Church Father's Car scene and my favorite Elevator scene.\n\nAnother positive note of this movie is that it is a believable and loving story of a family. The Cast did perfect job to their characters especially the leading actress coincidentally-named Annabelle Wallis as \"Mia\", she did an excellent job and got a loyal fan in me. Also would like to mention Ward Horton, who played a role of Mia's husband \"John\", did a superb job.\n\nDirection wise movie was fabulous despite the fact that Director of this movie was new, he did an incredible job and I want him to direct Annabelle 2 as well.\n\nAt the end I would like to say that I had no intentions to write review for it and I found my thoughts in some reviews too but it's just to add a number to supporters of this movie and I will recommend it to everyone who are a fan of arguably believable horror movies."

We missed personality even though the story has a history to it. The characters were behaving predictable and there is not much space left over for your imagination. \"A few shocking moments doesn't make a good film.\" Overall a good story if new to the genre but an almost amateuristic production. The casting is one of the few things we liked about it. The actors are giving their characters a personality but sadly those personalities are a bit like any other \"paranormal\" horror-story."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was... Not terrible, not good, not remarkable. Annabelle isn't really much of anything, in my opinion. During and after viewing, I was left with the feeling of clich\u00e9, cheap scares and no real entertainment. The film's plot is that of an unexceptional horror flick. It's scares, far too few (Almost all of them are showcased in the trailers), feel predictable. Like many others in the same genre lately, I got the impression of the whole picture building suspense on which it does not deliver. Some more positive reviews talk of Annabelle \"reveling in it's cheesiness\", but I would disagree. It rather uses it as it's very foundation, which just won't do for a horror. So, to summarize: This is a mediocre experience, over-hyped, and not worth paying any money for."

        "review_detailed_main": "Annabelle was a nice plot device to establish the kind of work the paranormal investigators, the Warrens, did in the before the main plot of The Conjuring started and it probably should have stayed that way. Annabelle is one of those films that are so okay that it's a problem. The film is a prequel/spin-off to 2013's The Conjuring and serves to tell the back story of the possessed doll (Annabelle) that is showing in the beginning of that film. In this film we see that it began as a doll eventually possessed by the spirit of a criminal and that instantly brings Child's Play comparisons to mind but at least Annabelle doesn't use unexplained magical words to make it happen. Throughout the film we see the spirit possessing the doll doesn't do anything physically but manipulates objects in the environment and causes mental delusions. The film decides that it needs more clich\u00e9s and adds in the fact that everything that has happened is part of some mysterious demon worshiping cult, shadowy monsters to attack in the dark basement, A priest being shown that \"The Light of God\" is easily overpowered by any demon and a character to make a seemingly random \"heroic sacrifice\" that in the end serves to accomplish little to nothing. The film isn't anything special and is made up of elements we've seen a thousand times. Overall, I don't feel like there is any real incentive to go see this movie it doesn't add anything to the genre as a whole and doesn't really feel like we are learning anything worth our attention about Annabelle past the first ten minutes. The film is a little less than okay because it just uses tired film ideas and feels like it is playing it too safe because of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "A word of advice for horror movie producers: If you're going to riff on '70s horror classics like \"The Omen\" and \"Rosemary's Baby,\" make sure to look more deeply at why those films connected with viewers rather than just stealing their imagery. Merely mimicking them aesthetically is a hollow exercise, and proof that you don't understand that horror is more than a series of jump cuts and frightening images. Horror, at its best, taps into something deeper. There's nothing deep about \"Annabelle,\" the spin-off of \"The Conjuring.\" It offers surface level scares without the undercurrent of humanity needed to make them register. Director John R. Leonetti and writer Gary Dauberman work proficiently enough on a technical level to craft a few scenes that get the heart racing, but the climax of \"Annabelle\" is so misguided, silly and even offensive that any excuse genre fans may be inclined to make for the mediocre hour-and-a half that precedes it will likely turn to rage. If you saw the 2013 hit, you remember the creepy doll that wouldn't go away. Ghostbusters Lorraine and Ed Warren kept Annabelle in a locked case, recognizing the true evil held within. How did Annabelle go from a relatively harmless but totally creepy doll to a tool of the devil? \"Annabelle\" tries to tell that story, using the Manson Murders and \"Rosemary's Baby\" as a backdrop. Some may be tempted to write off \"Annabelle\" on concept alone, in that it's something of a cash grab, like a straight-to-video sequel designed to strike while a hit predecessor's iron is still hot. It's a movie that screams \"Boo!\" instead of trying to get under your skin. There is one great set piece involving a storage unit in the basement and an elevator that just won't leave it, but that's something you can watch on cable later, while ignoring the weak film that surrounds it."

The satanists were summoning a demon with the ritual murders, but since things got disrupted the demon only has the wherewithal to get hisself into a doll rather than into a person as planned. Once something like that is thwarted the demon never stops trying to get a soul. To that end the Annabelle-housed demon follows the fledgling family to Sacramento. This movie is a deft horror. The pacing prolongs the suspense and the scares are good n scary. As a whole it is ok, just ok. The story itself isn't scary, it just feels like a story. It doesn't leave much of an impression."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Conjuring was nice suspenseful horror by James Wan which worked well at different levels. Now we have Annabelle a prequel to it giving us the origin story of the possessed doll which was more of the side story in The Conjuring. So those who liked the first film will be excited about this one too. Unfortunately it falls short. I had very low expectations after seeing low ratings but it was pleasant surprise that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.\n\nThe movie is a slow burner, so if the impatient ones might easily get bored with this. We have a standard couple Mia and John. Mia played by Annabelle Wallis (felt like intentionally cast for coincidence!!) and Ward Horton as John. Not so much great acting skills can be expected here, anyways they do a decent job for a horror film. Mia is pregnant and one day John gifts her a doll to add to her collection. No guesses which doll and we are all like \"no! what are you doing?! don't keep that!!\", lol. Well actually the doll isn't possessed yet, it was just another cute doll until one day a terrible incident occurs followed by more horrific encounters. Well that's where I will stop, it has short run time of about 100 minutes and there not much of story. It is actually great that they didn't drag it much.\n\nDirected by John Leonetti who was cinematographer with James Wan for The Conjuring, there are many nice shots and couple of jump scares for those enjoy it. I also kind of liked they kept the pacing slow, which built up tension and suspense steadily and gradually. Well most of it is what we already scene in many horror flicks. But original horror films are so rare these years. Even with recycled material, the film worked for me as it looked technically sound for such a low budget film. It was good old school horror with not much CGI gore and stuff. The scene where Mia gets stuck in elevator in the basement was really scary and my favorite from the film. There are many more scares which I did not see coming and were quite unpredictable. The background score almost similar to The Conjuring again generates the scary tone required thus works effectively.\n\nOverall, I had a good time even if it was just an average movie at best. The weak point was the script, which I wish was better written. Also director doesn't try anything new and innovative for which there definitely potential. Still, Annabelle works just fine for horror genre as it does have enough amount tension getting built up plus scary moments making it worth a shot.\n\nRATING: [2.5/5]"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"There are things happening that I can't explain.\"\n\nThe Conjuring was one of my favorite horror films of the past decade and it even managed to make it into my list of the best films of 2013, which is a huge achievement considering I'm not a fan of the genre. Despite how much I enjoyed The Conjuring, I still had very little expectations for its prequel, Annabelle, because from the get go it seemed like the producers were simply trying to bank on the success of the first film. That is perhaps the reason why they rushed this film to theaters only an year after The Conjuring. The budget is surprisingly smaller and James Wan's direction is missed here. I want to begin my criticism with the technical aspects of the film because The Conjuring was one of the better looking horror films I had seen, but from the opening scene in Annabelle the contrast is huge. The lighting and the eerie setting that was so effectively used in the original is lacking in this prequel. It's strange considering that director John Leonetti was the cinematographer in The Conjuring, but here he fails to give the film a similar look. Instead of those amazing shots Wan delivered, we get several close ups of the doll's face which never actually does anything. This film looks as ugly as the vintage Annabelle doll does and it lacked the eerie atmosphere that worked so well in The Conjuring.\n\nIf at least the story or characters would have been half as interesting as The Conjuring I would give Annabelle a chance, but nothing about it really worked for me. The story is predictable, the characters are uninteresting and boring, and there are very few scary moments. Leone should stick to his work as a cinematographer which is an area where he has proved to be talented, but as a director this is his third flop. If it weren't for The Conjuring's success this film would have been sent directly to DVD because even the performances were wooden. Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton fail to deliver compelling and interesting characters we would care for. That lack of sympathy for them hurts the film's chances to scare us. The Conjuring had set up such an interesting premise that there were a lot of interesting things that could've been done with this prequel. Unfortunately here we discover that the doll that was the scariest thing in the paranormal investigator's closet (enclosed in a glass shelf) actually isn't all that eerie as it seemed thanks to Gary Dauberman's uninspiring script.\n\nDespite how much Annabelle disappointed me, I still have to admit there were two or three shocking moments that sort of worked for me. The film does become predictable and familiar at times relying on the sounds of rocking chairs and appliances going off on their own at night. After so many close-ups of the dolls face, it lost its eeriness. The three moments I will rescue from this film involve the opening scene where we see the neighbors get attacked by a cult from the window, then the scene we see from the trailer where the small girl runs towards the door turning into the adult Annabelle, and finally the elevator scene which was perhaps the scariest moment of the film. Other than those three moments I wasn't really shocked by Annabelle. The characters and the story were so boring that at times I felt like snoozing for a few minutes. It was a huge disappointment."

The movie, which is part of *The Conjuring Universe*, promised to be a spine-chilling exploration of supernatural horror, but it failed to deliver the fear and suspense it advertised.\n\nThe premise of a haunted doll should have been inherently terrifying, but the execution left much to be desired. The scares were predictable, relying too heavily on jump-scare tactics rather than creating a genuinely eerie atmosphere. Instead of building tension, the film seemed to rush through key moments, leaving little time for the fear to settle in.\n\nAdditionally, the storyline felt underdeveloped, with characters who lacked depth and a plot that didn't fully utilize the potential of its central concept. While the cinematography and production design were commendable, especially in setting the dark tone, they couldn't compensate for the lack of genuine horror.\n\nOverall, *Annabelle* could have been a much better film with more thought put into its narrative and scare tactics. As a horror fan, I found it disappointing and lacking in the fear factor that defines the genre. It's a missed opportunity for what could have been a truly terrifying experience.\n\nRating// 3/10."

The husband reveals that he bought a doll for they're expected child, later that night next door their neighbors are brutally murdered and are attacked themselves by a cult. Not soon after strange things start to happen around them revealing that there might be something to this doll. This Movie could have been something of interest when the conjuring hit theaters it blew people away with its atmosphere and direction with the supernatural, alot of people were curious what was up with this creepy doll that was introduced in the beginning. Unfortunately all this film is is a mediocre and boring film overall being focused on this couple for the entire movie is the biggest problem with the movie. They are unbelievably generic, boring, blind, stupid and na\u00efve to the point that you don't even care about them or their babies well being. The fact that they hear screaming coming from next door and don't immediately call the cops just show how dumb they are. Outside of the Cult attack the whole first hour it's just padded with slow walking scenes, staring and dialogue between the couple that is Really uninteresting movie doesn't really get any sort of suspense and tension buildup throughout the entire movie. Just having this doll sit there staring the entire time it's not interesting or exciting. You don't feel any weight or presence of it. The only exception is this one scene with a demon in the basement at this point it start to feel like it going somewhere but even after that encounter what's we're still sitting through us more scenes otherwise just walking around slowly when is this point it is pretty obvious what is going on. How to match in the completely hollow supporting characters the priest doesn't amount to much is set for a half bake explanation about the doll and this book shop owner befriending the wife that feel just thrown in there."

When something scary does happen it's usually cheesy like a girl in a dark silhouette appearing in a doorway, something everyone has seen before thousands of times.\n\nAside from a few jump scares that come up every once in awhile, there were many scenes that build up suspense, only to lead up to nothing happening. Suspenseful music would start soaring for several seconds, the music would suddenly stop, and then the scene would end. It was very disappointing to me because I was expecting something serious to occur in these scenes, only to get nothing. Only the scene I found truly scary was when the mother reaches in the baby's cradle and gets grabbed by a creepy hand. Other than that, the film was not very scary."

The film does EXACTLY that, I mean what else did you want??? It features excellent scares, decent story, excellent cast, excellent demons, and of course it has that Creepy ass doll ANNABELLE!! Ignore the negative nellies that dont understand horror films. All 3 Annabelle films are excellent. The conjuring world is by FAR the best horror series Ever."

The film is flawed with a poor story line. Why would the husband leave for a few days when his wife is close to delivering the baby and then the house catches fire and they still return to the house.The priest is really not with it and the lady from the book store decides she needs to get out. Sorry it really is a poor movie. Those of you who say its good really need to be tested or resign from the company who pay you for giving good reviews. No kidding this really is a pants movie seriously don't bother. Don't say I didn't warn you x"

This film is very boring, dull and uninteresting. The beginning is ehh. Once things go crazy in the beginning it was pretty thrilling but after that it's just a huge mixed bag with overall bad qualities, literally so many of the horror this film tries so hard to rely on is closeup shots of Annabelle with the music then it cuts. It's annoying and overtime it gets tiring and very repetitive. This film has one of the most dumbest third acts I've seen in a horror movie. Third acts can make or break the film. This film was already broken from the start but it fell even harder. Dialogue was bad so many things were bad. There's a scene in the basement that I found pretty thrilling but other than that this movie is dog crap\n\nActing 7/10 Script 3/10 Dialogue 2/10 Screenplay 3/10 Cinematography 7/10 Music 7/10 Effects 6/10 Plot 2/10\n\nOverall, this was a huge let down, I don't expect anything special coming out of this conjuring universe after this, I knew it was too good to be true. This film is lacking in everything in the horror movie department, and the things it does bring to the table don't even mean anything. Very huge let down. Terrible"

This movie seemed to give me the same amount of fear factor or even more with less resources, and the reason i liked it more is it didn't bank on a women possessed tweaking out and becoming ugly at the end for its payoff like many horror films do. Instead this movie gave me what other horror movies don't....the actual demon! Finally a movie went balls out and showed us what was lurking and stalking the characters. The design and costume of the demon was good too, sometimes you see its arm and other parts, but you also get to look it straight in the eyes face to face, and no its not just a creepy nun or some weird human its actually a demonic entity. Well done, esp since i thought the movie would just be a different version of chuck ha ha i was pleasantly surprised, bad thing is the story esp the ending is mediocre at best, but its worth the watch for sure."

The last time we hung out was when the movie had released (July, 2013) so, we don't really hangout much. But he called after all these months just because Annabelle was about to release and we were just that excited. That was our first mistake.\n\nThe horror in Annabelle is just good as compared to The Conjuring which was quite scary. There will be a lot of jerk and scare time and again, people in the back will be mumbling after a good scare during scenes - just normal - no problem with that. The problem although is in the story. Its confusing, at times does not make sense and you would think your nephew could write a better story.\n\nActing: The Conjuring > Annabelle; Direction: The Conjuring > Annabelle; Story: The Conjuring > Annabelle; Horror: The Conjuring = Annabelle\n\nWhy the comparison? Just so you don't carry high hopes to the theater. It hurts. Enjoy the scare."

        "review_detailed_main": "A dichotomous spurring sub-plot from its conjured sister, the devilish dolly from the \"The Conjuring\" manifests its feature length solidity with similarly fathomable truth. Bolstered by its historically accurate credo, the real-life accounts of psychic investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, the accursed bisque (in actuality a Raggedy Ann) becomes demonic conduit for - yet again - an occultly idolised grim hellbent on - you guessed it - sapping the souls of the innocent. If I've made the film sound rudimental and routine, thats because it is.\n\nThough anachronistically sturdy in recreating a 1970's vibe: TV sets like chunky microwaves, the ideologically pruned nuclear family, archetypal catholicism, society's infatuation with the occult and druidism, women represented as maternal machines with a knack for sewing - and mention of Manson's racially apocalyptic helter-skelter - what Annabelle lacks is some proliferant panache in its antique format. The short-lived killer toy sub-genre has elapsed, be it or not that the doll has long been considered an evil- harbouring entity in folklore. Blame the cabbage patch kids in the 80's, a craze in adopting toys as kin and provoking emotional attachments to prepare adolescents into parenthood from the earliest of ages. Chucky winces in his good guy dolls box, for annabelle trips up drastically short - perhaps the tagline 'based on a true story' really hindered the film's intensity, perhaps its just not fashionable to lever fear from toys - unless its an enchanted Xbox or psychopathic PS4.\n\nI've got no strings\u0085\n\nSo the doll - it looks creepy, but all the way through the film, the viewer sees nothing. No creepy head-turning, eye-rolling - just implied movements and a semi-serious, prudish levitation scene. Static camera shots, extreme close-ups, creep-zooms and abstractions but no gimmicks. The final act of Toy Story, with Woody on the barbecue grill warning Sid to be nicer to his toys, imbues a greater dread.\n\nI've got strings\u0085\n\nA concerto of violinists stab their instruments. Juxtapose the recorded sounds onto any suspenseful moment. Amplify the sound to a million hertz. Voila, a simulated scare tactic so effective it requires no visual connection. Humdrum being the optimum syntagm, aside from one particular scene (involving an elevator), the film struggles to breakaway from generic traits in an almost desperate attempt to scare. Taking the bisqe-uit, it's a surrogate spin-off too placid for outright franchising, 'Annabelle' loots upon accolades of its mongrel parent.\n\nThe real shame is that its just not scary. The narrative just too conventional, the suspense just too hammy. Highlighting its few violin-sawing jump scares, \"Annabelle\" is a commodified marketing campaign to whet the appetite for the second \"Conjuring\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Halloween night and, after returning from a very unfrightening costume party dressed as an even less frightening Santa Claus, I decided I wanted to be scared. So I hopped on the internet and found the popular 2013 horror flick \"The Conjuring.\" Two hours later the movie finished and I was well into November first, flinching at every little sound I heard, and trying to fall asleep as my feet tingled in fear of being pulled from my bed. For anyone who has seen \"The Conjuring,\" you know the exact feeling. Now I'm not a particular fan of horror films, they are extremely overdone and rarely well, but this one got to me. From my limited experience, \"The Conjuring\" is certainly the best horror movie I've seen. Then they went and made a prequel.\n\n\"Annabelle\" is the prequel to the ever so successful and ever so creepy \"The Conjuring.\" The premise of \"Annabelle\" is that one shot in \"The Conjuring\" where the same Annabelle doll turns her head and you wet your pants. The plot, however, is found in an average everyday couple and their newborn child. As a gift to celebrate the new baby's birth, the husband (I'm saying husband and wife because as soon as the movie finished I forgot their names) surprises the wife with a doll. After a traumatic incident where the neighbors are murdered by members of a satanic cult and the husband and wife are attacked, one of the attackers commits suicide with the doll in her hands. Some evil spirit then enters the doll, and the average happy family soon begin to experience the horrors of a demonic presence.\n\nThe happy couple, Mia and John Gordon (I just looked up their names on IMDb,) were played by Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton, respectively. I was not impressed by either performance, as they were both very single noted. Ward Horton in particular had zero depth to his character making him entirely forgettable at the times even when he was not on screen. In \"The Conjuring,\" one of the strongest things about the film was the performances. Patrick Wilson was fairly dull as well, but Vera Farminga and Lili Taylor gave the film a depth that really brought it to another level. This was nowhere to be found in \"Annabelle.\" Alfre Woodard provided some interesting development and did save a couple scenes, but she was simply not allowed enough screen time to have any sort of effect on the final result of the film.\n\nJohn Leonetti took the director's chair for \"Annabelle,\" after being the head cinematographer for James Wan during filming of \"The Conjuring.\" This is not the first time Leonetti has directed a sequel or prequel to a film he was head of photography. There is one consistency throughout his work though: the originals were fairly well received but when Leonetti was placed as director, the sequels were widely disliked. This is Leonetti's third film to direct, the first two were \"Mortal Combat: Annihilation\" and \"The Butterfly Effect 2.\" It is a wonder to me that the prequel to \"The Conjuring\" was placed in such unreliable hands. However, it was, and \"Annabelle\" was the result.\n\nAs the previews finished and \"Annabelle\" began, I adjusted in my seat, bracing myself to be scared. Leonetti used a clever tool in beginning this film by using the same shots that began \"The Conjuring.\" Unfortunately, after using up all these shots and displaying the title with a climactic musical swell, it went black. I was sure something was about to jump out and scare me. Instead, I looked up and I was in church. And a nice church too; very well lit. Church finishes and after a very lovely conversation with some friends, our average couple returned to their suburban California home with palm trees in the yard and the sun shining as bright as ever. At this point I almost began to wonder if I had sat down in the wrong theater. This continued for the rest of the film. There were different scenes where circumstances would climax and it would be fairly frightening, but seconds later it was morning again and the birds were chirping.\n\nThe thing that made \"The Conjuring\" work so well was the constant feeling that something awry was about to happen. It was the polar opposite here, where I found myself feeling like I was watching a pleasant drama rather than a horror film. It could be that was Leonetti's intent, to make you feel comfortable before he scares you, but it simply didn't work. In the end, the only credit for scares that got me go to the film's musical composer Joseph Bishara. Save some weak dialogue and performances, \"Annabelle\" was a decent film overall. It just wasn't scary. So as I walked out of theater, the doll never bothered me anyway.\n\nI give \"Annabelle\" a 5.0/10."

While this is John Leonetti's most competent film, it pails in comparison to its much better prequel \"The Conjuring\"; the scares and story (save for elements of the ending & a somewhat creepy basement scene) left me wanting. The acting is serviceable, but most of us never really go into horror movies for anything other than the scares. While this is the director's best film, it is in no way a great film; I do however have hopes for Leonetti's future films, coming from a career as a cinematographer his films will be visually pleasing. Unfortunately as of now that's where most of the pros tend to end. But it seems that he may be on the right track, although it may be a long journey"

The film revolves around the ever so common and safe plot of a demon haunting for the need of a soul and how the doll gets possessed or to be exact how it is being used as a conduit by demonic spirits. The lead actors Mia played by Annabelle Wallis (strange xD) and Ward Horton do a pretty great job at being the family in the centre of action. The film starts with the opening scene of The conjuring and moves further taking us into the past showing the origin of Annabelle doll. The film has quite the bone chilling scenes and sound effects which make it scary but not as scary as The Conjuring if you want to compare the two. The climax was a bit let down as i was expecting something different. Nonetheless it is still a good horror flick to watch and fans of this genre will be drawn to it. The most horrific part is the doll, and you cannot help but think about it every time you sleep at night. The makers have taken a lot of efforts to make the doll scary considering the fact that the original doll is so simple that no one would be scared."

It's a good movie, with a very simple production. Story's OK, it's not a Chucky like story. I should say that the movie is so simple that I could have made it myself. One of the costumes was terrible. That's the only reason why I'm giving 8, because they had funds to do it better. But the Story's OK and there's something else: Annabelle actually exists. Search the Warrens' Museum before you watch the movie. It's a very nice add to the conjuring story (but not a sequence, neither a prequel, so don't expect any links)."

She is so cold, so fake, I believe she never lived the events while acting, I am so disappointed that somebody decided to grant this role to her.\n\nThe Audio in this movie is also terrible, the Audio Engineer made every conversation a whisper, and every horror scene a set of screaming sound effects ... the thing that made me switch the TV volume up and down all along the movie, please think about a better way to make people jump out of their chairs next time.\n\nOverall I would have given this movie 10 out of 10, it is a master piece and we don't usually see many horror movies with such interesting story nowadays, but I will take 1 point for the terrible actress and 1 point for the horrible Audio Engineer."

Another reason why I didn't care for this film was because although it is a prequel to \"The Conjuring\" it wasn't on the same scale as the \"Conjuring\". What I mean is \"The Conjuring\" was more well put together and more serious. Not saying this film wasn't it's just that it wasn't as well done as the \"The Conjuring\". If you're a real die hard horror movie fan like me this film isn't going to do much for you.

        "review_detailed_main": "If you're even the least bit familiar with my reviews and genre preferences, you know about my love for horror. I watch too many gore-infused horror flicks dripping with cheesiness for my own good, and even the worst of those have outdone the disaster that is Annabelle. Presented before us is a film that exists as a side-story to the highly acclaimed horror favorite of 2013, The Conjuring. (If you have yet to see it, DO IT ALREADY. YOU'VE HAD A YEAR.)\n\nSo goes the tale of Annabelle, a doll presented in the introduction of The Conjuring, determined to terrify and revolt with its roots in Satanism and demonic entities. We begin Annabelle identically to The Conjuring. That's right, folks. The first few minutes are just carbon copies from The Conjuring. Eventually, we are presented with the necessary \"One Year Earlier\" frame, outlining the much-anticipated roots of Annabelle the doll. This is when we meet Mia and John Gordon, a happily married couple with a baby on the way.\n\nWithout giving too much of the plot away, here's an introduction to Annabelle: Mia and John experience a home invasion by two members of a Satanic cult. A female cult member stabs Mia in the stomach just as the cops arrive and is shot, bleeding onto the Annabelle doll as she dies. Mia, John, and the baby survive the attack, and their baby, Lea, is eventually born. However, there is a deep uneasiness lurking underneath the surface, and the couple moves homes after Mia begins to experience paranormal events she believes are linked to the attack.\n\nFrom here, you expect Annabelle to kick it into full gear as it delves deeper into the Satanic and supernatural abilities the doll now possesses. For the most part, it presents them, but in the most mundane possible way. Annabelle is a film that builds in intensity but eventually fails to lead anywhere. We expect big thrills to come, and we are left empty-handed almost every single time. The scares are cheap and the film's opportunity to explore the mythological aspects of Annabelle and the cult responsible for its demonic possession are left untold. Instead, we get 98 minutes of suspense, leading to nowhere but a terribly executed finale. It feels like a drama film desperately attempting to be considered horror.\n\nThe scares in Annabelle, I will admit, are spine-tingling at times. There are several minutes in the film that are fulfilling for horror fans like myself, but the fact that it is only several minutes of the film proves that Annabelle is an awfully executed piece of cinema. The pacing of the film is highly uneven, the acting is subpar at times, and the script leaves much to be desired. For an October release, we deserve better than a poorly written, badly directed horror film like Annabelle.\n\nI will admit, there is a possibility I am being more critical of this film due to my love of The Conjuring. And yet, in the scope of Annabelle existing outside of The Conjuring universe, Annabelle still feels like a lousy film. Few will enjoy it as a new favorite cult classic, but only if absolutely none of it is taken seriously. Believe me, with this film, it's not very difficult to accomplish.\n\n(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)"

        "review_detailed_main": "What a let down. 'Annabelle' is a prequel to 2013's 'The Conjuring', the most original and well made horror film in years so I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately being a prequel was about the only connection this film would have, with an entirely new writing and directing team coming on board. The masterful director of 'The Conjuring' James Wan's (also of the 'Saw' series) presence was sorely lacking in this mediocre horror film that gets little reaction out of its audience.\n\nThe main problem for me was a complete lack of menace from the doll. The movie is named after her, so surely she has to do something other than just sit there and look menacing for 90 minutes? Apparently not. The opening murder scene was actually quite well done and one of the few good moments the movie has. But after that things slow down and never really speed up again. Put it this way - if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the film. That's never a good thing."

She's blonde and she likes collecting creepy dolls. Ohh and she's pregnant, yeah.\n\nThere's also a doll of suspicious malicious appearance named Annabelle that's just kind of sitting there. I could have told you that doll was trouble from the first moment.\n\nBut they don't do much with it. They just kind of show it and then show something sinister happening. I don't think it ever even flies or turns its head. Certainly not as active as Chucky.\n\nThen the rest of the movie is just presenting a smorgasboard platter of horror techniques to see what sticks. It's not really about the doll in any cohesive way. There are serial killers, there are jump scares, the Catholic church gets involved, there's an evil book, there are creepy kids and strange occurences. Pretty much everything except furniture flying makes an appearance here.\n\nThe movie has its creepy moments, but 99% is just boring filler with this personality-less blondie going around and trying to flaunt her femininity and give off the impression of soft-spoken innocence.\n\nAs for the supernatural stuff, they don't even try to explain it. I guess you'd get more mileage out of it if you know some horror movie lore. Example: at one point there's a scene of a woman buying the doll for her nurse daughter. If you read the story of Annabelle you'll realize this is a prequel to the story (the person who started the whole story was a nurse). No way of knowing that or understanding the significance of this scene unless you did some research. Pretty dumb.\n\nIt's confusing, it's disjointed (yeah, they move to another house in the middle of the story), it's boring; no mainstream middle-class woman in her right mind would think it's cool to keep such an evil-looking doll around; and they kill off the only black character. Cold.\n\nDon't watch it. You can do better.\n\nHonourable Mentions: Vacaciones de Terror (1989). Mexican horror movie featuring an evil doll. Haven't seen it in a long time but I remember it being scary and I'm SURE it can't be as lame as this."

What really does tend to work here is the early scenes at the house where the growing build-up of the events here makes for quite a rather dark storyline here. The concept of targeting a pregnant mother in her home and enacting a blood-rite on her still-unborn baby that bonds her soul with a ravenous demon is unbelievably chilling and creepy, which makes it so much of a disappointment that it never really capitalizes on this idea by instead resorting to the second half with a series of ghostly flash images and quick-cut attacks that are so set-up and predictable that nearly every gag here, from the quick glimpse of the hands on the stairwell and the arm-grab in the darkened laundry room lowers this one slightly. However, the first half doesn't worry about this with the rather enjoyable set-up here as it goes through the early scenes of her pregnancy and the effect that has on the build-up by offering the chilling home invasion with the really enjoyable set-up here that makes for quite a fun scene ending in the brutal bloodbath that finally ends this. The eventual supernatural hauntings that occur aren't that bad following the incident while the scenes in the apartment after the move are even better here with the hallway ambush, the flash images of the ghost always walking around the apartment in the shadows and the big set-up here with the drawings done by the child eventually coming to fruition makes for a truly fun time here that makes for a great ploy to unleash the chilling action in the later half when the attempts to stop the progression of possession makes for some dark, chilling action within this, with the church attack and the eventual battle in the apartment to save their baby really ratchets up the tension and suspense here along with the fun action throughout the final half. That, though, again brings up the main fundamental flaw here with the film as not only does this make the film filled with routine and predictable scenes but the film does such a great job at showcasing something is wrong that their reasoning for not doing something earlier is seriously questioned. Staying in the house as long as they did after the initial attack is questionable considering what happened and all that follows, while the popcorn gag itself is so questionable that alone is quite unrealistic. Still, once in the apartment this one features so many fine attack scenes on both her and the baby that waiting so long to question what's going on that it's entirely unbelievable that takes as much time as it does to bring someone else in on the action. It's pretty big, and does hold this down somewhat though there's still a lot to like here.\n\nRated R: Graphic Violence and continuous scenes of implied and actual threats to infants and children."

(spoilers) it starts off pretty good with the creepy doll Annabelle, and the freaky hippie cult killers (Manson famiyish). but beyond the opening, there is nothing that was really that scary or disturbing. most of the violence happens off camera and there is a lot of build up with no pay off. there's a really cool looking demon that receives too little screen time to make it interesting. i found myself hoping there would be more of a connection to the satanic hippie cult as i like the late 60's/early 70's and Satan worship, they just seem to go together. I recommend watching The Devil Rides Out, Rosemary's Baby, or Race With The Devil over Annabelle. I still can't really see why this movie was rated R. I've seen more violence in a Roadrunner cartoon. That being said, the acting and directing was actually good and kept me interested and waiting for something to happen that never did."

        "review_detailed_main": "When medical student John (Ward Horton) buys a rare vintage doll for his pregnant wife Mia (Annabelle Wallis), the last thing he expects is for his gift to become a source of unimaginable evil, but that's precisely what happens after Manson-like Satanic cultists violently attack the couple in their home and somehow turn the doll into a conduit for a demon.\n\nThere's a nail-biting moment in Annabelle where Mia is absent-mindedly using a sewing machine, her fingertips getting nearer and nearer to the rapidly moving needle. It promises to be very nasty indeed, but winds up being frustratingly tame. That's the main problem with Annabelle: it never really delivers. Take the film's demon, for example: it provides a handful of lame jump scares, but it never actually does any serious harm. A freaky scene that sees Mia in an elevator that repeatedly arrives on the same floor had potential, director John R. Leonetti skillfully cranking up the tension, his evil creature lurking in the dark poised to strike, but in the end Mia easily escapes via some stairs to her apartment. I wanted to be terrified, but I wasn't.\n\nThe other issue I have with Annabelle is this: who the hell would make such a freakin' ugly doll in the first place? In reality, no-one would buy something that repulsive. They'd be hard pushed to give the damned thing away, yet John pays a small fortune for the doll and his wife is only too pleased when she sees it. At least Chucky was reasonably cute (before his face got all messed up, that is)."

There's a premise in the film that a demon wants take the child's soul... at one point the mother finds the doll in the crib and starts bashing it around... we then see what appears to be her real baby laying on the ground... we now believe she just murdered her own baby due to a hallucination by the demon, and now out of desperation, will allow the demon to take her soul or something along these lines... a real mind *beep* to get what the demon wants... but nothing of the sort happens, instead it's just another doll on the floor, baby is fine, but mother then thinks she has to kill herself to save her daughter, which makes no sense, because if she believes in demons, and she goes to church, she probably believes in God and must believe her dead daughter is now in Heaven, right? Well, it doesn't go that way either, instead she lives and the completely random black voodoo woman who has been helping them sacrifices herself...\n\nThe ending would have been better if she had beaten her baby to death, and gave her soul to the demon out of guilt...\n\nThe whole movie has no balls, and is a major disappointment, I would give this movie very few Tostino pizza rolls, and say, wait for Netflix/Cable/DVD to watch this train wreck."

The atmosphere of tension is built superficially, resulting in a slightly scary experience, especially compared to the impact of the original title in the franchise. The excess of jumpscares and the absence of new narrative elements end up harming the overall value of the project. Still, the figure of Annabelle has established herself as an icon of horror cinema, much more due to her striking presence than due to the merits of the plot. It is worth highlighting some of the script's attempts to add layers to the story, such as the change of residence and the exploration of aspects related to satanic sects from the 70s that marked the United States.\n\n\"Annabelle\" does not impress as expected, delivering a common production for the genre. This is a film that is successful mainly due to the popularity of its central figure, and not because of its cinematographic quality."

They put the best scares on the trailer so it might have ruined my viewing experience, had I watched the trailer first (luckily I didn't).\n\nI got mixed feeling about this movie. The good points first then. The atmosphere is creepy, the acting is nice (especially the lady/mom, she's excellent). They build suspense from trivial things (like the sewing machine), and the simple \"unknown\" factor. The elevator scene is genius!\n\nThe bad points, in my opinion, is the overused of blasting sound effect that denotes horror/ shock. It's cheap, and unfair. And it happens ALL THE TIME. Some things can't be explained at all... it's just seem like made up things to add to the creepiness but once you think about it, it doesn't make any sense (I'm talking about the drawings here. Come on now, the doll spent some time to draw those prophetic drawings? Where's the logic to that?? And I'm not talking about normal logic, I'm talking WITHIN the movie logic). Also it has really bad moral message in the end that makes something seems to be a good thing where such thing NEVER is a good thing. There are other ways to get rid of that doll, one of the possible solutions was to call a SWAT TEAM or whatever and escort that doll to another country... for example. The ending is the worst part in my opinion."

Although,the film got literally awful reviews with people commenting it down as 'the worst horror film of 2014',I can kind of get that,I mean,I had some flaws with it,like the amount of scenes that just left you hangin there like '..eh,is something gonna happen or eh..' and the predictable characters,but overall,passing that,this film was pretty cool and good,but it was,obviously,no where near as good as The Conjuring 1 or 2. Annabelle is a pretty good horror film with some effective scares and scenes,but overall in ways,is just another one of those horrors teens see for a good scare to get videos of your friends scared crapless and post it on Snapchat"

The start was like watching some kind of soap opera but in a good way letting the audience build a connection with the characters especially Mia played by Annabelle Wallis (strange name coincidence there)who played a strong part I thought.\n\nThe Doll was very spooky looking but the best part for me without spoiling anything was the scene with the doll next to the window with bright sunlight streaming in and the doll raised into the air (look in the background - very scary and well done) On the whole a good movie and in my opinion leagues ahead the Babadook which is getting loads of praise from movie critics.

        "review_detailed_main": "Annabelle is a 2014 horror movie directed by John R. Leonetti and written by Gary Dauberman. The film serves as a prequel to The Conjuring and tells the story of a young couple, John and Mia, who begin to experience terrifying supernatural occurrences after a cult member attacks them and their doll, Annabelle, becomes possessed.\n\nOverall, Annabelle is a well-crafted horror movie that effectively builds tension and suspense throughout its runtime. The movie benefits from strong performances by its lead actors, Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton, who convincingly portray a young couple struggling to protect themselves and their newborn child from the malevolent presence that has invaded their home.\n\nThe film's cinematography is also noteworthy, with Leonetti using a range of camera angles and lighting techniques to create an eerie atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. In particular, the scenes set in the couple's apartment are expertly shot, with the tight spaces and dim lighting adding to the sense of claustrophobia and fear.\n\nDespite its many strengths, however, Annabelle is not without its flaws. At times, the movie feels somewhat predictable, and some viewers may find the reliance on jump scares and other horror movie tropes to be somewhat tiresome. Additionally, while the movie's climactic scenes are suitably tense and terrifying, the conclusion feels somewhat rushed and unsatisfying.\n\nOverall, Annabelle is a solid horror movie that is sure to satisfy fans of the genre. While it may not be the most original or groundbreaking entry in the horror canon, it is still a well-made, entertaining film that is worth watching for its strong performances, effective scares, and expertly crafted atmosphere."

Especially in the first hour or so it reminded me of \"Rosemary's baby\": the big apartment, the nice couple, the eerie atmosphere of looming but intangible evil.

        "review_detailed_main": "The plot of the movie was very interesting and I would definitely watch that movie, because I would really like to know more things about \"Annabelle\". The storyline was well-written and explained really well, the events before \"The Conjuring\". The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. The filming location of the movie was basic, just a big creepy house. It was a really scary movie and there were many jumpscares. The killcount of the movie was low and most kills were done off-screen, nothing wow. The opening scene of the movie was definitely unexpected and it was very intense, I really liked it. The ending scene was kinda expected and it was just okay. In my opinion, it was a nice prequel and I will definitely watch the following movies of the franchise!"

The story line is good enough. Though there is some questionable moments, but, overall I just enjoyed it. At least this is far better than many other horror films like 'It Follows'."

        "review_title": "\"Annabelle\" (2014) scared the $#@& out of me!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Annabelle\" seems like precisely the sort of horror film that shouldn't work. Thinly drawn characters wind their way through a series of overly familiar tropes, including, of course, the titular possessed doll. These characters make the same baffling decisions that only people in horror movies are stupid enough to make, and cavalierly remain in dangerous situations long after you and I would have gotten the hell out of there. The film is so reminiscent of \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968) that for a while I actually wondered if it was a remake. And the script is pretty clunky \u2014 especially the coda at the church.\n\nYet \u0085 \"Annabelle\" still works. This is a frikkin' scary movie. I'd give it a 9 out of 10.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for the movie's success, I think. First, it's beautifully shot and directed throughout an especially creepy apartment building. Our supernatural antagonists are (at first) wisely seen down long corridors and stairwells. There are some static shots of the doll but none of the silly cut-and-cut-back tricks to explain that it is moving on its own.\n\nSecond, there is no ham-handed CGI to make the action cartoonish; there are only sparsely placed practical effects, and they work quite well. This felt like an effective old-fashioned 1970's horror movie about the devil.\n\nThird, Annabelle Wallis does well in her role as the young married couple targeted by Satan. She underplays it quite a bit, but she's still a good actress. (The beautiful Wallis is none other than the college student that young Charles Xavier tried to pick up in 2011's \"X-Men: First Class.\" And, yes, she does have the same first name as the demonic doll. Weird world.)\n\nI was confused at first about the awkward and confusing bookends to the film; they're distracting and unnecessary. Wikipedia informs me that these are intended to remind viewers that this movie is a spin off of \"The Conjuring\" (2013), which is regarded by horror fans as superior to this film. I guess I'll need to watch that soon."
