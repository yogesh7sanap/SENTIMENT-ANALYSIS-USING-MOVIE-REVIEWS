For me, the first came out of nowhere, whereas for this second one, expectations would have been incredibly high.\n\nA superb storyline, breathtaking visuals, first class acting, and Yoda, what more could anyone possibly want or need from a movie, it's a bold claim, but I would genuinely say this is one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nThe sets are unbelievable, you can really tell that for those involved this was definitely a labour of love, everything was precise and on point.\n\nIt's worth a 10/10 for Yoda alone, I adore his and Luke's scenes together. The wonderful voice of Frank Oz adds a great deal, it really does help to make Yoda such an amazing, funny, smart and curious character.\n\nLet's be honest, films don't get much better than this, it really is a masterpiece.\n\n10/10."

After the release of the first episode, the budget, the fans appeared, and, accordingly, the quality improved!\n\nThe fifth episode is the darkest and even the best in the original trilogy (in my personal opinion), and for many in the entire franchise.\n\nHere we will hear the famous Imperial March for the first time, learn all the greatness of the Empire under the leadership of Vader, as well as the formation of Luke as a Jedi.\n\nNew characters have added color to the franchise, some have already become iconic and famous among many (the same Boba Fett).\n\nThis fascinating story will feature plot twists (for sure many people understood what I was talking about) and a very addictive atmosphere of horror.\n\nAs a result, this is what the fans needed - a successful sequel. And, of course, you need to look at it, it's a classic after all.\n\nMy Rating : 10/10 (one of the best films)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.\n\nEmpire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.\n\nThe plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.\n\nEmpire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.\n\nThings that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.\n\nI love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.\n\nFor the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.\n\nThe Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.\n\nLuke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.\n\nThe training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic.\n\nA New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time."

No comparison whatsoever. \"The Empire Strike Back\" is George Lucas' best contribution to human history, and it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who claims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven't already done so. 20 out of 10!!\n\nOh, and Han Solo shot first! =)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film changed the game forever. The people behind the scenes took an exciting science fiction adventure film with a happy tone where the heroes have a happy tone throughout and throwing that on its side. Throughout the film the rebels are in a constant rush and panic, pushing the viewers to the edge of their seat wondering if the heroes would make it to the end okay. This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through. Even though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for. That is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city. Even though we as viewers are worried for the rebels, the imagery is jaw dropping. The imagery is further enhanced by the most popular score of all time, John Williams delivers his best work ever as it has stuck with people their entire lives and is recognizable by even those who haven't seen the film. The film was released in 1980 and all of the set design and special effects still hold up to this day as they are just as convincing now as it was apon first watch for everyone in the past 38 years."

        "review_title": "It's NOT the darkest of the trilogy - it's the most mature",
        "review_detailed_main": "`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.' I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me. I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending. Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens. If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film. Stop reading now.\n\nAfter the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al. Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.\n\nThe training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish. But somehow it doesn't matter. The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway. Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke. The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia. In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay. It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point. Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur. That's enough.\n\nAs for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER. This was my favourite touch. All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong. The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force. Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.\n\nWhen George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes. You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V. There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition. Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction. It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one."

Meanwhile, Luke goes to the Dagobah system and finds Jedi Master Yoda.\n\nThere are superior popcorn movies in the Star Wars franchise although there is plenty of eye-popping action in this one. This is the best overall film in the series. The dialog is snappier. The combative romance between Leia and Han is the best. Everything looks great. It introduces Yoda and Lando. There are great legendary twists. It is a Star Wars movie for film fans. Even the Special Edition is the best of the original trio.

        "review_title": "Even though he wasn't at the director's helm this time, George Lucas has done it again.",
        "review_detailed_main": "In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.\n\nAt first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.\n\nI have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.\n\nOh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!\n\nThere is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.\n\nBefore I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!\n\nIt is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history."

It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema."

Without Star Wars and its army of nerds leading the way, there is no Marvel attempt to take over films and no comic-con and you would be looking at a very different world.\n\nThis film has great moment and legendary quotes or misquotes and of course it has its flaws but what blockbuster doesn't and in the end it is a Star Wars film so it's worth watching.\n\nFeatured on Episode 69 of The Emerald Reprobates Podcast."

We learn more about who we have already come to love in the previous installment and we are able to enjoy a much more well-rounded and fleshed out idea of what Lucas' galaxy far far away should look and feel like. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Han Solo steals the show alongside his companion Chewbacca, played by the late Peter Mayhew. Mark Hamill really ups his game with Luke, making him into a less adolescent and sheltered farm kid, he's learning more about his past and the life he never knew. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa is the perfect mixture of sass and whit as she shows us that not all space royalty is uppity and useless. Billy Dee Williams knocks it out of the park with his performance as the suave and charismatic Lando Calrissian. With the success of A New Hope, this movie boasts and impressive budget increase. This is shown in the care and detail taken into consideration when seeing all of the creatures and vehicles shown throughout the film. Simply put, this movie CARES. The people involved put forth their best work to bring what the world needed in a constant rotation of mundane and bad sci-fi action flicks coming out around the same time. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect Star Wars movie in an otherwise very flawed saga. I recommend it for anyone that wants to go on a wild and fun ride through the stars!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my favorite of the classic Star Wars trilogy! It is the most suspenseful of the three and, as great as the other two are, they don't flow like this one does. This one explores the relationships instead of just action sequences (which are good in all three, though). The romance between Han and Leia and the one between Luke and Yoda, for example. This does have the best action sequence of the three of them, though; the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader. Pure brilliance!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is as Star Wars as Star Wars gets in that it is one of if not the best story told in the franchise. Empire Strikes Back takes everything that was good about A New Hope and just completely expands upon it. It is arguably the greatest sequel in cinematic history.\n\nEach character is given more emotional depth including Luke, Leia, Han, and even Vader this time. A New Hope is a fun movie, this movie feels more like an emotional experience in comparison. This is the first film in which the Imperial March, one of the best songs created for a movie ever is heard. Also, this movie contains probably the most shocking reveal in all of cinematic history.\n\nThe sets are more grand, the effects are more spectacular, and the music is absolutely some of the best in all of Star Wars. The film sets genuinely feel completely real. From Hoth to Dagobah to Bespin the locations in this film are so incredibly detailed and well made. Dagobah especially feels like a completely different planet. None of the sets even feel like sets. They feel like real places. Also the special effects are marvelous especially for its time. The asteroid belt scene in particular is not only breathtaking to see but the music mixed in as well makes it so much fun to watch.\n\nWhich brings me to the action. Much more fun and much more grand in comparison to A New Hope. The opening Hoth battle is such a great scene not only because of the special effects and the captivating action but also because of the stakes. The fact that we are following all the characters and they are all doing something makes it feel like they are actually in trouble and it makes for an engrossing scene. The fight with Luke and Vader is also a great action scene. The scene where Luke is looking for his friends and runs into Vader. The lack of music, the choreography, and all the colors work together to tell the story. One of the best set ups to a fight, like ever. The fight itself is very emotional for both characters which leads up to the big reveal at the end. Luke willingly chose death over joining Vader. It's a cliffhanger, literally.\n\nI feel like the Yoda stuff is shorter than it should be. Don't get me wrong I think the training scenes with Yoda on Dagobah are great. But, it feels too short and almost underwhelming. It starts off very funny when we meet Yoda, I love that scene after Luke crashes. I also think the dialogue between Yoda and Luke as well as Yoda and Ben is really well written. Yoda feels like a goofball at first, but quickly begins to come out as a genuine and wise character. All of those scenes are extremely quotable as well like Yoda says some really smart things. In the end it feels like Lukes training is extremely rushed and I understand it's because he chose to leave, but still I would have liked to see more. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the scenes we did get. The tie fighter scene is awesome and I think about Yoda's quotes to Luke on a daily basis.\n\nOverall, The Empire Strikes Back is honestly a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the best movies ever made without a doubt. The characters all have so much more depth to them. It completely steps it up in comparison to A New Hope. In terms of the character development, special effects, script, and execution. There is never a dull moment, and it is filled with iconic moments. The whole third act is so emotionally powerful. The scene where they lose Han, and then the Vader and Luke scene afterwards. Such well shot, emotional and beautifully filmed scenes. It ends with one of the best cliffhangers ever. Everyone is on a low note, and no one knows what's gonna happen next. The Empire Strikes Back is nothing shy of a masterpiece. *chefs kiss*\n\nI like New Hope better because it's much more simple and fun. Revenge of the Sith is my favorite, easily."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film as well as A New Hope has put me in a very very strange predicament. How exactly does one evaluate a film in which one knows the entire plot a priori, to no fault of the film. As well as a film with astounding visuals at the time, but very poorly aged visuals and shot selection today. Such is my problem with star wars as a franchise. So considering the circumstances, let me shortly say the following.\n\nStar Wars is an excellent intellectual property based on an excessively cheesy movie franchise. I feel similarly to the star wars franchise as I do the Marvel cinematic universe. They are a set of fun and entertaining family movies that can make your imagination go absolutely wild. I know I'm not alone in pretending that I was a Jedi or a Superhero when I was young. What the franchise is not is any sort of art film or strong statement about anything. It is pure fun, but perhaps better left in nostalgia than a film to come back to. As the weight of the visual technology fades, it is hard for me to justify that the average storytelling and wonderful soundtrack are enough to carry it.\n\nConclusion: wonderful IP and universe, very cheesy film."

The only truly classic thing to come out of this film is The Imperial March is an iconic score and deserves all the praise it gets. But other than that? There is isn't anything that I can truly call great in this film.\n\nI'm sure this film was amazing for it's time and me not even being alive in 1980 is probably one of the biggest reasons why I don't understand the so called \"pure genius\" of this film, but there is no doubt in my mind that it has greatly suffered the Seinfeld effect and is something you had to actually be around for understand what all the hype is about for this so called \"excellent\" and \"amazing\" sequel."

Luke will try to master the powers of the force by searching for a new Jedi to train him; meanwhile, as he digs into his past he discovers more about how he became a Jedi to begin with.\n\nThis movie is directed by Irvin Kershner (Robocop 2) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Clear and Present Danger), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Nighthawks) and James Earl Jones (Coming to America).\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back was always one of my favorites in the original trilogy. The opening yeti scene was fantastic and a great way tp start the film. The Princess and Hans scenes were hilarious and the banter makes you laugh no matter how many times you've seen it. Yoda is a legendary character introduced in this film and the Hans stasis scene is always sad. The final Luke vs Vader scene is also legendary and fun to watch unfold.\n\nOverall this is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see. This is an easy 10/10."

While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda.

However, they are betrayed by Lando and captured by Darth Vader. Meanwhile Luke has a premonition with his friends in danger and he decides to interrupt his training with Yoda to save them, despite the warning of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends?\n\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\", later retitled \"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\" is a fantastic sequel of Star Wars, with a great story. The plot has adventure, romance, comedy and betrayal and is engaging until the very end. The characters now are more experienced and bonded. The mannerisms of C-3PO recalls Dr. Smith, from \"Lost in Space\". This is the type of sequel that keeps the high quality of the original film. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Imp\u00e9rio Contra-Ataca\" (\"The Empire Strikes Back\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome. Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions. The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development. The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . .. . . . . well, that's pretty much it. Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants).\n\nThe characters however, have developed considerably since the first film - it's nice to see loyal Chewbacca show a sense of humour. The sexual tension between Princess Leia and Han Solo is palpable. . . . . . . . . . until they kiss (which looks about as exciting as snogging a shoe). In a clever twist, Yoda the Jedi Master is not a Hercules-type warrior, but a wizened green dwarf; the characterisation would have worked even better had he not had a voice a-la-Sesame Street.\n\nIn the Special Edition of Episode IV, A New Hope, there is an obvious and uncomfortable chasm between those scenes which have been unaltered since they were shot in 1977 and those that were digitally re-mastered and altered 20 years later. Fortunately the same is not the case in Episode V. But why was it necessary to darken the picture contrast so drastically?\n\nFor fanatics The Empire Strikes Back is of course an integral component of the Star Wars dynasty. Viewers with a more casual interest in the story could probably get away with skipping this installment altogether."

Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.\n\nWith more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series. Personally, A New Hope will always be my favourite (for sentimental reasons), but The Empire Strikes Back is a very close second."

        "review_detailed_main": "What can I say about \"The Empire Strikes Back\" that hasn't already been said? This film takes everything great about \"A New Hope\" and elevates it. The cinematography, the setting, the characters, the story, everything is crisp and succinct in \"Empire\". There were multiple times (3 to be exact) that I had full body chills, all because of the brilliant marriage of story, score and performance.\n\nThis movie shows that the \"galaxy far, far away\" is more than just Tatooine and the Death Star. From Hoth to Dagpbah to Cloud City, \"Empire\" helps expand the Star Wars Universe. By traveling to different parts of the galaxy, the film physically separates the three leads. Even though apart, their connection remains strong with the force (and their incredible chemistry) binding them together. Their individual journeys have purpose and the addition of new supporting characters (Yoda, Lando, etc.) are legendary.\n\nIf this film failed, Star Wars would not be the legendary franchise that it is today. Simply put, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is top tier cinema.\n\nAdditional Note: The three \"chill-worthy\" moments were 1. Yoda raising the ship. 2. THE reveal. 3. Realizing the force connection between the siblings."

        "review_title": "My Favourite Film Ever",
        "review_detailed_main": "So my next step in watching Star Wars films is the 2nd film released The Empire Strikes Back and I'm going to spoil the review for anybody watching this is my favourite film I have ever seen so expect me to be very positive about this film. The premise of the film sees Luke Skywalker travel to the planet Dagobah and learn from a Jedi Master in order to improve his skills, while Leia, Han, Chewbacca & C-3PO are on the run from The Empire with Darth Vader in charge of everything.\n\nMain Character There is sometimes some criticism of Mark Hamill's performance in the first two Star Wars films because he does complain and wine quite a bit. However, I think this helps make this character feel interesting to me, the other two jedi's we meet in the first two films in Obi-Wan & Yoda are very wise and all knowing so easy to respect but hard to relate to. Luke is us the audience, we don't understand the teachings of the Jedi and we get frustrated easily, Luke makes mistakes as a character which makes him easier to root for as he feels very human compared to these other characters who feel like gods. This film does a great job in making Luke flawed but also making us care about him and want to see him succeed in his mission despite these flaws.\n\nSupporting Characters As mentioned in my previous review Harrison Ford as Han Solo & Carrie Fish as Leia are brilliant supporting characters and they are great in this film together. They have so much charisma and there chemistry together is off the charts (probably due to real life chemistry), they have some of the most iconic scenes in film history together in this film and there romance really evolves in the film and feels very natural and appropriate for the two characters on screen. Now onto possibly the star of the show the character of Darth Vader, in A New Hope we are given a brief introduction to Vader but in this film he is centre stage and he is the embodiment of pure evil in this film. He is menacing and you are scared of his power as we aren't really shown that in the previous film, he is very commanding and you learn more about his character that makes him even more interesting then he was in the previous film. Frank Oz voices Yoda in the film and he was a great addition to the film, you can really see how wise Yoda is as a character and I really liked his dynamic with Luke in the film as you see two people pretty much at different points of life and how they treat things which leads to them clashing. Billy Dee Williams plays Lando Carrissian, a smuggler that are heroes meet and he also has loads of charisma and charm to him even though you can tell he maybe isn't as honest as he lets on and like Han from the previosu film he has his own motivations to help the team.\n\nStory This film takes risks with its story by splitting the characters up into two different storylines but it really pays off. You have the slower but really interesting personal story with Luke & Yoda and you have the faster more exciting romantic story involving Han & Leia. They both mesh incredibly well and they both give an audience member different things to enjoy and it allows the pacing to feel perfect and well done. Obviously this film has some twists in it that are very well known but I wn't mention them specifically in case there is somebody who doesn't know about it, but it is all handled perfectly and really adds drama to this film but also the future films aswell that was pretty revolutionary at the time and even holds up now even though I know the twists.\n\nScript The script for this film is so well written, the dialogue makes the characters feel so real and the drama is amped up in this one to truly make you care about the characters and the plight that they are in. The humour is good too especially with Han & Leia as it fits there characters perfectly and feels right for them and their romance. Also the twists are perfectly handled and written brilliantly to allow you to really sink them in and understand them.\n\nStyle This film's style is darker then A New Hope but it feels right as the heroes are plunged into a darker story and as the title of the film suggests the villains are all over them from very early on. In terms of action scenes The Battle of Hoth at the beginning of the film is one of my favourite battles not just in Star Wars history but in film history. Also the lightsaber battle between Vader & Luke is faster and just as personal as the one between Vader & Obi-Wan making it more exciting and a much better watch. Also John Williams score is even better in this film and really adds to the suspense and the darker story that is being told. I should also mention that I watched the newer Blu Ray version but unlike A New Hope the changes are very small and I actually thought they were fine and didn't change the film one bit.\n\nOverall Overall, I literally struggle to find any faults with this movie. It is the perfect middle part of a trilogy and should be watched as that so watch A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back & Return Of The Jedi in a short time frame to truly appreciate the development of the characters and the story. With this being my favourite film of all time I heavily recommend this film and the other two films in the trilogy.\n\nRating - 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Back in 1977 I really enjoyed the first film in the franchise, but the hype was so enormous when this came out I decided to avoid it for a bit. I finally caught up with it in 1997 by which time Time had sadly caught up with it too and wreaked its usual damage. Then it was a case of Roll Over Harryhausen, tell Jim Henson the news.\n\nStory has imaginative intergalactic politics and battles amidst a plethora of gormless soap and stereotypes. To a kid it would be marvellous stuff to watch and as an adult to revel in through rose-tinted glasses, but coming at it as an adult I see it through the Empire's, sorry, Emperor's New Clothes and in the Altogether. It's relentlessly inventive but not in my top 1000 films of all time. Favourite bits: Luke yakking to Kermit about the Force; the flying city where expense or common sense is no object; the love affair between the Princess and the Scoundrel; the remarkably obvious pay-off, hyped at the time as something groundbreaking.\n\nThe first cut is nearly always the deepest - long live the brash first film, this sequel is entertaining and nonsensical, an eminent time-passer. The first was a monument to Luck, the second a monument to Hype; I love fantasy movies of all eras and genres but mainly those not surrounded by heaps of hype swallowed by millions of people, it's a real barrier to my complete enjoyment of anything. This is a watchable movie but only a must-watch movie to see for what digital cgi cartoonery has done to the movies, and to us. Modern cgi is usually cold and soulless but usually not jerky and laughable, cgi has spoilt us all and there's no going back. However, now to watch Jason & The Argonauts and curse Roger Rabbit."

While Han and Leia escape in the Millennium Falcon, Luke travels to Dagobah in search of Yoda. Only with the Jedi master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the Force beckons him into the ultimate duel with Darth Vader (David Prowse).\n\nThis has to be my favourite Star Wars movie out of them all! This movie does everything way better than the first with great character Development will all characters and the introduction of 2 new characters, a smuggler from Hans past and a badass bounty hunter. The most has great special effects and a great musical score by John Williams again! The sets are so good to look at and the characters are so much more likeable in this movie!\n\nThe movie also becomes way more darker than the last one.\n\nMark Hamill does a way better job playing Luke even becoming more likeable. Carrie Fisher is still the likeable princess from the first one. Harrison Ford is still as likeable from the first one and him and Leia relationship is way more drawn out. Chewbacca is hilarious in this movie. Billy Dee Williams is a welcomed addition to this movie! James Earl Jones is menacing Vader!\n\nOverall this is the best Star Wars movie to date!"

        "review_detailed_main": "After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swampworld with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?\n\nWell, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the \"Star Wars\" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous \"Star Wars.\" People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but \"Empire\" is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.\n\nGeorge Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.\n\n\"Empire Strikes Back\" is thus a richer film than \"Star Wars\" emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.\n\nLucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.\n\nThere's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.\n\nThe best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in \"Star Wars,\" sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farmboy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after \"Blazing Saddles.\"\n\nWhat else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable \"Imperial March\" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.\n\nThe returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in \"Star Wars,\" gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the \"cave\" that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.\n\nThe enthusiasm that makes \"Empire Strikes Back\" so beloved today is understandable. It turned \"Star Wars\" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. But it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality \"Star Wars\" has, needing both that earlier film and the later \"Return Of The Jedi\" to make it as great as it is."

I'm sure there were plot twists before 1980, but this movie has to go down in history as the best and biggest plot twist ever with just 3 words: \"I'm your father\".\n\nEverything about this movie is better than A New Hope (and A New Hope was a 9/10 for me) including: the lightsaber battle, the special effects (which still hold up to an extent to this day), Yoda, a deeper dive into the universe through character and creature introductions, and of course more of Darth Vader. The lines quoted by Yoda throughout his sequenes are some of the best known movie quotes of all time as well. John Williams continues to deliver with his score and character themes too. This movie is just a classic and absolutely my favorite movie out of all 9.\n\nFinal grade: Absolutely a 10/10"

The fact that George Lucas did this movie on his own with his own money should tell you everything you need to know about how amazingly tenacious he is, not only that, he brought the characters to life..making them memorable, believable and most importantly relatable. Yes it's an old movie, yes it feels out dated...but trust me, if you look really past that and focus on its level of storytelling and the amazing writing of the story, you will understand why this movie has a rating of 8.7...most movies today and even in the last decade haven't even gotten close to that.

        "review_detailed_main": "The first Star Wars movie, is a Sci-fi and cinematic masterpiece. But where Star Wars capitalized, Empire Strikes Back took it to the next level.\n\nHere's what I think of the movie:\n\nStory - I'm pretty sure we all know the story of Star Wars. A Galactic Empire is empowering the galaxy, and a Rebel Alliance tries to stop it. Today, it's sort of a clich\u00e9 plot but back then, it was imagination skyrocketing into the heavens. Now, thats the plot of Star Wars. The story spans from a battle on the frigid planet of Hoth, to a space dogfight in an asteroid field, to Cloud City where the greatest plot twist in the history of cinema, is reveled. The film ends on a cliffhanger which leads to Return of the Jedi. I'm not going to spoil it, but I don't think I would need to because I'm willing to bet that about 99.99% of people have already seen this movie anyway(to that .01%, where the hell have you been?).\n\n-Rating 10/10\n\nCharacters - The characters from the original movie are back, including Luke, Han, Leia, C3P0 and R2D2, and of course, Darth Vader. But the films also introduces some new characters as well, including Lando, The Emperor, Boba Fett, and Yoda. The Emperor doesn't really play a big part in the movie(I think he only has like, 10 lines) and Boba's name is never really mentioned. However, Yoda plays a big part by teaching Luke the ways of the force, and Lando, who is Han's old pal, plays a big part by betraying our heroes and giving them to Vader. Of course, he's still a good guy, he had to hand them over. Overall, I'd say the characters are still great.\n\n\n\nVisuals - This was back when Star Wars movies didn't rape the fabric of CGI. So what you see in the movie were real things. The Walkers, asteroids, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, everything. The original Star Wars set the standards for Special Effects with the light sabers, Death Stars blowing up and everything. Empire Strikes Back isn't any different. The Effects are still awesome and look great.\n\n-Rating 10/10\n\nMusic - The Star Wars theme is (of course) still here and it's one of the most recognized themes in cinema. You only need to hear a second of the Star Wars theme, and you'll know what it is. Like any other Star Wars film, the music is composed by John Williams, so everything is played by an orchestra. Even though it's great the here the Star Wars theme in all it's nostalgic glory, the music thats played is still just as great.\n\n-Rating 10/10\n\nOverall - Empire Strikes back is my favorite Star Wars film and is one of my favorite movies. If I had to make a Top 10 list of my favorite movies, about 15 movies would be tied for the #1 spot, and this would be one of them. Everything about it is just perfect.\n\nFinal rating : 10/10\n\n-PeterPPK"

        "review_title": "Action, Adventure, But Lack Of \"Epic\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "In terms of action and adventure, \"Empire Strikes Back\" is a rousing success. There are enough space flights, phaser blasts, and lightsaber wielding to satisfy the visual effects junkies. The only thing missing, however, is that \"sense of something epic\" inherent in its original predecessor.\n\nIn \"Episode V\", as it has come to be known, the rebels are still being pursued by the Empire, this time on the ice planet Hot. The first half of the film focuses on those battles, primarily featuring Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). A new character in Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is also introduced, though his loyalties are very much in question. The second half deals more with Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) beginning steps to becoming a Jedi. After the death (in Part IV) of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke goes to continue his training with Yoda, an enigmatic little green character seemingly older than time itself. The film's climax brings forth the long-awaited meeting of Luke and Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), as well as a startling (if now clich\u00e9d) revelation that sets the stage for the final chapter.\n\nThough a good movie in its own right, I always felt as if this one lagged behind the original in certain key areas. A recent watching confirmed this. I think the \"trouble\" stems from the fact that \"Empire\" is much more of an action film than a drama. Whereas \"New Hope\" was so incredibly genre-diverse, \"Empire\" takes that same cast of characters and instead relies a bit too much on laser blasts and space maneuvers. It doesn't help that certain scenes (inside the \"asteroid\"; Lando's scenes) just feel a little draggy...like filler.\n\nOverall, though, this is still a very watchable film that keeps the main storyline pushing forward. For special effects or action/adventure buffs, this one will stand out. For others, it may fall just a tick behind the original."

Luke's Story in this is great and Yoda is a lot of fun. Darth Vader is an even better villain in this film. This film is fun and exciting from beginning to end. It never gets slow and is fast passed. This is an amazing film.\n\n9.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "There are two main ways to follow up a genre film. The first was perfectly encapsulated by Aliens in the \"bigger is better\" school. You expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience. The second is to not go bigger, but to go deeper. The Empire Strikes Back might be the best example of that way to go.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back actually feels a good bit smaller in scale than the original Star Wars. The biggest battle happens at the beginning of the film, involving a patch of icy land, several large walking tanks, and about a dozen speeders. That is smaller than the couple of dozen fighters attacking a moon sized base that can destroy a planet. The movie never goes bigger than that. In fact, the scale of the conflict continuously gets smaller as the film goes on.\n\nAt the beginning, the conflict is between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. It's got galactic consequences, that great battle on the planet of Hoth. If the Rebel Alliance doesn't successfully get away, then the Empire's return strike after the destruction of the Death Star will wipe out its last major adversary for control of the galaxy. The next major set piece is the chase of the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field. It's now one ship versus a handful of fighters and a Star Destroyer and the uncaring nature of outer space. It's a chase in order to capture the handful of occupants on board so that Darth Vader can lure Luke Skywalker.\n\nThe final conflict is between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. We're more than an hour since the Rebel Alliance has even been mentioned. The conflict involves only two people, not half a dozen. It's no longer about galactic consequences. Instead it's about a father and son and a conflict of good versus evil. The fight of the film narrows, and the only reason it can pull that off is because of the characters.\n\nThe original Star Wars utilized archetypes to tell its well-worn story. The Empire Strikes Back moves beyond the familiar hero's journey, and in order to accomplish that it needs to move beyond archetypes. Luke is no longer the farmboy hero. Instead he's an arrogant war hero who thinks far too much of himself. Han is no longer just the rogue, but a man with his own sense of right and wrong. Leia is no longer just the princess in need of help, she can push back on Han and control situations like she could only try to in the first. Darth Vader is no longer just the antagonist, he's now got a more complex goal of turning the hero to his side of the overall conflict. These characters are far more interesting in this second adventure than the first, and the story's structure of the second film is built to allow these characters to actually move through actions and change.\n\nThe center and highlight really is Luke. As I wrote a second ago, he's wildly arrogant at the start of this film. He goes out to check out a meteorite on his own and escapes from the clutches of a giant snow beast without help from anyone else. He also leads the successful feint against the incoming Empire attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, providing enough time for the transports to get away free and destroying a few of the AT-ATs as well. When he's sent to Dagobah to find Obi-wan's former master, Yoda, he thinks that he's beyond humility. He doesn't need it. He's awesome. But from the moment he lands on Dagobah, he fails at everything he does through the rest of the film. The capstone of his training is when he walks into the cave and fails to use the Force in the ways that Yoda had dictated, fighting the phantom version of Darth Vader and revealing that he had only defeated himself in the fight. He fails to raise his X-wing from the swamp. He fails to maintain control of his emotions when visions of Han and Leia suffering come to him. He fails to listen to Leia's explicit warnings of a trap. He fails in his fight against Darth Vader, only escaping through a desperate act of falling down a giant hole.\n\nHis constant stream of failures, capped by his failed confrontation with Darth Vader, humbles Luke. He no longer feels like he can face the evils of the universe alone. Dangling from the underbelly of Cloud City with only one hand, he calls out to Leia, desperate for any help. Even in the final moments of the film, he stands with his friends, not apart, and has become part of a plan to help the captured Han instead of running out there alone. Luke's journey in this film is fantastic all the more because it undermines the hero's journey he went through in the first. It goes against the idea of how we think hero's behave and succeed after their great victories.\n\nIt's the character work that really makes the film work, but the movie continues the first film's proud tradition of great design. There are expansions of the world in things like the Super Star Destroyer and the walking tanks the AT-ATs. Yoda is a creature come alive with puppetry. The fighters, the planets, and creatures are all great. The special effects move the technology of the first film forward, and it's always in the service of the great story and character journeys at the heart of the film.\n\nActing takes another step up as well. Moving directing duties from \"Faster, more intense\" George Lucas to Irvin Kershner was a surprisingly good choice overall, but it makes sense once you realize that The Empire Strike Back is more character film than science fiction adventure.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back is a magnificent sequel that takes the characters from the preceding adventure seriously and gives them space to grow, propelling them through an adventure that truly tests them. It very rightly stands atop the world of genre fiction as one of the its greatest accomplishments."

        "review_detailed_main": "So, I was almost 1 when this movie dropped and, well, it started the opening night tradition.\n\nOK, well, how to do this? I guess we will start with the hate. I like to address the hate in movies, especially ones that are well regarded and loved.\n\nNow, I'll excuse it for the people that just don't like Star Wars. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.\n\nBut then there are the people that really hate Empire because of...reasons. And those reasons are Revenge of the Sith.\n\nI'm sorry, panning Empire because of loyalty to the prequels--misplaced as it is--doesn't make I-III any better. It just makes you petty.\n\nNow, why its loved and, I'll admit, I am one of those fanboys that really do love this movie.\n\nFor starters, Empire went dark. It was the really the episode that the good guys lost and, that made it unique among, well, among just about every movie not made in the 1970s. I guess that is what made the 70s such a wonderful time for movies.\n\nWe could use a little more of that. We could use a lot more of that. We use a lot more gritty in cinema. And, we could use a lot more \"lived in\" Everything looks too clean.\n\nEmpire had that.\n\nAnd then it had that big, legendary, reveal that made all those kisses between Luke and Leia utterly wrong once the second big reveal hit in 1983...which explained that look Han gave Leia when she told him in the next installment.\n\nMoving on...\n\nWe have the Battle of Hoth, which, yeah, nerd awesomeness with kind of a WWI trench warfare v tanks feel and a WWII Evacuation of Dunkirk feel with the rebels on the run and the Empire forcing its way across the galaxy with brute strength.\n\nAnd that prolonged time on the Falcon, well, that was just brilliant for character development and, incest blocking.\n\nSo, really, honestly, there was way too much to love not to put Empire on the throne."

The settings for the entire movie are outstanding from Hoth to Cloud City. As always the score from John Williams was on point more so than ever in my opinion. The movie is set between episodes 4 and 6 doing a perfect job of not only carrying through the success of the first movie and surpassing it in my opinion but also does an amazing job of setting up episode 6 to conclude the trilogy without leaving an annoying cliffhanger at the last minute. The characters really establish themselves with more famous moments such as Han Solo's \"I know\" line towards the end of the movie and we get to see Luke's agony as he hangs from cloud city."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember watching The Empire Strikes Back when I was young and just completely loving it. Even today it remains as my favourite film in the franchise.\n\nStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back follows Luke Skywalker training more and more to become a Jedi whilst Han Solo and Princess Leia are pursued by Darth Vader.\n\nAfter A New Hope, everyone was so excited to see the next Star Wars film. It became one of the most anticipated films of the early 80s and once it finally came out, people just fell in love with it. This is the best Star Wars film to date and here's why.\n\nFirst of all the camerawork in this movie is absolutely excellent. RIP Irvin Kershner, you did a great job. The special effects definitely evolved since Episode IV as they look really good. It's astounding to think that this movie came out in 1980 because how beautiful the set design and effects were. Whilst A New Hope didn't have many fight sequences, this one has plenty and the action scenes are extremely entertaining to watch that keep the adrenaline flowing.\n\nApart from all the positives mentioned, the area where this film shines is its characters. The acting by everyone was superb once again. Writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote a beautiful script as we learn more about each of our beloved characters. The chemistry between Leia and Solo is fantastic and quite funny at times. We learn a lot about Luke's past and his relation to Vader which makes up for a great conflict between the two. If you thought Darth Vader was evil in the previous film, wait till you see how menacing he becomes in The Empire Strikes Back. This film also gave us YODA which was an absolute treat.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars film and I don't think any other film can reach its level. The film is well paced alongside some incredible action sequences that keep the intensity going. Our heroes are given a lot of depth which makes us root for them and care about them throughout and the villains have never been so menacing. The Empire Strikes Back is a classic and will remain a classic for a very long time."

        "review_title": "Difficult to see all the fuss and love nowadays as much as those present for its inauguration did.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Good lord, what spell does George Lucas have everyone under? This is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. Perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the Internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. Although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays.\n\nMaybe it's futile criticising it now, but at the end of the day, it's still just a film. Perhaps you really did have to be there on opening night with no knowledge of what awaited you, preparing yourself to be propelled into a world of monsters, space travel and aliens as you left your brain at the door. But I do think most people rate the film based on childhood experiences more than the film itself \u0096 they don't ask themselves the question 'How good was the film?', they ask themselves 'How happy was I as a kid when I first saw this?'.\n\nFor the record, I liked the previous episode. I thought it was good fun and relatively light-hearted with a sense of vision going for it throughout. You really believed Lucas had an idea and desperately wanted to follow through on his vision. This twinned with the scope of ideas to do with space travel and the structuring of space stations, look of attire and general mise-en-scene enforces the evidence Lucas loved an idea to the point it was an obsession, an obsession he let everyone else into and love in equal measure.\n\nAlas, Episode V entitled 'The Empire Strikes Back' from 1980 is actually quite silly and removes any feeling or excitement the prior episode may have instilled into one. Its overall idea is that the young and upcoming hero in Luke Skywalker (Hamill) is to go off and train to take his skills to the next level and become a Jedi whilst friends Han Solo (Ford) and co. are chased down by the evil forces led by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones).\n\n'Fine' you think, this may well be more interesting now that the introductions and general establishment of good versus evil has been dealt with; there also seems to be a self discovery journey going on. But if anything, the film is less interesting than the first one, particularly after about an hour after which it transcends into a bunch of slightly interesting scenes set on space ships and odd jungle infested planets. Once all that has happened, Vader gets some hired guns to find the rebels and more stuff happens that just has you passively sit there and watch it all unfold.\n\nMaybe it's that I cannot just let myself go, but I had no problem with the 1st and 4th episodes in terms of narrative, which were actually quite interesting as this broad and quite epic setting was used to transfer good and evil across a galaxy. In this one, there doesn't feel like anything at stake. The film's protagonist Luke is safe and sound on a jungle planet with Yoda, being taught what he needs to know, so he's fine, whereas Solo and co. are hopping around trying to dodge the forces of evil and the problem is you never feel any connection to them. Why should you feel any towards an annoying, big, hairy creature; daft comic relief robots and an underdeveloped, expressionless and somewhat empty headed woman who goes by the name Leia (Fisher).\n\nBut these things are the bigger picture. The film has all number of frustrations going on at spaced intervals. Of course, Solo and co. never get hit by any of the laser beams and they can hide in that meteor storm nice and easily but again, criticising it seems futile. One thing I noticed on several occasions was that everyone in the Millennium Falcon kept talking over each other, which also annoyed me and the heavy handed catalyst which pushes Luke off into his training with Yoda is a near death experience on ice planet Hoth, during which he nearly freezes to death amongst being eaten.\n\nTowards the end of the film, Luke will be having a showdown with Vader after which a famous line is uttered. All well and good but Luke doesn't go down into the bowels to fight Vader because it's the realistic choice, he goes down there because we want him to \u0096 we want him to fight and the story demands he put his new Jedi skills into practice so that all can see how much he's really learnt. This is after the film goes needlessly 'dark' for one scene involving the freezing/supposed death of a main character and no, the film is 'dark' for that one scene; not from the start and throughout, it's still that laser dodging, fast talking, monster eliminating 'fun' the prior film was. All in all, The Empire Strikes Back is underwhelming and viewing it now makes it seems quite silly more than anything. Perhaps proof 'event cinema' can and never will withstand the true test of time."

The characters were barely 2 dimensional , the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy . Episode V was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isn't close to being good.

First of all, the acting in this film is amazing, People who watched the film didn't know that actually most of Harrison Ford's lines were improvised, which is awesome. Carrie Fisher as Leia was great, especially when she talks to Ford, Frank Oz as Yoda is great, way better than CGI Yoda from the prequels. Luke as the hero was great, but I like how they show Luke as the hero, but he still loses, which brings me to Darth Vader. He is by far one of the best villains of all movie history, he is menacing, mysterious, then when he tells Luke, \"I am your father\", that completely changes how we first watched A New Hope. Effects are good for that time, also two others characters that I need to mention are Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian, these two characters really showed me that this is such a great movie franchise, Lando with huge charisma, and Boba being silent badass, so out of ten I would give this incredible movie a 10/10.

Overall even though it was made in the 80's it was still captivating to a boy used to computer graphics. The absolute best part was the final lightsaber battle between Vader and Luke where... well, I won't spoil it for those who haven't heard the line."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although called \"Episode V,\" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I've always thought one of the better entries in the series.\n\nIf you watch the first Star Wars and then this one, you'll immediately see a vast improvement in the special-effects department. There is a much more polished look to this one, and improved sound In fact, the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.\n\nWhile the first Star Wars was a bit subdued, this one picks up the action right from the start, although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out, and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer's interest with other things.\n\nThe second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved, and \"Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.\n\nSome of the movie's dialog is still corny, especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship, but it's not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from \"Chewbacca,\" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The \"Rambo\" action continues as it did in the first film, with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous, but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film, overall, delivers another interesting adventure, far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one, which was even better."

The scripts is way better developing the story, the characters and their relationships, and even connecting all the subplots to the main plot at the end. The dialogue is still not great, but that was to be expected.\n\nPlus? We are introduced in much more detail to \"The Force\", expands the Universe to places beyond \"The Rebels\" and \"The Empire\", the score is still awesome and the action gets more diverse and less repetetive (although, it can get a bit boring here and there, it's not even close to the first one).

But careful examination tells all - by every conceivable measure this is a better picture. The characters are more fully developed, Vader is even more evil, the score gives us the chilling Vader theme and the story is more interesting. Now that the six films are complete, The Empire Strikes Back is even more compelling and interesting than it was before we knew its Big Secret.\n\nAll great heroes are flawed, and Luke Skywalker is no exception. Empire reveals to us in full that the inner battle he will have to fight is worse than any enemy he will face. As we meet for the first time Yoda, the wise Jedi master (we find out in Sith why he is on this jungle planet), we learn what a Jedi is, what his responsibility is and just how difficult that life will be. Luke, however, wants immediate gratification - he wants to help and wants revenge.\n\nThe film cuts back and forth between Han Solo and Leia's pursuit by Vader and Luke's training and ultimately leads to the greatest scene of the six films, the epic light saber battle between Luke and Vader. And, if you are one of the 12 people on the planet who do not know the outcome, the less said the better.\n\nEmpire rightly holds a place in the IMDb top 10, combining Action-Adventure, space opera and even the best elements of a super-hero film, into an infinitely watchable, entertaining movie. **** out of ****."

While the original film has grown somewhat dated in appearance, and Return of the Jedi feels a bit silly now, Empire has maintained remarkable staying power. The effects in the film feel as fresh now as they did in 1980, and as importantly the story and tone of the film still hold an ominous feel and lend the series the grandeur that made it so lasting. Without Empire, Star Wars would have been remembered but not nearly in the same way. Everything that was begun in Star Wars was expanded and improved upon here, right down to the score Remember, this was the movie that introduced the now-famous and ridiculously overplayed Imperial March composed by John Williams. And virtually every scene is now iconic--the Imperial Walkers in the snow, Luke's training in the swamp, the asteroid field chase of the Millennium Falcon, the Cloud City, Luke's lightsaber battle with Vader. When I think of \"Star Wars\", most of the images that come to mind first are from Empire. The colors and textures of the film are so sharp and rich.\n\nA truly majestic film. One of the great visual statements in the history of movies, and one of the most successful realizations of a movie vision we will ever see."

When New hope was a happy and bright movie, Empire strikes back was dark and not afraid to do something new and dark. Also this is the first movie that Yoda is in. Special affect in this film is amazing during the 1980s, everything that happens in space is amazing and the practical affect in this film is gg.

The first star wars movie was a feat in special effects and something quite new. The Empire Strikes back, however, drew us into a new world with an amazing conviction. We were all so very much standing next to Luke and Han, so that they have almost helped share their world with us, but also influence popular culture today in a somewhat surrealistic concept, where the actors/actresses step out of the TV/silver screen and dictate the 'real' world, using their 'fantasy' world to justify for their candor - in an almost 'emperor's new clothes' fashion. Only the greatest movies have the ability to enmesh reality and the fiction on the screen. Lord of the Rings did it, Hitchcock did it, and Lucas did it! Lucas made us believe in a world far away, long long time ago, which any other creator would have made seem like another Star Trek or Stargate episode (like the prequels)."

The acting, led by the charismatic trio of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher, is a lightsaber duel of emotions. Film editing propels the narrative at lightspeed, seamlessly transitioning between Hoth's icy plains and the swamps of Dagobah. The strength lies in the darker, more mature tone, expanding the saga beyond the binary of good and evil. Weaknesses? The romantic subplot might be as clunky as C-3PO on an Ewok dance floor, but it's a minor quibble in the grand scheme. The music, John Williams' masterpiece, is the Force that binds the scenes together, from the Imperial March to Yoda's Theme. Cinematography captures the vastness of space and the intimacy of lightsaber duels, creating a visual odyssey through the galaxy. The message? A tale of loss, redemption, and the resilience of hope in the face of Imperial tyranny. 7/10 is a blast from the past that still holds its intergalactic charm, a Star Wars episode that's both iconic and imperfect, like an old friend you're happy to revisit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Back in the 80's, people were very excited for the release of The Empire Strikes Back, the much-awaited sequel to the phenomenal Star Wars. But, I can imagine, they were also wondering if it would be as good as Star Wars. No, it's not. It's much better. There's more action, the characters become richer and we are introduced to new ones. Thankfully, Lucas backed down in directing and/or writing the film.\n\nConsidered as the best film among the Trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back starts with the whole gang staying at a Rebel base in the ice planet of Hoth. After almost getting mauled by a Wampa Beast, Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan Kenobi to go to the Planet of Dagobah and look for a Jedi Master named Yoda. The Imperial Army arrives and tries to destroy the base, but the Rebels have already escaped, with Luke accompanied by R2-D2 goes to Dagobah. The Battle of Hoth is easily my favorite action scene in the whole Trilogy.\n\nWhile Han, Leia and Chewbacca are hiding from the Imperial army that's chasing them, Luke meets the 800 year-old Jedi Master Yoda. Full of wisdom and a funny way of talking, Yoda trains Luke to be a real Jedi and teaches him the ways of a Jedi. Almost nothing happens in the middle of the film, except for great character development and lots of intelligent dialogue. It manages to keep us interested and excited without having too many action scenes. We get to know more about all the characters, including the villains and new characters that we are introduced to.\n\nWe then meet Lando Calrissian who lives in Bespin, a city that floats among the clouds. Lucas hardly touched this masterpiece, but he still added some more striking visuals, most of which aren't unnecessary. More windows are added to the buildings in Bespin, adding lot more light and life to the settings. The visuals added aren't a bother anymore, and for once probably made a scene look better.\n\nHan and Leia don't trust Lando, to which we soon find out that they were right about their feelings toward him. Luke forsees that they're in trouble and goes to make sure that they're all right. As Han Solo is about to be frozen, Leia finally admits to Han that she loves her. To which Han replies with, \"I know.\" It's an incredibly touching and emotional scene, where things are just about to get worse.\n\nAs Luke arrives at Bespin, he encounters Darth Vader, to which father and son fight. Quite possibly the best Lightsaber fight in all the Star Wars films, the scene is filled with so much emotion and a shocking revelation. Luke sacrifices his own life rather than join the dark side, and is saved by Leia and Chewbacca, along with Lando, after much threats from Chewy. The film ends on such a downbeat note, keeping a cliffhanger for the final movie in the Trilogy.\n\nThe characters have yet to face another adventure, and learn more from each other as the Imperial is yet to be beaten and Solo to be rescued. It's not a happy ending, or should I say, a beginning for the characters as what the future holds from them is yet to be known. It shouldn't be a suprrise from anyone that The Empire Strikes Back is considered by many as the best of the Trilogy, because the film is a great stepping-stone for the characters we've grown to love in the first film and introduces us to new ones that we easily grow to love and care for. That's what makes Star Wars a great Trilogy in the first place: it's the characters we remember. Not the visuals.\n\n10"

It is so dark in theme it almost enters horror flick territory and that is brilliance in and of itself to go from one extreme to the other so fluidly and poetically. It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just didn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool suspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's budding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering \"the world is not flat it's round\" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas wrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing maniacally and saying \"Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two billion light years!\" or crying with joy all the while with the one idea that \"This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the end of time and even after that.\" As Hamill said so eloquently, \"In the Empire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has problems, they turned Han into a coffee table!\" I must also include Silent Bob's quote \"She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I know'.\" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the audience. They must have been more stunned than people leaving the theaters after seeing the Exorcist for the first time. It was pure 100% movie magic and worthy of the original in every aspect."

        "review_detailed_main": "George Lucas' 'Star Wars' trilogy is the greatest fantasy story in all of film history. Yes, even better than the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'Lord of the Rings' is fine work but the characters aren't as well developed as in 'Star Wars' and they are too long. Also, each 'Star Wars' film stands out better than each 'Lord of the Rings' film. Three chapters in 'Lord of the Rings' is one big movie while 'Star Wars' is a space western, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a dark, attractive and Gothic work of art and 'Return of the Jedi' is like a Disney film. Each has their own personality. As far as trilogies go altogether, 'The Godfather' films will always be the greatest in movie history'.\n\nI love 'The Empire Strikes Back' but I can't go along with the assertion that it is better than 'Star Wars'. I was one of those people that saw 'Star Wars' every weekend for a year when I was 11 and 12 years when a child's admission was only 50 cents to a dollar. There was such a magnificent freshness to 'Star Wars' that audiences couldn't get enough and when adjusted for inflation, 'Star Wars' is the second biggest box office film is history, second only to 1939's 'Gone with the Wind'. Meaning that these two films sold the most tickets in motion picture history.\n\n'Star Wars' even created the entire concept of the modern day blockbuster and influenced hundreds of films after it, is the biggest movie in the history of popular culture and created a new religion. A recent poll in Britain asked people to identify their religion and a substantial portion of them wrote in \"Jedi Knight\".\n\n'The Empire Strikes Back' does advance the story line forward greatly, has a convincing and blossoming love story between Han Solo and Pricess Leia and gives us the showdown we want. It also introduces us to the legendary Yoda and a new key player in Lando Calrissian and has some breath taking special effects. But 'The Empire Strikes Back' owes its success to 'Star Wars' but has to be given credit for the fact that it teaches people, especially the young, that the good guys don't always win and that the fight for what's right sometimes seems impossible."

        "review_title": "The darkest and best of the original trilogy",
        "review_detailed_main": "One of the rare sequels which manages to surpass the original, The Empire Strikes Back is an all-time classic. A much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young Luke Skywalker. A New Hope followed Skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.\n\nWe pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. All the familiar figures from last time around are here, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. And Luke Skywalker is here as well and it is Skywalker whom Darth Vader seems most interested in finding. Last time out Vader and the Empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. Now, Vader has taken a personal interest in young Skywalker. The movie kicks into high gear as the Empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. The rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions.\n\nGuided by the spirit of former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness in what is basically a cameo role) Luke Skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of Dagobah where he is to be trained by the old Jedi master Yoda. Soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, Yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. The performances of puppeteer Frank Oz as Yoda and Mark Hamill as Skywalker are crucial here. Were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young Jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. But Hamill and Oz pull it off well. On Dagobah Luke (and the audience) learn much about the Force and the ways of the Jedi. In the original film the only Jedi we saw, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. Now some light is shed on exactly who the Jedi are and what is required to become one.\n\nWhile Luke trains on Dagobah, Han Solo and Princess Leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. Harrison Ford is terrific again playing Solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. Carrie Fisher is again strong in the role of Leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling Solo. Eventually Han and Leia make their way to Cloud City where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Han and Leia don't quite trust Lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in Cloud City are not quite what they seem. Sensing his friends are in danger Luke Skywalker leaves Dagobah to attempt to rescue them.\n\nSkywalker arrives in Cloud City to meet his destiny. Han, Leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about Luke Skywalker. Where the original Star Wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film.\n\nSome will say the ending of The Empire Strikes Back leaves the audience hanging. It is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. But the ending here is powerful in its own way. It leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. The film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. It is by not going for the easy Hollywood ending that The Empire Strikes Back truly triumphs.\n\nTaken on its own merits The Empire Strikes Back can be said to even surpass the original Star Wars. The acting performances are again first-rate. Yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. In playing Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. Or against, we're not quite sure. The John Williams score, including the famed spine-chilling Imperial March, is magnificent. The visuals are dazzling, as would be expected. And most importantly we have a truly great story. The Empire Strikes Back, much more so than A New Hope, is Luke Skywalker's movie. It is fascinating to watch his journey as he moves towards fulfilling his ultimate destiny."

How could the original be surpassed? Three years (and a lot of cash) had, of course, given the film-makers the opportunity to develop the special effects technology far beyond the original film. But this alone was not enough. Where Empire truly excels over it's predecessor is in the two essential fields of film storytelling-- both the plot and the characters are far richer and more captivating. Why is Empire the greatest film ever made? We will never again see such a perfect blending of romance, adventure, emotion and movie magic."

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Strikes Back tells the story of the evil galactic empire attacking the hopeless rebellion after the destruction of the Death Star. One thing that I feel is worth noting right off the bat is that I don't think this film surpasses A New Hope but is ratter on the same level in terms of substance as well as quality.\n\nWhat makes this film good is that it is able to keep its focus on the characters in a universe that is so interesting as well as vast. That is something that makes the original trilogy better in my opinion because in the prequels it was focused on showing us heavily C.G.I. visuals ratter then on the characters. This is one of many factors that make the original trilogy by far the superior films. The plot is also more complex then the first of this trilogy which shows that the people involved with this project were taking risks. The characters were all likable and interesting. And the fact that they filmed at real locations shows dedication from the director Irvin Kershner.\n\nThe cons of this picture though are not minimal which leads me to feeling as though it is grossly overrated. The acting and dialogue is still hooky, the effects are showing age, the action is underwhelming, and unfortunately the fan base that surrounds Star Wars has made it difficult to watch Empire as it was intended. The story although complex is occasionally driven forward by plot convinces. And although I did not see this infamous twist coming, I also was not all that wowed.\n\nIn conclusion The Empire Strikes Back is complex and has relatable characters which is able to drive this picture forward as well as be entertaining. And I'm giving this one a 6/10."

It took many dark turns that nobody at the time saw coming, it didn't use the same elements that the previous movie used and it felt like we were exploring the galaxy a lot more than we did in the last film.\n\nIf I have to pick where to put this on my Star Wars rank list, it'd be on the top three, just not sure where in the three spots.\n\nThe romance part of the film works really well with Leia and Han. Sure, the age gap between Carrie and Harrison was a bit awkward, but they somehow made it work great for the franchise and became one of the best couples ever.\n\nThe reveal of Vader being the father wasn't a surprise to me when I first watched it, because I started watching the franchise with the prequels first in 2006 and knew what was happening.\n\nAnd I know this is going to cause a debate, but I think Yoda is a Muppet. It's not because of Frank Oz performing him, but it's because he feels like one to me. I feel like the Jim Henson company helped a little bit making him and there was an episode of Muppet Show where Luke, Chewie, R2 and 3PO was in and to me, that was a deal that Lucas and Henson made as a fair enough collab as a team. There's even some behind the scenes pictures that Jim, Kermit and Piggy were in. Think about that for a few minutes.\n\nThis is without a doubt, one of the best sequels that was ever made and will always be forever. The force has always been strong with the franchise and fandom, and will forever more."

As everyone knows, this George Lucas directed film, was a huge box office smash, becoming the highest grossing movie of all time. It still held the record in 1980, thus giving the green-light for Lucas to develop a trilogy of films.

Some number two films in a trilogy, are susceptible to taxing pacing, caused by the need to be a set-up for the big finale in the third film. If done correctly, the film can be a successful bridge-film, while still completing its goal of being an exciting entry in the trilogy. This film accomplishes the goal of being an exciting adventure, full of maturing characters and it comes with a more darker side to it. It also successfully bridges the gap to the third film, Return of the Jedi (1983). It creates major implications for the main cast of characters. It is a cliff-hanger of a story.\n\nGeorge Lucas stepped aside as the director for this film, for director Irvin Kershner. Kershner creates a slick, exciting, action-packed adventure, full of dazzle, flare and artistry. It has one of the most incredible soundtracks ever, thanks to legendary composer John Williams. It is pure pleasure watching this film. It is the stuff of legends now. It is still hailed as being the best Star Wars movie ever. The film starts with the main cast together, but splits them up into two stories, that carries the film to the end, eventually bringing them together again, but with a price. The first sub-plot involves Luke (Mark Hamill), meeting the Muppet-like, Jedi master, Yoda (Frank Oz), who begins training Luke to be a Jedi. The other sub-plot involves Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), being chased by Darth Vader (Peter Mayhew/James Earl Jones) and enlisting the aid of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), the leader of Cloud City. The stage is set for one of the biggest cliff-hangers in film history.\n\n9.3 (A Mygrade) = 9 IMDB."

        "review_detailed_main": "Arguably the best film from the original trilogy (and entire Star Wars saga), The Empire Strikes Back strikes a more mature tone than it's predecessor; still fantastical and exploring a labyrinth of imagination that you could get lost in, but delving deeper into the mysticism of the force and division between good and evil.\n\nSome of the most famous quotes and scenes in cinema history are found within these two hours, influential and replicated or parodied countless times. It's difficult to find someone not aware of the film's 'twist', even if they haven't seen the film, and that cultural impact shows what a behemoth this film is. The storytelling takes an almighty step forward with these plot points, keeping the story engrossing and well paced.\n\nEmpire sees the introduction of some of the most recognisable characters in media; fan favourites who's mannerisms and qualities endure beyond the film. Without losing any of the core characters from A New Hope, these new characters are integrated well, having meaningful contributions to the story and wider context, without overwhelming screentime.\n\nRelationships develop tenfold, creating more chemistry between all the characters, new and old. Whilst more apparent arcs of friendship, romance, and betrayal flourish, smaller interactions between less noticeable relationships show the evolution off screen - such as Chewbacca and C3PO. Leia in particular is given the opportunity to stamp her personality in the film, even more so than previously - an excellent character leading the way instead of falling into the royal category of damsel in distress.\n\nOnce again, the settings as magnificent, none more so than the original locations in the likes of Hoth and Dagobah. Cloud CIty benefits from Lucas' later edits, but these built sets create such an atmosphere. These are supported by the costuming, props and puppetry, which are as iconic as the heroes utilising them.\n\nThe soundtrack is still excellent and transitions the story between scenes so well. Overall, the whole film is a little more seamless, and it is the perfect film building upon an unbeatable foundation."

        "review_detailed_main": "The momentum throughout the largely-adored Star Wars instalment isn't exactly energetic enough to win against A New Hope. So overall, it's a very well-constructed sequel that continues with the epic sci-fi action, but is mainly disappointing.\n\nThe new director, Irvin Kershner, definitely builds onto George Lucas's original and clever direction. The force, the explosive effects, the appealing battles and the cool robots are all brought back, except they're not as fascinating this time... The real flaw is the exceedingly unhurried pace, and it manages to coat all the creativity.\n\nAlthough The Empire Strikes Back leaves off with a reasonably satisfying touch, it fails to leave you excited for the next movie. It's a likeable flick worth experiencing in the cinema, but it's adored a little too highly. But still, there's absolutely no doubt that the big fans of the series will love it.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

        "review_title": "Grossly overrated",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all. It has no structure, no dialogue, no screenplay, a threadbare story, but one that is not told because of non-existent direction, etc. It continues where the original left off, and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story, or develop characters, relationships, etc. The makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didn't bother with it. Of course, that's all right. I don't have any problem with that. But what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this \"film\" from almost every quarter \u2013 from viewers and critics alike. On this board it's being rated as the 17th best movie of all time. I've consulted quite a few film guides, and they all tag maximum, or near maximum, stars to this film. Even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. What is going on? Of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. The first film was both good and a milestone. Not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. It was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. The \"Force\" embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. It is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. Spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. When this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of \"new hope\". And to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. There is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age. And with all this going, Star Wars rightly became a tremendous hit, and the focus of fanatic devotion. It was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base, as long as it didn't spoil the original. Empire doesn't spoil the original. It not only continues the war between good and evil, it does so with more spectacle, more aplomb, more special effects.\n\nWhen people say they like Empire, what I think they really mean is that thy like Star Wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping. Because Empire is nothing but embellishment. They're not judging the film itself. The ideal situation would have been if Star Wars remained as a standalone fairy tale. Fairy tales end, and they leave us with the aura of \"happily ever after\". They don't go on and on and become sagas, and if they did that would totally destroy the aura. Empire is the first mistaken step towards saga, and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth. There is nothing else to be told, and that's why the film is so bad. One boring battle joined to another boring battle, and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever. The strain tells. Everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do. The third film, The Return of the Jedi, redeems itself by trying to finish a story. The prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background. But Empire is caught in no man's land. It is bad, and it should be exposed as such. All this pretending isn't healthy, I don't think."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a galaxy far, far away, there exists a cinematic gem that has stood the test of time, capturing the hearts and minds of fans across generations. I am referring to none other than \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\" Words alone cannot express the sheer brilliance and captivating nature of this film, but I shall endeavor to do justice to its incredible impact.\n\nFrom the very moment the iconic opening crawl graces the screen, accompanied by John Williams' majestic score, you are transported into an unparalleled universe filled with rich storytelling and unforgettable characters. Director Irvin Kershner masterfully expands upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, delivering a film that sets the gold standard for sci-fi fantasy adventures.\n\nFirst and foremost, the character development in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is nothing short of extraordinary. We witness the growth and transformation of our beloved heroes, as well as the introduction of new faces who have become indelible figures in popular culture. Luke Skywalker's journey toward becoming a Jedi Knight is rife with inner conflict and self-discovery, a testament to Mark Hamill's exceptional acting prowess.\n\nThe character dynamics are also expertly woven together. The unforgettable banter between Han Solo and Princess Leia provides a delightful mixture of wit, charm, and undeniable chemistry. Their captivating romance adds an extra layer of depth and emotion to the film, allowing viewers to become fully invested in their captivating love story.\n\nOne cannot discuss \"The Empire Strikes Back\" without mentioning the iconic and menacing presence of Darth Vader. Portrayed by the legendary David Prowse and voiced by the iconic James Earl Jones, Vader transcends the realm of villains, becoming an archetype for the ages. His powerful presence and the revelation that shocks audiences to this day have forever solidified him as one of cinema's greatest antagonists.\n\nThe film's technical achievements are breathtaking. The groundbreaking visual effects and stunning set designs transport us to the frozen planet of Hoth, the lush swamps of Dagobah, and the magnificent Cloud City of Bespin. The Battle of Hoth alone is a masterpiece, showcasing the epic scope of the Star Wars universe and leaving audiences in awe of its grandeur.\n\nFurthermore, the film's screenplay, penned by the legendary Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, is a triumph. It seamlessly combines moments of intense action with deep emotional resonance. From Yoda's wise teachings to the dramatic revelation on Cloud City, the script expertly balances light and dark, creating a narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.\n\nOf course, the score composed by John Williams deserves a standing ovation. It elevates every scene, stirring emotions and building suspense with its iconic themes. The Imperial March, which made its debut in this film, has become synonymous with the power and might of the Empire and is instantly recognizable to fans worldwide.\n\n\"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\" is a monumental achievement in filmmaking, setting a standard that many have aspired to but few have reached. Its influence on popular culture is immeasurable, and its impact on the art of storytelling is undeniable. Even after all these years, it continues to captivate and inspire new generations, cementing its status as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Its compelling characters, gripping storyline, stunning visuals, and unforgettable music come together to create an experience that transcends the boundaries of cinema. It is a timeless treasure that will continue to awe and inspire for generations to come. May the Force be with you as you embark on this extraordinary journey into the heart of the Star Wars saga."

And Han Solo's \"I know\" is so to character, keeping that arrogant and boastful persona as he would. The use of the force is the epitome of subtlety as it creates this beautiful living organism. It's a cinematic masterpiece: where the CGI might not hold up today, the cinematography certainly does, clearly inspiring movies to come. Obviously it's one of the greatest action movies, let alone movies in total. For some reason I prefer A New Hope"

Luke Skywalker is a w***er who is supposed to be a jedi knight, but instead he needs to be rescued all the time. I wouldn't have cared less if he had crashed in his plane, had been eaten by that snowmonster, had frozen to death, he got shot by the ATATs, if his father had killed him, or he had fallen of that tower. The music score is well composed, though I think a classical symphony isn't very suitable for a sci-fi movie. I believe they should have used synthetic music to create the right atmosphere. On the other hand the effects and sceneries are very impressive. Unbelieve what effort George and his guys have done!"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, this is not just my all-time favourite sequel but my all-time favourite film. It thoroughly deserves that title because I consider it nothing less than a masterpiece. It takes everything great about the original and simply improves on it, a task many would've seemed to be impossible.\n\nWith Irvin Kershner taking the reigns of director, from George Lucas, the film goes into a not necessarily darker tone but more mature. With A New Hope being a more light-hearted, but no less iconic, space opera this change puts more focus on the emotions of the characters we have met and, in turn, raises the stakes for heroes, especially Luke who must now face his foe.\n\nHarrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill maintain the effortless portrayal of their respective characters from the first film. The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando is simply brilliant as he too fully embodies his role and bounces off Harrison Ford's Han Solo. Another introduction is that of Yoda (operated by Frank Oz) that adds to the mystery of 'The Jedi' and 'The Force' as this character is just overloaded with so much wisdom and is used so well to build Luke's character throughout the film.\n\n'Empire' contains possibly one of the most memorable line's in of all cinema; those who have seen this know exactly what I mean. However, it far from relies on this moment as there are a countless number of iconic moments and dialogue.\n\nThe visual effects of the 1977 release of Star Wars may have been ground-breaking but this film shows how far the industry has come in 3 years. Whether this be the representation of Cloud City, the Walker Assault or even as simple as shots of the Falcon flying. These may seem easy enough to manufacture in 2020 but must have been incredible to see in 1980. I am simply gutted I wasn't able to experience that wonder myself.\n\nJohn Williams again excels at what he does. He is extra-ordinarily consistent in his quality, and not just in this franchise. He truly sends these films into the history books and is one of the many reasons Star Wars, Empire especially, is still so loved today.\n\nEmpire Strikes Back is truly the heart of this trilogy and is unquestionable in its quality. The Story is unforgettable and the film-making is sublime. I only have two words for those involved in its production: Thank You!"

The other problem is that it just stops abruptly, relying too much on the sequel to clean up the loose ends. The dialog is amateurish and there is too much emphasis on special effects. Yoda is cute but Chewbacca and R2-D2 become increasingly annoying with the silly noises they make."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is the continuation of the story of the first. The war between the rebels and the Empire continues, while Darth Vader Luke demand throughout the galaxy. Directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, this film has the participation of the same actors from the first film.\n\nThe film inherits most of the qualities of his predecessor. It has a carefully chosen cast and consistent performances, with some emphasis on the work of Harrison Ford, actor who was already highlighted in the first film and now consolidates his success. Action scenes are excellent, thought of meticulous way and the fight scenes with lightsaber remind us some great duels of piracy and swashbuckling films. The special visual and sound effects are the best that existed at the time and fulfill their role with great merit. The only difference between this film and the latest films of the saga is, in fact, this technical issue, given the huge advance that, in a few decades, the techniques and special effects achieved. The soundtrack was again in charge of John Williams, which continues the excellent work started in the first film of the saga. In fact, the first main theme of the chords of the saga became one of the songs that instinctively comes to mind of people when they think of film music, the same way as the \"March of Darth Vader\" has become one of most songs instinctively associated with the image of any movie villain. The point of greatest merit of this movie is the script. It is a deeper script, more psychological and intense than the script of the first film, and this contributed decisively to the success of it, and the franchise itself. Oscar winner for Best Sound, is one of the most popular films of the saga in the present day."

        "review_title": "The sequel to the groundbreaking Star Wars revisits everything that worked the first time while upping the stakes and refining the rough spots.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Following the events of the last film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew),Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), their droids R2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and the rest of the rebel alliance have been driven into hiding on the ice planet Hoth after their destruction of the Death Star. Darth Vader(physical: David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) continues his search for Skywalker and eventually finds the rebel base with the rebel forces forced to retreat and Luke is separated while Han and the others attempt to elude pursuit of the Empire. Luke travels to the Dagobah system at the direction of his deceased master Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) and directs Luke to locate his former master Yoda. As Luke dives deeper into the teachings of the Jedi and The Force, Luke's friends will face a danger that will force Luke to make a choice that could lead him to the Dark Side and discover revelations that challenge everything he's learned.\n\nGeorge Lucas had always planned to expand Star Wars even if the first film proved unsuccessful down to contracting author Alan Dean Foster who wrote the novelization of Star Wars to write a limited location sequel novel that could be adapted on a low budget released as Splinter of the Mind's Eye. When Star Wars broke Box Office Records, Lucas reappraised his approach to the sequel leaving the Foster adaptation as novel (which became a success in its own right and the start of the Expanded Universe) and proceeding to plan a much more ambitious sequel. Lucas having felt the strain of directing Star Wars opted to take a role as Executive Producer and instead handed the reins to Irvin Kershner. The script received a lot of input from multiple parties as Lucas had many different ideas on how to approach the subject of Luke's father (who was not yet the reveal we know), Luke's sister (also originally a new character), and expanded roles for the Galactic Emperor and other planets which weren't deemed feasible. The script was given multiple passes by several writers including notably Lawrence Kasdan who had impressed Lucas with his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark. Upon initial release some critics were mixed in the darker tone from the original film with some outright lambasting the film, but overtime The Empire Strikes Back has been re-evaluated as not just the best film in the series, but one of the best sequels of all time.\n\nFrom the movie's introduction, it makes it clear to the audience that while the destruction of the Death Star was a victory slowing the threat of the Empire, it didn't stop them as the Rebels are forced to hide on the desolate ice planet of Hoth while Vader searches the galaxy intent on finding Luke. The harshness of the ice world is a fantastic setup with its bitter and inhospitable cold serving as a nice counterpoint to the original desert planet we saw in Star Wars and gives us the feeling of a new and unfamiliar place we've not yet explored. The characters also feel like they've advanced with Luke Skywalker carrying a more hardened demeanor in contrast to the fresh faced youth we were introduced to him as and Han and Leia have both advanced with the two developing a relationship and Han having become less cynical and self-serving as a character. The movie keeps itself mostly pretty simple with Luke embarking on a journey of self-discovery with Jedi master Yoda voiced and puppeted by Frank Oz and the character is a solid mixture of quirky, weird, and wise that makes him a unique mentor figure for Luke to play off against. The action scenes have also been expanded upon with a larger scale and more ambitious effects with the Battle of Hoth sequence featuring some great computer assisted Stop Motion to bring to life walking battle tanks called \"Walkers\" that look amazing in motion as well as destruction. We also get Billy Dee Williams as Han's former friend Lando who plays the role with the same cocky swagger as Han but still gives his own spin on it and gets some good moments in the film as a character. Darth Vader remains a solid antagonist in the film with his menace dialed up as the primary antagonist this time around, but also some solid revelations that are now famous (you know what I'm talking about) and some terrific pitch black humor of Darth Vader \"promoting\" various officers to Admiral after the previous one failed him.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back is a great film in its own right and one of the best sequels of all time. The characters you loved the first time around are expanded upon and revisited and the world is made to feel alive and bigger with new environments and world building that make the film an engaging sit even when you know what's coming."

The 2nd Star Wars film takes the original cast and subjects them to 2 hours of major discomfort...A forbidding icy planet replete with nasty creatures. There are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding out in the depths of asteroid fields, and Luke's foray into the black swamp of the Degobah system. It's a more taut, curiously downbeat film that slows almost to a halt in places, as Luke meets the Jedi Master who will teach him the ways of the force. The set pieces more than make up for the lack of pace...The opening battle on the Ice planet is a visually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as cool when they don their winter outfits. The asteroid chase and cloud city sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious heart of the Star Wars Universe. The character development glues everything together. Luke's maturing process in the darkness of Degobah..Han and Leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and interplay with Chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes a team spirit that was coming together at the end of Episode IV. The centrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between Luke and Vader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of Cinema's all time memorable moments. And it's a great sequence, from Vader's sobering welcome 'The force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. The forces of darkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling that the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. There is an underlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..Vader is never as beautifully evil as he is in Empire. We finally see just why he is (Emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to his own generals in ruthless fashion. We get some great new characters...Han's old buddy Lando Calrissien (sp?) is the slimy administrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation, and there's the legendary Boba Fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel, and an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a Star Wars icon. And of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of his malevolance. Any faults? It's hard to find much complaint. Some of the dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the curious but necessary Degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the parts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the most deliciously dark of all Star Wars movies, and the most mature. Classic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough memorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema history."

        "review_detailed_main": "When talking about The Empire Strikes Back many people have commented on how dark it is in comparison to the other two films from the original trilogy. However as was expected by Star Wars fans, Revenge of the Sith without a doubt took the title of Darkest Star Wars movie from Empire's mantle. Given the galactic scale of tragedy in the final prequel, Empire's personal tragedy reveals itself to be a little self-absorbed. In the post-prequel Star Wars paradigm, we should be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel in the final revelations of Empire.\n\nWith the issue of darkness settled, the Star Wars audience and the movie-going public should now be able to see The Empire Strikes Back for what it is. The best Star Wars movie. And not only is it a great Star Wars movie, but it is a great movie. The direction, the writing, and even the performances come together to make it a complete movie.\n\nWatching the movies that George Lucas has directed, specifically Star Wars: Episodes I-IV, you can tell he is not a student of the craft of acting. The result is that actors are left developing the emotional life of the characters on their own. Some actors are able to survive and even thrive in this environment. Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness give inspired performances in the original Star Wars that make some of the other performances in the movie appear worse than they actually were.\n\nGeorge Lucas responsibly tapped his professor from film school, Irvin Kershner, to direct The Empire Strikes Back, and the difference is palpable. Star Wars is without a doubt the most revolutionary in terms of Special Effects of the original trilogy. But in terms of quality movie-making, editing, cinematography, etc., Emipire takes the cake. And all the while putting together great shot after great shot, he managed to pull good performances out of most the cast. Not a single one of the primaries are flat or perform an unbelievable moment. Hamill's performance is so good you actually believe for at least a few minutes that he might stand a chance against Darth Vader.\n\nBut the quality of film-making and the emotional life of the characters would not have mattered, nor could they have possibly existed without brilliant writing. In Empire Lucas is at his myth-making best (Han's metaphoric descent into hell and Luke's journey into the Dark Cave are brilliant), and the screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden is sharp, well-paced, and energetic. As a result of this three-part collaboration, you have the rough and romantic flirtations of Han Solo and Princess Leia (in which you can hear the voice of both Brackett's earlier work, The Big Sleep and El Dorado, and Kasden's later work, The Big Chill and The Accidental Tourist). Also you have Yoda-speech when it was genuinely profound in a Confucian way, before it devolved into the gimmicky and painful form it takes in the prequels.\n\nOn the whole there is no denying that Star Wars: A New Hope is the most influential movie of the series, quite possibly of the last quarter of the twentieth century (although it would have to fight with Jaws for that title). And with the fall of Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith, it no longer can be called the darkest of the Star Wars saga. But it is, with little doubt the best movie of the series."

Now, I'm a little older and can appreciate this movie. This is the best Star Wars movie hands down. Not my favorite, but the greatest.\n\nThis takes the Star Wars saga to a whole new level with the introduction of Yoda and the fleshing out of Darth Vader. Every returning character from A New Hope is given so much more to work with and it shows. We learn more about Han's past, Luke's past, and Luke's future. The visual feel of the movie is incredible. From Bespin, the cloud city to Dagobah, the lonely hideout for Master Yoda, each one of the locations presented support the turmoiled, chill of space feel that dominates the movie.\n\nThe climax of the movie is the most memorable climax of all time. It's been alluded to more times than can be counted. It also takes the battle between good and evil from a back and white area to a shade of gray. The fact that the innocence of Luke can come from the pure evil of Darth Vader is perhaps the biggest revelation.\n\nThis is one of the best sequels of all time. Check it out.\n\n**** out of ****"

Empire succeeded where so many others failed, even in the modern trilogies. The characters are further developed, the special effects are ground breaking and the universe in which this is based is rich."

But boy was I ever wrong!!! In my opinion, I think that this is not only the best sequel, but the best movie ever made.\n\nEverthing about this movie is excellent, from the battle that's taken place on Hoth, to the climatic battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skwalker, where Luke finds out about his secret destiny.....\n\nThis movie also introduces a new character named Yoda {who is about the size of a dachshund when it stands on 2 legs}. If you were to see Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of The Clones, you would find out why people in the Star Wars universe call him \"master\". I like the way he sounds like say fozzie bear from the muppet babies and his backwards spelling like, \"Powerful jedi, was he.\"\n\nAs I said with another review about \"Return Of The Jedi\", I owe it all to George Lucas. Without him, Star Wars wouldn't have been created. Thanks George Lucas!"

If you haven't, I would definitely suggest looking up some of these documentaries in order to see what the project was actually like when it was first made. The crew and cast describes it as a lot of chaos and self-doubt until its first debut when it gained its cult following. The way that Lucas wrote and directed these films is a tribute to his true genius and success."

        "review_detailed_main": "Top of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason. It's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth battle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City, before finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and revelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han and Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect."

Billy Dee Williams is a welcome addition in a effortlessly charismatic performance. John Williams' musical score is perfect once again.

        "review_detailed_main": "It is not always possible for a sequel to re-capture the peculiar magic of an original film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' manages to do so by being less of a sequel than it is a new film on its own. The story begun in 'Star Wars' is advanced, the characters & their relationships with one another are deepened and the film itself abandons much of the easy spirit of the first film in favour of a darker and more uncertain tone. If the first film was largely about heroism, the second is largely concerned with struggle. The main characters are soundly tested in this film and for the most part, they come up short.\n\nThis is also the film that transforms Darth Vader into one of the screen's great villains. Vader was interesting in 'Star Wars,' but he is iconic in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and he rightfully takes his place as not only a great villain, but a great character. In spite of the despair that runs through the film, the visuals and imagination so apparent in 'Star Wars' returns here, as well. The film is littered with awesome action sequences and more than enough 'coolness' to measure up to its predecessor.\n\nAgain, the original (1980) version is the one to see - if given the option - although the enhancements made to this film are somewhat less invasive than those applied to 'Star Wars.' Still, the film is more charming and more polished its original release. It is considerably less delightful than its predecessor, but it is every bit as good of a film, if not even slightly superior to 'Star Wars.'"

And let's just say that I hadn't seen it in years just before I voted. And a 10 sounded so, well, unreal, especially when you should actually presume that it's the original Star Wars which deserves a 10. If one of the movies should have one. But it was this one I found right. I still do. I am sure that this is the absolutely greatest adventure movie of all time. Of all Star Wars movies. Of the Indiana Jones movies. And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series. It's so intense, its plot and subplots are perfectly intertwined, just about everything in the film is perfectly fit for its genre. This is why this movie deserves a 10."

I've seen many sequels over the years, Terminator 2, Aliens, RoboCop2, Shrek 2, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings (bare with me on those two since I know they're book series), etc. and yet none of them seem to hit the beats of the development of the characters and plot alongside the action so perfectly balanced. I don't know, my review may seem a little ramble like but it's just one of my all time favorite movies and I'm kind of at a loss of words for how to talk about it professionally."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Empire Strikes back is the best of the original trilogy, as well as being the best of the entire series. Its so good that it is on my top ten films of all time. It manages to switch between the cheery space opera tone of the original film with added darkness and despair.\n\nThe characters this time around are given much more screen time to grow and develop, being ever more three-dimensional. This depth of character is what adds to the first film and makes it so much better than the rest of the series. It shows the good and the evil, the greed and corruption and the tyranny that grows within the corners of the of the Star Wars universe.\n\nThe cinematography, score and special effects remain quite consistent, moving on from those that were present in the first film. The only exception of this is the special effects, which have been slightly spruced up since the first film.\n\nThe story itself has become a lot more brutal and unforgiving, without moving into spoilers, it fully embraces the dark side of the force and fully explores the darkest corners of its plot.\n\nIt is because of the emotions stirred in Empire that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third.This is the heart of the franchise, this is the peak. Everything that has been added and built upon from the first film is fantastic, there are no conceivable downsides to this space epic.\n\nMore Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Episode V \"The Empire Strikes Back\" released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall \"The Empire Strikes Back\" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke). Also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(Yoda) holds the saga together just great. This really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is I usually don't rank sequels over the original."

Like special effects, which were really better than in the first part (probobly because of the bigger budged). It's also better in terms of action. The sword fights were much more impressive than in first part. The starship battles were also very impressive and pretty realistic. Many new colorful and very important characters appeared in this part. What else did I liked was Darth Vader's position in this part. Here he looked more dangerous and independent than in the first part. It's a really entertaining movie and it's worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Empire Strikes Back is an example of how well done a sequel can be, it takes the series to a whole new level and is an improvement over A New Hope. The amazing thing is that this time Lucas wasn't the director. That doesn't change anything, he guided Irvin and ESB is still his creation.\n\nThis time everything is on a larger scale. The battles aren't puny and meaningless, they are actual battles. The movie starts with the battle for the icy world Hoth. From there the plot splits in 2, one being with Luke and one with the rest: Leia, Han, Chewie, 3PO and R2.\n\nWe are explained in more detail how the Force works and we see how truly powerful the Empire is. Thanks to the money Lucas earned from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back has better special effects and some splendid locations, including Hoth and Bespin.\n\nBut it's not all about battles, the love story part of the series is also developed, Luke's struggle to understand the Force and use it continues, while Vader is more determined than ever.\n\nStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a remarkable chapter of the Star Wars saga.\n\nFinal Score: 5/5 or 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Call me blasphemous, but cinematically, The Empire Strikes back is far superior to the original Star Wars. We pick up shortly after the destruction of the Death Star. The Empire has dispatched probe droids to find the rebels. One probot finds a base on the remote world of Hoth. Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best. I hope he recaptures this someday."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hoth. Yoda. Cloud City. That moment when you realize family really does matter \u0085 priceless.\n\nIndividually these words represent small facets of pop culture, making whatever the question is in Trivial Pursuit obviously \"Star Wars\", but when you put them together, in this order, the words \"Empire Strikes Back\" will inevitably fall from your mouth. The second chapter (or fifth, however you count them) in Lucas' grandiose space opera involves a frozen planet, a little green man, the force, family, and eventually a good old fashioned hand losing. (Should I have put Billy Dee Williams somewhere in there?) A personal favorite among the original three, I grapple with words because what can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens, even hundreds of times. This is a staple to my youth, a film series that I have seen over and over in no particular order. For this viewing, I went with the classic Laserdisc edition which reminded me that no amount of special effect could change the heart of the story. What can be said? What should be said? In Skywalker's famous words to Yoda, \"I can give it a try\" \u0096 we all know, by heart, what will follow next.\n\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\" is the strongest chapter in the original trilogy for three reasons. The first is that we have three subsequent chapters, each dealing with a different world, in a different galaxy far, far away. Lucas, in my eyes, has expanded his opera into more than just a desert planet, or a wooded terrain, or on a star that causes death; he grew and blossomed with this film. As audience members, we believe in each of the settings, we understand how cold it is on Hoth, we can feel the moisture on Degoba planet, and our fear of heights is prevalent in Cloud City. Lucas defines, travels, and leaves out no detail as he escapes with us through this expanding universe. Moving onto a second note, this is a darker chapter. Without repeating what so many others have said before, Lucas challenges us to escape from scene after scene of battle (albeit he does put a small dusting in) and listen to the words that his characters are telling us. He places small Easter eggs throughout that still gives us goose bumps as we watch (and understand), he hints towards the final chapter, but without really giving us the entire sandwich, just a sample. This smattering of the unknown, the final scenes where Vader reveals his journal's secret to Luke, the iconic nature of the slicing of the hand, all of this matches against any battle scene any science fiction director could create. Lucas has always been criticized for his lack of character development in his six-part series, and with Jar-Jar I can understand, but he had hit his stride with what he wanted from his leads. I could see the spark between Leia and Han, the love between Chewie and C3PO, and Yoda's Oz like abilities when he explains to Luke that the force lives in nature. Lucas is telling us, giving us the chance to see that the final battle will be a line up between Nature and Machine \u0085 get ready Ewoks. Finally, this film is the strongest because it is a victorious battle for the dark side of the force. Very rarely do movie audiences walk out of a theater and feel as if hope has been crushed on the curb. Each time I view this film, I get this child-like sensation that maybe, just maybe, Vader and the Emperor will crush this little Rebel Alliance in the final chapter and reign supreme forever. \"Empire Strikes Back\" gives you that sense of possible dark side victory, with the call of the bounty hunters, the frozen carbonate, and the loss of Skywalker's ambidextrous abilities. Think of it this way, was the Dark Side really that evil, or did they just wear black and pursue those that were unwilling to follow the law? Goth British police officers?\n\nIn all honesty, \"Empire Strikes Back\" could be re-watched at this moment. There are less big fight sequences than in \"Return of the Jedi\", and there are less moments of confusion and droid humor, \"Empire\" stands on its own because it remains an elusive, dark chapter. Our leads, those that we have given our hopes, hearts, and dreams to, have all been fooled, tricked, or captured, and it feels confined (like it is only the Millennium Falcon vs. an entire armada of Star Destroyers) in this middle chapter. You leave the theater wondering about that infamous \"Who shot J.R.?\" moment, and a desire to see the Force be victorious. To me, this middle chapter gave the Dark Side of the Force an equal opportunity to make a case for itself; \"Star Wars\" is an equal opportunity employer.\n\nObviously, I loved this film. It has been a staple, like so many others, in my youth for years and further into my adulthood. I love these characters, these worlds, the unknown, and especially Lucas' vision. Despite the criticism of the \"new\" chapters, we will always have the original to go back to in any shape or form.\n\nWithout sounding repetitive, watch this series. Introduce your children to this world(s), and allow them to grow up with the largest space opera created. Spark their imagination, and you will not be disappointed.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****"

It's weird to think that Yoda was only introduced here; he's been such a central character in the series that it's easy to forget that he didn't star in Episode 4! In some ways, watching \"TESB\", you get the feeling that the people behind the scenes realized how lucky the series was making them, and so they decided to go all out. And they do just that. They played it to good effect here (I personally thought that \"Return of the Jedi\" overdid it a little). But anyway, the Force is with this movie from start to finish!"

It no doubt took twice as much effort to make, and drew in a huger box office crowd, and in doing so The Empire Strikes Back established itself as the film that rivalled the film it followed on from.\n\nAll the main characters from the first film are back, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and lovable non humans Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, along with new addition Lando (a charismatic turn by Billy Dee Williams) a rogue pal of Han's who's now the head of his own establishment, as well of course as Yoda, the tiny green martian with wisdom who guides Luke on his way. The story's a bit too lost in names of special planets, spaceships and character names that only the most ardent sci-fi nerd is going to follow intently, but once again, the sheer spectacle and grandeur of Lucas's work over-shadows everything, a remarkable vision that still hasn't dated or staled over 25 years on.\n\nSo sit back, relax and prepare to witness the sheer scale of escapist entertainment. *****"

Also, conflict between the brave but out-gunned Rebel Alliance and the mighty Galactic Empire Spices things up. it all comes back to the myth of the hero's destiny.\n\n\"Star Wars will do very nicely for those lucky enough to be children or unlucky enough never to have grown up\" You all know what i mean. :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Any comments here refer to the theatrical release, not the pile of rubbish known as the special edition. Rick McCollum should be tracked down and given a good kick in the pants.\n\nIn your epic battles of good and evil, \"Empire Strikes Back\" pretty much takes the cake. We have everything here -- characters with depth, tragedy, romance, adventure... aliens that are believable. It has become clich\u00e9 to compare \"Star Wars\" to \"Lord of the Rings\", and that's not entirely unfair... but, really, \"Star Wars\" is better and \"Empire Strikes Back\" is the best.\n\nAs Dante Hicks says in \"Clerks\", this film is the best because it imitates life, \"a series of down endings\". Sometimes life is better than that, but it's often not. And whereas most movies want happiness, this one put Luke and Han in a bunch of bad situations with no hope of escaping unscathed. That's what makes this fantasy very much reality."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few movies I call pitch perfect. Everything is flawless- the action? Edge of your seat! The drama? Heart-wrenching and powerful! The comedy? Frequently clever and hysterical! The special effects? Better than A New Hope, and then some! As for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the theatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the original version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are perfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great character in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance by Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca, and there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the AT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of the ship battles are just as beautiful. Overall, Empire is my favorite Star Wars, and one of my favorite movies. It has everything- heart, humor, action, drama, suspense. I highly recommend you see this one(if you haven't seen it already)."

If for no other reason, the development and dramatic impact of the Darth Vader character within this film sets it apart from all the others. When Vader utters those famous five words in a battle scene, we remember them for the rest of our lives. The intensity of this film is greater than the first or third one (and far more than the latter entries). Not one, but a trio of characters, are fleshed out in this film more than in any other Star Wars entry. Obiwan, Luke, and Vader all have great character development. The music is outstanding, the cinematography is outrageously good, and the script is more sophisticated than the first entry. Don't miss the best of the Stars Wars films.\n\nWhat idiots thought that Pulp Fiction or Fight Club were better films than this one? There are probably 99 out of 100 people who think this film is better."

But I cannot understand exactly why it is in such a special place compared to other Star Wars movies. Regarding the very famous twist at the end, I think that was not a striking part for me. At this point we do not know many details and background of Star Wars and its characters. There are no by-products. We have not delved deeply into its world. It's a mystery to me why our minds should be blown away by that famous twist. The Falcon side is all about repair and escape. I really don't understand what puts this movie above other movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rating: 9.7 Overall, a brilliant movie that really builds on where the last movie left off and improves on it in so many ways to make it a very memorable film that is not only the best in the series but in film history as we see a more mature Star Wars in the characters that take part in it.\n\nGreat Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredible managed and executed, and this movie is a definite improvement in directing people than its predecessor as the director was really able to get more out of his actors in their performances for this time around), Very Good to Great Acting (Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (showed the progress he has made from being a naive/hopeful kid to someone more cognizant of the present and the work he needs to put in to be a better Jedi), Great from Harrison Ford (the real star of the show in all his scenes as he smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (and he really cleaned up the delivery of his lines in this movie as there are not any awkward pauses as there were last time), Good to Very Good from Carrie Fisher (She really improves this time around as she is given more freedom to play as opposed to last time; she also really grows as a character from being the damsel in distress to being a loving leader), Good to Very Good from Billy Dee Williams (Really becomes a memorable presence in all the scenes he is in with his cool nature that conflicts/competes with Han, though there is some hiccups in delivery as he is still getting used to the Star Wars universe as opposed to the other members of the cast), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and really grows the character to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great to Incredible from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with the puppeteering and the vocal performance, Good to Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Incredible Story (Really sets up different elements of the universe very nicely and uses the concept of parallel storylines very well; also has some of the most iconic moments of the series and does a good job in building the downfall of the characters; the only issue this time around is that it does not have the ability to build worlds like the previous film could), Great Screenplay (The dialogue this time around felt way more natural and was better written; the screenplay still shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines (with it having one of the most iconic lines/plot twists in cinema (or even narrative) history)), Brilliant Score (Takes what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Very Good Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life, but there are some issues with Sound in this movie as there feels like a delayed sound with the lightsabers (which is very annoying if you have watched the prequels)), Very Good to Great Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (This movie does not really go overboard with the new visuals of the re-release as much as the other movies so it is easier to comment on), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history, and really added to that with the Hoth/Dagobah/Bespin sets which are regarded as some of the best in all of Star Wars), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as it has three major parallel story lines that all converge to the climax and the end (something that helps keep the audience engaged to see how the different arcs are coming along), Pacing was better in this movie as it felt more consistent and not as slow as the last one, Build to climax is done very nicely as it is really pivots the franchise into seeing who these characters really are as they have to make important decisions for the future; Climax was the best part of the movie as we get to see what Luke's training has come to/seeing the rest of the crew into action as we get to see how much the characters have grown yet see how far they really are to their goals in the sage; moreover one of the most important lines in history is delivered in this climax that make Star Wars a franchise memorable, Tone does not play as much into the space opera or science fiction epic as the last one but does have shades of it; feels more like a standout movie that really transcends genre in many ways (while still keeping the same star wars charm), Really can be felt of as a stand alone movie (even though it leaves so much to be answered with its ending) as we get to see the rise and fall of the characters as they must continue their own individual quests to grow as characters."

Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise centered on a film series created by George Lucas. The film series, consisting of two trilogies (and an upcoming third), has spawned an extensive media franchise called the Expanded Universe including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books. These supplements to the franchise resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe, keeping the franchise active in the 16- year interim between the two film trilogies. The franchise depicts a galaxy described as \"far, far away\" in the distant past, and commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good, in conflict with the Sith, their evil counterpart. Their weapon of choice, the lightsaber, is commonly recognized in popular culture. The franchise's story lines contain many themes, with strong influences from philosophy and religion.\n\nauthor: http://www.internetvietnam.net/\n\nHave a nice day."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Empire Strikes Back is an absolute classic science fiction film released back in 1980. It continues the story of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo as they battle the evil Galactic Empire.\n\nOne of the many strengths of this film is its intricate and well-developed plot, which includes numerous engaging twists and turns. The film's visual effects and breathtaking action sequences are mesmerizing, and are elevated by John Williams' iconic musical score.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back also delves deeper into the mythos of the Star Wars universe, introducing legendary characters such as Yoda, and exploring the concept of the Force in greater detail. The film's central themes of temptation, sacrifice, and redemption are expertly explored through the character arcs of the protagonists, making this installment both emotionally satisfying and thought-provoking.\n\nOn a technical level, the film is an undeniable triumph, with excellent production design, costumes, and special effects that hold up even by today's standards. The performances of the cast, especially Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, are also standout.\n\nIn conclusion, The Empire Strikes Back is a masterful and groundbreaking film that is a must-see for fans of science fiction and action. Its timeless appeal and impact on popular culture cannot be overstated, and it remains a favorite of mine to this day which is why I've rated it a 9 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and one of the best films ever made. The film immortalized the already iconic characters that George Lucas created in Star Wars, while making a very dense and entertaining film. The Empire Strikes Back is so great because of the improvements made to Darth Vader, the ambitious tonal change, and the fact that it still contains one of the best twists ever. With enough analysis the most impressive thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how hard it is to find flaws in the film.\n\nDarth Vader still stands, and probably always will stand as one of the best villains ever brought to the screen, second on my list only to The Dark Knight's Joker. However, in Vader's first appearance Vader is slightly inconsistent in that he's a temperamental villain often yelling, which isn't nearly as scary as a villain who remains calm. I would contest that the best villains act like they are always in control, whether they are not, it is in The Empire Strikes Back that Vader develops into this villain, while also systematically murdering his failing accomplices. It could be argued that Vader's development helped the tonal change that Empire Strikes Back brought.\n\nIt's another testament to the villain, when they are so chilling that the tone of the film seemingly dives with them. As Vader develops into the more controlled, systematic villain the tone of the film dives into a darker world. With Star Wars being considered, at least partially, a kids film it seems extremely ambitious of Lucas and Kershner to make a film directed at kids dark, something many filmmakers are unwilling to do today. The dark tone helps accentuate the character development as the characters hit their all time lows, and the film's tone represents that the world isn't always nice.\n\nThe story for Empire Strikes Back, being the middle film in the trilogy, had the most freedom, and used it accordingly. The story of Empire Strikes back is arguably, the strongest in the series, as the film was one of the earliest to say the bad guy can win, in a giant blockbuster, another very ambitious move. However, the best element of the story is the unpredictable turns it makes, in particular it's iconic twist. The twist remains one of the most famous of all time, for a reason, and the film benefits from it.\n\nIn the end Empire Strikes Back has the best story in the trilogy, the best character development, is very ambitious, and immortalizes it's iconic villain. On top of all of that it has been copied numerous times over the years, and remains one of the best films ever made. Empire Strikes Back still stands as the embodiment of what makes Star Wars so great."

The effects are just as enthralling as they were in Star Wars (if not more so), as shown in the amazing new worlds that Empire introduces (Hoth, Cloud City, Dagobah), and John Williams once again blows us away with a score that is on par with his work in the previous movie. The story takes us in a different direction than Star Wars, giving the audience a greater insight into the workings of the Empire and Darth Vader's character. Vader's arc culminates in his iconic confrontation with Luke Skywalker at Cloud City, which ends with possibly the greatest twist in movie history. Empire's story is more mature than its predecessor, and leading actors have matured and greatly improved as well (props to Mark Hamill, who did about half of his scenes with a puppet and still made them believable). The dialogue is sharp, the camera work is clean, and new iconic characters get to shine in this movie. I especially loved when Yoda gave his explanation of what the force is, increasing the audience's understanding without removing any its mysticism. Overall, this movie expertly balances pretty much every aspect it should. The acting, the visual set pieces, the sound design, the score, and the story all shine, combining to create a masterpiece of a movie.\n\n10/10"

The action is stunning, the visuals still look ground-breaking today. Empire overall, is just the best movie sequel ever and I don't know if I can call it the best of the original trilogy because its a tough choice between the three of them, to me.\n\nBut I still love The Empire Strikes Back so 10/10."

But since then, critics and fans, including i, have redeemed the movie as the best Star Wars movie, and one of my favorite, sci-fi, and sequel movies, and one of my personal favorites. It is alongside with Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Aliens (1986), one of the greatest sequels of all time. The movie looks better than most CGI-Hollywood films today, and this was made in 1980!, and was made entirely without CGI. The movie stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz. 10/10, totally recommend it, to every movie fan."

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) -\n\nBefore I start the review of this film I will state that I do love it, because I love all of the Star Wars universe, especially the original trilogy, but also because it was a really well made film and it was delivered excellently in the same way as the first.\n\nI may ramble and reminisce a bit too much at times, not there should be some sort of point to it and actually that's the affect that these films have on a lot of people.\n\nThis film didn't fall in to the usual trap of a sequel, with repetition and pointless continuation just for the sake of making money. It had some great moments, including laughs, action, space fighting, romance, the whole lot and with an original plot that continued the story because it needed to.\n\nI wouldn't have liked to have turned up to it without having seen 'Star Wars' (1977) beforehand and if you have to finish things off due to some sort of O. C. D., like I do, you will need to watch the next one, 'Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi' (1983) too, because this one ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nIt works as Episode \"V\" of the original 3 (V, IV & VI - Ask George) and of the larger nonet that it became with the release of the Prequel Trilogy (1999/2002/2005?) and the more recent Sequels (2015/2017/2019) too and many regard it very highly on its own, but it certainly couldn't have been released or have been so successful without Episode IV, because I needed to know where they came from, who Ben was, why Luke had magic powers and so on.\n\nWith that aside, I think that I mostly tend to appreciate this film, because I only remember seeing \"IV\" and \"VI\" on TV as a child, with maybe a few clips of this one, until my parents finally got a Video Cassette Player and of course the all important Cassettes to go with it, which came quite a bit later due to these highly popular productions actually being quite expensive back then.\n\nAs a result I probably haven't seen this one as often as the other two, but feel a nostalgia based on a clearer teenage mind watching it almost new, as opposed to a 7 year old's memories of cute Teddy Bears (Ewoks) for instance.\n\nThe story and the character development was great, because it meant that there was more of the universe that I already loved and I got to know my favourites better, whilst other great personalities like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Yoda (Frank Oz) were introduced.\n\n\"Empire\" actually had some of the better jokes, a great story and many of the classic moments that have since been turned in to memes. Harrison Ford looked mighty fine as Han Solo too.\n\nThe update of the film, when it was digitally remastered, added some beautiful colours to places like Cloud City and clarity for the rest of the film. I also finally got to see more clearly what it was that attacked Luke at the beginning of the film, which, fun fact, was written in because of a car accident that he had in between recording, which left his face quite hideously disfigured.\n\nI also thought that they had realised that Harry had given them a lot more than they had expected in the first film and they seemed to have decided to expand his role in this one to make him more than just a roguish taxi driver. They later did the same, quite cleverly, with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) in the sequel films, because although the Jedi bit is great, the films have always relied on these additional characters to keep the action going in other ways while the young Padawan gets trained or has extended laser sword fights.\n\nThe brilliance of this instalment was also added to by yet another superb soundtrack provided by John Williams, who managed to almost completely create something new, on top of the existing themes, but without it being far far away from the general style of sound already used.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong with any of the Star Wars films (Skip 'The Last Jedi' - 2017), because they contain so much heart and a vast knowledge of the film history that had been collated in George Lucas' mind while he grew up. That was obvious with nods to many of the other great epic western, medieval, sci-fi and war films and tales that went before and of course the polish he delivered with each of the films in this series, not to forget the brilliance that came from his own imagination and the superb supporting special effects created by the ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) studios.\n\nI look at other films from the late 70's and early 80's and wonder why they didn't put as much in to it as the people that made this original trilogy, because it obviously worked if you want to create something that lasted.\n\n962.22/1000."

The acting is dreadful, the bad guys aren't scary of funny and aren't even both guys! The kid who plays Luke Skywalker is dreadful and your left hoping the bad guys actually get him and strangle him. The storyline is just stupid and why they decided to keep the same characters as the first two home alone's is beyond me. Overall I have to say this movie is a big disappointment and I only gave it the rating 1 because I had to, if I could give it a zero I would."

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of people say that The Empire Strikes Back, the second of the original Star Wars trilogy, is the best in the entire Star Wars trilogy. Watching it for the first time in a while, in the theater with my parents and a friend of my dad's (who's a big Star Wars fanatic) just today, I found it to be fantastic. Although, it doesn't quite reach the excellence of the original (especially with George Lucas no longer helming as director), it's still fabulous.\n\nThis movie picks up three years after the original, during the continuing struggles between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Having destroyed the Death Star, Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on Ice Planet Hoth. While Han and Leia escape in the Millennium Falcon, Luke, under the guidance of the ghost of his deceased mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness), journeys to the mysterious Swamp Planet Dagobah, in search of Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Yoda's help gives Luke his only chance of survival, when the Dark Side of the Force beckons him into the duel of duels with Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones).\n\nJust like in the first movie, the story is exhilarating and engaging. It's also far more mature than the first movie, and perhaps that's a really good thing. That much being said, even though the movie does still have engaging action sequences, it feels a little longer compared to the first movie, though they're roughly the same length. Another thing that holds this movie back from trumping the original is that compared to the first movie, the humor is only in trace amounts, when a story of this caliber could've easily used a little more; R2-D2 and C-3PO, practically the drive of the first movie, are given reduced focus this time around, and their amusing banters are scant.\n\nStill, however, the acting is terrific from everybody. Mark Hamill is, once again, fantastic as Luke, perhaps even a little better than the first movie. Everybody else who returns from the first movie is incredible, especially David Prowse (may he rest in peace) and James Earl Jones as the physicality and voice of Darth Vader, respectively. Also joining the cast is legendary puppeteer and actor Frank Oz (best known for Sesame Street and The Muppets), who's just exceptional as Yoda.\n\nAnd just like the original, The Empire Strikes Back is a visual win! It's filmed and edited very shrewdly, especially in the action sequences, and the set design is, of course, phenomenal. And of course, the special effects, despite George Lucas having amped them up since the original release, are incredible for a movie released in 1980, particularly the lightsabers, and on an additional note, the scenes of Luke talking to Obi-Wan's ghost.\n\nAnd last but not least, the music! John Williams returned to score this movie, and once again, he did an incredible job. He composed new cues for this movie, and even reused his famous main theme. It's still as timeless and majestic as the first movie.\n\nAll things considered, The Empire Strikes Back is an excellent follow-up to the original Star Wars movie. It does fall a little short of the first movie, but it's definitely a must-see for anyone who's a die-hard Star Wars fan!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"New Hope\" showed the whole world that fiction can be adventurous, fun, and new worlds, as George Lucas showed, need further disclosure. A new film was needed that would continue the story of the confrontation between a small army of rebels and an unshakable and gloomy Empire led by Darth Vader. The fans got such a movie.\n\nThe very title reveals the essence of the upcoming conflict. The Empire and its Death Star had suffered a crushing defeat, which meant that a retaliatory strike was needed, a step that would make the rebels lose. And this film perfectly demonstrates how the stakes are rising in this legendary confrontation.\n\nThe main characters have matured noticeably, they have grown up, become more serious. Their characters are perfectly shown in the events that surround them. It seems that the actions in the previous movie were like a starting point. Now each of the heroes chooses his own unique path. Luke Skywalker, as the main character, decides to become what he did not think a few years ago - a Jedi, a warrior of light, who once and for all must defeat evil in the person of Vader and Emperor Sidious, who is still flashing in the background. Obi-Wan Kenobi's self-sacrifice seems to have made him an adult overnight, made him feel indebted to this old teacher. And then Luke accepts this burden of fate, intending to fight to the last.\n\nLeia Organa and Han Solo are testing the strength of their fragile relationship so far, they do not want to give in to each other. All this happens against the background of the struggle with the imperial armies and a series of betrayals, when it turns out that friends can no longer be trusted. In the maelstrom of events, news comes under the finale, which is now fashionable to call a \"twist\". This is an event that turns out unexpectedly, something that turns the whole narrative upside down or vice versa. The history of Star Wars was probably one of the first to show this technique in the cinema. This is remembered for many years, and the play of the actors (those who saw it will understand which actor and what situation I'm talking about) amazes with its sincerity and literally makes the audience tremble from the discovery that happened.\n\nHowever, this seemingly gloomy picture is not devoid of positive interesting moments. Huge Wookiees, droids and ridiculous situations allow you to dilute this tragic story of one family.\n\nThe creators of the picture skillfully use the technologies available at that time, which enable viewers to see and, most importantly, believe in the reality of those worlds that are shown to us on the screen. All this is flavored with excellent dialogues, colorful characters and a wonderful musical component. What the Imperial March that appeared here is worth, which for decades will become the personification of the yoke of evil, the approaching dangerous Darth Vader.\n\nThe creators perfectly show several storylines and interactions between the characters at once. There is a love relationship, and the relationship between mentor and student, a test of friendly feelings. And each of the lines is successfully woven into the overall plot, makes you empathize and see yourself in these diverse characters, understand their motives, agree or not with their opinion.\n\n\"The Empire strikes back\" makes it possible to leave our native Land and go on an unprecedented journey, makes you throw away your earthly experiences, understand how much brighter and more dynamic life can be, because it is in a galaxy far, far away, where events happened a long time ago. Cinema will allow you to ask a lot of questions about the meaning of life, about relationships, about the world, which is not only black and white. The world is multifaceted, with its own complexities and ambiguity. And, most importantly, this film will encourage you to see the next one, the one that will complete the classic trilogy and finally put all the dots on the \"E\" for these heroes.\n\n9 out of 10."

It looks likes it will be the most mature work. But it suffers from lacking th e freshness of Star Wars and doesn't the sense of conclusion that Return of the Jedi has.\n\nLike Revenge of the Jedi its pessimistic tone gives the impression that this is th more mature serious work.The plot of the film doesn't develop the story. Its simply the Empire hunting down the rebels. Missing Empire the Strikes Back doesn't affect the understanding of the story of the 3 films.\n\nIts positives are the relationship between Han Solo and Leia and the famous scenes between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.

It just stops when all the battles have finished and do not explain any other things after the battle. Instead, it only shows a shot of the characters looking out the window. This really disappoints me. Second, about the love between Princess Leia and Han Solo. I have never thought that Leia and Han Solo are a couple until they suddenly kiss. It makes me feel very surprised because the movie does not show any obvious relation between them. Third, the movie does not tell story but showing a battle sequence instead. It is very boring for audience to watch. Finally, the battle of Luke and Darth Vader did not bring out a mood of climax but instead it makes me think that \"It is ridiculous.\""

The special effects still hold up well to today's standards, the dialogue is witty and intelligent, and the character dynamic allows the actors to play well off of each other. It's a very different kind of film in that the \"good guys always win\" theory is proved wrong, and Darth Vader's surprise revelation at the end of the movie is still one of the best movie moments ever, which was shocking for its time.\n\nThis is one of the few films that I find that never diminishes after each viewing.

        "review_detailed_main": "What a Shocker...I think this one is everyone's favourite as nearly every single fan will say \"This is the Best Star Wars Movie of All Time\" and I agree with them, but that's not the main reason why I love it.\n\nIt's always hard to make a sequel better than the first installment, and this was more successful. Unlike the first one, they made it darker and they explored the series.\n\nWe got to see more worlds and we got to know more about the Jedi and how the Force works, the Lightsaber duel in this is really intense, much quicker and precise.\n\nAnother reason why I love this one is because the Bad Guys win, which is surprisingly rare, we get Han Solo captured by Boba Fett the Bounty Hunter, Vader wins the fight and the heroes still don't want to give up.\n\nAnd also this was the film that gave us the greatest plot twist of all.\n\nAlso, Yoda is awesome."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll Admit, I'm not on that bandwagon saying that this film is my favorite in the Star Wars franchise. But I tip my hat to Lucas and everything this film offers. This film is one of the best films ever made. I don't doubt that one bit.\n\nWhat this film does so brilliantly versus the 1st film is going further in depth into the characters of Luke and his journey learning the force. This film is about him fighting between the good and dark side of the force internally. It's that classic arc of battling between the good and bad part of us and learning not to give into the anger, hate, and suffering. It's iconic, and Hamill does such a great job.\n\nSo did Harrison and Carrie. Having their relationship explored and getting to see how both of them help each other grow as people. It's really good.\n\nAnd once again, James Earl Jones proves even more why he is Vader. He's much more ruthless, short tempered, and so much more imposing than ever. He's inflicted Physical, Emotional, and Mental Pain on all of our heroes, and he plays that part so effortlessly. Iconic doesn't even begin to describe how amazing he plays Vader.\n\nAnd I gotta say, I'm constantly impressed with the action scenes in this one. Some very solid Sci-Fi Space action, and some really iconic lightsaber fights. The Sound Design of the blaster's spaceships, and lightsabers again are really good.\n\nAnd as always, John Williams continues to show why he's one of the best composers in Hollywood. The Score is very memorable. Not bad at all.\n\nAgain, this isn't my favorite in the franchise, but I give all of my respect to this one. It's a really well-made film. One of the best Sci-Fi films ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had heard just so much of star wars ever since eternity and I directly saw the movie regarded as the bestest in the entire series. But man....it was so underwhelming. Not saying it was a bad movie. But nowhere near the status people portray it to be. It was like your another science fiction coming off a story thought by a bunch of fascinated teens with passion to create something fantastic and stylish but without some actual depth. I guess, maybe it was a great movie in 1980, for people of that time. But me having seen movies like Dune (which had so much more depth, more human, not mere fantasy but conveying reality) and man of Steel, this didn't make much sense of it. Just a okayish \"entertaining\" time pass movie.\n\nSo, from one movie, what I get is, star wars was back then what Marvel is now. A gigantic lore with some really amazing characters (no doubt about that. Yet the movie is not human because all the characters are just one directional and single layered) with the sole purpose of movies being immature entertainment. I predict that just like Marvels, down the line, star wars will be directed not by directors with individual vision but by those who serve to the fans vision and also I believe I am going to see a lot of fan service as well. Let's see if my prediction comes which I will know once I have seen the rest of the movies.\n\nIt just makes sense even seeing the 1980 film that Disney took over star wars. The brand Disney has been stamped all over it ever since then. I just wondered that people called it one of the darkest movies in series, when it's not even near what a \"dark\" movie is.\n\nEven on the entertainment front, I was not thouroughly impressed. But it's at least good in that segment.\n\nOverall, seems like a good movie for your kids."

The story surpassed the first film, with excellent pacing and no dull moments. I appreciated the darker tone and the more personal and complex plot, while still maintaining a straightforward narrative. The cinematography and visual effects were impressive for a film made in the 1980s.\n\nThe acting was outstanding as well. Mark Hamill truly shined as Luke, a significant improvement from his performance in the first film. The rest of the cast also did a fantastic job.\n\nI have nothing negative to say about this film; it was perfect!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Empire strikes back is a complex movie to review. On the one hand, in terms of plot development and pacing it feels like a step back from A New Hope. Luke goes to train with Yoda, while his friends evade a Star Destroyer through the power of plot armor. Eventually he goes to save his friends.\n\nHowever, it does a few things exceptionally well:\n\n1. Expand the world building of the original film. A New Hope was largely a fairy tale story which could stand on its own. But Empire Strikes back grounds it in a believable universe. The death star is gone, but that barely made a dent in the power of the Empire. The nature of the force is expanded on. The emperor is introduced. Darth Vader isnt just some random bad guy anymore.\n\n2. Subverting expectations done right. Structurally, the Empire Strikes back is kind of an odd movie, and its even more unique in that it ends on a pretty dark note. Luke going to save his friends doesn't really work at all. He instead gets his hand chopped off, almost dies and needs their help. But this subversion doesn't just come out of nowhere like a The Last Jedi gotcha, it actually makes sense.\n\n3. The plot twist at the end is so well known that people dont really factor it in when reviewing the story 40 years later. But keeping it in mind, this really would be a shocking moment to anyone watching it the first time.\n\nAlso, with a better director at the helm, Empire Strikes back has better dialogue (slightly, its still not great), better acting, and better cinematography. John Williams even steps it up a notch with the music.\n\nOverall, the somewhat weak plot development (it spends far too much time in asteroid fields, a cheesy romance, and training montages), still makes me think its a bit overrated. But its still the best Star Wars movie."

The reason why I think that this one's the best of the first trilogy, is because it is the darkest, it's the best sequel I've ever seen and it's got all the ingredients (romance, adventure etc.). My\n\nfavorite scenes are still the \"asteroid belt sequence\" (I still don't know exactly how they pulled this one of) and the lightsabre duel at the end of the film.\n\nThe fourth film was as George Lucas said primarily about introducing the characters. The fifth film was a more complicated one. It had to function as the bridge between episodes IV and VI. The drama was also more intense in this movie than in the other episodes. The last installment of the first made trilogy was primarily the climax or the ending of the complete told story.\n\nMy final remark, if you haven't seen the Star Wars trilogy yet, wait until George Lucas has finished the Prequals."

I think that people went into this film with high expectations and were not disappointed. I wasn't, not really - it's a great film. Still, as I said, just a LITTLE bit less great than the first one."
