        "review_detailed_main": "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.\n\nIt's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.\n\nBasically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.\n\nThis is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.\n\nTold in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.\n\nWith a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.\n\nThe Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.\n\nThe only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.\n\nIn the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across."

The acting performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: The Prestige",
        "review_detailed_main": "I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no wrong. Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy) cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist. The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession, revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can sometimes be used as tools for deceit. What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the notion of how \"magic\" actually worked. Besides the better understanding of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience, somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be detrimental to any leaks of secrets. And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn between the rivals added a little gravitas. The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian scientist! I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in, without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours, you don't feel its length at all. At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection - what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none other. P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's movies?"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is very engaging and intriguing. You are presented with a complete mess of scenes which go back and forth through time and are needlessly confusing, yet the core story and the characters were compelling enough to keep me interested and paying attention. The cinematography, the sound, the acting, and the visual elements are all perfectly in place, and overall its very entertaining.\n\nMy only concern is that the film prevents itself from achieving greatness by relying heavily on a very cheap, shallow plot element. It becomes science fiction, which is fine but a bit strange after spending so long convincing me the characters are real. This is something I find with all of Nolan's movies, that they present themselves as being mysterious and secretive but fall a little flat if you apply any brain power to them.\n\nStill, I think this movie is worth watching if you're looking for something a little suspenseful, a little creepy, and very entertaining. Maybe the movie's ultimate goal is the same as a magician's, as said in the movie: that one moment where the audience is in awe and disbelief."

        "review_title": "\"The Prestige\" starts well but cheats with its own premise...",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are many kinds of magic: wizardry \u00e0 la 'Harry Potter', illusions or hallucinations, or entertaining shows: mediums, rabbits in top-hats, women sawed in half, bag-content guessing, magic cards etc.\n\nSpeaking of cards, Christopher Nolan's \"Prestige\", made between two 'Batman' movies, lays its cards at the first voice-over monologue where we immediately recognize Michael Caine's smooth voice. It's about the third kind of magic and provides the three structural rules of an act: it starts with the Pledge: you show something normal then the Turn, you make it do something extraordinary... but there's an element of expectation and the higher your reputation goes, the more sophisticated the public. In fact, there's got to be something unpredictable, so it all comes down to the Prestige, the trick no one sees coming and will earn magicians applauses and guess what? prestige.\n\nThen, the least you can expect from the film is to follow these three rules even in the loosest possible way if it means wowing you with a spectacular surprise. And given that it's a Nolan film about the deadly art of illusion, much more opening with the killing of a magician, the imprisonment of his rival whom everything accuses, your twist-radar is set from the start, so not any twist will do. Whatever the prestige will be, if it's not venturing in the realm of feasibility, something will have been missed. We're dealing with magic after all, not fantasy, not sci-fi. I insist on the sci-fi element because the film opens with some electrical contraption that shakes its credibility from the start until a reassuring trap door shows and we can let a sight of relief go.\n\nFrench called electricity a Fairy so it all makes sense that magicians would use it as a device for generating illusion, just like rivals Edison and Tesla were perceived as wizards. After all, it's also established that magic is about what you see and what you don't and the use of lights and darkness is integral to the act. Still, I didn't like that machine. It felt incongruous and weird in a period drama and I was afraid Nolan would end up inserting some Batman-like device. And when he said in the \"making of\" video that he wanted to portray magic according to his personal vision of film-making, I thought \"no kidding?\", I'm pretty sure everyone got the parallel, especially when magical acts use special effects worthy of a Spielberg film.\n\nSo Nolan gets a little carried away at the end while the first two acts of the movie had really gotten me involved, I mean the escalating rivalry between the two magicians Alfred Bowden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and their attempts to destroy one's act or find one's secret. What Nolan got right is that the rivalry mostly works as a foil to plunge us in the world of magic and know all the tricks. After all, that's the greatest thrill about magic, seeing how it works. For instance, the way a magician puts a dove in a cage and then flattens it to magically making the dove reappear under a handkerchief always made me scratch my head... but in this Dickensian universe where there's no pity for little children, why should there for innocent animals?\n\nThe trigger of the rivalry also helps to understand how one of the most famous magic tricks, the \"escape from the tank water\" that made Houdini's reputation, is indirectly explained. Working as false audience members, Bowden and Angier are assigned to tie the magician's pretty assistant (Piper Perabo), one of them makes the kind of knot that doesn't leave any chance for the poor girl, who happens to be the other's wife. We gather that from then, it's personal. Another pivotal moment occurs when one conceives his masterpiece, an act that consists on getting in a door and coming out of another. He calls it \"The Transported Man\", for us, it looks like teleportation and it justifies why the rival is devoured by jealousy, although Caine's character can only see one explanation: there must be a double.\n\nAt that point of the review, it's impossible to go further without spoiling the film. It's engaging enough to make you forget there's a twist but it's not spoiling the film to say that there's a twist, since it's the essence of magic. You've got to wow the audience with a surprise at the end. With the seemingly death of a character right at the start of the film, the battle to know everyone's tricks and the existence of a double, anyone could reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. But you know Nolan has more than a trick in his sleeve and that's both a blessing and a curse. Granted anticipations are to be toyed a little to be emotionally rewarded, all he had to do was working on the narrative structure to make what we know first a more effective reveal or a shock.\n\nInstead of that, Nolan relied on a far fetched revelation combined with an implementation that destroyed the whole atmosphere built throughout the film. From the start, we follow magicians who are dedicated to their passion, which is good, but the escalation toward sadism and some ends-justifying-the-means means made their whole approach to their art debatable, leaving no room for sympathy. In this cruel battle of wits, women are reduced to disposable pawns (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen would get more dimensional roles in a certain Woody Allen's movie).\n\nThe first two acts, we can call them 'pledges' and 'turns' are great but then the film goes downhill. One thing for sure, I hated that Tesla Machine, and no offense to David Bowie, but Tesla was quite a handsome fellow whom I doubt spoke with such a heavy British accent. Nolan wanted his film-making to echo magic, but he let the reverse thing operate."

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.\n\nThe final pay-off of any magic act \u0096 the prestige \u0096 is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.\n\nThe prestige as the end note to the show \u0096 in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd \u0096 is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige'\u0096 of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a \"gotcha\"-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.\n\nOur two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.\n\nTo further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson \u0096 always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point) \u0096 performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.\n\nWith Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.\n\n'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).\n\n9 out of 10"

So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.\n\nThe story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see \"the prestige\".\n\nI can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see \"Batman Begins\") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.\n\nHugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.\n\nScarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than \"Labrynth\" would have you believe.\n\nThe visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.\n\nIf you see one film from 2006, see \"The Departed\". But if you see two, \"The Prestige\" better be on your list."

What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique."

In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment. It's like the end discredits everything that's been building for long chunks of Nolan produce, like the film shoots itself in the foot (or in the head ?). Too bad. This feels like a great, but it surely isn't."

        "review_detailed_main": "Long ago I watched The Prestige and The Illusionist in the same weekend. Comparisons are odious but it is inevitable for me to think of the second when talking about the first. You want to know why, keep reading.\n\nMagic is present in everybody's childhood, but it is something we lose, as we get older, in part because there are not many movies about magic to watch when you grow up. But if you want to turn the clock back and feel excited about how magicians perform tricks and get some answers about \"how it is possible\" or \"what's the trick\", lucky you because there are two movies which will definitely satisfy your curiosity.\n\nBoth movies take place in England at the end of the XIX century. They not only have in common their genre, drama-mystery but also a fantastic cast. Edward Norton' remarkable portrayal of Eisenheim in The Illusionist is as memorable as Hugh Jackman and Christian Bales's in the Prestige. The appealing special effects, the convincing costumes and the compelling dialogue; you will enjoy these movies from the beginning to the end.\n\nAlthough there are several similarities between the two movies their plots are quite different. The Illusionist is, without a doubt, a much more romantic interpretation of the life of a magician. The Prestige, on the other hand portrays the rivalry between two magicians where revenge is the main feeling. The second movie is, indeed, more action-packed but no less moving than The Illusionist.\n\nThese two must sees will trap you and will carry you to an enjoyable world full of magic. But if you really love cinema and good stories the one I highly recommended to you is the Illusionist."

        "review_detailed_main": "In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in \"The Prestige\". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.\n\nI notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like \"Memento\"; one-upmanship, like \"Insomnia\"; the question of morality, like in \"The Dark Knight\". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).\n\nPS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are \"The Illusionist\" and \"Scoop\" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson)."

I initially saw it simply because I enjoyed some members of the cast so much (Bale, Caine, Bowie), but I left the theatre in awe. It is such a well-written, layered, intense, character driven story on par with Faustus or Jekyll and Hyde in terms of characters that are overly driven by their obsessions. It invites you to watch in the first lines of dialogue and from that point forward, you hardly have a choice. One of Nolan's strengths is that he doesn't shy away from difficult stories to tell. None of the characters are entirely likable. It's hard to pick someone to root for, but that is one of the things that makes them so human. Jackman and Bale are both fine actors that attack their roles with tremendous capability and Rebecca Hall is one of the best discoveries I've had in movies. Even Johansson, who is easily the weakest link, was used sparingly and didn't detract from the movie. The plot is fascinating and leads to an immensely satisfying ending. I can't watch this enough times."

It had all the makings of a great film, but I kept looking for (and longing for) the greatness to impact me. It never did.\n\nIt fell flat for me by the end. I really didn't care about any of them by then. I wasn't even sure I cared about the little girl. I certainly didn't care how anyone did any of the illusions; I was sick to death of their obsession with each other and just wanted them to move on already. Although there would be no film without it, it all seemed to be 'too much trouble to go through' and obsession is about getting caught up in it...for me, I couldn't get caught up in itnor could I quite get their obsession. Although Iam a big fan of the long, thinking person's film, I have to say I thought it dragged on and on by the end and I just wanted it over. It definitely did not leave me wanting more. I just wanted different.\n\nI had paid attention all along, I was impressed with the film and thought the acting, the cinematography and the direction were all superb. Even though some of the twists seem unnecessary, I thought many were brilliant and I kept trying to will myself to care about it, to care about them, but I didn't.\n\nIt was a very good film in a detached sort of \"viewing art\" way but as far as feeling \"wow\"'d by the end, not so much."

Yes, it is an adaptation, from a book, but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie, like this reviewer. Rolling Stone magazine (as printed on the DVD cover) said it best, \"You want to see it again the second it is over.\" Christopher Nolan, who last directed one of the best comic book movie adaptations, in \"Batman Begins,\" does it again with \"The Prestige.\"\n\n\"The Prestige\" is based on a book, of the same title, that was written by Christopher Priest. The story is about two magicians who have been rivals to each other ever since the day they met and throughout the course of time, each of them tries to gain an advantage over the other. Eventually the friendly rivalry becomes an obsession. Their obsessions over trying to discover how the other does the trick, or how to upstage that trick, could turn into something that would kill one another.\n\nFirst things first, this reviewer will not make any comparisons to the other magic movie, \"The Illusionist.\" What this reviewer will talk about is the plot. The story is fantastic. You cannot help but stay alert, and throughout the film you want to know what will happen next. There are many twists and turns to the plot, which will make you say, \"How did I not catch that?\" There is a quote in the movie that is used frequently, \"Are you watching closely?\" You need to be paying close attention in order to catch all of the various twists throughout the film.\n\nBesides all of the various twists, the acting was also fantastic. Hugh Jackman was a big surprise success as Rupert Angier. Christian Bale is always good and the trend continued as Alfred Borden. Michael Cane as always was great as Cutter. Scarlett Johansson was also very good as Olivia Wenscombe. Even David Bowie and Andy Serkis popped up as Nikola Tesla and Alley.\n\nOverall, there is not much to complain about. If you are looking for a movie about magic with a hint of science fiction, you should enjoy this. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan films, you should see this movie. If you enjoy movies in general, you should see this film. It is a shame this movie did not win any academy awards. \"The Prestige\" is recommended!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first time I watched \"The Prestige\", I didn't think anything of it whatsoever. However, on reflection, I think it's a film to be taken with a pinch of salt, and not just when regarding the magic.\n\nThis movie suffers from two main characters having the thickest plot armour imaginable - making all of their encounters feel inconsequential. This is a fairly severe oversight in an otherwise robust film that does provide intrigue, but still lacks on a fundamental level.\n\nNolan is one to weave as complex a tale as he can, and here is no different. Starting with a dramatic but unexplained death, the story plots the rivalry between two pioneering magicians: one who prizes showmanship and theatrics, and the other who reveres the art above all else. I prefer Hugh Jackman's performance to Christian Bale's (not something I would normally say), but Bale's feels a bit too abrasive and cynical even for the character design.\n\nWhat lost me a bit was the whole Nikola Tesla arc, where Nolan tries bridging the gap between illusion and reality. It's all a bit clunky, and whilst I don't particularly see why David Bowie was brought in for the role, I don't see anyone else doing much more with the material either.\n\nThe music is fairly minor in the story (not orchestrated by the usual Hans Zimmer), so doesn't elevate the film like in most of Nolan's other projects. Stylistically, there is a faithfulness to 19th century London; period attire is par for the course, but there is a decent finesse to the whole endeavour. The scenes in the USA are the best looking parts, as the scenery across the pond gives a little more scope for artistic license.\n\nMercifully, Nolan does leave most of the chronology alone, allowing a more rigid story to be told. Towards the end, I did begin to feel a greater sense of attachment - the conflict between the protagonists is palpable - but the romance aspects felt contrived and just like plot padding. I was invested in the finale, and there certainly are dramatic twists and turns, but in my opinion, they require you to accept some flawed storytelling tactics.\n\n\"The Prestige\" is definitely not one of Nolan's best: whilst it does exhibit shades of what makes his masterpieces so powerful, it also struggles with hurdles that even basic stories should be practically immune to.\n\nInvulnerability breaks immersion, and is one of the issues I had with \"Tenet\" 15 years later. That alone inhibits this movie from ascending into hallowed ground, condemning it to just being a worthwhile watch."

The motion picture is perfectly directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, author of various masterpieces: \u00a8 Insomnia,Memento,Batman begins, Dark night\u00a8. At the same time was made another film(2006)with similar theme titled 'The illusionist'by Neal Burger with Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel which also achieved much success. Rating : Above average, it was throughly amusing and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think.

        "review_detailed_main": "One of my most favourite films ever; 'The Prestige' is Christopher Nolan's most fascinating and engrossing film to date, pipping 'Memento' and 'Dark Knight', for me. The story of two rival magicians with a tragic history linking them, trying to outshine one another and the mysteries surrounding makes the premise of a magical two hour narrative.\n\nThere ARE holes in this movie and the story is not as compact as some other Nolan films; having a few weak moments. But this is where the genius of Nolan comes in - he makes it work completely, despite those problems - which is why I rate this movie as one of his best directed films.\n\nThis film doesn't have the heavy-handedness of 'Inception' (which is overrated IMO), isn't too clever for its own good (again, like 'Inception' and 'Memento' to an extend though I think the latter is Nolan's strongest in terms of sheer narrative brilliance)or the slightly impersonal feel of 'Insomnia' (a great film nonetheless; an underrated Nolan film I think). It is, in my opinion, the right mix of entertainment and quality. You will just not get bored with this film - in fact, I was left wanting more!\n\nThe acting in the film is flawless and is what makes the film such a compelling watch. The entire cast is brilliant, without exception, from Rebecca Hall to Scarlett Johansson to Michael Caine. As the two rival protagonist magicians, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem to go one better that the other with each passing scene. Ultimately, it is Jackman who shines more as Robert Angier though. As the mentally distraught, obsessive but consummate showman, he pretty much steals the show from perhaps an actor who may, in retrospect, be superior in sheer acting quality.\n\nIn a nutshell, 'The Prestige' is unlike any other Nolan movie. The sheer \"watchability\" value of 'The Prestige' beats the other Nolan movies blue and black. I have watched it four times completely; I enjoy it more and more each time. Without doubt, my favourite Nolan movie.\n\nWatch it; it is truly magical."

Every time! And now, when I finally sat down to watch it, I realized how much I had missed. I think it's one of the greatest movies ever created. Packed with subtle references, The Prestige itself is a magic trick and indeed, you have to watch closely. And when you do, you find yourself compelled by the seemingly harmless passion of the artist that is soon revealed to be a dangerous obsession which shows to what lengths a person is willing to go to and what sacrifices he's willing to make to be greater than his rivals and to be the very best he can."

        "review_title": "Does anybody look better in a top hat and tails than Hugh Jackman?...",
        "review_detailed_main": "... but I guess that is really beside the point.\n\nChristian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.\n\nThese two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his \"catch the bullet\" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.\n\nThis is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - \"Brilliant\".\n\nScarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?\n\nI wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film."

Still, it's ultimately unconvincing. Probably it will do big bucks, but don't be fooled by the current 8.5/ 10 user rating: the film's no masterpiece. Sure, it has its high points: great production values, with wonderful costumes and a gorgeous art direction - which succeeded in creating the visionary, sci-fi Victorian age that \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" tried in vain to create with massive digital effects in 2003 - . Most of the performances are strong; the best, in my opinion, is Jackman's. Bale is just a step lower. What didn't convince me is the script. It use a series of cross flashbacks which didn't always work well. The plot, very convoluted, is sometimes repetitive. The \"surpise ending\" is not that big surprise if you have paid attention. Even if its atmosphere of is definitely dark, with some brutal scenes, the Prestige is nothing other than a magic trick played to the audience: it will entertain you for a while, but will leave you nothing much. Maybe's my fault, but I was expecting much more. My rating is 6/10"

The supporting cast all deliver, Nolan still can't write women, Bowie, Caine and Serkis pick up the slack easily. Whilst Nolan has become much more of a High concept director, often with stunning set pieces, with this he tells a basic story, with plenty of genuinely unexpected twists and stylish direction and cinematography.

The story is okay, but what really took my breath away was the atmosphere (much like in Memento). He creates the perfect atmosphere for his movies, his style is brilliant. The shots are just gorgeous. In my opinion he is leading the charge in giving movie-goers a different experience; watching a Christopher Nolan film is a hugely different and a much more absorbing experience than nearly any other director. Well, for me anyway, obviously the experience is a hugely subjective thing.\n\nThis film is special. There are no real good guys, no real bad guys, just human struggles with that hedging of the supernatural that really gets you thinking. His films are not perfect in that they don't fit molds or answer all the questions. That is what makes this film special, it draws you in and really makes you question things; important things.\n\nHowever, the important thing is that it is a truly absorbing experience, what more can you ask of a film?"

Movie certainly was worth the effort. It is somewhat similar to \"Usual Suspects\", but better since, I can much easily associate myself with magician then with criminal. I tracked at least three nested stories, it has absolutely unexpected ending, and movie is very logical if you analyze it afterward. Scarlett Johansson acting was average but other actors just took me there. I believed every word. If you can still catch it in a theater, go, and if not happy DVD viewing."

If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.\n\nMaybe Insomnia is his \"weakest\" movie (if you count the reception it got) and \"Following\" was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning.

Just a unique story with excellent writing, professional directing, and wonderful acting from an all-star cast, which never gets old. This was a great movie when it came out 15 years ago, is a great movie now, and will be a great movie 30 years from now too. My only knock is that it requires some intentional \"suspension of disbelief\" in a few spots in order to make it work, but otherwise it's perfect. It is so good that it merits multiple viewings and I still look forward to watching it again. I put it in league with \"The Sixth Sense\" where the first time you watch it is superb but you have to watch it at least twice in order to really appreciate how good it is."

And so is the screenplay. It's completely astonishing! The whole movie is!\n\nRobert Angier (Jackman) and his assistant, John Cutter (Caine), are into magic. Robert is the illusionist, and John is his assistant with building and testing illusions. When a man picks two volunteers to tie a woman (Robert's wife) to bind her in ropes so she cannot possibly escape the water cage (like one of Houdini's escape tricks), it all gets interesting. The two volunteers were Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Bale), who didn't even know each other until that day where that woman -- who was Angier's wife -- drowned in the water cage all because Alfred Borden tied the knot in the assistant's hands wrong. She couldn't slip out of the knot. She died.\n\nNow Robert is angry. He shoots Alfred's hand later on in the movie, losing two of his fingers. Now, they are fighting at each other, not physically, just apart. THE TRANSPORTING MAN ILLUSION is a wonderful illusion that Alfred Borden made up, and now Robert is trying to steal his secret. He has become obsessed. So, he makes it better. BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH! JUST SEE THE MOVIE!\n\nOh, and for those who pay attention to music in movies, you'll be disappointed. There's not much music to pay attention to. There's just some violins and other orchestral instruments here and there and occasionally there's a, \"BOOM\" of a timpani when you're supposed to be shocked or surprised at something.\n\nSorry if I gave too much away, just PLEASE agree with my comment. I don't get any people who agree with my comments. I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Thematic Material, Some Very Startling Scenes of Violence, and Disturbing Images\n\nMy Canadian rating: 14A: Frightening Scenes, Mature Theme, Violence"

This is every magicians dream and to do it through the cinema is quite a trick in itself. The performances are excellent and Christian Bale as always is the character in life and breathe. Hugh Jackman is so turning out to be more than an eye catcher and can act in the most excellent and gentlemanly fashion. Michael Caine.......when don't you turn in an awesome performance. Scarlett Johanson does an excellent job and surrounded by such thundering performances, how can she not excel in the pouted way of hers and it is put most excellently to use in this movie. Take the rabbit out of the hat and take a bow, this was definitely a magic trick of a movie."

I was completely entranced by this movie. Normally I can detect upcoming plot twists and foreshadowing gives everything away to me. But in The Prestige... it's an exceptionally excellent plot. I was terribly surprised... not that it was terrible... it was exciting. The acting is superb. Absolutely and powerfully believable. I get very into things, like books, video games, and especially movies. Watching this movie got rather intense. The effects are amazing. It's a bit of a fairy tale but it seems so real. As someone put it, The Prestige is \"storytelling at it's best.\" I concur, 100%. I am making a list of movies you must see before you die. The Prestige is definitely on it. This is hands-down, thumbs-up, one of the best movies I have ever seen and I'm exceptionally proud to call myself a fan of Christian Bale and The Prestige."

I have seen hundreds upon hundreds of movies, and I cannot at the moment think of another I can say this about.\n\nSo what is it about the prestige? Is it the BEST story? Is it the BEST acting? Is it the BEST cinematography? I would say the answer to these three questions is probably no, not BEST, but very very good. When a film can succeed in such a way on so many levels, it makes a lasting impression. The Prestige is definitely this type of movie, and one of the most entertaining I've ever seen.\n\nThe acting is marvelous. Maybe nothing Oscar worthy, but this movie didn't call for that type of role. Christian Bale is perfectly mysterious, Hugh Jackman is spot on as a revenge seeking widower, and Michael Caine adds exactly the right support to bring it all together.\n\nThe cinematography and art direction really give this movie the mood it needs to be memorable. You will be sucked in to its mystery, and each scene will keep you on the brink of illusion and reality.\n\nChristopher Nolan's touch of teeter tottering timelines may frustrate the casual viewer, but it will challenge and entertain those who are ready to tackle the secrets of the film. You will be guessing and guessing, hoping for that home run of an ending, and trust me...it's a grand slam. You will not be disappointed. Better than Memento.\n\nBut what is it that takes this from a great movie to a masterpiece? For me it was the sounds. The mysterious score added wonder to all the right moments, making this more than a movie, but an experience that I will look forward to being a part of again and again.\n\nEvery element was there, every aspect executed in superb fashion. A 10 if there ever could be one. Movie-making magic!"

I came out of the theatre thinking what a good film, but by the morning, what a great film.\n\nThe mere fact that it plays on the mind, and requires a lot of thought to see some of the holes (yes there are some but not as clearly dismissed as in some other films)gives an indication of the impact it had on me.\n\nI had to laugh at the comments over the accents and \"mumbling\". It's called English. It is not \"American English\". I don't criticise American actors for talking in American accents, so please don't do the same to my native tongue.\n\nMy only advice here is go and see it for yourself if you have not already. Oh and look up a certain Nikola Tesla on Wikipedia if this name is not familiar to you.\n\nAnd finally, don't forget, it's a film. And fiction. It's not real, or historic. Enjoy it. I did."

You like their movies or not, generally you can tell \"This is a .... movie!\" as soon as you see a movie of them.\n\nIn my opinion, some directors want to reveal themselves, their characteristics in a movie. I think Shyamalan's Lady in The Water and Nolan's Prestige are such movies. I see Nolan as a magician. You can see all the pledge, the turn and the prestige in all of his movies. The best part of his movies is that you cannot see the trick easily. You can watch the movie again and again, and you may still see new points. You may still change your mind about the truth, about \"the trick\" or you may just be lost in surrealism, in a multi-dimensional truth. You may just see what you want to see and you can never get what was Nolan brothers thinking, just like a poem."

An impressive cast star in it with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in the leads; and Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie supporting as the film plays with the viewer's mind more than any movie has since Nolan's \"Memento\". The use of normal linear plot setting along with flashbacks and flashbacks in flashbacks are what help to accomplish such a perplexing work of genius.\n\nRobert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are rival magicians in an end-of-the-nineteenth-century London. Borden develops a new trick which frustrates Angier and compels him to do things which are almost inconceivable to find out his secret. Cutter (Caine), Angier's illusion creator, insists that Borden uses a double where Borden goes in through one door and the double comes out the other; much to Angier's disbelief, he vows to find out Borden's method and use it to improve his own act.\n\n\"The Prestige\" is yet another astonishing and remarkable film from the fantastically skillful Christopher Nolan which propels the viewer on a ride through the dark hearts of two men. A solid film from a solid director with a solid cast is reason enough to check this masterpiece out. Upon, multiple viewings the film unravels more and more to reveal its true genius inside and out, highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen some movies that try to blow your mind, I've seen some movies that try to challenge you and make you believe in the unimaginable. The Prestige does both, it challenges you while making you think you know what is going on and just when you have it all figured out it throws a Monkey wrench into your plans and leaves you totally baffled and dumbfounded even after the ending, so the real question is what is true in this film? and what is a lie? The Prestige Is brilliant, taunt, dark, sinister, sadistic, malicious, vicious need I go on? It's a film that you can revile in and admire for it's complex nature and dark themes. It's one of the most convincing and thought provoking period pieces I've ever seen since Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. It enters your mind and slowly but surely starts to poke at your brain and make you think what you know and believe is nothing but an elaborate hoax, a smoke screen to blind you from the truth that is buried underneath the complexity of this film it brings out the first basic law of life. Kill or be killed. And this film takes that meaning to a whole new extreme it uses treachery, betrayal, murder and deception to fully tell and improve the main basis of the plot and to bring out the dark nature that revenge has on a man's soul. All in all this film is nothing short of a brilliant and taunt masterpiece.\n\nHugh Jackman(who finally makes a great film outside of X-Men.) Brings his acting to whole other world, he pulls no stops to be cruel and vicious. He brings a great darkness the likes we have never seen and an obsessive nature like on other. Christian Bale(Who in my opinion stole the show.) Is another who rocks the house in this film, he brings a more sadistic side than Jackman and really almost out classes him in this film. Bale really steps up his game and brings a whole new level of obsessive rivalry to this movie. But all in all the whole cast does magnificently in this handsomely mounted film.\n\nThe Prestige is not your average film, it requires strict and complete attention to truly grasp and understand the story and plot. Kind of like The Matrix if you sneeze you will lose what is going on in the film, it's that complex. But when you get to understand it and know it it really is a truly magnificent film and a really treat to watch on screen. But I have just one request if you watch this movie, watch very closely because nothing in this film is what it really seems."

Unlike his recent movies, that are more on style than substance, this \"smaller\" movie is an example of how to maintain a storyline without trying to outsmart the audience with cheap tricks like backward/forward armies and other such nonsense.\n\nNolan needs to rewatch his own earlier movies and make note of the old adage, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Sometimes less plot complexity produces a far superior story."

        "review_detailed_main": "As the title suggests, this could be the final review of the prestige but as the movie starts this will be my final take on what is a brilliant movie and achievement in film making. Throughout the years I have watched the prestige too many times but this just speaks to how good it is with a number of factors some quite obvious others not so.\n\nThe prestige is by no means a simple movie and this expertly shown with Nolans signature exposition this can be seen in the opening scene's and this sets the tone for the rest of the movie which is a great touch as I feel some people may be confused by the name and how a magician can make a great film. One of the obvious staring points for The Prestige is that it has a stellar cast and with this comes some of the best acting you will see in a movie; even from David Bowie, the main treat for the audience in my opinion comes from Hugh Jackman as his level of acting in The Prestige is hard to come by; not a foot wrong, he really helps to capture the desperation and want and need for passion and curiosity and it goes to show the level some humans will go to, to find out what the trick is. Again another star role in Christian Bale's character is definitely not squandered as he shows a dark and gritty but quiet way of going about his life almost begging the question if he is bi polar until the prestige is reviled this is just another reason The Prestige is one of the best films in the last 20 years.\n\nVisually, The Prestige is nothing short of unique I would say stunning but there is not many if any other movies shot in this way giving a sort of vintage feel to it as even if The Prestige came out 50 years ago it would still be as critically acclaimed because there is little CGI used which probably could be worked around. That being said the use of this type of Imax cameras helps to give the movie dark and cold undertones which in my opinion helps to show desperation and a greed for fame but also keeping the mysterious nature of how the trick is done.\n\nNow for the best part of the movie, undoubtedly; the story telling is just off the charts beautiful evoking passion, inquisitiveness, shock and most of all sadness this helps to give an almost frustrating sense when nothing is reviewed to the audience almost keeping its cards hidden. The best part of the story telling for me has to be how the movie is structured, With the beginning of the film being the pledge: with it being two ordinary magicians that seek greatness and we've all seen that before, then the movie movies onto the Turn making the actors and characters do something extraordinary but not too far fetched for it to be unbelievable in this case it would be the teleportation magic trick, Then for me which is some of the greatest film and movie making ever The prestige of the film one of the most apoplectic and shocking obviously no spoilers but this really is the twist of all twist; only Christopher Nolan could pull something so brilliant off with such incredible execution almost as good as the magic trick it self.\n\nThis really is a film makers film and for the prestige of my review the twist you could say is that this movie is terrible, no I'm just kidding this is definitely one of the best movies ever made with a collection of everything the viewer and director would want showing just how powerful a human can really be when their mind is set on greatness taking only themselves into account which is why I believe this film is nothing short of a masterpiece and I do believe a 10 out of 10 is the least I should be giving it, and still to this day I believe it is extremely under appreciated and underrated with honestly no movie even coming close to the genius and creativity of what is and will be one of the best endings to a movie ever.\n\nThank you for reading,"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"It is inhuman to be so cold\", says one of the film's characters, and that's what \"The Prestige\" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as \"Memento\" meets \"Rash\u00f4mon\" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer \"The Illusionist\" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is, on the surface, a story concerning rival magicians in Victorian London. But, at the heart of things, it is really a film about film-making.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the goal of any film is threefold. I call it the 3 Es: Engage, Entertain, and Enlighten. Before either of the later two can happen, the audience must first be engaged. This means giving them a point of reference; that is to say, introduce them to something familiar right off the bat: a character that is relatable, and a situation or conflict that is easily comprehended. Once the audience is engaged, it is the filmmaker's duty to then entertain them, by putting the established characters in humorous or nerve-racking situations. There is a certain flare for creating truly entertaining scenes that only a few select directors possess. There is a kind of showmanship quality to film-making. The final thing a film must do is enlighten the audience. That is, the film should come to a point that stimulates the mind of the viewer. This is not always achieved and is even more difficult to pull off than pure entertainment. This third aspect is what separates great films from those that are simply good. It helps the film stick in people's minds long after they have seen it.\n\nThe above three elements of the film viewing experience are directly comparable to the three stages of a magic trick, as discussed in \"The Prestige\". These are The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. The Turn is when the audience is shown something ordinary; a handkerchief or a small bird. This is much like the beginning of a film when the audience is engaged by something equally familiar. The second part is The Turn, when the ordinary thing is made to do something extraordinary, like disappear. \"But,\" as Michael Caine's character says in the the film, \"you wouldn't clap yet. It's not enough to make something disappear. You have to bring it back.\" This seemingly miraculous return of the vanished object is The Prestige, and it is the most important part of the trick. These latter two parts are similar to the way entertaining the audience can bring them to something enlightening; how a heart pounding chase scene can wind and twist and turn, and then deposit us at some great, profound truth.\n\nAnother convention of magic tricks that is shared in film-making is the suspension of disbelief. It is said in the film that the audience knows that it is only an illusion, but they don't want to know how it is accomplished. \"They want to be fooled\", as they say. This is equally true with the film viewing experience. Any individual of even average intelligence knows full well that what they are witnessing on screen is not entirely real, but they ignore that fact. They want something extraordinary. They want to see something aside from their familiar reality. They want to escape, and it is the job of both the magician and the filmmaker to render a believable fantasy for the viewing public.\n\nFilmmakers are the magicians of their day. With both magic and cinema, people go to the theater to see something outside of their own, regular experience. They are, at first, presented with something against which they can compare their own lives. \"I know what this is. I get this\", they think to themselves. Then, through this relatable proxy, the audience is taken on a journey into previously unknown territory, where they witness things they had never imagined and certainly did not expect. Then, at the end of this voyage, and indeed because of it, we come to a profundity that we had not known, yet it is undeniably true. We leave the theater having gained a fuller experience. Or course we know it was all smoke and mirrors, but to dwell on this notion would ruin something very special."

Actually its among the all the time. The story was not a story. It was reflection of different human natures shown flawlessly through competition between two magicians - played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. The movie has several twists backed by logical sense that kept the interest alive for 2 hour length. The ending blew me away. I was shocked when secret of Christian Bale revealed in the end. On the technical side, art direction and camera work was stand out. Locations were so real, one could actually feel. On side role, Scarlett Johansson confidently played Magician's helper. She is hauntingly beautiful. Her little presence was noticeable.\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan is the next big thing after Spielberg, Eastwood, Scorsese, Lucas and Allen. He has developed a new genre of cinema - Intelligence + Entertainment. I am not surprised by the fact his three films are in IMDb Top 250."

The storyline despite being complex is wonderfully coherent as well. There are no unnecessary scenes in the whole film. It's very reminiscent of Fight Club in some ways.\n\nI'd highly recommend this film to everyone."

Intelligent, witty, excellently shot (a superb mix of breathtaking pans and establishing shots and very involving hand-held/steadi shots), with the finest actor of a generation (Caine) and very likely his successor (Bale).\n\nNo spoilers here, as unlike Memento,The Prestige's tricks can be worked out before they are revealed, and audiences will have great fun doing so. This is a tale of rival Victorian magicians, whose obsessions lead each into darker and darker places as Jackman's Angier seeks revenge for the death of his wife, and Bale's Borden looks to prove himself the better of the two magicians. Even without the mystery, twists and turns, this story is an excellent character study, something that carries the picture and at times supersedes the mystery and science fiction elements of the plot.\n\nLike Memento, it has a non-linear narrative, though not such an extreme one...the narrative is played out in three stages, like the magic tricks within it - first the pledge, then the turn, finally the prestige. It can be followed easily enough by anybody with a decent attention span, and reaps great rewards for those who follow it closely enough to try and fathom its mysteries. As with magic, the trick is not what has been done, but HOW it has been accomplished.\n\nNolan is fast proving himself (along with David Lynch) the master of non-linear narrative film-making. His movies put the non-linear pretenders in their place (you know who you are), and shows that, even in this age of mass-consumption and dumbing down, movie audiences can be allowed to think, and don't need everything spelled out for them.\n\nCan't wait for Oscars night, if this doesn't walk home with a few (Nolan particularly, Bale and Caine) then there is NO JUSTICE!!!"

The actors are amazing: Hugh Jackman - charming yet sometimes scary, as we know him, and Christan Bale, more lively but equally \"strong\" as in Batman Begins, are the two rival magicians. Their act is sustained by Michael Caine, as their mentor, and Scarlett Johansson. I didn't go to this movie expecting much, but after having seen it, I can say without any doubt that this is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time, and I strongly recommend it.

He has the ability to create mood and deep, well rounded characters better than almost anyone in the thriller genre, ever. For my money, only Hitchcock was better. And the Prestige was something worthy of the Master himself. Its is a dark, twisty, surreal film that truly goes unexpected places. Nothing is what it seems. And Nolan manages to pull of the twists, turns and surprises expertly, never once make a jump in logic that you don't take with him without question. The acting is phenomenal, Bale, Jackman and Caine are all excellent. But it is Jackman who owns this film. Between this and The Fountain (which I still don't know if I liked or not) he has really come into his own as an actor. Its a shame he was completely ignored at awards time this year. Towards the end of the year, there were some truly great films, but this is unquestionably the best. Its a well paced, thoughtful, intricate thriller that is better written than almost anything I have seen in years. Nolan is one of the most talented directors of his generation, something he continues to prove film after film. Howmany of todays \"franchise\" directors take a break in the middle of a superhero franchise to make a moody, dark period thriller about dueling magicians? The man is a master, only a notch below Hitchcock himself, and this film is his masterwork, so far."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Prestige\" got some bad reviews early on, and at one point it was listed on RottenTomatoes.com with less than 30% fresh rating. I went to see it, as a result, with mixed expectations. On one hand, I think Christian Bale is the next great method actor and I firmly believe Christopher Nolan is on the pathway to really carving out a name for himself in Hollywood (beyond the fanboy audiences). He's still being advertised as \"The Director of Memento and Batman Begins\" but soon it will just be \"From Director Christopher Nolan.\"\n\nAs for the film? Exceptional. Inventive, unique and twisted. Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career-making performances. It's by far Jackman's best performance on film (in a serious role) and one of Bale's best, which is saying a lot. This guy can do anything. It's amazing to see him in \"The Machinist\" a few weeks ago and then turn around and see him here. Within the past year alone he's moved up many ranks in my book. (Of course, I don't have a book. But if I did...)\n\nThe film is dark, and its blend of reality with sudden fantasy may throw some viewers off. But I don't think it's a cop-out, as some people have claimed. It's just Nolan's style. Batman incorporated many different genres and themes that one wouldn't necessarily expect from, of all things, a Batman film - and here The Prestige delivers some magical material that I didn't see coming. Even knowing the ending ahead of time (after it was ruined by an ignorant IMDb user who thought it would be funny to spam people with the ending), it still came as a shock in delivery.\n\nWhat I finally felt so satisfied with was the film's direction, acting and character development. With a lesser director it could have easily been a lame exercise in style over substance and a flashy, gimmicky ending. Nolan elevates it and the two lead performances are really engaging. It works as a morality tale as well as an intense character study that has you alternately rooting for both men to succeed. And the film changes perceptions of past events so often that by the end you're kind of sitting there, shocked that it's played out so vastly different than what was expected.\n\nChilling, gripping movie. Had me consistently engaged from beginning to end, and I'd say in some ways it's the most well-made Nolan film yet."

(The first two are called the pledge and the turn)\n\nThe basic premise is of two magicians at the end of the 19th Century who become mortal enemies over a woman. And, as important, their rivalry in search of the greatest magic trick. And naturally the dilemma of what you can lose when you want to win, damn the consequences.\n\nThe protagonists are superbly played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, ably supported by Michael Caine and assisted by Scarlet (why her, again?) Johannssen.\n\nBale who was the boy in the exquisite EMPIRE OF THE SUN (9/10) and, of course, the not so personable anti-hero in American PSYCHO (8/10) as well as the latest Batman incarnation, is growing into his roles. He is on the cusp of A list status and thoroughly deserves it.\n\nThis film is like an exotic buffet; exquisitely crafted, beautifully presented with oddities and interests available throughout. Moody and electric, it captures the time and era beautifully. It is another feather in the amazing Christopher (MEMENTO (9/10) Nolan's cap. He's become a name director that you can trust with your hard-earned moolah.\n\nEspecially interesting in reality was the whole story of the Edison/Tesla feud which was only touched on here. Tesla was basically the person who invented AC current and then was shafted by Edison. Watch for an interesting cameo appearance here. And Andy (gollum) Serkis in a non-digitized role.\n\nTHE PRESTIGE was really magic."

Two magicians rival to be the best, and this movie takes you through many years of that rivalry, along with the resulting jealousy, anger, betrayal, and ethic and moral dilemma. Oh, and did I mention death, disfigurement, and deception? The performances are gripping, and the production is stunning, creating a believable setting that draws you into the story. I did experience some moments of confusion when the time lines jumped into the past or present a bit abruptly. But in the end, most questions will be answered. It's important to remember, though, that the most compelling question is not what was real and what was deception, but rather, how far do you allow yourself to go to prove you're the best?"

It wanted to be about the plot twist/rivalry, but it also had a theme in the age-old \"is there magic\" question. As stated in the previews and other reviews, there're some surreal sci-fi aspects to the movie. This was very disappointing.\n\n3) There are a few irritating inconsistencies that just make it hard to suspend belief and get into the movie. I won't put any spoilers here - but suffice it to say the movie lost cohesiveness in anything involving sci fi or the final twist.\n\n4) The flash-forward flash-back nature of the story telling did not add anything to the mystery of the story - it just leaves you irritated and confused for the first 20 minutes (who is reading whose diary again? Is this before or after the last thing that happened? etc)\n\nAll in all, the plot was very well constructed and the idea was great. In general the acting was good and it was well directed. It was just missing that extra \"oomph\" that turns and interesting movie into a fabulous one. There was something a little too predictable about all of the plot twists, and something a little inconsistent about the theme of the movie that prevented me from really praising it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Prestige\" is the kind of movie you wish will come after sitting through 25 other bad movies. Simply put, this is the best drama I've seen all year. Set in the late 1800's in (mostly) London, the film is about two rival magicians who continually \"one up\" another on magic acts. The film stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine. Caine plays the mentor of both magicians. The movie is shot out of order and sort of begins with the end. But just when you think you know how the movie really ends, it throws you for a huge twist. I won't divulge into the plot because if I do I'll spoil a lot of it. Let me just say this: I've seen so many movies that very, very few of them are able to surprise me at the end. This is one of those few movies. I was caught completely off guard with the final twist.\n\nIn the first hour of the film I quickly realized that this movie is NOT the movie you've seen advertised in theaters and on TV. The trailer makes Bale out to have real magical powers and Jackman out to be the copycat magician. As it turns out, neither is true. (That is NOT a spoiler). This is quickly realized within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The trailer's deception left a sour taste in my mouth, but by the end of the movie you soon figure out why the film's trailer was so deceptive; it's all part of the magic. I can only surmise the trailer was so deceptive because they simply didn't want to give away juicy plot details and spoilers. And I'm glad for it! Normally I despise a film when it's misrepresented in a trailer, but by the end of the movie I had forgotten all about the stupid trailer.\n\nThe performances were all very, very strong. However, it's Christian Bale that shines in this film. This is probably his strongest performance yet. (The 2nd strongest being his manic role in \"The Machinist.\") That's right folks, he was nothing in Batman Begins compared to this movie. Anyways, don't be surprised if he gets some sort of nod from the Academy or the Globes for his role in this.\n\nThis is the movie that \"The Illusionist\" tried to be. If you were left disappointed with \"The Illusionist\" (as I was), you owe it to yourself to see this magic movie. You'll be happy you did."

        "review_detailed_main": "When The Illusionist ended, it felt like there just wasn't enough of the theme. Just how perfect was this movie? Period piece, great cinematography, great editing, colors, contrasts, actors, script, plot, revelation and it was all about a turn of the century magician. Here's an era that hasn't been explored much in Cinema. It got a 5 outta 5 from this reviewer.\n\nThe Prestige gathers Batman Begins' two stars, Christian Bale and Michael Caine and thankfully forgot to include the dreadful Katie Holmes. So with the perfect trifecta of players known to work well together, Nolan adds another player, Hugh Jackman, aka The Wolverine. But the superb actor roster does not end here. Andy Serkis of Gollum fame plays the eccentric assistant to the even more eccentric real-world historical figure, Tesla, played by the best actor to play such freaks, and a true Rock God, David Bowie, who is barely recognizable in the his first scenes. And of course the feminine presence is filled by current Thinking Man's Goddess, Scarlett Johansson as the lovely assistant to our dueling magicians. You see the story isn't plain, it's quite complicated.\n\nTwo aspiring magicians, are hired as crowd plants for the star magician's tricks that involve the use of spectators. Here's the setup. We have an aging magician touring around Europe and his trustee engineer Cutter, or ing\u00e9nieur, as he tells the court, played by Michael Caine, brilliantly of course. There's of course the lovely assistant who happens to be the wife of crowd plant, Robert Angier (Jackman). During the preparation for the water tank escape, it is Angier's job to tie her legs and Alfred Borden's (Bale) responsibility to tie her hands. On one fateful evening, even after being told not to use certain not, Borden does so. The assistant unable to escape drowns in the tank. This drives a rift between Angier and Borden and in sue turns them into rivals; a vindictive rivalry that goes beyond the ends of science, physics and ethics.\n\nAt first we see the sides of both magicians trying to pick up the remains after the tragedy. But always watchful of each other they will endlessly pursue the crippling of the other's life and career as magicians. Whether it's ruining the act or even using real ammunition during a bullet catching trick. There's nothing one won't do to one-up his adversary. When Borden comes up with The Transported Man, a trick where he seemingly enters a placard and comes out another one on the stage, within the time it takes for a ball to bounce; Angier is haunted with this astonishing trick which he can't seem to reproduce without using an actor as a double. This very trick begins the downward spiral into madness both men will experience. Angier's interpretation of the act is exposed by a disguised Borden. The event leaves a humiliated Angier with a very broken leg and with an empty theater.\n\nThis leads him to sequester Borden's assistant for ransom. The demanded ransom is the key word to decrypt Borden's stolen magic trick book. This key, which is of course trickery, leads Angier to Colorado Springs to meet the eccentric Tesla facing hostilities from his own personal rival, Thomas Edison. This is where we learn about obsession and how it drives men like Tesla and Angier. Tesla believes he has created a teleportation device. But it has a few bugs that need working out. But Angier' is too eager to spend his fortune acquiring this device to bring his career back to greatness and finally defeat his nemesis, Borden.\n\nFor those who don't know about Tesla, he is considered to have invented the 20th century. He created wireless communication in 1893 and Alternative Current (AC) and was the object of utmost frustration and competition to the better known Edison. Tesla was considered mad by some for theories about science-fiction worthy concepts, like a global wireless telecommunications network. Yeah he sure was wacky huh? Now I won't say much more about The Prestige's story line simply because it would ruin the fun. But be assured that this movie is great and parallels the brilliance that was The Illusionist but with the slight difference, that The Transported Man isn't a trick. And there are many, many twists in the storyline that may or may not be expected but only add to the complexity and richness of the story.\n\nEvery little detail in the environment is taken care of as much as possible to transport the viewer into this magical world. Nothing is spared to make the storytelling as real and believable as possible, even in its most fantastical moments. Every major actor in this movie gives Oscar worthy performances. Not just one of them, but all of them. Nolan cannot go unnoticed this year for the best movie statuette, best writing, and best direction.\n\nIf someone can reinvent intelligent cinema, it's a man like Nolan. He's proved it time after time. Memento, Batman Begins and now The Prestige.\n\nI will end this review here, for fear of revealing too much of its secrets. It would be like taking off the icing and leaving you with the cake. This movie must be seen by anyone who loves cinema that isn't packed with Hollywoodisms, clich\u00e9s, gratuitous fireballs and puerile sexiness. If you haven't figured it out yet, The Prestige gets 5 abracadabras outta 5."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Prestige is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is totally unique, keeps you gripped throughout and the plot is so clever and original. You don't see many films about magicians, maybe thats why I found this to be so interesting, and I doubt we'll ever see a better one. The film is not really about magic though. It is about obsession. It is about deception. By the end, Robert Angier (Jackman) is a magician for totally different reasons than when he started, and I think this quote shows his obsession not just to be a better magician than Borden (Bale), but to make Borden crash and burn.\n\n\"I need to know his secret.\" \"Why?\" \"So I can do it better.\"\n\nBy the end, it is difficult to tell who you are supposed to be rooting for, because both main characters aren't exactly good guys, and I think this makes the film very unique. It is not about good triumphing over evil, rather it is about how you can get so caught up in one thing that it rules the rest of your life, and the dangers of becoming obsessed.\n\nThe acting in the film is superb. If you went to see a professional magician, you'd see the showmanship and antics that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman perform in The Prestige. The special effects are fantastic, as are the illusions that are performed. Michael Caine is, as always, brilliant. He is still proving to be one of the best supporting actors in the business. Scarlett Johansson is also excellent.\n\nChristopher Nolan's direction is, obviously, brilliant. This is a fantasy film, and he has still made it look completely real. I also think his screenplay for all of his films, especially this one, is the best by anybody. Never does he just put things in front of you to watch. The non-chronological order he uses means that as you go along, any questions you may have are answered along the way, and this makes for a wonderful cinematic experience. I think this sets his films apart from other directors'. In summary, I think it's safe to say that Christopher Nolan is the real magician here."

Magic is where the money is, turning the crowds out in their droves. And the top magicians of the times are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale.) They are rivals, but friendly rivals, engaging in a healthy sense of competition with each other. But Borden publicly denounces the tiredness of Angier repeatedly churning out the same crowd-pleasing tricks and demands something new. So they team up to pull off an idea of Borden's together, with tragic results. Angier's wife is killed and, blaming Borden, they become bitter rivals. But when Borden comes up with a new and innovative idea that wows the crowds, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to unwork it. So obsessed, bitterness, betrayal and murder become par for the course.\n\nDirector Nolan seems obsessed with becoming Britain's answer to M Night Shyamalan with his high-concept sort of movies. He's doing a better job of it of late, that's for sure, and with the next Batman movie out soon, he's going to get the most commercial drive. But in between he's managed to make The Prestige, which will be unforgettable but not because it's great.\n\nWell, it's quite a good movie, if you can follow it, which I'm not sure many will be able to. This is such a complicated and multi-layered story that you'll be scratching your head more than once while it runs. But that, of course, actually makes it all the more intelligent, and you can't complain about that.\n\nThe title, by the way, refers to the final act of the magic act, which Michael Caine's character guides us through in the early stages of the film. As he's stated before, he only acts for the joy of it these days without commanding a hefty fee, but there's nothing wrong with his performance here. He's just the start of the supporting cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and a surprise appearance from musician David Bowie.\n\nA good film, then, but maybe a bit too complicated and off-puttingly so for some viewers. #241 in the IMDb Top 250 is pushing it a bit. ***"

This movie was a great tribute to this misunderstood, brilliant scientist. Yes, just like time-travel scenarios, this film makes you think but not enough to give you a brain cramp. It's twists and turns rival the most demanding road rally track and will keep you involved the whole time. Not too many films do that for me anymore. It's a terrific way to spend 130 minutes. Be sure to have plenty of popcorn on hand."

        "review_detailed_main": "When Christopher Nolan decided not to make the follow up to Batman Begins in order to concentrate on this, my reaction could be gauged as somewhere between disappointment and pathetic, howling cries of grief and anguish as I wept fanboy tears of despair. However, upon seeing it, I am definitely glad he did because The Prestige is one of the most enjoyable films from 2006 I've seen: a twisty turny epic about two rival magicians in Victorian era London trying to out do each other with more twists than a contortionists convention.\n\nThe story revolves around two men: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), former friends turned bitter enemies after a tragic accident during one of their shows. Angier is the showman of the two, a good magician blessed with the fact he's got natural charisma practically gushing out of his ears. Borden on the other hand is a man brimming over with skill and invention, but has a rather dull personality compared to his rival. Constantly trying to outdo one another, Angier discovers that Borden has invented a new illusion called The Transported Man and becomes obsessed with discovering his secrets. Unable to do so, he creates his own version and sets in motion a spiralling chain of events that can only lead to the destruction of them both...\n\nFrom out of this premise, Nolan creates an engrossing and highly enjoyable film. Jackman and Bale quite rightly burn up the screen, with Bale in particular going a long way towards justifying his reputation as one of the finest actors of his generation. There's a very strong emphasis on the spectacle of the magic industry as well, so to watch the two men performing their tricks is a riveting experience, not least of all when Angier perfects his version of the Transported Man and winds up travelling to the other side of a vast theatre in the space of two seconds. As with all magic, half the fun is trying to figure out how they do it, the other half is not knowing.\n\nUnlike real life magic shows however, it's not all fun and games because for all it's showboating, The Prestige is still a very dark movie. Angry young men have always been strongly characterised in Nolan's movies and Angier and Borden are no exceptions. They are both sympathetic, realistic and detestable in equal measure, each man getting multi faceted characterisations to the extent that it's difficult to know which one to root for. The only downside of this is that the rest of the cast, with the exception of Michael Caine's venerable old master, don't get such loving time devoted to them. Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah in particular is a very sad character, worthy of a lot more screen time given Hall's fantastic performance.\n\nThankfully though, this is the only real complaint about the entire movie and isn't quite so noticeable on the first viewing when you get swept up in the duo's battle of wits amidst the fantastically recreated Victorian London. This confirms Nolan's reputation as one of the most talented storytellers in Hollywood today and is another glowing addition to his already impressive resume. And if the attraction of two men locked in a complex and vicious cycle of revenge isn't enough to justify a viewing...well, it also has Scarlet Johansson waltzing around in a skimpy corset. Try and resist it now."

This film has consistently pushed the boundaries just as the Matrix did when it was first released. Not many movies can boast such a debate over the tiny details or the implications of the actions of each character. When the machine is first seen in its detail, the ruthlessness of Angier is truly discovered. While movies such as the Sixth Day attempt to debate the ethics of such a device, The Prestige simply uses it to highlight the greed and burning ambition of a man. This movie is very complex in its themes and plot and it is encouraging to see a film that forces the viewer to think and review the storyline again and again to try and determine the truth. Is it not also ironic that while we the viewers are attempting to seek the truth, so the characters are seeking to disillusion us, just like a magic act. We are forced, in a sense, into volunteering for the magician which shows us in the end how incredibly well thought out this storyline really is. Cutter seems to sum it all up for us - 'Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled.'"

If you present a film that raises questions and the end of the final act does not answer them, then you have yourself a panned and wildly criticized film. The only kinds of questions that can remain unanswered are that which bare little importance to the main plot itself. Tarantino mastered this, by giving unanswered questions to almost all his films (Best example: Briefcase in Pulp Fiction). The Prestige however, suffers awfully from being unable to answer important questions. While the movie itself is entertaining, albeit a bit long, it fails to wrap up the story the way really good films do, like its rival 2006 magician hit The Illusionist. The hook and line are bearable to watch, but the sinker fails to satisfy. While it did give its nice twists and turns, The Prestige does not leave a satisfying finish.\n\nRivalries can be very ugly. Take the Yankees-Red Sox, Bears-Packers, Canada-United States, Tupac-B.I.G., and Coke-Pepsi as pure examples. Some can be friendly, some can result in tension, and others result in worse. In the case of The Prestige, we have two magicians ready to kill each other if the opportunity was given. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians that are so hell-bent on figuring out the other's latest tricks and amazing acts that they will put their families, even their lives on the line. Meanwhile, Cutter (Michael Caine) is in the middle of it all, trying to end the foolish rivalry before it escalates into something more. Throughout the film you see each person gain the upper hand in terms of skills, success, and happiness more than once, but like a seesaw it goes back and forth until the final moments.\n\nHandling this grim and dark tale of competition is an all-star cast, an accomplished director, and David Bowie? Anyways, Christopher Nolan, who has been acclaimed as one of the better current directors out there, directs this film with a technique that mixes the choppy Memento and the dark Batman Begins. Using darker colors, longer shots to portray emotion, and hints and clues throughout, Nolan is certainly the right man to tackle this story because of its non-linear course. He does a much better job here than in Batman Begins in terms of serving a gloomy atmosphere and dim tone. Also involved in the writing, the Nolan brothers did a good job hiding the secrets from the audience, but also stretched the plot a bit too long, when it could have easily been a much shorter film. Perhaps it was because they wanted to foreshadow the ending on multiple instances? Perhaps because providing more content would give the ending a bit more closure? Nonetheless, not everything seen in the first two acts was actually necessary.\n\nAt least we have some fine acting to help move the story along. Hugh Jackman removes the claws and does a superb job as a broken, bitter magician whose better days left him after circumstances beyond his control. Michael Caine tops Jackman with his portrayal as the magician not taking sides in the entire case, even when loves are on the line. David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson were good, but a bit underused. Christian Bale on the other hand, didn't provide as much effort here as in previous performances like in Batman Begins, The Machinist, among others.\n\nPacing of the movie is its ultimate strength and its ultimate weakness. In a non-linear film, moving too fast would be confusing and make the viewer more lost than a blind drunk man in a mirror maze. Once again, citing Pulp Fiction as an example, the modern masterpiece clocks in at over 140 minutes, is slow-paced, and yet remains astoundingly entertaining and fun because it is so rich in content and detail. The Prestige on the other hand doesn't quite dazzle and entertain the way Pulp Fiction, Memento, Fight Club, and other non-linear movies do. With a phenomenal amount of dialogue and little action, the true fun of the film comes within its mysteries, its questions raised.\n\nYet exactly like what would happen if the television show Lost abruptly ended, The Prestige does not answer all the questions, even when the credits roll. As the film progresses and the plot becomes thicker and the tensions and stakes raises, a lot of details raise questions about the who, the where, the why, and especially the how. Nolan was good at teasing the audience and leaving the bait, but failed to go for the kill when he really should've. He did not wrap up the story in a nice bow, or in a fashion that would leave the average viewer fulfilled. The Illusionist followed a similar pattern of leaving clues to the grand finale, except the ending answered all that needed to be answer. With questions that could result in several different answers, each of them potentially changing major themes in the movie itself, answers were more than necessary here and it was not delivered.\n\nBottom Line: The Prestige is a dark, twisting movie that doesn't seem to find its course, and while it keeps the audience in check, it leads to an abrupt dead end with many questions hanging around. The direction was great, the casting was wonderful, and the cinematography was outstanding, but something in the writing was lacking--seemed to be missing. Then, to make things a bit more disappointing comes the final act, which may leave some viewers pleased, but may leave others scratching their heads. If you want all answers revealed, you are in for a major disillusionment."

        "review_detailed_main": "Such a fuss has been made of this movie that I expected something out-of-the-box, and for anyone willing to believe the unbelievable it might even seem so. It's another example of how movie goers and makers have embraced the format of 'Style over Substance'. Everything about the story is so far-fetched and unbelievable that most of the time it's simply not worth even considering the outcomes. It's presented as if its fiction-fact, then swings into ridiculous science-fiction. IE; Human Cloning in the 1890's!\n\nIf it weren't for some reasonably convincing performances from the leads, stylish art direction and production design, moody lighting and cinematography (except for some unsteady hand-held sections) this production would have fallen over in a heap. As it is, it holds its own based on stylish looks smothered in over-done smoke and mirrors camouflage. Many seem to go for this style and bluster but some will come away feeling cheated and taken for fools (and not in any sort of a good way), it doesn't do to think too much about this type of superficial writing. Characters are bleak and over-the-top nasty, not leaving much (if anything) to admire."

It has the gorgeous talent of allegory, appealing to all, and to each at different levels. If you follow them all, the movie will bring a shiver to your spine when, as layers of reality, each as real as the next, are peeled away in this shrewed screen play, revealing men and man, women and woman, tragedy and joy.\n\nSo many fragments of the story mirror others: wife's and partners and girl-friends and Daedalus-like science... yet the film holds them all clear in mind. The film itself is finely crafted: gorgeous detailed sets reward the eye, and multiple viewings.\n\nThe casting is perfect: Bale at his driven, rather than simply raging best. Jackman, so brilliantly failed and jealous, Scarlet and Rebecca hall, in a partnership completely distinct from VIcky Cristina, but which must surely have alerted Woody Allen's eye.\n\nDavid Bowie is perfect and his own fame helps convey Tesla's own struggle with being ahead of his time. The presence of Andy Serkis (You MUST see him in Einstein and Eddington) is becoming a code for must-see movie.\n\nThis is, simply, one of the best movies of the decade."

The Prestige keeps you guessing throughout the movie and alternates the role of 'good guy' and 'bad guy' between the two protagonists with such subtlety that by the end you're not biased to one or the other character, rather, you understand where each of them is coming from. A strong story and good acting by both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make this film even more gripping. Scarlet Johanssen puts in her two cents...but is overshadowed by the male leads. I must say...one of the best films I've seen! 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "When Christopher Nolan made his debut into American cinemas with Memento, film-lovers witnessed the first rumblings of a creative genius who brought innovation and artistic flair to theaters with his unique visual and narrative style. Since that time, I've eagerly awaited each of his subsequent films with the hope that his unique cinematic style would continue to develop. I haven't been disappointed. In 2005, Mr. Nolan directed what many fans believe to be, arguably, the best of the Batman films, finding both critical and box-office success. As a surprise to those expecting a sequel to Batman Begins, Mr. Nolan has instead produced a subtly staggering film about personal and professional rivalry between two magicians. The Prestige finds Mr. Nolan again in top form and re-teaming with his Batman Begins star, Christian Bale.\n\nThe Prestige is an extremely complex film surrounding the conflict, jealousy and vengefulness that haunts two rival magicians. The story is told in a skewed timeline not unlike Memento. If anything, The Prestige's timeline is more intricate as the story shifts between several viewpoints and jumps around in time throughout the film. While this might sound confusing, this complex narrative never loses the viewer's attention or makes the movie less enjoyable. The multi-faceted approach instead pulled me in completely. It is one of my favorite films. As far as plot is concerned, I think it is best to omit most of The Prestige's details from this review as it relies heavily on numerous plot twists and surprises. I'd hate to ruin that for anyone. Suffice it to say, I found the subplot involving famed inventor Nikola Tesla to be a story-telling masterstroke. For those of you familiar with the inventions of Tesla, his involvement in the plot will be a definite highlight. It's also worthwhile to note that The Prestige has incredible replay value. This is a film that demands repeat viewings and delivers more surprises and depth with each look."

For starters, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Hugh Jackman perform magnificently, and will keep your eyes riveted to the screen. David Bowie was a nice surprise, and the recipient of a makeup job so convincing that my brother and I almost disbelieved it was he. Piper Perabo and Rebecca Hall are very convincing. Scarlett Johansson's performance is somewhat flat, but she makes up for it with sex appeal and flair.\n\nApart from the acting, the effects, sets, and ambiance of this film make for an excellent period piece. I was particularly enamored with the scenes in Colorado Springs. Simply spectacular.\n\nI will reiterate the conclusions of the aforementioned writers. This movie is a magic trick unto itself, with the magnificent writing and twist of plot.\n\nYou too, won't be disappointed if you go to see it. Leave Santa Clause 3, Deja Vu, Bobby, Borat, and Flushed Away in the theaters. If you can get out to see The Prestige, it is well worth it."

        "review_detailed_main": "From what I read about The Prestige in the paper, I was expecting an exciting, entertaining little movie from one of my favorite directors starring three of my favorite actors. So, rather casually, I drove up to a nearby theater with one of my friends to see it. I didn't expect a cinematic tour de force, but I suspected I would at least enjoy the experience.\n\nI can happily say it was the most pleasant surprise of my life. My mind was utterly blown by the dark, beautifully crafted masterpiece that seized control of my senses and not for a moment let go. The plot involves two magicians, Alfred Borden(Christian Bale), and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman), who were once partners but are flung down paths of revenge by a tragic event that may or may not have been an accident. From this relatively simple base, the movie spirals down into the abyss of obsession, competition, and plain hatred in a manner that will keep you guessing towards the end. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give magnificent performances, aided by a strong supporting cast including Michael Caine and David Bowie(!) Nolan's brilliant directing and Jackman's masterful acting shed light on Angier's obsession that eventually consumes his live, as he desperately seeks to unravel the mystery enshrouding his rival's ultimate act, 'The Transported Man.' The answer to the enigma will drop your jaw and send a cold shiver down your spine. The twists and turns in the deliciously convoluted plot are quite natural, not at all like the cheap gimmickry abounding in the works of M. Night Shymalan.\n\nStaged like an enormous magic trick, The Prestige keeps you guessing and, more importantly, questioning. I couldn't stop thinking about what I had seen for several days after I left the theater. The Prestige easily stands as one of the best movies of 2006. I sincerely hope it is given some serious consideration for some Oscars. In my mind, only Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' strikes me as a better movie.\n\n\" Are you watching closely?\""

The movie leads into unexpected moments, serious flashbacks, and edge-on-your-seat thrills. This film really tricked up my mind really well. There were many scenes in the movie that lead to twists and turns later on.

The effects are glorious, the performances were superb, the music is dark, the film editing is super, the art direction is superb and the cinematography is golden. With a brilliant cast portrayed by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, & David Bowie, a mind-bending script by the Nolan Brothers, and a powerful plot containing twists and turns, \"The Prestige\" is a marvelous Nolan masterpiece, and it never disappoints! \"The Prestige\", in my review, \"A mind-bending puzzle that's fun to watch again and again\"."

It is also cold, without feelings, thus leaving the spectator indifferent to the proceedings or the final outcome.\n\nSubsequently, it doesn't matter any more that the movie is well crafted, in some instances well acted (especially Michael Caine), none of these things can change the viewers' overall sensation of disappointment in watching this film.

Kudos to everyone involved but the three big names are these of Caine, Bale and Jackman (in that order). Phenomenaly presented witty screenplay, with unexpected twists and some really fresh humour. But make no mistake, this is not a comedy, the jokes will only make you feel a little bit more cosy. What you will also experience is a masterly Nolan-blend between reality and mysticism.\n\nThousand thumbs up for a genius at play! 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw the DVD cover for this film I was immediately drawn to buying it due to a combination of factors; Christopher Nolan to me is a great director with Momento a piece of art as far as I am concerned. I also consider Batman Begins to be the best of all the Batman films so far, maybe even the best comic book film so far. Christian Bale I also consider to be a fine actor and almost all his performances so far (which I have seen) have been the best I have seen for his age.\n\nI was not disappointed, my high expectations were met and at no point during the film did I become bored, the story moved along swiftly and the film did not rely on stereotypical portrayals of the period, Nolan actually made the period feel fresh.\n\nChristian Bale as usual gives a stellar performance and Jackman holds his weight as the supporting lead. I was not entirely convinced by Scarlett Johannson as she seemed quite wooden (and pouts her way through the film) in a role that relied on her looks, a special mention should go to David Bowie who was excellent and will hopefully appear in more serious acting roles.\n\nOverall greatly entertaining, not too confusing and deeply engaging."

Hugh Jackman is born in \"top class\" in England, meaning he would speak, & have an affluent aura during this time period. He would be forced to act, speak, eat & posses the mannerism of a low class working peasant, which would be exhausting and a magic act in itself.\n\nThe other big flaw is Bale's double & all prosthetics he wears as disguises. Caine's character is a master & experienced \"magician engineer\" who creates doubles. How can Caine & Hugh NOT see all the fake disguises on Bale's secret double, especially after capturing & interrogating him? Hollywood mission impossible style facial make up wasn't invented yet. Even if modern disguises were used, in real life, one can spot such disguises, especially bc they're BOTH magicians. Viewer gets to see plethora of facial fake parts in Bale's home, & they look truly fake. Last, Caine switching allegiance because he sees the truth at the end- Jackman has so much $$ & freedom due to his birthright, he could have kept his secret from Caine & the ending would've been very different.\n\nActing is excellent from entire cast. If one can not dwell on obvious plot flaws, this film is enjoyable & rewatchable."

Anyway the villain character's reactions to his false beliefs could not be captured then.

I felt the plot dives deeper than it really should have, there are some very absurd moments and the exaggeration took me out of the movie a bit.\n\nI also found the tone far too dark, it should have been a more light hearted look at the dedication of magicians, instead of going as far as to bring teleportation, cloning and suicide in to the story. While it can feel a bit pretentious, The Prestige is a really unique movie, worth the watch if you are looking for a good mystery.\n\nTwo magicians begin to feud after one performs the ultimate trick, teleportation.\n\nBest Performance: Christian Bale"

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's *The Prestige* is a spellbinding exploration of ambition, obsession, and the lengths to which we go for greatness. Set in the late 19th century, the film follows two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), who are locked in a fierce competition to create the ultimate stage illusion.\n\nNolan's masterful direction, coupled with a sharp and layered screenplay, draws the audience into a world filled with illusion and secrets. As the narrative unfolds, the film delves deep into the personal sacrifices each magician makes in their quest for supremacy, revealing the darker side of ambition and the complexities of duality. Themes of obsession and sacrifice are woven seamlessly throughout the story, keeping viewers engaged until the very last reveal.\n\nJackman and Bale deliver stunning performances, infusing their characters with depth, passion, and an unsettling intensity that mirrors their rivalry. The supporting cast, including Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson, adds richness to the narrative, further enhancing the film's depth.\n\nVisually, *The Prestige* is a feast for the eyes, with its atmospheric cinematography and period-appropriate set designs that transport viewers into the world of Victorian magic. The film's editing is particularly noteworthy, masterfully juxtaposing timelines in a way that heightens suspense and intrigue.\n\nWith its intricate storytelling and haunting score by David Julyan, *The Prestige* is not only a compelling tale of rivalry but also a meditation on the fine line between illusion and reality. The film leaves audiences pondering long after the credits roll, making it a must-see for fans of thought-provoking cinema and thrilling narratives."

        "review_detailed_main": "I found the most interesting part of this movie to be the behind the scenes look at some of the tricks used by illusionists and magicians. The broader story has great potential. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival illusionists in late 19th century London, whose rivalry goes beyond just a fun competition and becomes dangerously obsessive with ultimately tragic results. All that sounds pretty good, and both Jackman and Bale were solid in their roles as Angier and Borden respectively, as was Michael Caine as Cutter, Angeirs' assistant. Spoiling the story somewhat for me was a sort of mini-subplot about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Edison is never depicted in the movie, while Tesla is played by David Bowie of all people. That rivalry was very real of course but dissolves into a bit of a farce here, as Tesla has supposedly invented some sort of teleportation device that Angier wants to use in his show. A simple and obsessive rivalry would have been quite sufficient without that dive into sci-fi silliness. I also have to say that while the movie certainly had its strong points, for the most part the story just didn't take hold of me. I found it a little long and slow-paced at times, and in the last 15-20 minutes there just seemed to be too many twists and turns happening, which again took away from the story's credibility. In the end, my reaction was that this was OK, but nothing more. 5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Prestige is an entertaining thriller from writer/director Christpher Nothan the man behind films like Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. The Prestige is about two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden whose friendship turns into an intense rivalry that leads them on a life long battle for supremacy. Hugh Jackman stars as Angier and Christian Bale plays Borden who also worked with Nolan on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Jackman and Bale are great in their roles portraying men who are driven to be the greatest magician in the world. Michael Caine is fantastic as always playing Cutter a man who builds and constructs illusion tricks. Scarlet Johannssan is strikingly beautiful as both Angier's and Borden's lover assistant Olivia. She brings a lot to the small role she does have in the film. David Bowie also does a solid job with his role as brilliant scientist Nikola Tesla. The rest of the cast including Piper Perabo as Angier's wife Julia, Rebecca Hall as Bordens wife Sarah, and Andy Serkis as Telsa's friend Allie are believable in their supporting roles. Director Christopher Nolan does a great job with the period setting and the mood of the film. Even with a running time of 130 minutes the film is never slow which helps draw the audience into the story. The plot for the most part is complex but never complicated but does require a couple of viewings to full understand what the movie was all about. From the twists and turns to the superb acting The Prestige is an entertaining thriller that is sure to please anyone looking for a good film to watch."

Enter Christopher Nolan, and this is no longer the case.\n\nAs two friends' different philosophies on magic set tensions in motion, it is a tragic death that forever puts a wedge between them. A rivalry ensues between the more penetrating Borden (Bale) and the showman Angiers (Jackman). With three different time lines moving all at once through most of the movie, there's really never a moment's boredom. This storytelling is efficient and compelling.\n\nThere is enough foreshadowing throughout the movie to make one giddy. I loved how Nolan chose to focus much more on Borden's personal life than Priest did in the novel. All of the developing back story is gone, but what is gained is worth it in my opinion. Borden's wife, played by Rebecca Hall, was an unexpected treat. She certainly out-performed the other female lead. . .\n\nAt times, the movie was a little too enunciated, my reason for giving it a 9 and not a 10. Just a little more faith in the audience, especially at the very end, would have been nice.\n\nAs always, Bale was perfect. Cane was able to really shine as well, especially when reprimanding Angier at the end of the movie. A real surprise though was Hugh Jackman. Of X-Men and Kate and Leopald fame, I was more than worried for his quality of performance in this movie. Thankfully, there was never any reason to be, however. It wasn't till the very end when perhaps he was just a little too over the top (and he kind of earns it) that I thought, \"Wait, that's Hugh Jackman. Oh dear, good for him.\" Never for a second was I ever tempted to think of Wolverine or elevators.\n\nSplendid entertainment."

We start with Christian Bale (\"Borden\") about to swing for the murder of Hugh Jackman (\"Angier\") but of course it is not that simple; and through a series of complex flashbacks we discover just how these two, erstwhile friends and colleagues, got themselves into this predicament. This is a story about ambition, obsession - to succeed and to hate; it has elements of love - both men have relationships, one the cause of their estrangement; the other (with Scarlett Johansson) continues to fuel it. The whole nature of their profession - illusionists; conjurers of/to the imagination - lends itself splendidly to the subject of this vendetta. The look of the film is first class, with Wally Pfister creating a gem of vivid imagery with some wonderful visual effects too. The performances are OK - they are not great; the dialogue is likewise. For a film essentially about seeing being believing (or not) the script is frequently too wordy and overpowers the subtle opportunities for the actors to demonstrate rather than speak their parts. Sir Michael Caine probably brings the most authentic accent to the proceedings - the others left me needing quite a bit of convincing; and the brief appearances of David Bowie as Tesla were a poor choice of casting, I felt. This is a good film, and I enjoyed it - but I did need to watch it 4 times before I felt half way comfortable writing anything down about it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to this movie not completely sure what to expect. I knew it was directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) and starred Christian Bale (Batman Begins, American Psycho), Hugh Jackman (X-Men 1, 2, and 3), and Michael Caine (Batman Begins). I knew it was about magicians. I knew it looked cool as hell. This movie blew away all expectations. The acting was first rate and the direction, par for Christopher Nolan, was superb. This movie will definitely exercise your mind with more twists and turns than all of M. Night's combined. The quest for fame and one-upping a rival becomes an obsession that makes for a riveting piece of entertainment. Only Christopher Nolan could undertake such a complicated storyline and deliver it so perfectly. Definitely worth the seven bucks and two hours spent."

Creepy and dark, this movie is one of those films you just can pay close enough attention to--I can't imagine anyone having it figured out before the movie lets you in on its secret. I think that \"The Illusionist\" stole some of this film's thunder, and it's a shame--that film was nowhere near the masterpiece that this film is. I am waiting for this film to come out on DVD, just so I can watch it a few more times, being able to (hopefully) listen to the Nolans' commentary track."

Both actors are geniuses and deliver a powerful presence on-screen.

That title belongs to The Prestige, at least in my opinion. Featuring an amazing pairing of Jackman and Bale, and the hot off of critical failure Insomnia, Nolan's movie scorches from the beginning. Putting Tesla in as a historical anchor was pure brilliance, and with the aid of Tesla technology most of the illusions they pulled off could easily be done, even the shocking ending(s). Therefore, despite what some might say, this is all entirely realistic.\n\nIn fact, I think Nolan would be smart to re-visit Tesla and do a biopic, because there are few people as insanely weird and full of pure genius, in history, as Tesla was.\n\nOn the surface, this is a simple magician versus magician period piece, but it slowly evolves into a battle of wit between two incredibly driven men. The twists in this movie, the first time viewing, are nearly impossible to predict (unlike Inception/TDK), and everything comes together perfectly. One of the most under-rated movies, ever."

Christopher is quite deftly carving a name for himself among the best directors of this generation and has followed phenomenal movies such as Memento and Batman Begins with another masterpiece. There are not many directors who can boast of having their last 3 movies in the IMDb top 250 list.\n\nThe movie takes on an unusual tale of the story of 2 magicians and weaves a poignant drama around it. Full of suspense and mystery. Without revealing too much, I would implore all you viewers to give this movie a dekko, and you will not be disappointed. If the suspense of Memento intrigued you, if the dark and poignant drama of \"Batman begins\" thrilled you, then The Presitge, will take over and take you to a world of envy, jealousy, suspense, drama and yes .. prestige.\n\nEnjoy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's The Prestige tells the story of two rival magicians, Borden (Bale) and Angier (Jackman). The two battle over deceiving and outsmarting each other as they try to be the better magician. Spanning several years and often jumping backwards and forwards in time, The Prestige is a beautiful, brooding tale about obsession and how far it can and shouldn't go.\n\nBeing one of Christopher Nolan's more modest films (being made between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and on nowhere near a larger scale), The Prestige is one of those films that only those who pay attention understand it's true greatness. With a typical Nolan-esque cast (Christian Bale, Michael Caine\u0085), the film is setup for quality cinema and does not disappoint. From start to finish you are fixated and deprived of attachment to the world around you much like Borden and Angier as you too do not want to miss any of the films trickery.\n\nOne of the best things I like about The Prestige is how it deceives the viewer just as a magician would to their own audience. 'Are you watching closely?' a line which is repeated throughout The Prestige hints at the films very own nature. 'You want to be fooled,\" the last lines of the film as uttered by the legendary Michael Caine, leave the viewer in a bewildered state as they reconsider what they have just seen.\n\nThe cinematography is grand. DOP Wally Pfister who has worked on all of Nolan's films I believe, deserves just as much credit as the director himself. From the dark and electrifying theaters to the eerie Colorado Mountains, The Prestige looks fantastic.\n\nHaving seen the film several times and enjoyed each viewing as much as the next, The Prestige continues to amaze me. It truly is a mesmerizing and brilliant film which just cannot go unseen by anyone."

In addition to the great director, the cast selection is superb as well. Well, thankfully I'm not disappointed by this movie.\n\n\"The Prestige\" is filled with twists and turns. I think how you see the twists and turns will affect what you think of the movie eventually. Some people will be fascinated by them (like me), while others won't. Well, the story can be basically summarized to two themes, Deceit and Obsession. I thought Nolan chooses a great way to present the story. Though the back and forth narration may confused some people, I thought it really works well for the movie, teasing audience to figure out how the story really goes. I feel that the type of flashbacks here is different from those used in Nolan's \"Insomnia\" and \"Memento\", though they are effective for their respective movies.\n\nI watched the show with some book spoilers in mind. To those who had read the book, well, the story is rather different from the book. The ending especially. The movie does not mention about the descendants of the Magicians at all.\n\nHugh Jackman's and Christian Bale's acting are amazing. One supporting actor which I think stands out is David Bowie's Nikola Tesla. His charisma really makes his character interesting.\n\nLike other Nolan's movies, this movie is visually stunning. You won't be disappointed by its cinematography.\n\nDespite being a great movie, I don't think that this movie will be one of the major contenders for Oscar. The genre doesn't really suit well with Oscar type of movies.\n\nNevertheless, in my opinion, this movie is one of the best movies this year, and is definitely a must watch."

But, people seem to really identify more, these days, with characters that have no redeeming moral values, and are driven by their dark obsessions to the point of whatever-it-takes. A totally sad, sick, unsatisfying ending.\n\nOthers have said that one has to have intelligence, and a healthy attention span to enjoy this movie, and I would also add to that, a true interest in magic, and how it works. Though the real 'meat' of the film lay in the personalities, I felt they were suffocated by layers of intricate plot weavery of how the tricks were accomplished, and if you aren't interested in that? this can be a very long watch.

        "review_title": "A little confusing, but excellent performances make for an otherwise great all-around film",
        "review_detailed_main": "I was stoked to see The Prestige from the moment it first began gaining buzz. Hugh Jackman. Christian Bale. Scarlett Johansson. Michael Caine. Christopher Nolan. It just had the marks for something great, and the trailers only continued to perpetuate this ideally amazing film. While the film does deliver in many instances, I cannot help but feel that it was anywhere near as good as I could have imagined. Whether I hyped it up far too much or not, is up to interpretation.\n\nIt is the late 1800s, and magicians are the key theatrical acts in London. Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two up-and-comers who work together, and then instantly turn into rivals after a particularly devastating incident early in their careers. What follows is a tale of both men finding a means of one-upping each other at every turn, whether it be physically sabotaging the other person's act, using the sexy assistant Olivia (Johansson) to help get secret information, or gaining help from the even more secretive \"wizard\" Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, in a rare film appearance).\n\nThe thing about the film is that you have to pay attention at all times. It has moments where the film feels speedy, and others where it feels downright slow. But no matter what, something integral is always happening. Despite it being told in a particularly bizarre narrative structure (the present flashbacking to the past flashbacking even further into the past, and then back again), the film follows the key three-part magic act sequence (which any trailer fan should probably already know about). The film suffers here because it does not really stay consistent with the direction it wants to go in, and becomes a bit confusing and inane as a result. It may be a bit of a struggle to grasp the structure at first, but slowly becomes more easily accessible. At times it works strongly, but in others, it just feels like it wants to toy with the audience and do nothing else. We know every little detail matters, but should the material not be a little more solidified than it is? A bit of extra padding and focus here could have helped greatly.\n\nBeing a period piece, you can see the great care and devotion taken to ensure that the film looks like it is occurring at the turn of the twentieth century. It may be dark, but there is just enough light to shine through and make everything all the more colourful. The costumes are all lavishly gorgeous, as are the backdrops and set pieces. It feels distinctive and authentic, but not to the point of being overkill. The score is just about perfect, and the editing really helps to act as the drive of the film. The great British accents are all highly in tune with the rest of the feeling of the film as well, even from the American actors.\n\nJackman and Bale are excellent in their respective roles. Right from the start, you can tell these two are steering towards destruction, and as their characters slowly move into becoming downright evil, it becomes even more of a pleasure for the audience to watch. They play off each other well in their scenes together, and their presences are downright smoldering. These young actors really show off their chops, and show off the deeper range that only a few select modern actors can even pray to be able to show. While I really enjoy Jackman as an actor, I cannot help but realize this is one of his deepest roles yet. He's very striking in the role, but at times you can see that this is one of his first real attempts at doing so. Bale on the other hand, can add this right next to his already brooding library of ranged works (his most astonishing being his turn in American Psycho), and looks like he is right at home with the material. I know they probably will not get recognition during the awards season, but I can only hope this is a taste of things to come from both of them.\n\nCaine is great as the wise manager character that he has perfected over the years, and Bowie's small performance is practically intoxicating. He does not play the character up too much, but he plays it with just the right amount of intensity demanded. He is complemented by Andy Serkis, who thankfully plays a real-life character and not one made totally out of CGI. It was something different to actually see him literally acting, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it be just as good, if not better, than his CGI-work. Although they only have so much they can do, the three main female characters, Johansson, Piper Perabo, and newcomer Rebecca Hall all perform excellently, and work well off their co-stars. I would have liked to have seen a bit more material being used by these three, but they really stand up well against their much more heavily used male co-stars.\n\nInevitably, the comparison to this year's \"other magician\" film, Neil Burger's The Illusionist, must come up, and thankfully, it works at about the same level. They both have strong acting (although the female acting is far superior here), a good storyline, and beautiful sets. If anything, The Prestige feels like it wants to accomplish more than it can handle. Thankfully, it does not become too overbearing, but some of the confusion the film generates really does detract from it.\n\nAlthough not as good as Memento or Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan has added another strong film to his short resume, and continues to prove his worth in Hollywood. I can only hope that the audience does not get too overly distracted by the film's structure problems, and can truly appreciate this all-around great film.\n\n8/10."

If you have read any reviews from people that said that they couldn't follow the plot or are unsure as to what the true ending meant or anything to do with confusion in the plot they are people that need to go back and watch the movie again. This plot is very intelligent, but when you pay attention - the pay off is grand. Brilliant film making, I look forward to seeing this movie again. This is the best film I have seen this year and the fact that I feel so strong about it is why I came to this website to write about it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Prestige\" is by far one of the best films I have seen in recent months. The actors pulled together a finely written script, and the directing was seamless. Many movies throw in \"plot fillers\" just to make up time or fill in some blank space due to lack of...something - but Christopher Nolan not only tied all the loose ends together, he threw in far more than normal and still managed to clean it up by the time the credits rolled. Yes, it makes you think, but it also makes you 'feel' the movie itself. Jackman and Bale played their roles to a \"T\" and I can't speak highly enough of them. And of course Michael Caine was brilliant. I've never been a big fan of Johansson, but I feel she really did pull this character from the pages of the script and make her real. Piper Parabo was also a fully dimensional character...a big step up from Violet Sanford.\n\nTwo days later and this movie is still running through my mind in vivid images. Excellent."

        "review_detailed_main": "I did something tonight that I have never done before. I saw a first run movie, twice in the same weekend. I can't remember the last time I've seen two first run movies in the same weekend (I suspect it was in high school), I do remember the last time I saw the same movie twice in theaters (Memento).\n\nAs everyone who knows me know, I'm a serious Christopher Nolan fan. Ever since I saw Memento I've been hailing him as the second coming of Alfred Hitchcock, and have the full expectation that when his career is said and done he will be universally recognized certainly as the greatest director of his time, possibly of all time. Greatness is often achieved by making a single innovation in your craft and repeating it with increasingly mastering execution. No one has ever used non-sequential time lines as effectively as Nolan did with Memento, and my one reservation about his place in Hollywood history has been that that style could never be as masterfully used in another film again... that his second work could never be equaled, let alone surpassed.\n\nThe Prestige has reinforced my confidence in my initial assessment. The flash backs he used in Begins showed that he has an understanding of the technique that is unrivaled, however the use of it was not nearly as complex as it was in his early works. Prestige more follows his first work, The Following's, use of non-sequential time than Memento's in that the ordering of the scenes is very complex, by far his most complex yet. Not only are the scenes ostensibly randomly arranged, but also in parallel following the thoughts of two men at the same time. But of course the arrangement is not random, the order is there specifically to misdirect the audience... much like the magicians in the film do when performing their tricks.\n\nBut it goes beyond misdirection, the scenes themselves are very powerful imagery investigating guilt, sacrifice and obsession... but the time line adds to that as well. Following seemed to use this style to add to the suspense and give the audience a little puzzle to figure out, Memento used them to do all that and force the audience to feel like the protagonist, The Prestige uses it to do everything that Memento did only the protagonist is not on screen, it is audience. With ever twist and turn you feel the mystique of a magic show, scratching your head not at how anything particular on screen happened, but how the story could come together like it does.\n\nThe most amazing thing is I still can't figure out how Nolan does it, the emotions Memento and Prestige invoke when seeing them for the first time is pure ecstasy, I know of nothing that can do the same. When its over you wish you could forget everything you just saw and watch it again just to feel that way again and again. But then you watch it again anyhow, because it was so phenomenal with the expectation of not being nearly as good as the first time, and you see all the little things you missed the first time around and just marvel at the mastery of it all and get a chance to look back into the crowd and watch their jaws drop as pieces of the puzzle fall into place.\n\n9/10: Not quite Memento but close. My only misgiving is was I was I had the puzzle together enough to see the big picture about half way through the film, although I know only one person thus far who has had the same experience. Expect to see lots of 10's on this one, they're well deserved."

        "review_detailed_main": "What might audiences find when peeking behind the curtain on this vaudeville act? A tense period piece, maybe a transcontinental thriller or perhaps a meditation on movie magic? This dense turn-of-the-century tale is all of those and more, proving Christopher Nolan to be a Hollywood heavy-hitter way back in 2006, and captivating audiences with its spell-binding and complex method for nearly two decades. Assembling his A-team of now-celebrated collaborators for this study on stage sleight-of-hand, such as cinematographer Wally Pfister and production designer Nathan Crowley, the British director is in true command of his craft for the film's somewhat-bloated 130 minutes, at times confounding and confusing viewers due in no small part to its marquee misdirection and sluggish pace. Leading lads Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale steal the show in dual roles as duelling magicians across three acts, daring audiences to sympathise with each protagonist as they pursue Faustian-like pacts with deadly consequences. Michael Caine and David Bowie are deserving of much praise, but sadly Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson find their talents wasted in under-written roles, did someone say dead wife trope? One-upmanship, pride and obsession are the name of the game during the pledge, turn and eponymous prestige, but the film flounders as it covers far too much thematic territory for its own good, and refuses to settle for any singular focus. Peeling back its layers reveals a fractal filmmaking style, trademark elliptical editing and marvellous use of mise en abyme, all of which would be improved in later Nolan features, yet this experience does demand your attention and encourage repeat viewings where keen eyes hope to spot every trick. Abracadabra.\n\n7/10 black cats and top hats."

The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing, right up until the last seconds of the film. These last few seconds will make you say \"Wow, I get it now\" and you will realize that Innocent scenes earlier in the film have significant importance. The special effects are great and the acting is very well done. The movie draws many parallels with another recently released \"magician\" film - The Illusionist, but the action and intensity of The Prestige makes for a more exciting and enjoyable experience. A backstage view of how some magic tricks are done also adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended, definitely worth the price of admission."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching a movie ten times is stupid. Unless, of course, that movie is The Prestige. When my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to watch it again, I was more than happy to acquiesce. You may be wondering how someone's attention could be held after watching a movie so many times. It can be summed up, quite simply, by the fact that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director. He manages to take a movie that has one of the most simple themes and build an intricate plot around it. The movie focuses on the competition between two magicians as they each strive for supreme success. Along the way, they each face the hardships of death and the slow decline into obsession with their work. In one of the most influential scenes of the movie, one of the characters is begged to give up his quest for greatness because it will only bring him sorrow. He, of course, does not heed this warning, but I will not go deeper into that to avoid spoilers. Along with the way Christopher Nolan developed a brilliant plot, he did an incredible job of casting his roles. Hugh Jackman plays one of the magicians, Robert Angier, and Christian Bale was cast as his competitor, Alfred Borden. Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie each contribute vital side characters and stories. Ultimately, this movie was created to get your mind thinking in ways that are very far outside of the box. There are some supernatural events, yet it is easy to relate to certain characters in the film. One of my girlfriend's complaints was that she did not know who she was supposed to like in the movie, but I think that was Nolan's purpose. He wanted the viewer to look at the film from all perspectives and not be fixated on just one of them. I don't even like writing a review for this movie because it is one that almost needs to be entered with a completely open mind."

About 99.9% of movies that I watch, I guess at every turn what will happen but this movie will kept me wondering until the end... The acting is superb as Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are pitted against each other as rival magicians. I'm unable to see any other actors other than Bale and Jackman in the characters they played.

The acting is spot-on, with Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and co. becoming completely submerged in their roles, and the plot is wrapped in a thick, foggy sense of mysticism and intrigue, with parts of it mixed and matched accordingly to build up a level of dramatic tension that most movies couldn't dream of possessing. It grows higher and higher, like Jack's beanstalk, until the ending, which will floor you like no other film has since The Shawshank Redemption or Requiem for a Dream. The Prestige, when you look back, will take something out of you that can't be so easily replaced. My highest recommendation."

Using rather obvious ploys (like phony beards and wigs, not to mention Scarlett Johansson as an assistant/secret agent), they each work as much on sabotaging the other's latest success as developing their own skills. This fantastic tale, directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan from the novel by Christopher Priest, might have bowled us over with a few cunning twists; unfortunately, the baffling screenplay reminds one more of H. G. Wells than \"Sleuth\", coming up with a bag of tricks so far-fetched it removes the film's core of inherent reality. The film is remarkably well-dressed and crafted, although the jumpy editing at the start (darting around in time before settling into a more conventional mode of storytelling) is rather a nuisance. The acting is solid throughout, even as the plot-gimmicks become more and more ridiculous, leading to a depressing and flat conclusion. **1/2 from ****"

With his ability to use flashbacks and mixing the past with the present, Mr.Nolan makes those watching the movie, his audience. The Pledge is simple, two magicians; Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) are set to out-do one another. But it seems as if every step the movie takes is The Turn of the whole trick and you must ask yourself, are you watching closely?. The Prestige is where you will be left mesmerized and trying to connect the dots.At times, it may seem as if the movie is moving too fast or if it's too hard to grasp but believe me, when the final curtain is drawn, you will know everything."

Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rivals in the aforementioned field, and develop an acid antagonism when Borden 'accidentally' allows Angier's wife to die suspended in a tank of water. Their vengeance soars on a level both personal and professional, with each vying for the other's popularity, women, and magical secrets. At the core of this is a trick of which no one knows the key--titled 'The Transported Man,' it entails Borden teleporting himself from one place to another; Angier meets up with eccentric electro-magician Tesla (David Bowie), who seems to hold the answer.\n\nDirector Chrisopher Nolan, who surprised us with \"Memento\" and rejuvenated the ailing \"Batman\" franchise, gives us another worthy, highly entertaining film poised for greatness...until the last 5 minutes. In his remake of \"Insomnia,\" Nolan's characters became slavish victims to the plot, and the same happens at the end of \"The Prestige.\" After bobbing and weaving in a multitude of directions and keeping us guessing AND fully invested in the characters, it betrays our trust completely and leaves us with the sour notion that everything that happened in the preceding 2 hours didn't matter all that much.\n\nIn a movie that pushes the figurative and literal limits of trickery, it seems like a low-brow deception for Nolan to leave us with the last-minute twists that would be more at home in the \"Saw\" series. Bale, Michael Caine, and Jackman (giving his best performance yet) are so strong--and their dispositions so absorbing--that the ending feels like the sort of dishonest fraud we'd get from a Three-Card Monte dealer. Yes, despite the maddening contrivances, \"The Prestige\"'s twists DO make sense--but I felt the characters deserved a more sincere, straight-faced coda.\n\nIn \"Secret Window,\" Johnny Depp told us: \"The most important part is the ending...and this one is very good.\" Too bad the same can't be said for \"The Prestige,\" a movie that is so passionately bound for greatness that its last-minute deceptions make the disappointment that much greater."

Magicians are famous for tricking the public into believing something that's not real. Well, that's exactly what Nolan achieves with his script. It's so meticulously thought that it's almost perfect.

A scientific prophet maybe. He claimed that concepts for many of his inventions simply appeared to him in his mind's eye or in a dream. A long explanation of Tesla's life could be made by somebody with sufficient knowledge, which I don't have. But I do have faith - that he was a man who knew things that have changed and will continue to change the world and the way that we think.\n\nThe film is a truth puzzle. To understand the film, is to understand that there are concepts and ideas that have been repressed from us, to be free from the fear of uncertainty, and to embrace the vast pool of possibility and discovery that is humanity's gift. The film addresses the two polar characteristics of man - his ability to be logical, and his ability to be emotional - and merges them into a mutually exclusive relationship. That is, one cannot exist without the other.\n\nFor those who are at odds with the film - the prestige of our lives is the discovery of truth, and I encourage those who wish to understand it's message. Hell, it's worth it. I love this film, and the passion put into it by the actors and other artists. It defines the age we live in, and is an elaborate and magnificent portrait of our collective soul in this modern age."

In most movies I can figure out the ending well before the movie is over this one I could not, I was still trying to figure it out after the movie was over. This is the type of movie that as soon as you finish seeing it you will want to see it again. This is a type of movie that you must pay attention throughout the entire film. I was one the edge of my seat and my friend next to me was scratching his head and stomping his feet with excitement after the film was over. I would recommend this film to everyone and especially to those who are into psychological thrillers. This film has Oscar written all over it."

The great magicians aren't remembered for \"clever tricks\" - rather, for the overall entertainment, for the illusion.\n\nAnd this film is perfect for all that. There is a mystery to it (in fact, at least two mysteries), but the clues to each are telegraphed all throughout the film, in plain sight. You have to watch and be alert.\n\nI figured out one of the mysteries in the middle of the film, but was still fascinated by how it was done. I think this is the same thrill I get when I'm watching a film about con artists (or a good episode of the old Mission Impossible), because what is shown is not always what is.\n\nAnd as this film explains, it's not how such things are done that matters (because once it's explained, no one cares any more), rather, it's that creation of illusion so that we have \"mystery\", that does."

There are no notable performances even though the cast consists of some of the most famous actors working today. Only David Bowie and Hugh Jackman make somewhat of an impression. The film is heavy-going and long. Nolan continues to aim for the noir look, but he can't capture it well in his film projects. So the film ends up being too dark and somber for its own good. The ending is meant to be clever, but with Nolan's direction it doesn't feel that way. Still, it's a solid release overall. There's nothing to distinguish it, however. Like all other films by Nolan it's overrated. He is not a great filmmaker. This is a man who's been influenced by Ridley Scott and the Wachowski brothers. He rarely comes up with anything original, and just continues to copy them. I don't recommend watching The Prestige. The magic tricks here are nothing to get excited about. Nolan erroneously aims for realism, but this approach leaves a bad taste in the mouth. This is far from being anywhere near Steven Spielberg's genius."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's always nice to see a director-actor duo collaborate in successive projects, especially when they can be removed from the massive studio work situation that surrounds a film like Batman Begins, which is where we find Nolan and Bale, filling in time between Bat films. A subsequent pairing allows the director and actor to further their relationship and speak in a kind of shorthand, bringing their collaboration to new heights. Think of Scorcese-DeNiro and Scorcese-DiCaprio, or Spike Lee-Denzel Washington for examples of this.\n\nThe term relationship is key, as The Prestige centers around the relationships the characters have with each other and what is perceived as their connective tissue plays both within and beyond the film. The audience is placed in a very strategic position of both knower and seeker of knowledge, and like a good magic trick, it is what we perceive and expect that will equally guide us and trick us towards the final act, or what is referred to in magic circles, as \"The Prestige\".\n\nNolan's previous work (Memento, Following, Insomnia) has built upon his manipulation of audience engagement with film texts, and tweaking our sophisticated knowledge as viewers in such a way that our work as an audience helps propel the film as we are forced to guess, then second guess our preconceived notions of where his films are headed. Without recognizing our intelligence as an audience, the film would have no place to go.\n\nThe psychology of Nolan's films are like that of a masterful storyteller, akin to Robertson Davies' Fifth Business set of novels. The make up and structure of the medium, whether it is writing or film-making, or magic tricks, is key to the enjoyment of the medium's content. We are well aware as we watch The Prestige, how the film unfolds in three acts, exactly as the magic pieces are described in the film. It is both a pleasure to behold on a story level, as well as a film level. Technically, it is parlaying exactly what it is being mystically told as the plot develops. This movie is a classic example why film schools exist.\n\nWithout giving too much away, this film is a pleasure on many levels, and worth subsequent viewings to fully appreciate and explore. The cast is perfect, as Bale and Jackman play two anti-heroes, whose sides we can easily assume or oppose, depending on how one reads the film and the characters' motives. Johansson plays a wonderful femme fatale, who we never can quite trust. Is she part of the illusion, or the only source of truth? Where does Caine's character's loyalties lie? His performance may perhaps be the best of the bunch, another testament to how prior work with a director leads to greater performances in their own ability to work in shorthand with each other.\n\nIf you can't tell by my tongue tied review, this film has volumes to speak about. Another thought provoking piece to add to Nolan's young but impressive resume.\n\nGrade: A"

With involvement from his brother, Jonathan Nolan, the duo are able to recreate the suspense and complexity as shown in Memento, intriguing the audience as they are brought deeper and deeper into the story.\n\nThis is story-telling at its finest.

If I am honest, I was slightly disappointed.\n\nThe movie is stylish and very well filmed and the acting is also mostly fine. Of the two leads, Hugh Jackman is definitely better and gives probably the best performance in the movie. On reflection, Christian Bale isn't that great and his accent really seems put on and not natural. Michael Caine is fine and Scarlett Johansson is mostly OK, though she doesn't always convince. There is also a nice little cameo from David Bowie. The effects are clever and the actual story is pretty good. So why wasn't I more blown away with this film? I think that the movie relies a great deal on the twist or twists and I could kind of see them coming a mile off and this certainly diminished some of the impact. I also felt that the movie was trying too be just a little too clever at the end, trying to fit in too many twists.I didn't get ALL of them but certainly the most important ones. Obviously,I won't even hint at the outcome and it is fun trying to work out the story before it reaches it's conclusion.\n\nThis is a movie worth watching but it may not live up to your expectations."

It lacks the smooth illusionist's quality that allows us to suspend disbelief and be deceived or dive in and accept the illusion. Instead it bumps along and tries to bully us into believing that we were just fooled.\n\nThe greatest success of the movie is the creation of the period. The costumes, sets and scenery do an excellent job of putting us in the setting. Visually, the movie is excellent.\n\nDr. Tesla's scientific solution is a horrible plot contrivance that turns a mediocre movie into a something worse. The result of the experiment fails to surprise or shock. The \"trick\" can be seen coming at us. Personally, I wanted be wrong and hoped there would be some final plot twist that would surprise and redeem this movie. There wasn't.\n\nThis movie fails to come together. As the film draws to a conclusion, it is very hard to care which character will win. Both are reprehensible enough that it is just too late to care what happens.\n\nThe Prestige is just frustrating to sit through for all the wrong reasons."

        "review_detailed_main": "The trailers for The Prestige carefully concealed it as a light-hearted film about a magician- nothing more, nothing less.\n\nI did not expect the dark, deep, and involving film that played out after I popped in my DVD.\n\nThe opening lines, narrated by Michael Caine who plays the patron magician \"Cutter\", are a big key to understanding the movie. Cutter explains that there are three important parts to a magic trick- the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Throughout the movie you will see how this law applies, as the \"secrets\" to some of the tricks are revealed.\n\nThe second part of the beginning of the movie follows. We see Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) trapped in a water-filled glass tank below stage, struggling to get out. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) goes underneath the stage and discovers him there. The movie then skips ahead to a trial, in which Alfred Borden is being charged for the murder of Robert Angier- he evidently drowned to death in the tank. Alfred Borden is found guilty of murder and sentenced to die.\n\nA rich lord sends a messenger stating that he will take care of Borden's young daughter in exchange for the secret to Borden's greatest trick. The messenger is also sent to give Borden Angier's diary.\n\nThat, is how our story really begins. We see through the point of view of Robert Angier as Borden reads through the diary.\n\nRobert Angier and Alfred Borden worked together underneath Cutter, until a tragic accident caused them to go their separate ways. Some time after they separated, Alfred Borden released an amazing trick. Angier, consumed with jealousy, did everything inside his power to find the secret to the trick. In fact, he began to doubt that it was a trick at all, but rather \"true magic. He was in constant competition with Borden, always trying to outdo him as a magician.\n\nHugh Jackman does an excellent job in portraying Angier's passions, delusions, and melancholy. He completely blew me away with its vibrant showing of his true talent in this movie. After seeing the X-men films, I was almost certain that he was trapped as Wolverine, but when you watch this movie you will think absolutely nothing of Wolverine and absolutely everything of Robert Angier.\n\nChristian Bale, as always, was also excellent. I have not seen an actor so diverse, so adept at playing a variety of completely different roles in as long since perhaps Johnny Depp. Yet Christian Bale even outshines Johnny in that department. You will be reminded as little of him as Batman as you will of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He truly put on the character and he put him on with brilliance.\n\nThe entire movie is a mystery up to the very end. We do not know if perhaps the rivalry did get out of control and Borden murdered Angier, or if Borden's magic is real and not just another clever illusion. What I can tell you, however, is that the conclusion will shock you, and you will be talking about, and thinking about the movie for long after the credits roll."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had been anticipating this movie ever since it was announced it would be at the helm of Christopher Nolan and written by his brother Jonathan (me, being a big fan of Memento), and became even more excited when i first saw the trailer. It looked serious, moody ,dark and just plain interesting.\n\nUpon seeing it a week ago, i wasn't let down. At all.\n\nI don't need to write down the whole damn summary for this movie, many others have already done that.\n\nIf you haven't seen this already, i'll just say that your in for a thrilling, dark, sad, violent,complex and enormously satisfying heck of a movie.\n\nThe thing is just very well acted through. Bale and Jackman are good as they normally are, and they aren't presented as one-note characters as i've read elsewhere. Their characters have motives for their actions, no matter how unjustified and cruel they are, and it doesn't make it seem like we should pity them for that, no, both guys almost hit the bottom of morality here. Michael Caine does a standard role for him here as the Angier's assistant, but he brings his usual charm and his always good acting chops. Perabo and Johanssen are beauties to behold,and both do a good job, though their roles are minor, especially Scarlett's. Hall is good too, and carries a shocking and very sad aspect of the film very well. And David Bowie as Tesla is one of the coolest cameos,ever.\n\nThe movie itself may be confusing, as it uses misdirection to present situations out of chronological order, but it's never too confusing, you get the time to organize every situation in time for the finale. The only grip i had with the movie, at least at first, was that it started very slowly and took it's damned sweet time on every minor event, and you might loose some of the initial interest or excitement you had.But at least 45 min. into it, it sets itself on overdrive and never lets you go.\n\nOh, and it looks bad ass. The production values are utterly amazing.\n\nJust go see it, forget about infamously obvious twist ending, just let yourself in, put your butt cheeks in the damn seat and let the film surprise you and, well, entertain you."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you compare the book to the movie, the book is actually better. A month before \"The Prestige\" was released I started reading Christopher Priest's award winning book of the same name. I was totally engrossed in it, not only was it a page turner, but it also was an extremely fun read. Not once did I think, \"Oh wow, this is getting boring,\" like most books I read. I was even thinking of writing a review of it because it was so well written, but instead I'll tell you now, READ IT! The book was extremely different from the film, director Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) took a lot of liberties. But since the two are so different I won't compare them anymore, I'll just talk about the movie.\n\nMagicians Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are the best of friends until Borden accidentally kills Angier's wife during a magic show. They part ways, but Angier is suddenly obsessed with taking revenge on Borden. He sabotages one of Borden's shows and ends up wounding him. Now Borden wants revenge. What follows is a series of one-upmanship between the two rivals.\n\nJackman and Bale are brilliant as always, showing the madness of these characters and their need for revenge. Michael Caine plays a mentor-like character named Cutter with a strong cockney accent, and does amazing. The other actors; Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie, are all noteworthy holding their own against the great acting chops of Jackman, Bale, and Caine. One thing that confused me though, it is never really explained why they go to such lengths to hurt the other, when it was an accident to begin with. This was explained in the book, but not in the film. Everything else though was masterfully crafted, and well explained. The cinematography, the somewhat grainy look, the dark and sometimes humorous approach of the film are all trademarks of Chris Nolan. He showed he could direct with \"Batman Begins\" \u0096which also starred Bale and Caine- and he has shown it again with \"The Prestige\". It is a fun film, with plenty of twists and turns, and is a great way to spend a Saturday night. Oh, and if you didn't catch my drift before, read the book as well. I give \"The Prestige\" 9 out of 10. It is rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a long time since I saw a film where I was so hooked on the story. The Prestige has a plot so full of twists and turns it merits several viewings - and even then there will be arguments over who did what - but I can honestly say that it is so engrossing that I enjoyed every minute of it again and again. What I really admire is the way everything - every word spoken, every action - was linked throughout the story. Nothing is wasted.\n\nI have seen the film criticised for being too cold and calculating. Maybe some of the characters come across in this way, but this isn't a film that wears it's heart on it's sleeve. It's not a romance. I think it goes deeper than that and asks questions about life and what we think are prepared to sacrifice."

        "review_detailed_main": "After a slow start, during which I was tempted to walk out of the movie (but I did not, because I'd read positive reviews here), \"The Prestige\" did cast its spell over me.\n\n\"The Prestige\" is visually lush, with high production values. Ornate Victorian coaches, gleaming beaver-skin top hats, high and low rent theaters and slums are recreated in glorious, or inglorious, as appropriate, detail.\n\nThe actors are all fine. Scarlett Johansson did not annoy me as she usually does; the director got a real performance out of her, as well as got her to wear her usual revealing neckline. Hugh Jackman is well cast as a man with a charming surface and a dangerous, secret interior life. I've never seen Michael Caine more appealing. He's the older mentor character here, and he doesn't seem so much to be performing as just being.\n\nChristian Bale is riveting as a young, scary, ambitious Cockney magician.\n\nI wasn't crazy about David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. (His name *was* \"Nikola,\" not \"Nicholas.\") I think of Bowie as a man who shocks, and he was uninteresting here. Tesla is an historical figure who lived a fascinating, controversial life, and I just didn't see much of that on screen. And Bowie's accent was all wrong; it was a big deal that Tesla was a Serb. Depicting him with a Dutch accent, as Bowie seemed to be doing, is kind of like depicting an African American historical figure as a WASP.\n\nAndy Serkis, as Tesla's assistant, was one of the most fun things to watch in the whole movie. I kept thinking, as I was watching him, \"Who is that guy? Have I seen that guy before? Whoever he is, he is really fun to watch.\" Dang if it wasn't Gollum, from LOTR.\n\nThe movie offers a few tidbits from the world of magic -- a cameo by famed NY stage magician and historian of magic, Ricky Jay; discussions of how various tricks were performed; magic lore. But this is never heavy handed, and though I'm bored by discussions of stage magic, these scenes didn't put me off.\n\nThe plot -- well, I can't say anything about the plot. Part of the reason for watching the movie is the pleasure of attempting to work out the puzzle as you watch the film.\n\nThe plot is a device to depict two men going at each other's throats, and losing their own souls by doing so. Ambition, Envy, Pride, Competition, Secretiveness, Obsession: lotsa big themes we can all relate to, whether we are Victorian magicians or not.\n\nWhat was missing, for me, in this otherwise quite excellent movie, was any emotional depth.\n\nA couple of examples.\n\nIn his early scenes, I had a hard time believing Hugh Jackman as a hungry young magician. He is in his late thirties, and he looks it.\n\nHis character is married to a much younger woman, who is blonde and pretty, and passive, as a doll. She's little more than fringe on the stage. I had a hard time believing their marriage. Given the importance, to the plot, of their union, this inability to invest in their marriage was almost fatal to my ability to invest in the movie.\n\nA key female character's suicide rang false to me for a couple of reasons. This was a very likable character, and her suicide threw the movie terribly off. Her suicide was never reacted to with any appropriate depth. At that point, the movie really did seem like too much of a wind-up toy that existed only to serve its trick ending.\n\nThis is especially unfortunate, because a key line, \"I love you today,\" and its ultimate meaning, speaks volumes about the nature of love.\n\nPoor Scarlett Johansson, who may never overcome the curse of her lush body and director's urges to exploit it, is made to fall in love a couple of times, and her only motivation for taking this monumental step is that she is given seconds-long scenes in which she looks into a man's eyes and -- SNAP! -- falls in love.\n\nWith just a little work and a few more lines of dialogue and action to fully animate its female characters, \"The Prestige\" could have been that most perfect of creations, a movie that entertains both men and women. For primarily male viewers, there is the clockwork plot and the cutthroat competition. For female viewers, there could have been fully realized characters, including fully realized female characters, inhabiting a film that has a heart as well as a crafty little head hiding schemes.\n\nInstead, the only real warmth in the movie comes from Michael Caine, the wise old man whom directors love in a way that they could never love disposable young female beauties like Scarlett Johansson, and a movie that this viewer could very much like, but never love."

        "review_title": "Did you watch it closely?",
        "review_detailed_main": "After some of the reviews this film was receiving from the popular press i was quite reticent in going to see it, my major motivation for going was namely the direction of Christopher Nolan and the extremely accomplished acting of Christian Bale, however after i finished watching this film i was nothing but shocked, amazed and truly humbled by one of the greatest pieces of film-making i have seen in rather a long time.\n\nI would like to start my review by saying this film is NOT and i repeat NOT about the revelation of the trick and how it was achieved. I have read some rather snooty and sniping comments levelled at this film and how they state that they saw the twist coming from a mile off....that is the point, there are enough clues throughout the film to show the spectator what is going to happen and Nolan does not hide these facts, they are there for a reason and i will not give the true reason away, all i will say is that if you know what makes Psycho and the Usual Suspects such masterpieces then you will know why The Prestige is a film of such ilk.\n\nNot only does this film have such a strong story it also sets itself in such a believable period of time, no expense is spared on the set design, the cinematography and editing has all the hallmarks and contemporary feel of a Nolan film, however it adds a haunting and almost tangible feel of impending dread throughout. The immediacy of the film meant as a spectator i was never left flagging and i was shocked to realise that this film was 2 hours and 20 plus minutes long as it felt i had barely sat in my seat before the credits rolled at the end, such the power of this film is that it felt that i had been on a journey with the main protagonists and came out of it a different person.\n\nMy one concern of this film was the performance of Scarlett Johannsen. I am aware that she is in the film as part of the exposition, however she is that bad and her abilities are that wooden that i still sit here in amazement in how she can still get work in Hollywood, however that is just a small point and thankfully her part is limited.\n\nIn conclusion i feel that this film will be misinterpreted a lot and if you you like your twists in the Saw or Seven vein (good films that they are) then i feel that you will be left disappointed, however if you want to see a masterpiece of film technique and true grandiose themes then The Prestige will be for you, I watched it closely and i got the point...so the question is did you?"

The twist ending in this is phenomenal and mind-bending... the first time. Once you know the twist, however, it seems like the film has no point. Watch it once, have your mind blown and then just let that be the film experience you associate with this film, because the second time is just disappointing."

I didn't even recognize David Bowie, who plays Tesla. It was a creepy movie and at times I had to close my eyes. This movie isn't suitable for young children under 13. It involves drowning, shooting and chopping off parts of the body. It has some scary parts, but my 11 year old brother was fine. I would only recommend children that young go if they are mature enough to handle the scary parts. Parents, go see the movie next and then judge to see if it is suitable for your children. Teens, this movie is made for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Prestige\" will keep you guessing what's coming next. It's one of those movies you just want to know the answer straight away but still beg for more clues. It's exciting, twisted, smart and well written. See it.\n\nIn the world of illusion, Borden and Angier will become enemies after one of their tricks goes incredibly wrong. Their rivalry will go past any limit, reaching further to accomplish the best trick and reveal all of their enemy's secret.\n\nThanks to Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman, the basic duel that is drawn throughout the film is stunningly acted and enigmatic, with classy gestures and smooth performance of dialogs. Christopher Nolan revives the era with delicious decorations and use of dampened tones, which gives the film an intense and pushy aura. The rivals are primarily interested in the \"living\" on the act, where the best trick is to deceive the audience into inflicting doubts to them and carrying them away from the truth.\n\nMichael's Caine character (who does a great role also) states that the magic is formed by three parts: the turn, which presents ordinary things to attract the audience, the pledge to transform this into something extraordinary and the prestige; the most important act, to blow them away.\n\nIt's end is clever and has many levels to understand it. It will all fall as a puzzle. The film, as it should, shields a fantastic Prestige. A turn of the table that will leave you gasping and clapping.\n\nWatch it, it's a nice puzzle to watch being solved. Just let the magic flow."

        "review_detailed_main": "The second magic related stories to be released in just over a month.\n\nChristopher Nolan has constructed an elaborate puzzle box of a movie thats a really good thriller. This is the story of two magicians who attempt to out do each other. The hatred is the result of a tragedy that happened years before on stage. Told in a series of flashbacks the film is a search for the secret of each man's version of the teleported man.\n\nSuperbly acted, this is one of the rare recent films where the actors, even when big stars like Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine completely disappear into their roles. Its clear why everyone was involved with this film because everyone gets real meaty roles. David Bowie appears as Nikola Tesla and has the best role he's yet to appear in. You really must see this film for the actors if nothing else.\n\nYou have noticed that I'm rather light on details and thats intentional. This is the sort of movie that is best taken on its face value. You'll want to see the twists and turns of its plot for yourself and not have them spoiled by reviewers and friends who feel the need to tell you too much about the story. What Nolan has constructed is a complex little thrill ride. What I will tell you is that he does play fair, in the end you will know all.\n\nFor me this is going to require a second or third viewing. Its one of those movies where I'm in love with the construction of the film so much that I have to see it again to see if the thing is as good on an emotional level, I think it is but I'm still distracted by the \"sparklies\" of the box.\n\nGo see this film if you like good twisty stories with more than a hint of real magic in them."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a former professional magician, the concept of this movie is close to my heart. It was fun seeing Ricky Jay, a real magician, playing a small part. Equally fun was the faithfulness with which most of the magic was presented. Rather than stoop to the level of camera tricks, the magic presented is the same as it would be presented by any modern day magician.\n\nSimilar to \"Memento,\" this movie skips about in the time line where some information presented earlier makes more sense later when you see it in context. Be prepared for rather plodding plot more in keeping with the offerings of M. Night Shyamalan with a similar style twisting ending. Personally, I guessed the ending too early.\n\nFaithfully reproduces the time period.\n\nPersonally, I think Hugh Jackman (as Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (as Alfred Borden) are too similar looking in appearance and demeanor, which made keep track of who was whom a bit distracting for me."

If you watch the previews to both, you'll find it nearly impossible to tell apart, since they're both about magicians in 1890s England, both starring dark haired men, women with full lips, and an older mentor gentleman. Both plots seem to dance around someone who will stop at nothing in his quest to find out the truth behind the magic tricks. I've seen both films all the way through, and I still have trouble telling them apart.\n\nIf you're looking for eye candy to go along with your magician story, The Prestige is the one to rent. Hugh Jackman, in his clean-cut handsomeness, is the star. If you liked him in Kate and Leopold, you'll be very happy to hear he looks almost identical in The Prestige. He and Christian Bale spar off one another, since they both seem to be master illusionists\u2014oh, wait, that's the word from the other film. Anyway, Scarlett Johansson is Hugh's girlfriend and assistant, and Rebecca Hall, David Bowie, Andy Serkis, and Roger Rees join the supporting cast.\n\nChristopher Nolan, creator of the slew of Batman remakes, cast two of his favorite actors in this film after working with them in Batman Begins: Christian Bale and Michael Caine. It's really nice to see the actors and actresses working well off each other, which isn't particularly surprising since most of them worked together in various films before. While some of the twists and turns of the plot are entertaining, as is usual with a Christopher Nolan script, as the end credits roll, audiences are able to find some flaws if they choose to think about it. However, if you like Nolan's films, or magic movies, or like to watch pretty people in pretty costumes, rent this one for an entertaining evening."
