It keeps you on your toes, special effects are really good, I guess this is the strength of this movie. Don't believe it deserves a 5.3 currently. At least a 6 in my opinion. On the lines of \" The day after tomorrow\". If you liked that I think you should enjoy this."

Some technical talk that may or may not make sense (I didn't really pay attention), with just a smudge of social commentary (climate change and all that) ... the main point is the movie tries to entertain and achieves that to a certain degree.

Since it was a disaster movie I figured it would go well with the big screen and the 4D-effects.\n\nRight from start I felt that something was off. The dialogue and over all atmosphere felt tacky and the acting didn't seem genuine. This was only the beginning though.\n\nGeostorm is filled with canned dialogue and clich\u00e9s that will make you cringe. Most of the actors under perform and there's no real chemistry between the main actors.\n\nDuring the whole movie you feel like you're watching a movie that you've already seen and the tropes used are so in-your-face that you almost feel provoked.\n\nI was thinking about leaving several times during the movie but since I was with friends I decided to stay. During the climax of the movie several people in the audience were loudly mocking the movie and laughing at the absurdity of it all.\n\nEverything about Geostorm was a disaster. It was very predictable and preachy and the director actually made you feel dumb throughout most of the movie. The only OK thing was the CGI but even that felt re-used and tired.\n\nNobody should watch this movie. It's utterly bad and should be avoided at any cost. I don't even want to think about how much money was spent on this garbage"

While people overcame this problem, another conflict arises when it becomes opportune to use the technology as a weapon for sole global domination.\n\nThe setting in which the story takes place, you can say, parallels our own at the present in which we are experiencing technological advancements which perks we use to solve our crises but also create further dilemma as countries individually vie to be the world superpower.\n\nGoing to see the movie, I wasn't expecting much for it because it seemed like a so-so movie that's probably been done before only re- released with a \"semi different plot\" under a different title. But I was surprised by how entertaining it is. There's the timeliness of its subject, there's definitely humor (which is funny but I thought they somehow overdid with some of the dialogue) but this one has also dramatic scenes that would touch you. The pathos really got me emotionally involved with what the characters are experiencing. This aspect I really enjoyed.\n\nThe downside, I can still say that it seems a lot of it's contents were borrowed from/ inspired by previous natural disaster/sci-fi flicks such as Day After Tomorrow ( look at one of its posters for instance), Armageddon, and Gravity to name a few. This might be a turnoff for moviegoers who are expecting originality and it will most likely be so but for me, I got over it and had myself a good time in the cinema. It is definitely not the best movie this year or ever but its up there with the good, entertaining ones I really enjoyed watching this year."

These are great \"popcorn movies\" when you just want a good action story that isn't Marvel or Tom Cruise. I love these hokey disaster movies.

The overactive energy is reflected in the chaotic extremities of the weather, which seems to be the main character in the movie.\n\nNumerous countries are on the brink of a Geostorm caused by the Dutch Boy Program, a preventive measure against natural calamities. Jake Lawson (portrayed by Gerard Butler), a renowned technology designer, and his brother Max (played by Jim Sturgess) are entrusted with the monumental responsibility of rescuing humanity.\n\nWith Sarah - Abbie Cornish lending her remarkable talents to this film, I wholeheartedly suggest it to anyone seeking a blend of thrilling action, suspenseful moments, and small amounts of emotional scenes."

Despite some clunky script at times & stereotyping I settled down to a film i found not so much a disaster movie but more a race against time mystery/thriller. And in that light I quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe film is saved by some strong female characters (including Gerard's daughter who manages to convincingly resemble my own 12 year old - a mixture of plain speaking childhood vulnerability and strong common sense) plus a concept thats half believable, if hugely depressing (in light of recent weather disasters). The special effects are pretty good. Perhaps we r spoiled and have seen too many Days after Tomorrow and 2012s to appreciate them anymore."

        "review_detailed_main": "Am hardly biased in any way against disaster films (there are some good entertaining ones out there), but judging from the dreadful advertising and negative critical reception expectations for 'Geostorm' were low. Still saw 'Geostorm', having liked some previous work of Gerard Butler, Andy Garcia and Ed Harris.\n\nWatching it giving it a fair chance, 'Geostorm' is not as dreadful as the misleading advertising made it look and it is nowhere near as bad as the worst of the SyFy/The Asylum disaster films. Then again, pretty much anything is better than films that are in a league of their own when it comes to incompetent quality, and putting 'Geostorm' on the same level of them would be insulting. 'Geostorm' has many problems, but at least it looked as if effort was put into it regardless of the generally muddled execution. Actually agree with most of the criticisms, other than finding that the visuals were better than has been given credit by the general consensus on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nStarting with the good things, 'Geostorm' looks good. The special effects, although overused, are great and it was clear they were where most of the budget went. The Dubai tsunami is a standout. A couple of sequences are thrilling, again a standout is the Dubai standout and another is the Hong Kong explosions. The film is slick in photography and editing and the scenery is atmospherically and cleverly used.\n\nThe music is haunting and rousing without being over-bearing. Didn't think much of the acting overall, but the best and most professional performance comes from Ed Harris, giving a performance that is in keeping with the film's tone while also trying to make a believable character out of what he has. Abbie Cornish also does her best.\n\nGerard Butler however lacks his usual charisma and doesn't look comfortable. Jim Sturgess is also completely out of his comfort zone and looks embarrassed the whole time. Andy Garcia just looks like he couldn't be bothered. The dialogue is high in the cheese, cringe, clich\u00e9 (not usually a bad thing but the film executes them badly) and stilted factors and can feel preachy, while Dean Devlin's direction is not a hack job but there is a real sense of inexperience and not being comfortable with the material.\n\nFurthermore the story just doesn't thrill and in monotonous in pacing and how most of it is staged. The spectacle is there, but even for a film where one actually goes in expecting to shut their brains off at the door there is a lack of brains and suspense, in turn replaced by tedium and excessive ridiculousness. Story-wise, 'Geostorm' is completely bonkers and on top of the generally less-than-thrilling, derivative and mindless action (with exceptions) there are attempts at character development that fall flat due to doing little to develop it properly (the brother relationship amounts to very little).\n\nAs well as the heavy-handed and out-of-kilter political elements that just confuse the story tonally and an ending that feels completely at odds with the rest of the film. The preachiness of the ending also leaves a sour taste in the mouth.\n\nOverall, looks good but underwhelming on the whole. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

The storyline was well-written and well-explained, even though it was very simple and easy to understand. Sadly, the characters weren't very interesting, but they were well-developed and kinda likeable. At least, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and there were too many shocking scenes. The opening scene of the movie was kinda unpredictable and very promising. The ending scene was kinda predictable, but I enjoyed it. Also, the cinematography and the CGI effects of the movie were both AMAZING and very well edited. Overall, \"Geostorm\" was a nice action movie, adventurous and I would definitely recommend it to my friends!"

        "review_title": "Worldwide Weather Wackiness Courtesy Of GEOSTORM",
        "review_detailed_main": "It would be fair to say that a lot of the apocalyptic disaster films of recent decades, even after the potential horrors of global warming and extreme weather events had come to light, have certain credibility problems and plausibility issues that always pass muster with the studios but wouldn't do so with scientists that actually study things like that. Previous disaster films from the 1970s, like EARTHQUAKE and THE TOWERING INFERNO, didn't exactly have this problem. But there's no question that they are often spectacular to watch, which is, after all, the point of such films to begin with, whether it's films like THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, SAN ANDREAS, or \"2012\", each of which are modern-day extensions of the 1970s disaster craze taken to an extreme. And then there's GEOSTORM.\n\nThe film involves an international cadre of orbiting satellites known as \"Dutch Boy\", monitored from the International Space Station, which are somehow capable of controlling the world's weather in an era of extreme climate change. But when it appears that system is somehow failing, and extreme weather events are becoming even more extreme, the man (Gerard Butler) who designed the Dutch Boy program and was replaced three years before by his younger brother (Jim Sturgess) is forced back into service to find out what is going on. Beginning with the entire population of a village in the desert of Afghanistan somehow being frozen, the weather starts to go progressively more haywire by the day. Gas main explosions in Hong Kong, ice storms in Tokyo and Rio di Janeiro only make the situation more important for Butler, who is also starting to come to terms with both Sturgess and his own daughter (Talitha Bateman). As it turns out, the whole Dutch Boy program, which was an international project, was about to become wholly run by the U.S. government; and it is in fact being sabotaged from inside the White House itself, possibly even by the president (Andy Garcia), as he has the biometric codes that control Dutch Boy. While Butler and the I.S.S. crew try to fix a problem that's quickly coming up towards the dreaded Geostorm event, it is up to Sturgess, a Secret Service agent (Abbie Cornish) and a tech expert (Adepero Oduye) to find out who the saboteur actually is.\n\nDean Devilin, who both directed and co-wrote the screenplay for GEOSTORM, is no stranger to films of this kind, having collaborated with spectacle master writer/director Roland Emmerich on a ton of similar special effects-laden films in the past, such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, the 1998 versions of GODZILLA, and the 2016 reboot INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE. In the case of GEOSTORM, Devlin has taken a page not only from his former mentor Emmerich, most specifically \"2012\", but also from more plausible films like DEEP IMPACT and TWISTER. Where he slips to a fair extent is in the notion of a whole program of satellites in orbit somehow able to \"control\" weather events around the world. It's an implausibility that the film can't really get around, simply because nobody would even try to do it without having an unintended deleterious effect akin to playing God with billions of people's lives hanging in the balance. It is bad enough, really, just for Mankind himself, by his extreme addiction to carbon and fossil fuels to so create the kinds of weather catastrophes that keep happening with ever more frequency and extremity. Why potentially make it even worse with a global network of weather-controlling satellites that are susceptible to sabotage? Even so, in other ways, the film works in showing how these horrific meteorological events are bringing both Butler and Sturgess, who have been estranged for one another ever since the U.S. government took Butler off the Dutch Boy project, back together, along with Sturgess developing relationships with both Cornish and Oduye, as well as Butler strengthening his relationship with Bateman. Had Devlin put a little bit more attention into those aspects of GEOSTORM, the plausibility problems might have been eased, and thus the issues of story and humanity wouldn't be so overshadowed by the special effects, which are admittedly quite good in whatever format the film is shown (regular; 3-D; or IMAX 3-D). Fortunately, however, Butler, Bateman, Sturgess, Garcia, and Cornish do more than enough to overcome most of the plausibility problems and Devlin's penchant for trying to one-up Emmerich. GEOSTORM may not be a masterpiece, but it is a fair bit better than most 21st century Hollywood spectacles."

The second act's mystery plot was predictable, zero interest, and no intrigued. The third and final act's mystery unfolded itself to reveal something I felt was mundane and mediocre. By the time everything was finished, I had zero interest in most of characters and events that occurred throughout the movie.\n\nThe first act explained how the satellites worked and how they protected the earth from its own weather, the explanation was believable in context. The second act set up the mystery part which was my least favorite. By the time the mystery was set-up, I had already figured it out. I realized that by this point, I'd been patiently waiting for the action to transpire. One random action scene occurred during the middle section of the film, it felt out of place. After the believable opening, the predictable mystery, the third act picked up, the action kicked in, and I was satisfied. Hannah Lawson played exceptionally by Talitha Bateman was great in her role. Every scene with Talitha Bateman was exceptional. I enjoyed Talitha Bateman's on screen chemistry with Gerard Butler, their family relationship was believable. Abbie Cornish was great here as well, my second favorite character. I didn't care about any other characters here because there wasn't any real development with them. Overall, this movie is run-of-the-mill predictable with zero fun up until the end.\n\nFor a more in-depth review, check out my video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0Qh-seNIEI"

        "review_title": "Geostorm is nothing but 90's disaster film clich\u00e9s and science that make Sharknado look credible",
        "review_detailed_main": "Disaster movies seem to be a genre that few can get right. Not that they're unpopular, as the late nineties through the 2000's gave us a ton of those. But while audiences may have gone back to them each summer to catch the latest crisis that threatens a city, critics rarely praise them. Even mass audiences seem to be aware of how crass they are. I'm sure if I were to name Volcano, Deep Impact or Independence Day, you'd probably tell me that one of them a guilty pleasure of yours. I'd be lying if I said I hated these, but it's clear that proper storytelling an compelling characters take a backseat to the real star, the special effects.\n\nOne thing that's changed is that the blockbusters we have now contain all sorts of special effects. A giant tornado or a hail shower isn't going to look as impressive as Iron Man or magic come to life. Another is that people are more likely to consider just how many could die in a disaster movie situation. Finally, audiences are going to eventually want more variety and disaster movies tend to take the same route. Geostorm is so bland and generic of a disaster movie that you'd wonder if it was written to be a parody.\n\nDue to climate change and global warming, scientist Jake Lawson (played by Gerard Butler) creates a series of satellites that connect to a system called \"Dutch Boy\". This can deploy anything to stop major weather like hurricanes, tornados, and even control temperature. Because Jake is a rebel who doesn't think the UN should be in charge of these weather forces, he's booted off while his brother Max (played by Jim Sturgess), who works for the white house, is given charge.\n\nA couple of years later, the UN starts to notice the Dutch Boy malfunctioning. They send Max to his brother Jake to go into space to figure out the problem. As Jake gets there and is introduced to the ships commander, he see's that there's been a lot of glitches that is being perpetrated by a terrorist hacker. Meanwhile, Max and his girlfriend secret service agent Sarah (played by Abbie Cornish) start to uncover a plot from the inside of the white house that may have to do with the Dutch Boy. Perhaps president Andrew Palma (played by Andy Garcia) or U.S. Secretary of State Leonard Dekkom (played by Ed Harris) might know what to do.\n\nWhere do I begin with Geostorm? Probably that it uses all the clich\u00e9s that we've seen in every nineties disaster movie like the crisis bringing the family together, government officials that don't believe the scientists, the rag-tag group of heroes, the rebel who doesn't like authority, and more. This movie adds nothing new to any of these. The special effects look neat, but are unimpressive, look cheap, and don't make sense half of the time (why does a satellite need a death ray? How can Dubai become flooded with water only for it flush into nothing?)\n\nWhen it's not clich\u00e9d, it's very boring, with a lot of science talk that I'm sure that any scientist will be happy to debunk. I'm no meteorologist, but I'm sure you can't get rid of a hurricane by blowing up wind. You'd think that the movie would at least play up the actions as campy. Nope, everything is treated serious. I'd like to meet the scriptwriter who seriously thought that he was crafting something original. This isn't even good enough to be a sci-fi Channel original movie. At least Sharknado embrace the insanity of the idea and had fun with it.\n\nI'll give this two satellites out of ten. It's hard to tell who would like this. Kids maybe, but I'd think they would find this too boring. Disaster movie fans may get something out of the special effects, but would still find a lot more from other movies. The only thing that may be a saving grace is that it could make a star attraction for a movie night. Geostorm is definitely one of the worst of the year. Skip this storm."

When the system suddenly goes haywire, Lawson travels back into space to try and find out exactly what has gone wrong before a planet-wide super storm (a geostorm) can wreak havoc around the globe.\n\nTidal waves crashing through cities, sudden sub-zero temperatures, equally unexpected heatwaves, massive electrical storms, hail stones the size of footballs, and a silly thriller subplot in which an evil politician conspires to rule the world: this film is a predictable hash of warmed-up Hollywood clich\u00e9s that never takes any chances. Furthermore, none of it makes a lick of sense, logic taking a back seat to the special effects. If all you want to see is more global destruction on a massive scale and some explosions in space, by all means have at it, but don't expect to be blown away."

The satellites accomplish this by some combination of freezing things, cooking things, and making huge waves. How? I don't know. I think it has something to do with lasers.\n\nGerard Butler is responsible for building the system, but he gets kicked off the project - but you don't really blame them, because he really is a jerk. His brother takes over the project, and Butler disappears until three years later, when \"something goes wrong\". He's brought back, and because a whole three years have passed, no one seems to recognize him.\n\nThere's a plot, but not really. They try for a twist, but if you don't figure out who the bad guy is, you're either stupid or you've never seen a movie. Nothing makes sense, and the laws of physics are entirely ignored. They re-shot large parts of it to add more tension that has no reason to be there.\n\nSo you're left with a movie that makes no sense whatsoever, so you sit back and enjoy a special effects thrill ride - except you can't because the special effects are few and far between. When it doubt, they just blow something up.\n\nSo it's not fun, it's not \"so bad it's good\". It's just a waste of money and time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Written and Directed by Dean Devlin in his directorial debut, I personally question his ability to direct a movie, especially when it's about a space engineer trying to fix a weather-controlling satellite before a massive disaster, the Geostorm, ensues. With a pretty big budget for a newbie director, and a great cast, including the well-known guys like Gerald Butler, Ed Harris and Andy Garcia, there a 50-50 chance that it'll succeed, ...or fail. Ultimately, Geostorm is a solid enough movie, with good directing, great music, good acting, and possibly one of the craziest disaster movies out there.\n\nGerald Butler is great as the troubled Jake. The crew of the ISS is also great, particularly Alexandra Maria Lara as Commander Ute, Eugenio Derbez as Hernandez, and Amr Waked (who I at first thought it's Antonio Banderas) as Dussette. Ed Harris is amazing as Leonard Dekkom, and Andy Garcia is also very good as President Palma. Jim Sturgess as Max, however is wooden at times, so does Abbie Cornish as Secret Service agent Sarah Wilson, although she did got some badass moments which is great.\n\nThe movie pushed the boundaries of believability, and presents us with probably one of the most craziest, over-the-top doomsday scenario ever put on film. Frozen on the Afghanistan desert, extreme heat on Hong Kong, and massive tsunami in Dubai is just one of the examples of how over-the-top, but still enjoyable film. It's a solid mark on Devlin's directorial work, and we can expect to see him directing again soon. The story's focus about climate change actually helps in adding tension and kept us imagining what happened if these disasters happened in real life. The humor is also well executed, and worked, especially those who seems to came straight outta a meme(\"Marry Her!\" - the president). The editing is also, very well done. Intense scenes felt very intense. Action scenes felt very exciting, and emotional scenes felt very impactful. They also tried at concealing the plot twist in the movie, and they did very well. The cinematography is good, and the music is also, very good, another remarkable work by Lorne Balfe. What does surprise me is it's political subplot, which actually, a great idea (but leads to one of my gripes with this movie).\n\nHowever, this movie is plagued by a lot of problems. The dialogue is cheesy at times and some scenes felt very awkward. The movie is also filled with plenty of plot holes. Several plot points were mentioned and gone without resolution, and small problems appear, and then completed within like 5 minutes of screen time. The CGI is at times very unconvincing, with destruction physics felt very fake. And as aforementioned, the political subplot is a great idea on paper, but it suffers from Devlin's direction, which makes the subplot seems unnecessary and very out of place.\n\nNevertheless, Geostorm is insanity at it's finest. The over-the-top plot, along with great cast, good performance and an all-out spectacle of destruction makes it a enjoyable ride from start to finish, though the dialogue and unconvincing CGI ruins the movie a bit.\n\nFinal Score: 7/10"

Ed Harris remains a delicious rat bag and there were still some big names so that was definitely alright. The speed in the movie is great, you do not feel bored. The special effects are incredibly good, yes the story may be far sought, but still fairly up-to-date.

        "review_title": "Not Bad Enough to be Funny but Not Good Enough to be Entertaining",
        "review_detailed_main": "Disaster movies need to get just a couple of things right to make them entertaining. The first is decent special effects, when you want to see stuff get destroyed, its better if it looks relatively plausible. No one is asking for a completely accurate rendering but we all get some enjoyment from movies seeing the skyscrapers get toppled or Dubai getting flooded. Geostorm has the budget but it can't even produce eye-catching special effects. The premise (even if it is stupid) frees up all these possible scenarios for unique carnage but most of the disaster scenarios look fake or they only show generic events. This should have been the easiest thing to accomplish but most of the big scenes left me shrugging my shoulders or checking my phone.\n\nSo, if the effects can't carry it, maybe the cast can. Good actors and actresses elevate bad material all the time. Regrettably, most of the cast in Geostorm is miscast or flat out bad. Gerard Butler is in the first category. He's been good in other things (even if he's made his share of flops) but no one is going to buy him as a scientist. He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about and he can't do anything with the material because its crap. I didn't like Jim Sturgess at all, his fraternal rivalry with Butler is just them yelling and pointing at each other and Sturgess needed to be on point to sell his weasel of a character. Abbie Cornish and Ed Harris are both sleepwalking through this and Andy Garcia wasn't effective because they give him the same old lines to utter as the President of the United States. Alexandra Maria Lara is okay, but her character's entire job is just to back up Butler's character. The one performance I did like was from Zazie Beetz as Dana. She's not in it enough to pull this movie out of the gutter but she at least was funny and had some charisma.\n\nIn this kind of movie, you also need characters to root for, so you're emotionally invested in someone getting out alive. Again, the movie fails, Jake and Max are both selfish pricks and the creative team made a big mistake having the movie rely so much on their friction as brothers. Jake and Max's past is covered by exposition dumps and that makes them even more boring as characters Sarah has no depth, she's even called secret service barbie and why should we care if she can't be with Max? Andrew is a boring president, we don't get any idea why he's a great leader until the plot requires him to step up. Ute is fine but she's bland. We also get introduced characters when the individual events are going down but the time that we spend with them is so small that its almost impossible to get attached.\n\nI don't want to get into the science of Geostorm, critics have already hacked it to death and while it is ridiculous, I was willing to look past it if the movie could be good outside of it. Outside of flooding, tornadoes and the occasional giant ice storm, Geostorm boils down to a mystery about who is hijacking this global weather controlling system to wipe out specific parts of the population. I like a good mystery, but the movie does itself no favours by the casting of specific actors. As soon as I saw one of the actors, I called him being the culprit and I hadn't been watching the movie for more than 20 minutes. The story just starts out running down the nonsense hill and by the end it fell and broke its legs. The ending left me shaking my head and laughing when that was clearly not supposed to be the desired reaction.\n\nI can offer very little in defense of Geostorm. I can't praise the effects because they weren't believable enough to sell me. The plot was too nonsensical to be interesting and all the characters were too shallow or stupid to invest in. There was the odd good performance but that's not even close to being enough to recommend this. The idea of geoengineering is fascinating but the way they decide to use it to anchor the film was just wrong. Geostorm was a flop for a reason and I can't even persuade myself to recommend it as a guilty pleasure. Unless you must see every disaster film out there, its better to leave this one alone."

I wanted to see \"Geostorm\" not for its politics but because it's a disaster movie. Disaster movies are one of my favorite movie genres. Unfortunately, it doesn't succeed at either one of those types of film. It's story is so poorly told that I lost all interest in any point it was trying to make. The disaster parts of the movie weren't very interested either. The cast seems to have been thrown together at the last minute. Some of the \"names\" didn't have much to do. They cast members that did have things to do didn't hit the ball out of the park with their performances. The special effects were okay. I wish I saw this movie in 3D. \"Geostorm\" plays like a sub-par SYFY network movie but not nearly as fun. Dishonorable mention: Gerard Butler."

It's very annoying to just want to watch a movie or tv show for \"entertainment\" but then come to find out it has ulterior motives and a message like a darn after school special. I get it, if the government is involved in the plot of a movie there may be a political agenda attached, but they angle the movie in an attempt to influence personal views. No doubt creating a one sided plot and preaches to the audience. Not to mention the \"one world\" new world order type agenda shoved down our throats. Suggesting any form of nationalism being down right evil. Not even accounting for the obvious environmental agenda, it's just way to preachy and demeaning to the audience. Bravo for the programming attempt. But hey you still have the attention of the sleepers."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spectacular but failed disaster movie about a network of satellites designed to control the global climate. When catastrophic climate change endangers Earth's very survival, world governments unite and create \u00a8The Dutch Boy Program\u00a8. After three years of successful protection, something starts to go wrong. It begins to fail and the satellites attack Earth resulting in fateful consequences, causing massive destruction and wreak havoc. It's a race against the clock for its creator to uncover the real threat before a worldwide Geostorm wipes out everything and everyone. Two estranged brothers (Gerard Butler, Jim Sturgess) are tasked with solving the program's malfunction before a worldwide Geostorm can engulf the planet. Brave The Storm !. Some things were never meant to be controlled... Heaven forbid those same things should ever control us !. Surf's up... Way up !. Some Things Were Never Meant to Be Controlled !. Control the weather, control the world !.\n\nAn ordinary Catastrophe movie about the Dutch Boy Program: a worldwide net of satellites surrounding the planet, that are armed with geoengineering technologies designed to stave off the natural disasters. It is a spectacular and breathtaking film, though failed at USA boxoffice and all around the world. At the time , it pretended to be the ultimate in disaster movies by pumping up a rather slender story-line with no much sense. Packing a lot of catastrophes as freezing of people, flooding of urban metropolises, avalanches, tidal wave with the subsequent destruction of cities are thrown in, among others. Not very interesting and predictable script by Paul Guyot and director Dean Devlin himself, in which the typical disaster plot is mixed with space stations, shuttles and political conspiracies. This Dean Devlin's Geostorm represents a return to the golden age of Disaster genre, whose heyday was in the seventies and eighties, but it is far from classic Catastrophe movies, such as \u00a8The Inferno Tower\u00a8 by John Guillermin or \u00a8Earthquake\u00a8 by Mark Robson, it is next to failures as \u00a8Meteor\u00a8 by Ronald Neame, \u00a8The Swarm\u00a8 and \u00a8When Time ran out\u00a8 by James Golstone , most of them produced or directed by Irwin Allen , the King of catastrophe movies. Alongside the two protagonists: Gerard Butler, Jim Sturgess, who develop an endearing brotherhood like two brothers who are eventually separated but who come together to cope with the destruction that will take place, there are a lot of well-known secondary characters as is usual in any self-respecting disaster movie, such as: Abbie Cornish, Alexandra Maria Lara, Daniel Wu, Eugenio Derbez, Andy Garcia, Ed Harris, Gregory Alan Williams, Robert Sheehan, Ritchie Montgomery, Richard Schiff, Mare Winningham, among others.\n\nIt displays a thrilling and tense musical score by Lorne Balfe. As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by Roberto Schaefer. The motion picture was average but professionally directed by Dean Deviln. He is considered to be one of the best screenwriters and producers in Hollywood. He acted in, and executive produced \"The Visitor\", a sci-fi series with Roland Emmerich and wrote some of the episodes. With \"Godzilla\" and \"Independence Day\" he not only co wrote and co produced them he was also the 2nd unit director on the latter and produced \"Stargate\". Writing or producing successes as \"Independence Day\" (1996), \"Godzilla\" (1998), \"Independence Day: resurgence\" (2016), \"Flyboys\", \"Cellular\", \"Arac attacks\", \"The patriot\", \"Universal Soldier\", \"Stargate\", among others. And eventually shooting as cinema as television, such as: \"The Ark\" , \"Leverage: Redemption\", \"The outpost\", \"Almost Paradise\", \"The Librarians\" and \"Geostorm\" . Rating: 5,5/10. Well worth watching for disaster genre fans."

The stereotypes were out of control with bad scripting and very bad acting.\n\nThe hero is a washed up, alcoholic (of course), obnoxious man who consistently acts like a 6 year old who gets fired for physical violence and throwing a literal temper tantrum in a Senate hearing. And holds a grudge against his brother for canning him. His daughter is 13 going on 40. Who is condescending towards him and acts like his mother. Guess the Director thought a kid acting and talking like an adult was cute or something.\n\nOf course, the UN comes crawling back to the 6 year old man-child who lives in a trailer because he is the only one on the entire planet who can fix the complex broken satellite system created by scientists and engineers from 17 nations! OK.\n\nTo get the overgrown toddler into space, they send him up on a space shuttle, all by himself. They use an entire space shuttle configured like a transport bus with dozens of rows of chairs. But he's the only passenger. No wonder they ruined the planet.\n\nEvery office worker in this movie is also an accomplished \"hacker\" who can pull up any confidential information with a few keystrokes. In a world where office secretaries can read network packet traces. Hmmm. Oh, and the entire crew on the ISS are inept flunkies who don't know, nor care about what their duties are. Guess the writers are not aware of the fact that Astronauts are some of the most intelligent and capable people on the planet. NASA or the other 16 space agencies would never allow computer gamers and skaters in space masquerading as astronauts. Give me a break.\n\nAt some point, I thought to myself that Greta Thunberg may have written the script and made herself the hero of the story. Maybe she did, who knows.\n\nMy recommendation, avoid this intelligence insulting movie."

And while some stand out from the pack (think 2004's 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 2009's '2012'), others crash and burn faster than a comet careening toward a major city. 2018's 'Geostorm' is exactly the latter.\n\nThe film can be categorized as a colossal, big budget disaster itself. Everything about it was ill-conceived, from the script to the story, the cast to the CGI. Instead of focusing on the events that are taking place on earth, 'Geostorm' gets lost in its own politics in a \"holier than thou\" attitude. Yes, climate change is something that should be taken seriously, but to build a whole (terrible) film around it to teach audiences a lesson will probably instead teach hollywood the lesson of not wasting money on efforts like this.\n\nBut it's really the acting that is most egregious. From Gerard Butler's sniveling and angry outbursts as the head engineer of a global galactic climate system who must come out of retirement to save the earth once again, to the C-rate performances from Jim Sturgess and Abbie Cornish, no one is safe from the horrible script. Even Ed Harris is hung out to dry in his portrayal of the defense secretary. But it's not just the dialogue and the script. It's the actual acting - just so bad. And the unoriginality...so many scenes feel like they've been lifted from other, better films (how about that 'Gravity' scene?).\n\nDon't bother with this disaster movie. Re-watch one of the many other better ones out there. Or just turn on the news."

There's something very old school 90's action hero about Butler, he's like a Harrison Ford or Stallone type of action star. I'm late getting into his films because i was put off by all those horrendous \"ROM COMS\" he constantly made & I didn't really like his 300 or his Law Abiding Citizen (not because of Butler's performance but because of the ending & how it's made to look like vigilante justice is wrong!!! It's not) anyway i really, surprisingly enjoyed his critically bashed \"Geostorm\" flick as it's made in the vibe of those 90's disaster movies & it's fun in that way. Butler plays our rugged hero as a scientist type & we have the Awesome Andy Garcia as the president.\n\nGeostorm is a proper \"Popcorn\" movie, a big budget Blockbuster film that fits into the world in peril disaster movie category & it's simply a lot of thrilling fun. Just chill & enjoy Geostorm as it's meant to be, it's pure FX driven entertainment.\n\nIt's just a big fun action-packed special FX extravaganza with a 90's heart. I looked at it as just what it is, a fun blockbuster with a great Gerard Butler leading all the action."

        "review_title": "GeoPower! This Storm Is Stronger Than Expected",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are very few things scarier than a natural disaster. What would happen if that power could be harnessed by humans, manipulated to our whim in order to keep our world acclimated and functioning perfectly? Could such a thing be used for good, or would it merely be repurposed as a weapon? This question is the key concept in my next movie review, titled Geostorm, the latest disaster flick to \"storm\" into the theaters. Pun aside, Robbie K is back for another overview, so let's get started, shall we?\n\nLIKES:\n\nThe Sound: My first like is the incredible sound editing Geostorm contains within it. These editors \"blew\" me away with the fantastic renditions of Mother Nature's torment, capturing all those destructive sounds and unleashing them into the theater. Lightning filled maelstroms, horrendous fires, and bone chilling ice storms all drop with mighty blow, causing the theater to rumble in delight. This effect may not seem like much, but it really rounds the experience out and immerses you into the havoc.\n\nThe Visuals: No surprise here, Geostorm's visuals are also beautiful displays of technology. We know this genre is all about making disasters look real, and this film brings that power out with little hesitancy. Watching destruction unfold is breathtaking, as the terrifying mayhem of the manmade storms unfold, helping you experience the horror without actually being there. Geostorm's displays, although limited in number, are the selling point of this film, especially during the exciting moments when our characters are trying to navigate their way through the destruction.\n\nActing: Sometimes these disaster movies tank on the cast, resulting in whiny, nimrod characters who are asking to be sucked up into a twister. Not the case for this film. Geostorm's cast is actually fantastic in bringing their characters to life, and also brings an awesome team to the mix to diversify the genre. Gerard Butler was a solid choice for the lead, combining action gruff with scientific strategy to craft a tough as nails character to lead the project. This dynamic nature made a fun hero to root for while seeing him evolve past his flaws. Jim Sturgess does a bang-up job in his role as well, playing the role of the neurotic congressmen forced to choose between family and job. His character required a much broader class of emotions, and he manages to hit all of these with little trouble. As for the female leads of Abbie Cornish and Alexandra Maria Lara, these women were incredible displays of girl power in the modern world. No super powers needed here, for these women have intelligence, ferocity, and heart as they tackle all the demands this movie placed on them, and all with a realistic touch. I wished they had utilized them a little more, but they maximized their screen time.\n\nThe Story: Despite how cheesy it looked, Geostorm's story was better than I expected. The characters have some backstory not lost to the storm, requiring them to grow much like the threat of total cataclysm. During the actual presentation itself, Geostorm is nicely divided into four sections each occurring simultaneously and playing important roles to the dilemma at hand. Throw in a little mystery to figure out the culprits, and you have a more engaging story line than we typically see in these films. All in all, they managed to execute this ridiculous concept quite well for me.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nStorm moments: Despite the promise of major cataclysm, Geostorm is surprisingly bare of storm sequences for much of the movie. Many of these scenes are in the background, with only a few having that thrilling, on the seat edge. In addition, despite being thrilling, these moments get a little too ridiculous, the sheer unrealistic maneuvers violating the science without the technology to do so. While I appreciate, the disasters fitting into the movie, they still needed a little refining.\n\nThe Predictability: Geostorm tries its best to throw you off the trail to the culprits, but the trailers and obvious foreshadowing will give you the answer within the first 30 minutes. In addition, the fate of other characters is not surprising at all, mostly because they figure things out minutes within the film. Had it not been for the visuals and exciting pace, the story would have been drab and put me to sleep. I'll admit there was a nice little uncertain moment, reminiscent of a few other flicks you are certain to remember. Past that though, it's a predictable mess indeed.\n\nUnderutilized team: Like many films, our protagonist becomes part of a special team in charge of fixing the problem. Unfortunately, after the introductions, most of the team is essentially useless save two members who actually get more screen time. While not as bad as the gang from Wonder Woman, this group just didn't feel needed in the grand scheme of the picture and could have been utilized in a more conducive environment to add a little more suspense in the mix. Either that or cut the characters to help the budget.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nDespite the cheesy idea, Geostorm was a welcome change to the natural disaster movie collection. Stunning special effects, a Sci-Fi Esque story, and dynamic characters are certain to entertain fans of this genre and bring with it a nice twist. However, if you are looking for a storm movie, you need to pick another tale as the disasters are a minimum or overly cheesy to be believable. Throw in some weaker story elements and predictable plot, and you further weaken the storm they were trying to bring. Overall not a bad film at all, and the special effects are more than worthy of a theater visit. Otherwise check this one out when it hits home release.\n\nMy Scores:\n\nAction/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0"

The tsunami which usually inundates the Big Apple is directed at Dubai for a change.\n\nAndy Garcia is the newest US President \u2013 a distinct improvement on the Orange One! Gerard Butler is a bit wooden: was he their first choice or did other actors turn the role down?

Yes, it's a mishmash of borrowings from other disaster movies with even a dash of MOONRAKER in the space station scenes \u2013 but it's well paced with a halfway-decent script and engaging characters. The science is probably wide of the mark (though a conspiracy-nut friend of mine believes our climate is already being controlled by malign forces).

And gem it was.\n\nActing: 5/5 All the actors were doing their part perfectly and beyond. I like the cast.\n\nStory: 5/5 I like the idea that humans finally realise that they have to work together to solve complex issues. Kinda like the whole idea behind Star Trek is.\n\nSound: 100/5 (really awesome, can't complain about anything. I lived it.\n\nCGI: 5/5 this was something I thought would be bad based on the rating. But this surprised me. This was really good.\n\nI can continue. This really was a great movie and had great twists and had you on your feet. Which I love.\n\nI really recommend this movie. This is up there where other great movies are. It's not a disaster like don't look up was. So check this out. Great movie!!"

Some funny dialogues don't save the film. You just have to sometimes wonder who even thought this was a great idea to show to people. It'll probably be most appealing to scientists looking for a good laugh. \"Geostorm\" is the example of cinema as an immediate spectacle, as a pure surface.

The science is rubbish but I had fun watching that movie. In this Hollywood disaster there is no way to suspend that much belief. There is not a single scene or theme that hasn't been done 1000 time and done poorly at that. You can call every scene that is about to happen and be 100% right. No originality at all. There is no great twist that makes you say 'I didn't see that coming.'\n\nThe worst part, you do not give a damn about any of the characters. You have the reluctant hero, the family divorce, the child who believes in dad, the family disfunction that resolves at the sacrifice that ends up not being a sacrifice, the good guy who is bad, the bad guy who is good, and supporting people who pop in just so they can deliver a cheesy line and further the 'plot.'\n\nI saw this on HBO so I didn't pay anything which is good.

Even as hyped as I was, I can definitely say that I was not disappointed. I saw this movie with a friend who also likes disaster movies and we both agreed that it was better than we thought it would be, especially given the reviews, and we both had a great time. You won't hear me saying that it was perfect - it had weaknesses for sure, particularly in the resolution - but nothing that I considered to be unforgivable or that hindered my enjoyment. (You just have to buy into them the way you buy into the premise - they're all ridiculous on some level but it's part of the territory.) I've seen many of these types of films that I would never watch again, but I can honestly say that I'll probably rewatch Geostorm several times in the coming years.\n\nPeople who gave this movie less than a five have clearly never seen some of the truly awful disaster films put out by SyFy channel. And I find it hard to believe that any fans of the genre came out of this movie feeling like it had been a waste of their time.\n\nMy friend pointed out that this movie has a little something for everyone - a mysterious government conspiracy, a car chase, a whole adventure on the space station in addition to what was happening on the ground, and family drama which I thought was pretty well written even if these types of reconciliation stories are rather clich\u00e9 in the genre. It probably had too much going on, but that meant it never got boring.\n\nI would hate to think that people who would actually love this movie like I did would be put off by bad reviews, which is why I felt like I had to write a good one. If people don't go and see these kinds of movies they're not going to make them anymore, especially disaster movies which require a big budget to look good. *Mrs. Lovejoy voice\": \"Won't somebody please think of the disaster movie fans?\"\n\nTLDR: I could spend a lot of time talking about ways to critique this movie, even as a fan of it, but I think the most important thing I can say is that I enjoyed it quite a lot and would see it again."

I'm honestly shocked that Ed accepted such a role, things must be tough for older actors in Hollywood these days.\n\nThe emotion between Gerard Butler and Jim Sturgess' characters leaves a lot to be desired - it's not realistic, and is lacking true human emotion. Plus the backstory is missing too much for the viewer to understand the family dynamics. Adding another 15 minutes to the story might have given their characters depth, but again, Dean Devlin fails the audience.\n\nGeostorm is a disappointing failure in the Action Sci-Fi Thriller genre. If it had been billed as a satire based on some of the successful films with stories of the earth's threatened existence - pieces of which Devlin may have been trying to imitate (e.g., Independence Day (1996), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), etc.) then I might tend to be more charitable with this review, but unfortunately that is not the case."

It's almost amusing and insulting too see why they gave the rating they did . A lot of other successful titles are based on similar ideas . Why is gravity a better movie for example ? - to me that was a ''1 person'' type of movie , sitting in a place doing nothing... boring...., a 5 star movie )\n\nAbout the movie , i liked it . Didn't got bored , it is an action packed sci-fi . It is pretty close to interstellar and die hard , in a good way ,but about 1/5 the emotional impact at least for me . But that is good , it was not intended to be that way . The plot is allright , the climate change is a real deal (of course no one reading this is going to be affected in any meaningful way , but it's undeniable ) . The global wheather control system is placed in a timeframe , that is maybe too early (as in 2020), maybe 2030 could be a better..... but nothing wrong with that ."

Science Fiction films need to grab you from the start but this one bored me to tears.It's all talk and boring talk at that, with the occasional action sequence squeezed,put in as an afterthought,or just to keep you awake.As for the characters,you couldn't care less about them.An utterly awful film.I would rate it zero but the rating section wouldn't allow it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review by Marianna T\u00f3rgo\n\nEvery year we have at least one movie about the apocalypse and how the world is going to end until USA shows up, in last second, to save the day. The last couple ones released were pretty bad, like \"San Andreas\" (2015) and \"2012\" (2009), and you may ask yourself why. Well, those movies were great in the special effects area, but when it comes to developing a consistent script they are train wrecks. When people left the cinema they could say that \"at least the effects were pretty good\", \"Geostorm\" doesn't even have that wild card to save its own skin. Promoted as an apocalypse film, \"Geostorm\" doesn't really show disaster scenes, since 94% of screen time is dedicated to zooming in Gerard Butler or Jim Sturgess faces. The plot surrounds \"Dutch Boy\", a giant satellite built to protect earth from sandstorms, blizzards and every natural disaster possible. \"Dutch Boy\", built by Gerard Butler and his crew, is starting to show defects, putting life on earth in risk. Although, is it just a casualty system error or someone is trying to bring \"Dutch Boy\" down? There is where the plot starts. Gerard Butler is the classic big brother who fights and drinks by 11 a.m, and, deep down in his good guy heart, is looking for redemption. There is nothing new to see here, we saw Gerard perform this same type of character over and over. His brother, played by Jim Sturgess, works for the government and doesn't talk to or visit Gerard's character after firing him from \"Dutch Boy\" project \"for not being responsible\". After \"Dutch Boy\" shows its first error, Jim Sturgess goes after his brother to fix it, since he is the only one that can do the job. The script tries to captivate you with this brother issue, but it doesn't spark any flame. Gerard Butler, surprisingly, does his part; the problem here is Jim Sturgess. All the scenes in which the public should connect with their relationship are cringy, Jim Sturgess can't cry or change his expression. However, what saves Jim Sturgess' scenes is Abbie Cornish, who plays a government secret agent that is secretly romantically involved with him. She is a bad ass, who shines in action parts but also moves you when she cries. Speaking about action parts, they are the best thing about the movie \u2013 and trust me, this is not a good thing when you are an apocalypse movie. The disaster scenes are borderline offensive, showing stereotype versions of each country: When Brazil appears, it shows Rio de Janeiro's beach with a bunch of hot, tanned and muscled people. When Dubai appears, we see a man on the back of a camel in the desert, and the list goes on - you get what I'm saying. They are not more offensive because there isn't enough screen time for it, the disaster scenes are just as fast as you at the cinema regretting after buying the ticket to see this movie, thinking \"I should have watched The It movie again, that was worthy of my money and time\". Don't get me wrong, I do like the whole \"Dutch Boy\" idea, and how it is something that \u2013 probably \u2013 will come true someday. The plot of mystery and discovering who or what is behind the technical errors is also interesting, but the way the movie was made\u0085 it just doesn't land. My problem with \"Geostorm\" comes from the fact that it is not a 0/10 or a 10/10, it is basic and flat, a good 6/10, and it could've been so much more. I would recommend this movie if you have some extra time that you want to spend watching some explosions here and there with a little good old plot twist , but if you're looking for amazing disaster scenes (as promoted in the movie trailer) and good acting skills, you will be disappointed. \"Geostorm\" sounded like a giant storm but ended up being just a light breeze, which soon will be forgotten just like every recent disaster/end of the world movie released."

Partly because of bad and overacting and possibly because of the weak story lines.\n\nThe story is about a corrupted climate control system in space surrounding our atmosphere. The effects of the corruption (extreme cold, hailstorms and the like) are shown quite sensational. The unfolding of the corruption, like the sequence how the weather control structure is destructed, is far-fetched and unbelievable. In the cinema I saw the movie the public sometimes laughed because of the lack of credibility.\n\nIf you want to see nice out of space pictures you will not be disappointed. If you are in need of a good story then you might better go and pick a different movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn;t know the history on this film when I started watching it. It got obvious early on they had more money than your regular SciFi Channel movie but oddly enough the script, acting and directing were all on par with most SciFi Channel movies. Very slick effects, very mediocre story and acting. Take away the 100 mill in effects and you have a 3 mill SciFi Channel movie. The locations and sets are nicer but if you closed your eyes you couldn;t tell this one from a hundred other films like this they crank out because they know SciFi Channel will pay back half or more of their budget so they know going in they'll make a profit. This one it sounds like it largely broke even but for a 3 mill film that cost 120 mill to make I;d say they dodged a bullet. It's vaguely entertaining but does have nice effects. If you are after a good movie this isn;t it but if you;re trying to kill 90 minutes I;ve seen worse. Sadly these days for me this passes for a good review. I often start watching movies on streaming services and I'll go through a dozen or more getting as little as two minutes into films before I can find one that holds my attention enough to even finish it. I'm not saying find a good one just find a film I can make it to the end. Realize I can watch most any film made before 1960 and the vast majority made before 1980 but films have been steadily going downhill for decades."

I went in with very low expectations because I never tend to enjoy these disaster movies, but ironically this was probably one of the ones I've enjoyed the most (I say ironically because it has been very negatively received by almost everyone). I really liked the two little mystery elements of who is responsible for what is happening in this film. A little mystery in any film is always a good thing. I also found most of the action sequences entertaining and unique enough to keep me entertained.\n\nThe biggest problem with these films though is that they're all basically the same film, just with interchanging disasters. The formula is followed so closely each time that you can pretty much predict it down to a T (I think that's why I appreciated the \"whodunnit\" aspects so much). They really need to change it up in the future if people are going to keep going to these films (however I sadly fear that they won't). There's some cheesy dialogue and some pretty horrific acting at times too, but altogether if these films are your kind of thing it's not going to be too bad of an experience."

So while its expected that production of such things in films should have a good deal of creative margin, there are a few things that really can't be sidestepped.\n\nPlease, the idea of tornadoes is fantastic, but when the highlight of these phenomenon in film digress from 1939's The Wizard of OZ (which was pretty f'n good in my opinion!) to some poorly modelled drillbit that OMG actually drops down to the ground like a enormous spinning roll of Pillsbury dough... They are meteorological processes, not gelatinous solid objects that happen to spin! It was sad when they were done so poorly in X-Men2 when when everything else was done so well, but what happened in GeoStorm? Its like a moron got ahold of 3d modeling software and someone said 'Good enough!'\n\nThe scope of the movie had me almost desperate to see it, despite the trailer, and frankly I just kinda got depressed from the poorly-realized situations and aspects of production.

As with The Day After Tomorrow and 2012, writers try to add character development peppered through the almost 2 hour playing time. Suggestion, forget it and just move on to the explosions.

Perhaps, not entirely unlike the political dithering and incompetence on such matters as climate change the picture criticizes. Anyways, the much-maligned CGI and preposterous scenario of satellites controlling the weather isn't the problem here, and some of the action is passable enough as far as these things go. The constant score begging for emotional engagement the movie can't earn is typical, too, if still lousy. I can almost overlook, too, that a supposed industry of world-class scientists and technicians is comprised of nobody over 50 or who couldn't supplement their income by modeling. After all, astronauts don't tend to be very old, but, for crying out loud, the crew mocks Gerald Butler--the Spartan Adonis from \"300\"(2007)--for how old and worn out he supposedly looks. No wonder the world is staring down apocalypse if its leading scientist looks like he's lifted more dumbbells than books over his life, and his peers still mock his appearance.\n\nThe main problem, then, is it's just incredibly poorly enacted and written. I wonder what the original cut looked like if this is the result after rewriting, reshooting and even recasting. All the brotherly quarrel stuff is garbage. Butler is mostly his usual affable self; that is, he presents the same persona he always does as opposed to actually acting. But Jim Sturgess is terrible. It's impossible to care about a character when everything he says is emphatic, bad-tempered or, when with his Secret Service girlfriend, nauseatingly cutesy. He's intolerable. So is his niece. Have the filmmakers ever met a child? They don't act or talk like this. I couldn't even pay attention to whatever she was saying in the forward and afterward of the picture it was so inconceivable. It hardly matters by comparison that the baddie is obvious from the get-go; the casting alone gives it away.\n\nOn the other hand, it looks cool when Abbie Cornish's agent drives a car in reverse and, without sticking her head out the window, shoots dead the driver chasing her car.... I like to say something nice about a movie if I can, and that's all I've got."

The predicable plot twists are very annoying and the guy playing the president of the United States needs to take a few more acting classes. Final score - 5.7 out of 10."

In essence, the same character he has in every other film he has appeared in. Except this time, in space.\n\nIt's an interesting premise that isn't played out to its full potential, but the film itself is non-offensive. The special effects are slightly questionable for a film that is, at time of writing, not even four years old, but if you can get over that then the rest of the film is fine. It's just incredibly formulaic - not necessarily to the point of boredom, but it's certainly not something I'm anchoring to watch again.\n\nIn all, this is a good film for background noise, or perhaps if you're looking for something which requires little to no thought. However, if you're looking for a thrills-a-minute, visionary action flick, I would maybe look elsewhere."

        "review_detailed_main": "After several natural disasters on Earth, there is an international coalition of seventeen countries to build a system of satellites to climate control called \"Dutch Boy\" under the command of the chief engineer Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler). However, the efficient Jake is a free spirit man that despises politicians and is replaced by his estranged brother Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess), who secretly lives with the Secret Service Agent Sarah Wilson (Abbie Cornish). Three years later, UN soldiers find a frozen Afghanistan village. In the International Climate Space Station that is under the administration of the USA but will change in two weeks to an international consortium, the Indian engineer Makmoud Habib (Richard Regan Paul) copies the data from the satellite responsible for the Afghanistan area to investigate and dies in a mysterious accident. Max convinces Jake to go to the station to investigate what happened. Meanwhile, there is an increase of temperature in Hong Kong, causing fire, explosions and collapse of buildings. Jake teams up with the German chief engineer Ute Fassbinder (Alexandra Maria Lara) and her team. Soon Jake and Ute find that a virus was introduced in the system and there is a traitor among them. But who?\n\n\"Geostorm\" (2017) is an underrated disaster movie by ridiculous \"professional critics\". It is amazing the Metacritic Rating (2.1), showing how terrible these people are. Lack of payola? Who knows? \"Geostorm\" is a movie with a great cast, ith the names of Richard Butler, Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Ed Harris and Andy Garcia. The action is great most of the time, with disasters, chasings, and betrayals. The CGI is also great, showing disasters on Earth and on the space station. \"Geostorm\" is not a movie to be indicated to the Oscar but is certainly a great entertainment and worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Tempestade: Planeta em F\u00faria\" (\"Storm: Planet in Fury\")"

To make matters worse the entire project are about to be turned over to \"the international community\" which of course is a well known recipe for disaster.\n\nHollywood lives in their usual dream world of course so they throw in suitable, old-fashioned, bad guy with the \"correct\" political views for a bad guy and with an outrageous and apocalyptic plan and we are all set.\n\nLet's ignore all that crap and focus on the movie. Once that nonsense is out of the way what is left is a fairly entertaining science fiction disaster thriller movie. The special effects are not bad and the movie moves along at a decent pace. The \"raison de etre\" for this movie is the action and the special effects so the story and the acting is adequate and nothing more.\n\nUnfortunately, as is all too often the case, the story writer is a bit of a low watt bulb. This satellite network that is the foundation of the movie is fairly unrealistic even for a science fiction movie. Let's forget about the total insanity in even trying to cover the planet in a network of satellites that are actually physically connected, the feats that these satellites achieve is just so far off the realism scale that is is annoying. What the heck are powering them? Anti-matter, black holes? This could have been done much better.\n\nThen we have the self destruct sequence that is playing a large part towards the end of the movie. What kind of self destruct blows up a few bits and pieces for show and then pauses so the characters can run around for half an hour or so? Either the story writer is dumb as a door nail or he thinks the audience is that dumb.\n\nAnyway, the annoying parts aside, as a science fiction and fantasy geek this was a fairly entertaining movie for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Geostorm would have to take the award for the silliest movie storyline I've had the \"privilege\" of seeing for a very long time. I'm totally over disaster movies and this one is the proverbial straw that breaks that poor camel's back, not just because of all the recycled plot lines and ideas from earlier movies, but more from the sheer audacity of various producers and studios daring to actually present such idiocy to the cinema-going public under the guise of entertainment. I guess there's a market for stuff like this (Calling it pop-corn entertainment is to exaggerate its social value). Otherwise why would these same various studios spend the equivalent of a small country's GDP on producing this pap.\n\nOne of the (many) bad guys is absolutely correct late in the film when he exclaims, \"Well of course if you're going to play God and control the weather, someone like me will want to weaponise the means.\" Yes, it's sometime in the future (we never find out exactly when) and somehow the world/USA/UN/God knows who? has developed the science to control the world's weather through a vast array of satellites controlled from a gigantic international space station manned by hundreds of people from across the world and serviced by a fleet of space shuttles. But a conspiracy sees the bad guys want to use the technology, yes, to take over a brave new version of the world, after it's been Geostorm remodelled.\n\nThis is one of these braindead movies where stuff happens just purely and simply to establish a given plot line. At least movies such as Star Trek have got the good sense and grace to at least give us an idea of how the world has changed, when they open portals into the future. Geostorm doesn't or can't be bothered. The writers would dreamily like us to think that everything they show is possible by tomorrow, so the world they show is exactly the same as ours, except for 1 or 2 more electric cars on the roads (which, btw are the same too).\n\nThe character sub-plots are exactly the same as you've seen in any number of other disaster movies (\"Dad promised to come home!\". Estranged brothers! (over pretty much nothing). Career power couple having not enough time for one another. Oh yes and mustn't forget the old reliable. Conspiracy against the POTUS! But for much of the movie, you feel you are being conned, just to be set up and watch a bunch of various disaster porn, which again, we've seen many times before (tsunamis, tornados, ice storms, fireballs, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes etc.).\n\nI really don't mind Gerald Butler. But he's making a habit of starring in and producing movies with these extremely nonsensical story lines (London Has Fallen is almost as silly as this, but still has aways to get near this one.) He sleepwalks through Geostorm and what's more doesn't even really try to hide the fact. Abbie Cornish is my favourite character as a senior Secret Service agent, who suddenly comes to life towards the end of the movie and in the best scenes gets to kick a fair bit of male butt. Andy Garcia plays POTUS. I only mention him, because, yes, I like him too, but he gets the best line in the movie, which he gets to utter in a hijacked taxi, believe it or not.\n\nThe action does ramp up late in the movie, where there's a bit more of the spy stuff, rather than the absurd, contrived SF and disaster material. But some studio head honcho, somewhere needs to draw a line in the sand, contact his peers and say NO MORE to apocalyptic weather event movies. The world has been sentenced to enough of them. Likely event?"

Hollywood does it's best making these style movies as real as possible. Looking back at Volcano and Dante's Peak even those were done well for their time.

My disappointment quckly disappeared in my delight at the story overall. Now, instead of stopping extreme weather, that system of satellites is behaving in the opposite way! But why?? That's what they have to find out.\n\nIf you want a movie with political intrigue, perilous happenings in space, car chases, spies, international collaboration, estranged brothers coming together, and - oh yes - a variety of natural disasters, this is for you. The science is bad, the dialogue can be a big stilted, but it's a rip-roaring good time."

But when Jake discovers that the White House planted the glitch, his and his daughter's lives are endangered.\n\nWith a hokey premise that takes itself deadly serious, this super-nature thriller is a gentle breeze from being a movie-of the-week. Bad writing, ham-fisted acting and corny SPFX further feed this shit-storm.\n\nFurthermore, if humanity controlled weather then all wars would be fought over the thermostat.

Just quit thinking so hard and watch the movie for what it is. I give the writers credit for being original. I mean, they could've just made yet another Spider-Man movie. Hollywood is out of ideas, so by that measure, this movie stacks up."

Gerard Butler puts in his usual dependable performance and the rest of the cast performances are adequate if not passionate. Some humorous, if not laugh out loud moments.

And everybody has one.\n\nThis honestly isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. The premise is basic and simple to understand, the storytelling is solid (the way hundreds of other movies have done it), the visual effects aren't that many - I think most of them are in the trailer - but they're timely and done right, and go as far as getting a reaction. (Oh, my lord! I didn't know that was a thing!...)\n\nThe editing though, can be nasty sometimes. The climax of a scene can abruptly end and immediately cut to its resolution and that's a little off putting if you're slightly aware how editing works.\n\nWas there enough meat for the actors to sink their teeth into? Probably not. But that's just the nature of blockbusters in general, and this is no exception. It's all about the premise and the drama. And to be fair, even that is well achieved to the point where you think the ending is pretty much certain, until it isn't.\n\nAnd most of all, which I think is the overarching theme that few people seem to be talking about, is that it tackles a real life problem we all face and what its most dire consequences can be in the most extreme circumstances, even without the sci-fi portion of it. I'm guessing a lot of people reacted poorly to that alone, because honestly, looking in the mirror in the matter of climate change, sucks.\n\nBut objectively, as storytelling and move making goes, the movie delivers a solid, balls to the wall, piece of narrative and action, which is to be praised, not criticized."

The plot was ridiculous, the script was written entirely in clich\u00e9s, the acting from the main characters was woeful, proof positive that Gerard Butler can't act to save his life but then again he positively shone when paired with Jim Sturgess who was just terrible and appears to be an emotional cripple. The two female leads, Abbie Cornish and Alexandra Maria Lara, were the saving graces in the acting stakes. I could throw in some spoilers but the wounds are just too fresh to go there at the moment. Hollywood has gotten so disrespectful of their audience these days that they appear happy to throw up anything these days without any attention to quality control. It has been suggested that if you put enough monkeys in front of enough keyboards they will eventually tap out the complete works of Shakespeare. Well obviously illiterate monkeys wrote the script to this one but it is a very long way short of Shakespeare. I give POS 2/10 and one of those was only because it was in color!

If the frost touched you, you froze solid. That happens in Geostorm, but it isn't just ice that chases people, but lightning, hail and heat.\n\nThe engineer who invented a multi-trillion dollar space station and satellite mesh to save the world is a noble hermit, living off the grid after \"The Man\" treated him harshly. Oh, his brother is \"The Man\", working as a presidential adviser. They haven't talked for years. His daughter is lovely, mouthy, precocious mechanical genius who only sees dad occasionally because mom couldn't handle his eccentric ways. All the nations came together to build this gigantic space station, run by a German woman. The software engineer who helps save the day is a black, quirky woman. The lead secret service action hero is also a woman. All the pure hearts and misunderstood heroes get a tiresome.\n\nLiterally nothing in the real universe functions the way it does in this movie."

No way an electric vehicle makes those turns on a dime and still holds acceleration power. This film has its moments, but overall, it's a way to brainwash adolescents and naive, this will happen if we don't switch to the super duper electric go cart to drive and soon live in tiny homes that are 'so smart, cool and trendy.

I was not in any way disappointed, I went to see a movie that I had a great expectations about and I walked out of the cinema feeling very satisfied. All these negative reviews am I seeing for this movie don't make sense, I think that we need to focus more on the individual elements that make up movies, not just looking at the movie as a whole.

The last good spoof was 2000's Scary Movie. And the last good disaster film was...was...well, maybe Dante's Peak in 1997. Definitely don't make 'em like they used to.\n\nI really wanted to give this movie an extra half star for the graphics, but even they were a letdown as they appeared in approximately 2% of this more-mystery-than-disaster-film. And I'm using \"mystery\" enormously loosely. Even the Scooby-Doo gang would refund the money and just tell the cops whodunit before the case was even explained.\n\nThe one brightside of this movie, though also not enough for that half-star, was the unintentional comedy. I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times at the \"dramatic\" moments, the fact the cast obviously had no clue what movie they were in and the acting...including the worst actor I've seen in years: Alexandra Maria Lara who played \"Ute Fassbinder.\" Seriously, if you like unintentional comedies like I do, she would almost be worth watching this (actual) disaster for.\n\nAlmost.\n\nFollowing the plot of the terrible (1998's) The Avengers, there's a satellite of hate put in place to fix climate change since we really just needed a Band-Aid. But, shocker, someone wants to use it as a weapon and cause the movie's title.\n\nAside from the horrendous acting, plot-holes, dialogue, predictability, clich\u00e9s and false drama, another one of its worst traits: it's so...damn...long. I kept checking the time as the first two-thirds is just people trying to figure out the plot they may/may not have read in the alleged script. And then, FINALLY, the \"action\" starts...but, of course, as Hollywood does so much these days (cough, cough, Thor: Ragnarok,) they kept cutting away from what people actually wanted to see in lieu of the bad story and acting.\n\nWorse, when the climax finally began, there was approximately 36 minutes left and as it ended, there was about 20 minutes left. This movie would never end.\n\nI take that back. Mercifully, it did and since I survived the Geostorm, my life now has a purpose: MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE HAS TO LIVE THROUGH WHAT I JUST DID.\n\n***\n\nFinal thoughts: My jab at Thor: Ragnarok was in jest. I really did like that movie, but was enormously frustrated with its cut-aways. Almost every single time one of the 15 subplots or action scenes got good, bam!, instant transition to yet another subplot. My guess: they think, \"Well, people have seen this countless of times, so we don't need to show them this all over again...and we can save money in the process! Cha-ching!\"\n\nWell, you answered your own thought there: if people HAVE seen it countless of times, make even more money by thinking of something new."

The brother in this is excruciating. It's a great story and some of the lines were lame but not nearly as lame as his acting I think the plot was great and the action was epic but the brother was not giving what was necessary to make meaningful character development. It needed a more believable switch to from hating brother to helping brother and his girlfriend helping was not at all believable. She didn't even look like she believed what she was saying. All in all a good watch if you can ignore the lack of depth from the one character and I guess the lack of build at the beginning. The budget must have gotten cut so they voiced over too much intro and not enough on screen build."

Unbeatable combination if creators aimed to kill viewers interest in the genre for as long as possible.

Not only does it have childish, implausible science over and over again, but the silliness of the relationships is beset by cliches and improbable behaviors. While none of the actors involved are known for their acting chops, per se, in this case, they could be labeled as unwatchable. The characters are all unbelievable, not only by the portrayals, but by the way they were written. Just silly and unlikely, from start to finish. They seemed to be shooting for at least the mediocrity of Armageddon, but all they managed was an actual Apocalyptic mess of amateurish schlock."

It combines extreme weather, space, climate change technology, a political conspiracy behind technology and plenty of effects and action. Quite a layered film, without silly parts, with an idea with a fairly solid basis (worsening weather in recent years), a film that although it does reach Armageddon (does not have the dark and extreme environments of the meteorite, nor the very strong feeling and Bruce Willis's interpretation), is not far from it. So a fairly complete film of the genre that has it all, as well as emotion that could be much stronger. Highly recommended to all fans of the genre. One of the very good movies in the genre, watch it in high resolution."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even with some big names in the cast, this modern-day sci-fi thriller won't hold up as a model for acting. But, with a far-out plot and the scenes to go with it of a mega-disaster theme, one doesn't need or look for great thespian performances. And, one can tolerate a couple of hokey scenes - between the two brothers Jake and Max Lawson. Gerard Butler and Jim Sturgess are in those roles. Andy Garcia and Ed Harris are the other big names besides Butler.\n\n\"Geostorm\" is an edge of the seat sci-fi thriller, and it has some tremendous CGI in scenes of devastation around the world.\n\nIt's no secret early in the film that espionage is afoot. For anyone who's used to films of this type, it's not too hard to figure out who the culprit is. I don't always guess right, but I nailed it on this one about halfway through the movie. That didn't diminish my interest or attention, because this film is loaded with space type sci-fi and some down to earth action. Besides, one can't be sure that a guess is correct until the end.\n\nThis film didn't do well at the U.S. box office, but with its international flavor it went over big globally. It would be considered a flop at one-fourth its budget at home, but the box office worldwide was nearly double the budget. Maybe American audiences are so satiated with fast action films that many just don't appeal to audiences as much. I'm one of those who tires of the constant action themes that have so little plot and acting.\n\nBut, \"Geostorm\" is better than most because of its plot, the sci-fi aspects, and some tremendous disaster scenes produced with CGI that look quite real. I am surprised that this film didn't at least get nominated for an Oscar for its visual effects."

Natural ways of god has rotated it all the way upto this time. They have their own controlling centre. They are uncertain and also unpredictable. Although many ways have been created and trialled by human but they are not fully capable of controlling these natural process. This movie is also related with this unsuccessful attempt of human to control climate.\n\nThe plot centers around a satellite which man has discovered to control climate and geological processes. This type of sci-fi thoughts are exceptional and oblivious.The first thing that has attracted my mind towards this film is this satellite controlling idea of the film. It is quite discrete and different idea. But soon the idea backfires as it attacked the earth. But behind this there is a buried mystery and conspiracy that when revealed is very much thrilling. This is not only just an ordinary sci-fi movie, this is also a thriller movie with lot of suspense and drama all around the characters.This will make you guessing the climax and you will eagerly wait for it.\n\nAnd not forget about the graphics and cinematography of this film. The overview of the satellite, the climate changes and the effects,the earthquakes shattering the roads,the volcanic evolution of earth and last of all the geostorm- all this special effects are very very good and jerky. Specially in the geostorm those big ice pieces raining and hitting the structures,aeroplanes,cars and buildings, the large tidal wave which is also in the poster of the movie just splashing everything around its course..these scenes are very much praiseworthy.\n\nGood to see Gerard Butler returning in a good form and with a good movie..This type of movie really suits him. He has done incredibly well in the character. His acting and actions are well here.He is an additive force in the running flow of the movie.He is been in the central role in the defence action against the satellite. Other co actors have also done well to make it a notable work.\n\nDirector Dean Devlin has also done a fine work. He has written a good script with very creative and imaginary thoughts and has drawn it in the shooting superbly. He has rotated the special effects , the characters , the machines and the dialogues all around in a co- ordinated way that it has been an excellent mixture of thriller and sci-fi thoughts.\n\nMovies like this which has touched many sphere of qualities and quantities of a film is absent now a days.Specially movies related with climate and environment doesn't count much. This is surely the best climatic movies of 20th era...Best is the best word i can choose for the review....."

The story isn't bad, I even thought for a sci-fi movie it had a nice refreshing story, different than the usual stuff we get. Certainly not realistic, not even in a far future, but that doesn't matter. I would have prefered a bit more disasters but all in all it was okay. The CGI's could have been better as well. The cast was good though, no real bad acting like some would say. So to me, for a movie in this genre it's worth a watch. I won't compare it to movies from another genre because that's besides the point. This is a sci-fi disaster movie and it's not a bad one."

Honestly, the special effects are pretty awesome, watching cities get hit by crazy weather phenomena is a treat for the eyes. The plot, though? It's extremely clich\u00e9 and some moments are seriously over the top, which can be a good laugh if you're in the right mood.

Gerard Butler actually spends the bulk majority of the movie in a malfunctioning/exploding sci-fi space station, which is nothing to complain about, because the space disaster scenes actually look super impressive. In fact, I think the space scenes were actually worth my IMAX 3D ticket more than the weather scenes.\n\nOther things of note: I thought it was pretty funny that at one point Gerard Butler's American character randomly points out that he was actually born in the UK. It's like someone behind the camera realized that his American accent sounds kinda wobbly and wrote in that line as a clever way of excusing it."

        "review_detailed_main": "FILM: 3.5/10.\n\nWell, let's just say Geostorm isn't going to top my list of favorite disaster flicks anytime soon. Directed by Dean Devlin, a frequent collaborator with Roland Emmerich, this movie tries to emulate the grand-scale destruction we've come to associate with Emmerich's films. However, even Emmerich on an off day is more entertaining than this.\n\nFirst off, the plot feels like a recycled disaster movie template. Gerard Butler, who is usually a decent actor to watch, offers nothing new in his role as Jake. It's the same character we've seen him play in similar films - the rugged hero trying to save the world. There's no depth or uniqueness to his performance, and the character is forgettable.\n\nAs for the disaster sequences, they're plagued by a lack of originality. At this point, we've witnessed our fair share of CGI destruction spectacles, and Geostorm fails to bring anything fresh to the table. It's a repetitive cycle of watching cities crumble and people run for their lives, with no real emotional investment.\n\nOne redeeming aspect of the film is Lorne Balfe's score, which injects some much-needed energy into the proceedings. The music occasionally adds a layer of excitement that the rest of the movie sorely lacks.\n\nMost of my time watching Geostorm was spent rolling my eyes at one clich\u00e9 after another. The plot relies on convenient and implausible solutions, and the characters lack depth. It's a formulaic disaster movie that doesn't even excel in the genre it attempts to embrace.\n\nIn the end, Geostorm is a forgettable and uninspired attempt to recreate the disaster movie magic of other, more successful films. If you're in the mood for a mindless CGI fest, there are better options out there.\n\nFORMAT: Blu-ray\n\nVIDEO: 9/10.\n\n1080p presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Good, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: Excellent\n\nAUDIO: 8.5/10.\n\nDTS-HD MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Good, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: Good\n\nMOOFIEMETER: 4/10."

They constructed a decent story (however implausible) around issues with climate, and so I was hoping that the latter part of the movie would delve deeper into the why and some intricate solution to re-stabilise the ecosystem.\n\nUnfortunately all you get is the same old cliched doomsday timer, that somehow the computer can work out to the second when an entirely unpredictable event is going to happen. Who even thought of the first \"timer\" movie?? They are ridiculous. We all know the hero wins and the clock stops somewhere between 1 and 4 seconds before the so called Armageddon event happens. They don't add suspense, they don't add interest, they just lower a movie a complete eyesore. Who decided \"oh yes what we need is a stupid clock that stops at 1 second before the end of the world?\" It smacks of lack of invention or creativity by writers and the director,\n\nRant over. Good B movie, but the overuse of cliched ruins the movie, and robs us of what could have been a really well directed post modern climate change movie."

The killer weather disasters begin again, even stronger than before. Now they have to hire Jake again to go back to outer space and find out what is wrong with Dutch Boy and fix it before the Geostorm starts and the world is destroyed.\n\nThe film is more Science Fiction than Disaster but the cast watching.

The film attempts to weave together the high-stakes tension of a political thriller with the mass destruction of a disaster flick, but the script fizzles out like a failed rocket launch, plagued by dialogue so clich\u00e9 it almost loops back to parody.\n\nThe special effects, a cornerstone of any disaster film, are a hit-and-miss affair; one moment you're watching a semi-convincing ISS, the next you're jolted back to reality by visuals of Dubai that wouldn't pass muster in early 2000s cinema. Gerard Butler's lead character, tasked with fixing a climate-controlling satellite system gone awry, is as unlikable as he is unrelatable, with heroics that feel more machismo-fueled than mission-critical.\n\nCritics and audiences alike have pointed out the film's failure to capitalize on its budget, resulting in a product that feels more suited to a low-tier cable network than a blockbuster opening weekend. The plot is riddled with extraneous subplots that meander aimlessly, bloating the runtime without deepening the impact. It's a movie that aims for the stars but barely clears the stratosphere, with a villain whose motives are as thinly veiled as the film's attempt at a climate change narrative.\n\nIn essence, \"Geostorm\" is a storm in a teacup, promising a deluge but delivering only a drizzle. The forgettable experience is akin to watching paint dry during a hurricane - somehow both chaotic and utterly dull. As the credits roll, it becomes painfully clear that \"Geostorm\" is a meteorological miss, a tempest of tropes that will likely be relegated to the annals of 'movies to watch when there's nothing else on.'"

        "review_detailed_main": "'GEOSTORM': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nThe new big budget disaster flick co-produced and directed by first time feature filmmaker Dean Devlin (who's previously co-written and co-produced such huge sci-fi blockbusters as 'STARGATE' and 'INDEPENDENCE DAY' 1 and 2). It was written by Devlin and Paul Guyot (who's also served as a writer and producer on the TV shows 'THE LIBRARIANS' and 'LEVERAGE', with Devlin). The film stars Gerard Butler, Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Ed Harris and Andy Garcia. The story deals with a series of natural disasters, in the very near future, caused by malfunctioning climate change devices, as the satellite designer, and his brother, attempt to stop them. It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's also a big disappointment at the Box Office as well. I found it to be a pretty boring and unmemorable film as well.\n\nThe story is set in 2019, after several huge natural disasters have caused massive destruction around the world. 18 countries have teamed together to build a natural disaster defense system, that they call 'Dutch Boy'. Jake Lawson (Butler), the architect responsible for the climate controlling satellites (which make up 'Dutch Boy'), is fired from his job for being a hothead. Jake's brother, Max Lawson (Sturgess), replaces him. Three years pass, and 'Dutch Boy' is now malfunctioning, by causing random natural disasters around the world (instead of preventing them). Max must now recruit his brother to help investigate the cause of the malfunctions, and stop them from continuing, before a chain reaction of natural disasters, called Geostorm, occurs.\n\nI think the movie has a good premise, which could have been used to create a cool natural disaster action flick, but instead the film is extremely routine and uninvolving. None of the characters are interesting, or fun, and even the action scenes are unmemorable (in my opinion). I was so bored by the movie that I had three caffeine pills (with the equivalent of two cups of coffee each) and I still kept nodding off during it. The film's one saving grace is Gerard Butler, who still is always amusing to watch (in almost any role he does), and technically speaking the movie is aptly directed too (there are some decent visuals in it). I think Dean Devlin is a talented filmmaker, and he seems like a great guy (I'm actually friends with him on Facebook even), but his talents are definitely wasted here. He needs to do a project that his heart really speaks to him about, I think."

        "review_detailed_main": "In order to try to combat climate change, several of the world's governments create a program known as Dutch Boy; effectively a network of satellites which have been created as a counter-measure to prevent severe weather phenomena. 3 years later, a UN team discover several people frozen in the Afghan desert and this event is followed by several other events in different parts of the globe. Realising that something is potentially wrong with the Dutch Boy program, 2 estranger brothers find they must put their differences to one side and work together to find out what has happened to the program before it can wipe out any more of the world's population...\n\nGlobal warming and the threat of climate change is something that has been discussed for decades and we're all being told we need to reduce our carbon footprint where possible. Therefore a film which seemingly offers a solution to such a large scale problem makes for quite an interesting concept.\n\nIt's a shame really that Geostorm is presented and executed in such a uniformly dull way; whilst I understand that global warming and climate change are serious world issues the film still could have made some effort to try and at least make what we see here exciting or entertaining. Rather than do this the film feels more like a dull documentary, only on this occasion it's one that lacks any real social commentary. The film has some big hitters on board such as Butler, Garcia & Harris, but they really are slumming it here and these big named actors fail to make much of an impression; Garcia fares the worst here and just looks like he wants to be someone else. Harris does OK with what he has to work with, but he probably should have had a bigger role in the film given his significance to the overall story.\n\nThe only time the film manages to generate any kind of excitement was when our attention switches to Hong Kong and all hell breaks loose. Aside from this section of the film you may find yourselves, like me, yawning, constantly checking the time and praying for the damn thing to end."

        "review_detailed_main": "26 November 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza tonight - Geostorm. This is a classic case of a trailer misleading the audience as to the content of the film. Now I love a good disaster movie, no matter how badly made, and after seeing the trailer for this film I thought we had the next step on from The Day After Tomorrow or 2012, I was not altogether wrong, but I was far from right. Without giving anything away the world comes together to create a solution to bring the planets' out of control weather systems back into some kind of order. This is done using a massive network of satellites controlled by the International Space Station. When one of the satellites malfunctions it cause a weather anomaly on the ground which is reported as tragic, but when more start to fail suspicions are raised and it seems something more sinister may be at work. We have as the head of our group of heroes the marvellously enigmatic Gerard Butler, who plays the man who invented the whole weather controlling system. Saving the world is written into the script but there is also an underlying story of a man unable to fit in the world and form a meaningful relationship with either his brother or his daughter. Although incredible corny in parts,this film is exciting and totally unexpected in its delivery. Once again the biggest stars are the guys in charge of special effects. Big action movies like this cannot hope to get off the ground without these guys and their computers. Great on the big screen, worth a rewatch at a later date."

The story is somewhat interesting with a international coalition commissions a system of climate-controlling satellites that cause natural disaster to current part of the world. Unfortunately the plot itself is easily predictable and is really easily to guess who reasonable for the disaster. But I do think the disaster scenes is done pretty well with it's pretty good special effects and the tension to them. But most of the plotlines are a mixed bag with a couple of enjoyable moments and some that feels similar to other disaster movies. The characters themselves aren't really that bad, but they don't have a strong development to them and are rather generic. The acting itself is decent on how it's done.\n\nOverall it's a flawed, but decent disaster movie."

The film \"2012\" was much more deep - or maybe \"Geo\" was a bit lazy.\n\nI didn't like the final parts, as it seemed like the production team ran out of time and needed to speed things up.

And then the first scene reached its end and fear took hold of me.That was pretty poorly written. But then I saw other seasoned actors. Beautiful and talented Abbie Cornish, then Harris and Garcia, this thing just had to improve again. It didn't. It's been a while since I've seen such flat stereotyped one-dimensional characters with zero evolution throughout the movie. It's been a while (20 years or so) since I've seen such obvious fake fights. It has not been a while since I stopped rooting for seemingly good guys to bite it but this time, it really should have happened. No excuse guys. I could have easily written better dialogues myself. I could have easily presented better and more believable scenes that would cost less special effects.

I am surprised that so many big names (Butler, Harris, Garcia) signed on for this. The overall idea was good and timely. And there was even a bit of thought in who the bad guys were (though even that was cliche), but the rest was just empty. Even the science (especially the space scenes) was completely off. One wonders is anyone even considered basic physics."

The story is quite weak, lots of stupid things like the space shuttles being \"treated\" like commercial space liners as if humanity is a spacefaring civilization, Rio de Janeiro freezing over, and selected cities being struck by catastrophes, some people would not like that.

A raucous tsunami of unappealing visual effects that never strike a balance between political thriller and global disaster blockbuster. It's hailed as an outdated illogical mess, and I for one agree. Having said that, some moments of enjoyment are to be had if you are willing to suspend your disbelief. A space station that controls Earth's weather system is being hacked and used as a weapon. It's up to Butler to save the day (because apparently no one else can...). It commences with a condescending expositional narration from a child about climate change, and how we as humans have caused this. Make no mistake, it's an important topic. But, it's never referenced in the film again. As if we're being told off and now our punishment is to watch Geostorm. The story balances a political story where NASA employees and secret service agents attempt to work out what the heck is happening, with Butler's heroic bravura as he works on the space station to also investigate satellite anomalies. The former is interesting, the latter is stupid. Let me explain. Watching agents investigate a global investigation where someone wants them dead, is slightly captivating. Witnessing a spacesuit being hacked (me neither...) as Butler attempts his best Bullock impression from 'Gravity', is not fun. The disasters themselves are tertiary, an afterthought if you will and boy do some of them look terrible, particularly the Dubai tsunami. It's another case of characters seemingly outrunning outlandish weather types whilst everyone else melts, freezes or drowns. At least the space station looks decent, so there is some hope! The culprit(s) was obvious and lacked authentic motives. Every character was one-dimensional. And, as always, Butler sacrifices himself...only to miraculously survive. Oh, don't even start on the special code system that him and his brother created. Moronic. If this was released in the 90s, it could've been. It wasn't, and therefore shouldn't have been."

A big storm, a big meteor, a big hurricane, a big earthquake.\n\nThey make for some spectacular visuals, but generally, little more.\n\nGeostorm managed to do a little less.\n\nThe movie uses the tired recipe for an \"apocalypse movie\", which it followed by the book and didn't bring anything new; i'm ok with an old recipe as long as it has some new perspective; Dialogue we haven't heard, an idea we haven't thought of, some impressive visual we haven't seen; this movie has nothing.\n\n\"Predictable in it's events, mediocre casting, mediocre/bad directing and poor writing\" is how i describe this movie. In other words, boring!\n\nIf you've seen Deep Impact, or Armageddon you don't need to see this. Visuals aren't even that great - watch Elon Musk's car floating in space instead! It's more rewarding."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tesla Tesla Tesla\n\nThis movie has Elon Musk written all over it.\n\nIt's about a space engineer trying to fix a weather-controlling satellite before a massive disaster, the Geostorm, with a pretty big budget, and a great cast, including the well-known guys like Gerald Butler, Ed Harris and Andy Garcia, it succeed to deliver. Ultimately, Geostorm is a solid enough movie, with good directing, great music, good acting, and possibly one of the craziest disaster movies out there.\n\nGerald Butler is great as the troubled Jake. The crew of the ISS is also great, particularly Alexandra Maria Lara as Commander Ute, Eugenio Derbez as Hernandez, and Amr Waked (who I at first thought it's Antonio Banderas) as Dussette. Ed Harris is amazing as Leonard Dekkom, and Andy Garcia is also very good as President Palma. Jim Sturgess as Max, however is wooden at times, so does Abbie Cornish as Secret Service agent Sarah Wilson, although she did got some bad ass moments which is great.\n\nThe movie pushed the boundaries of believability, and presents us with probably one of the most craziest, over-the-top doomsday scenario ever put on film. Frozen on the Afghanistan desert, extreme heat on Hong Kong, and massive tsunami in Dubai is just one of the examples of how over-the-top, but still enjoyable film. It's a solid mark on Devlin's directorial work, and we can expect to see him directing again soon. The story's focus about climate change actually helps in adding tension and kept us imagining what happened if these disasters happened in real life. The humor is also well executed, and worked, especially those who seems to came straight outta a meme(\"Marry Her!\" - the president). The editing is also, very well done. Intense scenes felt very intense. Action scenes felt very exciting, and emotional scenes felt very impactful. They also tried at concealing the plot twist in the movie, and they did very well. The cinematography is good, and the music is also, very good, another remarkable work by Lorne Balfe. What does surprise me is it's political subplot, which actually, a great idea (but leads to one of my gripes with this movie).\n\nGeostorm is insanity at it's finest. The over-the-top plot, along with great cast, good performance and an all-out spectacle of destruction makes it a enjoyable ride from start to finish."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 2019 the world is ravaged by the effects of global warming with out of control hurricanes and heatwaves costing millions of lives. The countries of the world come together pooling their resources to create a network of climate controlling satellites colloquially known as \"Dutch Boy\". While Dutch Boy stops the ravages of the storms and other anomalies caused by climate change, Jacob \"Jake\" Lawson (Gerard Butler) designer of Dutch Boy and head of the program brought it online without proper authorization and is removed by the congressional oversight body and replaced by his brother Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess). Three years later Dutch Boy is exhibiting malfunctions with satellites causing flash freezes in Afghanistan among other anomalies and Secretary of State Dekkom (Ed Harris) directs Sam to bring back Jake to investigate the malfunctions on Dutch Boy, however once on board the Interational Space Station IV Jake learns of a far reaching conspiracy involving Dutch Boy to bring about a world spanning destructive storm called a Geostorm.\n\nGeostorm comes to us from producer Dean Devlin, best known for his collaborations with Roland Emmerich throughout the 90s beginning with Stargate through Eight Legged Freaks before the two parted ways. Devlin has primarily worked in television since his split from Emmerich working on properties such as Leverage as well as The Librarian TV movies and spin-off TV series, but has occasionally ventured into films such as Cellular, documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?, and Flyboys. A co-production with Skydance Media, the movie was originally intended to be released by Paramount but was put into turnaround where it was acquired by Warner Bros. The movie was subject to a troubled production with test screenings in December 2015 going poorly and being authorized for reshoots adding $15 million to the budget with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, writer Laeta Kalogridis and director Danny Cannon shooting new material to improve the film. When the movie was released it underperformed in the United States where disaster films had lost much of their drawing power save for exceptions like San Andreas, but it did pull in $180 million internationally, but even with it's collective $222 million global box office haul the film still lost $75 million. Geostorm is the first feature directing job for Dean Devlin, but he did cut his teeth on 16 episodes of Leverage, and for his first outing Geostorm plays like a copy of most of Roland Emmerich's tropes and if that's what you're looking for here it is.\n\nGeostorm covers much of the same ground as The Day After Tomorrow albeit with a somehow even sillier plot point involving the climate control satellite system with the even sillier name \"Dutch Boy\". Disaster films have lost much of their drawing power in the box office with Emmerich's 2012 being the last hit of the genre back in 2009 that landed in the top 10 highest grossing films. San Andreas in 2015 and Into the Storm in 2014 were decent if unexceptional entries, but with the increasing availability of visual effects to lower tier studios most Disaster films of the past 10 years are typically relegated to premiers on the Syfy channel or VOD. Geostorm is basically The Day After Tomorrow with a mystery/conspiracy thriller element and not much more differentiating it beyond that. Aside from some elaborate space set action sequences pretty much all the elements you expect from 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow are on full display with all the silliness they entail.\n\nGeostorm is standard disaster movie nonsense with Dean Devlin trying to emulate Roland Emmerich's nonsense. Geostorm doesn't have high aspirations but it does reach them for whatever it's worth."

Also, the plot twist regarding the ''bad guys'' was very dumb and blatantly played out as if the plot was written by a middle schooler, nothing interesting or believable there, once again.\n\nOverall, just another rather expensive sci-fi flick that will maybe be remembered by kids who are 10 years old now just to be rewatched in their 20s to come to a realization it was just another stupid childhood film, that seemed extremely cool, because of some explosions and spaceships, we all had movies like that, didn't we?"

The film follows a world where satellites control the weather until they malfunction, causing global chaos. Gerard Butler plays the heroic scientist tasked with saving Earth, but even he can't rescue this script from its endless cliches and plot holes big enough to drive a hurricane through.\n\nWhile the special effects bring some decent destruction scenes, they're undermined by a plot that just doesn't hold together. Between a conspiracy subplot, clunky dialogue, and bizarre pacing, Geostorm tries to cram in too many ideas without doing any of them justice. By the time we reach the overblown finale, the sense of urgency is lost, leaving the audience just waiting for it all to blow over.\n\nIn the end, Geostorm delivers some eye candy for disaster movie fans but lacks the excitement or coherence to be memorable. It's a storm that doesn't pack much punch."

        "review_title": "Geodude, this Geostinks!",
        "review_detailed_main": "There was little doubt this thing was going to be a turd. For three years now the trailer for Geostorm popped up on movie screens and on the internet with the frequency of a dandelion before it was unceremoniously plucked from a well manicured lawn. Because of extensive res-hoots, this thing has been shelved more times than expired beef jerky at a disreputable gas station. Now with it finally out; we all finally get a chance to chew on the rancid teriyaki tinged aftertaste. The question remains: is Geostorm, the story of a malfunctioning network of weather satellites threatening to devastate the world, really all that bad? Well, no, no exactly.\n\nIt's not particularly good, but with The Snowman and Tyler Perry's Boo 2! out in theaters this October, Geostorm may by default be the best wide release movie this weekend. I know scary right?! A Gerard Butler helmed disaster movie that literally cuts and pastes pieces of Independence Day (1996), The Core (2003), The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and 2012 (2009) is now, generally speaking the best new flick you can watch at the Cineplex? Not since The Blind Side (2009) got glowing reviews has the world felt so backasswards!\n\nGeostorm does have a couple of things in its favor from the get-go. Not the least of which is everything borrowed from better disaster films are tropes that have transcended clich\u00e9 to become virtually ritualistic. Will there be pompous politicians realizing - only too late of the consequences of their actions; yup. Will there be city wide devastation unfolding before the POV of minor characters holding their mouths agape; of course! Multiple malfunctions culminating in a literal time clock with a self-destruct sequence being activated; umm check. Will the dog survive\u0085?\n\nThe velocity in which all these long favored clich\u00e9s hit you is not unlike being overwhelmed by a tsunami. It's like watching a sizzle reel of stuff going \"boom\" real good but without small stuff like story getting in the way. Geostorm even chucks in a couple of throwbacks including Butler playing the kind of rugged, altruistic uber-scientist we haven't seen since the atomic age. And with such strict adherence to formula, audiences are guaranteed to figure out the entire conspiracy at the center, the moment someone with arched eyebrows shows up and asks \"how can I help?\" In that regard this movie isn't so much an original piece, as it is a sing-along. One in which a certain audience is liable to belt out melody.\n\nIf however, you take out all the borrowed bits, Geostorm is a failure for all the regular, boring, humdrum reasons: bad acting, bad writing, bad pacing, bad directing and bad editing. First time director Dean Devlin obviously holds a torch for Roland Emmerich's oeuvre but his overuse of digital technology and generic camera-work lacks tactility and starves most the senses from anything truly exciting. The screenplay hangs a lot of its emotional baggage on a go-nowhere sibling rivalry that could have worked had they cast actors beside Butler and Sturgess, who look about as related to each other as a tangerine is to a hailstone. Then of course there's Geostorm's overt political message which is as clumsily executed as a 4am tweet.\n\nIt all adds up to well-meaning but terrible movie that's no different than its influences and arguably did itself no favors by delaying its release date. Here's a fun hypothetical, if this truly is the best version that can be sluiced out of the silt then why not release it without the re-shoots and re-edits? Than it wouldn't have just been bad, it would have been shockingly bad and therefore worth a watch. As this is the finished product we got, the world may be better off if you just skip this one altogether."

Seems typical, I mean the ambition part, but the weather control part and 'weather as a weapon' is great.\n\nThe opening is great which gives men a heads-up that in the near future human beings may encounter such extreme weather change. Though this is not uncommon to see in many movies, including Interstellar which also centers on the theme that the Earth is no longer a suitable habitat for human due to extreme weather.\n\nHowever, the movie focuses too much, I mean way too much, on the emotional touch and brotherhood conflict. Don't get me wrong. Sentiment or feelings are crucial to any films. Bus in Geostorm such conflicts have no EMOTIONS at all. The only good scene that presenting the brotherhood is the talk in front of Gerard Butler's porch. And that's how the whole movie goes down. Meanwhile the 'weather as weapon' scene is far from enough and diverse. For instance, the 5 (or six?) tornadoes in India (perhaps other middle east areas) just hovering around.\n\nIn all, from 0:10 to 1:15, you can skip it. Nothing really important happened during this part.\n\nAnther key element that ruins the movie is the sound effect, which is lousy and cheap as if I am watching a normal TV drama.\n\nIf you are looking for a disaster (or scifi) movie, then Geostorm may not be a good choice."

After all of these the plot is stupid,no thing worth of interest. After all A USELESS MOVIE maybe made to China to be happy.

It's the who's who in Corruption and Deception.\n\nThe good part is that if you open your eyes and your mind you will find liberation, in understanding how the Democratic Party works against the everyday person, Pandering for votes while plotting your destruction.

I LOVE IT!\n\n5,8?? Why critics always so mean! we are human, we never perfect. Talk about perfect, including this movie. At least, critics should appreciate them. This movie is sooo entertaining , I LOVE IT!\n\nMaybe the concept is not too original. Hey, who is doing original these days, especially considering that this is an art. Every artist always have their own inspiration whom done it first\n\nI am a big fan of disaster movie. Almost every disaster movie i have watched it. I think its fair enough to say that this movie is truly awesome. I mean it! That's because i compare it.\n\nI am not going to talk the detail, but here's what i think about this movie : Everything is GREAT! the only thing that \"not so great\" about this movie is the special effect , its just a view of them. The majority of special effects are great, but, when the tornados (yes, multi tornados) appears, that is the \"not so great\" part.\n\nI think the visual special effect need more to be polished, especially the multi tornados part.\n\nThats it. No more critics.\n\nThe Actor? Hey this is Gerard Butler. What so bad about him? i think he and the rest of the actor doing great with their parts\n\nAndy Garcia! I always love his voice, its such charismatic. He always the right person doing his part as high profile person, such as a president. Reminding me with Barrack Obama with his great voice & cool attitude\n\nOne of my favorite part about this movie is, the director knows how to mix politic and natural disaster...and also the humor part.\n\nThat's all. My advice, this movie is highly recommended. Just go to the cinema and watch the awesomeness of this movie. Especially if you are a die hard fan of disaster movie."

Going into the theater, I expected this movie to be all about the weather and climate elements, but I was interested to see that it was more of a tech, sci-fi mystery. While the random storms that were happening were not just random, they had been intentionally done by someone.The movie is basically a \"who done it\" trying to figure out who infiltrated the system and wants the entire world dead. A majority of the movie is filmed on a space station which is where the sci-fi aspects come in. Although Geostorm had some sub par acting, and the ending was completely typical and happy, it was well filmed and kept the viewer interested the whole time. This movie is more comparable to \"2012,\" \"San Andreas,\" \"Passengers,\" or any type of world destruction movie rather than a weather and climate based movie. If you are interested in destruction, mystery, or thrillers, but don't mind clich\u00e9 endings and somewhat bad acting, this is the movie for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's been happening to major releases for decades, but nowadays near enough every big-budget blockbuster comes with its very own straight-to-DVD knock-off. Recently, cult label The Asylum have released the likes of Ghosthunters to coincide with 2016's Ghostbusters, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table to sponge off the success of Guy Ritchie's equally terrible King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, and even Operation Dunkirk to dupe ill-informed shoppers into thinking it was Christopher Nolan's awards-grabber Dunkirk. When I first saw the trailer for Geostorm, I was convinced that The Asylum had stretched their purse-strings a tad, and that Gerard Butler had finally done the decent thing and stepped away from the big screen. It turns out that Geostorm is actually meant to be a proper movie, and that The Asylum's cash-in was in fact called Geo-Disaster.\n\nWith its horrendous special effects, ham-fisted action and completely nonsensical premise, I refuse to believe that I'm the only one who couldn't fathom that this was an actual blockbuster attempt. Geostorm may just be one of the stupidest movies ever made, and the real horror is that the final product is actually the result of 15 million dollar re-shoots after audiences reacted badly to test screenings way back in 2015. If this is a result of expensive re-shoots and a two-year hiatus, then I'm almost curious to see what state it was in beforehand. I can only imagine that the original version wasn't quite as hilarious, although Butler was always attached to play Jake Lawson, the brain-child of a giant climate-controlling satellite dubbed 'Dutch Boy', so it must have been at the very least amusing. Dutch Boy monitors and influences the planet's weather after mankind has ravaged the Earth and turned it into a melting-pot of devastating storms and extreme temperatures.\n\nHe may be highly intelligent, but as he's played by Butler, he's also punchy and obnoxious, and has his toy taken away from him by a Senate cub-committee after he refuses to cooperate. Jake's brother Max (Jim Sturgess) is placed in charge instead, but Jake's skills and experience in the field may be called upon again when Dutch Boy starts carrying out seemingly random attacks and threatening to cause a 'geostorm' - a super-storm of which none will survive. Abbie Cornish is also in the movie for some reason, even though she's way above this sort of schlock. Soon after starting to navigate through the unnecessarily complicated plot you will realise that very little of Geostorm makes sense, and you can probably work out who the bad guy is by reading the cast list. However, for all its utter stupidity and boring set-pieces where millions are indifferently massacred by bad CGI, I can never say that Dean Devlin's Geostorm was boring. It made me laugh more than once (albeit unintentionally), and although I say this through gritted teeth, it's moderately entertaining, if brainless fluff."

        "review_detailed_main": "No matter how fine their taste, I believe that anybody can enjoy an occasional B-movie now and then. The opinions differ only on what makes a good one.\n\nThe president of the USA, far-reaching conspiracy, the world in danger, a few good (wo)men doing what is right, impending big disaster - if these keywords fit your cup of B, then \"Geostorm\" may have what it takes to entertain you for 109 minutes and leave a good aftertaste.\n\nWhen the network of satellites designed to control the global climate starts to attack the planet instead, it's a race against the clock to uncover the real threat before a worldwide geostorm wipes out everything and everyone.\n\nMost of the story actually takes place in space, so considerable part of the visual effects budget has been spent to show us the International Space Station, satellites and the big cold void that we like to call the universe. And after having your fill of \"cosmos p*rn\", there are big natural disaster scenes to fall back on.\n\nThe disasters dominate the promoting materials but are actually in minority, and mostly mercifully short. They look awesome but are not essential to the story and thus tend to even somewhat disrupt the general atmosphere and flow. Especially near finale, which is mercifully short too. Because good entertainment should always know when to end and not stretch over two hours or something.\n\nStarring Gerard Butler - the unsung hero and go-to guy to any self-respecting B- or generic movie - who is joined by a surprisingly large and impressive cast including Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Talitha Eliana Bateman, Adepero Oduye, Ed Harris, Andy Garcia, Alexandra Maria Lara, Daniel Wu, Eugenio Derbez, and Amr Waked.\n\nIt's also worth noting that almost all major female characters are written as strong individuals and don't rely on their looks (although they do look good of course).\n\nThis approach is something that freshens and updates the general vibe reminiscent of the big dumb 1990's movie that the director and co-writer Dean Devlin became really famous for originally, meaning \"Independence Day\". Back then, of course, he was just a writer and co-creator with Roland Emmerich, here he debuts as director too.\n\nBut cool actors, strong female characters and even big-budget special effects will only get you so far, when the movie is lacking the most essential of elements: heart.\n\nAnd \"Geostorm\" has a lot of heart, which is the main reason I liked and enjoyed it so much - in spite of its weak storytelling where things mainly happen because they are ought to, not develop naturally.\n\nIt's a minor miracle that despite all the unrealistic-ness and cheesiness of the story - it's a B-movie, after all - the actors are so spot on, full of heart and conviction that you just have to buy all this what's happening on screen.\n\nThis is probably thanks to Devlin's brilliance at putting together this kind of big cheesy thing. It was about time he started directing too!\n\nLeading star Gerard Butler, in some movies just a poor man's Aaron Eckhart, is in especially good form, a shining example of how to breathe life into otherwise generic material, and grab us along with the ride.\n\nIf you think that spouting all these silly lines and making it feel believable must be easy, as it seems for him, then you should try acting for youself.\n\nIn a way, his charismatic work here feels as much an achievement as Matthew McConaughey's in \"Interstellar\" which is actually not the weirdest association if one was to compare the central themes of the two movies. But if this comparision seems too out-there, there are also parallels with many apocalyptic blockbusters from \"Armageddon\" to \"The Day After Tomorrow\".\n\nSo... I liked it. \"Geostorm\" is certainly cheesy, but it does what it does really well. Go catch this!"

Gerard Butler is pretty good actor. As is Ed Harris and Andy Garcia. I'm honestly shocked that they all signed onto this movie. I think the writers had a good idea but couldn't translate it to a movie. There's suppose to be suspense and a kinda who done it. Unfortunately it wasn't hard to guess. Geostorm comes with every cliche in the book. Even not so good movies I recommend because I don't know what another viewer might enjoy. I think a younger audience might find this entertaining. The 12-17 range. And 17 is pushing it. If you decide to watch, hope you like it. For me, 4 stars."

So he finally put the movie on, and after 5 minutes, I knew I made a bad choice, and my friend would never trust my movie choices ever again. The storyline is unbelievably bad. I just wanted to scream. By the end of the movie, I was cheering for the storms to kill off every person on this planet of abhorrent acting and awkward dialogue. I wish Gerard Butler would have played the King Leonidas role from 300 in this role too. I know it would have made absolutely no sense, but it would at least keep me from begging my friend to fast forward to the tornado scenes which, sadly, are far and few in between.\n\nIn conclusion, this is beyond terrible. I only gave it 2 stars because I absolutely love tornadoes, volcanoes, typhoons, and all of that in movies. It really did not deliver. It would have been much better if there was no story, and just show cities being destroyed by natural disasters for 120 minutes. Do not watch this movie if you are depressed. This will probably put you over the edge thinking no body knows how to make quality movies any longer."

So, I eagerly anticipate - and am rarely disappointed by - any new Disaster Flicks that premiere.  Films like SAN ANDREAS, 2012 and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW all brought their own special charms of cheesiness to the proceedings with the melodramatic performances that are a hallmark of these sorts of movies.\n\nAs I was watching the latest Disaster Flick - GEOSTORM - there was this scene early on...\n\nAn unnamed computer kid was tapping furiously away at his keyboard.  He stops with an astonished look on his face, the camera pans into him as the music swells and he exclaims with the earnestness of youth \"Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!\"\n\nI knew I was in good hands.\n\nAnd GEOSTORM delivers exactly what one wants in these sorts of films - an over-the-top, earnest, \"can do no wrong\", hero - in this case it is Gerard \"We are Sparta!\" Butler.  A flimsy scientific explanation that one just has to \"go with\" (I mean, really, a Geostorm?).  A somewhat major star \"earning a paycheck\" - I'm looking at you, Ed Harris & Andy Garcia.  And over-the-top contrived circumstances that puts our stars in danger by the...GEOSTORM...that would have been easily solved if ANY of the characters had a modicum of common sense.\n\nBut where's the charm in that?\n\nDirector Dean Devlin is no stranger to this sort of fair, having written the original INDEPENDENCE DAY, and he runs a fine line between fun, danger and parody - and for the most part succeeds.  Butler, as the hero, is \"fine\" (he's really not my cup of tea), but he doesn't get in the way like, say, The Rock does in SAN ANDREAS,  Jim Sturgess (CLOUD ATLAS, 21) is completely forgettable as Butler's younger brother who is put in charge of Butler (you see, Sibling Rivalry tension!).  The highpoint for me was Abbie Cornish (SUCKER PUNCH) who knows exactly what type of film she is in and relishes her role as filmdom's most unlikely Secret Service Agent (not unlike Denise Richards as filmdom's least likely Nuclear Physicist in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, but I digress...) who actually has the best \"kick-ass' scene in the movie and, darn it, if she doesn't deliver the goods in that scene.  \n\nAnd then, of course, there is Harris and Garcia, who seem to be looking around for the pay window and their accountants, so they can cash their checks and go buy that Villa in the South of France.\n\nAll in all, a cheesy, schmaltzy, melodramatic Disaster Flick that I enjoyed every cheesy moment of.\n\nLetter Grade:  C+ (it really should be a \"C\", but my inner 14 year old is giving it an extra point)\n\n5 (out of 10) stars -  and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

Worse, the lame attempts at humour...\n\nAll the characters are forgettable dullards with the exception of Ed Harris who always brings his brand of gravitas. The plot & pacing is ok...just about watchable, tho' the premise had more promise than was delivered.\n\nSo we're left with the city-destroying FX and space scenes to dine out on....which is surely the main reason we watch this sort of movie anyway. And they're mostly not bad. Over-reliance on mediocre CGI betrays a weightless cartoony sheen over things, aircraft/spacecraft are especially cheap-looking. The space-station & astronaut scenes were fairly well done, tho' not on Gravity level. City-destroying stuff was ok, but shots didn't linger long enough and there wasn't anything really original. We've seen this sort of thing before, and better, with the likes of San Andreas, Day After Tomorrow, Deep Impact, 2012 etc.\n\nA low 4/10. Not really worth your time, tho' maybe Disaster-Movie completists might find some value in the destruction scenes.\n\n3D-rating: decent depth but FX aren't interesting enough to boost the score or earn a recommendation."

        "review_detailed_main": "As soon as the trailer dropped I knew this film would be a joke. In recent years, Gerard Butler has become a king of being in hammy, corny, films so I knew this would be just about the same. I actually do like global disaster films no matter how cheesy the films usually tend to be. I knew not to expect much and just sit back and enjoy large scale cinematic disaster. After viewing the film, I am actually disappointed. The film stays too focused on its political themes, conspiracy, and character dialogue than something that should focus on its disaster element.\n\nThe film is about a scientist who has to travel to space to fix 'Dutchboy' a satellite network that controls global climate in space. However, someone has been manipulating the satellites causing large scale climactic disaster around the world. The mystery runs deep basing itself on a political level. Its up to the scientist and his once estranged brother to save the planet from a geostorm that is threatening to destroy the planet in its entirety.\n\nThe film does not offer enough disaster, straight up. I enjoyed 2012 (through its stupidity) because it offered many scenes of global destruction. This film shies away from it and only offers it in doses. Its the main reason anyone wants to watch the film. Yet we are subjected to far too much character moments, an on the nose political agenda, and a very generic political conspiracy that is actually really easy to solve. You've seen it all before, you will leave the theater completely forgetting the experience.\n\nYou can see why this film was in developmental hell for a bit, there's just not a whole lot going on that can warrant your attention. Gravity did all the space scenes better and this film felt like it wanted to rip a few scenes. The actual disaster from weather scenes look nice but as mentioned before they don't come often and do little to add to a film that doesn't have a whole lot else going for it. I didn't expect much but still managed to be disappointed.\n\n5/10"
