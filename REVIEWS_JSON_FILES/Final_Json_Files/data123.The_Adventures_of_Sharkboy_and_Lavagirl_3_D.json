        "review_detailed_main": "I can't remember the last time a movie confused and tormented my filmgoing soul as much as this movie did. Everything inside of me, everything in me that loves Shawshank Redemption and Vertigo and Raging Bull and all these great great great classic movies tells me that Sharkboy and Lavagirl was awful. And it was. Drastically awful. And I enjoyed almost every minute of it. Let me try and explain it this way - I have written ongoing lists of the greatest films ever made, and the worst films ever made, and Sharkboy and Lavagirl is the only movie I've ever seen that has gotten a placement in both lists for me.\n\nSharkboy is about a young child named Max who dreams up wonderful fantasies and adolescent superhero type adventures. Eventually he travels into this dream world aided by the aforementioned Sharkboy and Lavagirl as they fight to keep the dream world a happy go lucky place from the evil Mr. Electric. So there's the story. Simple, childish, and a bit reminiscent of Neverending Story. I knew this plot before my 6 year old cousin made me watch the film and I sighed. What a waste of two hours this would be. Then something strange happened. I got a chill. Then Lavagirl and Sharkboy appeared and took Max into their spaceship, and I got more chills. Throughout the course of the movie, especially in the end, I was enthralled and received more goosebumps than when I watched Braveheart, much to the embarrassment of my dumbfounded girlfriend.\n\nI have no idea how to explain my reaction to the film. I was pleasantly surprised, obviously, and I had a lot of fun watching the movie (I'm excluding the terrible 3-D version of the film, which is a pointless distract-or and takes away a lot of the magic). Then why am I only giving this movie 5 stars out of 10 (a middling mark to avoid giving it a 10 or a 1)? For the same reason why the movie is both on my list of most hated and most loved - it's a bad movie. To say it's a guilty pleasure to me would be underestimating guilt and pleasure. The script is silly, the special effects are slapdash, the editing is at times incoherent, the acting is atrocious, and there are moments where even my 6 year old cousin grimaced at the lame dialogue. But damned if this movie isn't a lot of fun.\n\nSo I can't really recommend the movie to anyone over the age of 10. I still can't believe that I, a 17 year old classic film lover, enjoyed this movie as much as I did. But I can definitely tell that it's a movie younger kids, especially boys (for I'm pretty sure every boy this age has dreams and fantasies just like the ones in the film) will love. I harkin this bizarre feeling I have for Sharkboy to when you find an old cartoon you used to love as a young child and watch it again. Even though you're reciting the lines and the songs like you did when you were young, you know deep down that if it wasn't a childhood favourite and gave you so much nostalgia, you'd hate it just as much as everyone else. This is what this movie was like for me. It was the childhood flick I never got to see. Maybe that warrants a recommendation. Maybe still not. I really don't know - you'll have to see it for yourself and find out.\n\nOr maybe not."

He has a wild imagination and enjoyed seeing a movie about a boy with a similar imagination. Taylor Dooley is adorable, and Taylor Lautner has some great moves in the movie. I asked my son for a quote about the movie: \"It is exciting, adventurous, and the 3-d effects could have been a little better, but if it wasn't 3-d it wouldn't be good at all\". It's a kids movie and my kid liked it, maybe yours will too. I"

If you have a boy between the ages of 5 and 12, you are probably going to have/get to see this film so here's what to expect:\n\nMore of the same... only less. Sorry if that doesn't make sense but it will. More of the same because it's just like \"Spy Kids 3-D\" on the way it looks and unfold. It looks like a video game and is very predictable. Less is because there is, unfortunately, hardly any good 3-D sequences. Nothing pops out at you the way it did in SPY KIDS except for when someone sneezes or throws something, and that is not too often. The 3-D in the action scenes was poor and barely noticeable. You can't expect too much from the RED AND BLUE 3-D but this was a step backwards from SPY KIDS.\n\nThe good news is that you will probably not get a headache from the 3-D like SPY KIDS. My 6 year old loved it and did not say a word throughout (a minor miracle), so i guess it does what it is supposed to do. Entertain the kids."

It was a true horror to have to see it again almost 15 years after the first time, I think I speak for everyone when I say that we remembered it a thousand times better in general.\n\nThe acting is so bad that it becomes a little uncomfortable, the plot of \"being a dreamer\" is super poor with an ultra cliche message seen in a thousand other children's films and the use of the green screen is simply a disaster, it's laughable as they proudly promote it on the poster, putting 3D in large.\n\nBUT, this movie was a part of my childhood, and I'm sure many other people's. Looking at the positive, the characters are original and I couldn't stop laughing watching George Lopez as Mr. Electric.\n\nIt is definitely not a good film, but if we let ourselves be carried away by nostalgia and not so much by criticism, it is quite good."

I think Taylor Dooley has a great smile and I hope this movie won't be an end to her acting career. My son lost interest in the movie before it was 1/2 over. We saw it in 2-D in a home theater (DVD). From the other reviews I have read, we didn't miss a lot with regards to the 3-D. The plot was a cross between a never ending story and a never ending story. My son still loves the toy though. And I look foreword to more of Miss Dooleys smile.\n\nI don't want to be accused of padding my comment with junk words, but when you have said all there is to say about a movie, I don't think you should be required to say more. Lest you end up in the same position as the writer of this movie. Forced by the constraints of running time or in this case a websites guidelines to stretch 5 lines of dialog into 10 lines of commentary."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is sort of a double review cause me and my girlfriend watched this together and we both have \"thoughts\" about it.\n\nMy 9yo cousin gave us this movie just cause he liked it...he even got us a couple pairs of 3d glasses to watch it with.\n\nBoth of us thought the movie was kid junk, but really isn't that what it was supposed to be? There were some fun spots though.\n\nTRAVIS: Most of the characters I hated. (Too bad Mr. Electric didn't do away with some of em before he was defeated.) They were weak and poorly acted...esp. Max. But I liked Sharkboy for the most part. He had that cocky attitude that sort of appeals to me. And, although not original, some of his one-liners were cool.\n\nANNETTE: Travis is a bit harsh (as usual), but I'll agree with him about weak and poorly acted characters. I couldn't even identify with Lavagirl, although I thought she was quite attractive. Sharkboy was a really cute guy though. Mr. Electric/Teacher was nothing short of annoying.\n\nTRAVIS: Story was really lame, but it's probably good enough for younger kids. It pretty much bored me tho. Some of the 3d was okay and I noticed it looked a heck of a lot better on our LCD TV than the old one.\n\nANNETTE: Yes. The story was very weak. But it was colourful, and as Travis noted, should appeal to a younger audience. 3d was fun, but not the best I've seen. We watched this on a 27-inch LCD screen with quite nice results.\n\nANNETTE: I thought the scene where Lavagirl zaps Sharkboy out of jealousy was the cutest part of this movie. And the way Sharkboy copied the tone of the Jurassic Park character's false calm in his \"yell...scream\" comment when they were on the \"train-of-thought\" was sort of humorous.\n\nTRAVIS: Yeah Annette. You would like that zapping scene! My favourite scene was when Sharkboy says \"ouch\" with that sh*t-eating grin on his face when Lavagirl kisses him.\n\nWell, anyhow, as you can see, we didn't totally abhor this movie. Although I think we both agree the only decent acting was by Sharkboy. For the most part this movie was boring. But that's most likely because we are too old for it. If you've got younger kids, it will probably entertain them adequately. Avg. rating=5.\n\nTRAVIS: I rated this a 4 cause it seemed to be cranked out without much thought. With some extra work it could have been a lot better. The only reason it gets as high as a 4 is cause I liked Sharkboy.\n\nANNETTE: I rated this a 6 because it seemed to appeal to the audience intended. But I also agree that with more time and attention there certainly could have been a lot of improvement. Perhaps if Rodriguez decides to make a sequel, he will obtain a better story with better actors and surprise us all."

        "review_title": "\"But when Max snoozes, he wins.\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "A colorful and occasionally imaginative film, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (In 3-D!!!) is an overall disappointment, a movie that had good intentions at the beginning, but devolved into a cheesy \"message for our youth.\" The movie revolves around Max (Cayden Boyd), the picked-on grade school student who would rather create his own world rather than live in the real one. Of course he's picked on by class bully Linus (Jacob Davich), of course his parents are always fighting (David Arquette and Kristin Davis), and of course Max lives life as a miserable school student who has very little going for him. Writer/director Robert Rodriguez formulated the entire movie, from story to special effects, based on inspirations provided by his children. There are reasons that most movies, even the bad ones, are not made by children. The movie is well meaning, but relies on too many familiar story devices: class bullies, mean teachers, quiet kids who save the day. We've seen this movie before, but the colorful, Super Mario-Mushroom Kingdom-like worlds that inhabit the movie does add some to the entertainment value. Max is taken to his dream world, known as Planet Drool, by Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley), the two superheroes of the world. Each superhero contains some depth, not as much as the superheroes in The Incredibles, but the nice little subplot of each character trying to find their place in the world was a nice touch. For instance, after one difficult scene to watch, we now know Sharkboy cannot rap well at all. Otherwise, the characters are each have one note. George Lopez hams it up, most likely intentionally to offer a cheese element to this movie, but I found his characters to be annoying. The movie's plot lacks any imagination, and the world of Planet Drool does feature some creativity, but not enough to save an otherwise pedestrian family feature. This movie is Rodriguez's second foray into the 3-D genre, and though I did not use the 3-D glasses while viewing the movie, the scenes accenting the technology are pretty obvious to the casual observer and distract from the overall viewing experience. I really enjoyed the visual style Robert Rodriguez employed in Sin City, and that movie may have even been enhanced with a few 3-D moments, but Sharkboy and Lava girl was a move in the opposite direction for the maverick director."

Everyone thinks he's making them up until one day, they show up to whisk him off to Planet Drool to help them fight the evil Mr. Electric (George Lopez) and Minus.\n\nThe plot sounds like a film that only kids will like. However, it has Rodriguez behind the camera and he did a good job with the first two Spy Kids movies. Unfortunately, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D is no where near as good as his previous work. Besides for Rodriguez, I didn't really have high hopes for the film Spy Kids 3D was awful and the trailers made this film seem like a joke. While watching the film, I thought it really was a joke. It was really cheesy and it was quite bereft of entertainment. I was hoping the film would start picking up from the weak start. Unfortunately, it didn't.\n\nThe acting is horrible which is surprising since the kids in Spy Kids were pretty good actors. Taylor Lautner, who plays Sharkboy, does the worst job and he gives a really wooden performance. Taylor Dooley, who plays Lavagirl, isn't much better and her performance is pretty weak. George Lopez just makes a fool of himself and he gives an over the top performance. David Arquette and Kristen Davis both give decent performances but they don't really appear in the film. The lead, who is played by Cayden Boyd, also gives a wooden performance. I know they are just kids but their efforts felt a little weak.\n\nI am really disappointed with Robert Rodriguez. The direction was really weak and the editing seem to have been done by a child. He spent too much time on the style instead of the story. Sadly, the film isn't even that stylish and it just looks like a mess. The story is pretty cheesy and lame. I know it was written by a kid but it was still pretty weak. Since the story is weak, the film is very dull. The sad thing is that the movie is only 85 minutes long but it feels so much longer since there is very little here to actually enjoy. The special effects are also pretty bad and they left me with a headache. In the end, this family film is better left on the shelf. Rating 2/10"

It also helps to be not over the age of 9.\n\nStill bearing that in mind and trying to view the film with a child's eye it's a charming story about a young kid whose make believe fantasy superhero friends come to life and take him to where one of them is from.\n\nHow'd you like to live on planet drool, as if some us might not live there already. That's where Lavagirl is from and the planet is in danger where kids are being held captive on an eternally moving roller-coaster. When one is on such a machine one hasn't the time to think or even daydream and in this world imagination is the enemy of the ruler, George Lopez who in a Wizard of Oz like turn is also the 3rd grade teacher in real life.\n\nCayden Boyd is the day dreaming Max who even keeps a journal of the adventures of his two friends. Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley are Sharkboy and Lavagirl, Lautner has certainly grown up and out in the past five years and now has some considerable box office pull with the Twilight films. David Arquette and Kristin Davis are Boyd's bickering parents who don't quite seem to have the time for their kid any longer.\n\nSharkboy and Lavagirl is a nice family film for those who have an eye for fantasy of The Wizard Of Oz kind."

        "review_detailed_main": "Robert Rodriguez stunned the cinema world about a dozen years ago with the low budget El Mariachi, a story of mistaken identity, a lethal guitar case, and a mariachi who just wants to play his instrument. Since then, the director has not had to scrounge for money and exceeds expectations with movies as varied as Spy Kids and Sin City.\n\nAfter seeing the lava scene in Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, director Rodriguez' son, Racer, came up with the story for The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Dad then creates a song of praise to that imagination, certainly not in short supply in the Rodriguez family. Max (Cayden Boyd) dreams and makes real the fantastic heroes of his mind. The film labors to be cute and instructive, two characteristics better left by themselves in movies or kept the province of artists like animators at Dreamworks.\n\nOne hero of Max's imagination can melt whatever she wants by ejecting lava; the other can do considerable damage with his teeth. Max's school bully and the electronics teacher are transformed through Max's imagination into look-alikes of Reddy Kilowatt and Flash Gordon's evil Ming the Merciless. Thus ensues an adventure not as sharp as Spy Kids nor accomplished as Frank Miller's Sin City.\n\nThe didacticism (exhortations to believe in your dreams, dream with your eyes open, change your life through your dreams, blah, blah) is heavily administered through speechifying at almost every turn. Even the graphics are imperfect, cumbersome, dull, and by contemporary standards, pedestrian. Lava and lightening, sharks and ice cube monsters look like elementary school creations.\n\nMax has a McCauley Culkin innocent look without the effeminate innocence and wiliness that made us feel comfortable when he was home alone. The principals, Boyd and Dooley, lack acting skills beyond awkwardly flashing well-attended teeth. A little like the characters from Peter Pan, these children are variously looking for parents either to pay attention to them or work harder at staying together as parents, similar to the four teens of this month's Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, a superior young-person's film blessed with solid acting and believable setups. The Adventures of Shark Boy & Lava Girl in 3-D is even worse because the 3-D is still annoying after all these years to perfect that technology.\n\nShakespeare in Hamlet described the range of imagination: \"Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till we find it stopping a bung-hole?\" This film could at best hold back the wine."

The script is probably top 5 worst I've ever seen. The animations were just unforgivable with horrid green screen backgrounds. This may be a hit for an absolute brainless kids movie, but as far as anything else goes, this movie tanks!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I hadn't planned on wasting my time reviewing this mess, but there are some subtleties that crept into my consciousness after the second forced viewing which may enhance a prospective viewer's experience.\n\nFirst of all, this movie obviously was designed for younger kids. That fact alone has a detrimental effect on a review done by an adult (as can be seen by previous reviews). However, it should be noted that a movie for the target audience will most likely be attended by their parents or guardians, and should be at least bearable for them also. This movie falls short in that regard.\n\nMy son, who is 5, absolutely raves about this movie, and will no doubt wear out the DVD in the next few weeks. But my younger brother, who is 17, walked out five minutes into it. Kids under 12 will probably be best entertained by Sharkboy & Lavagirl. It is a very colourful movie with a lot of motion and many bizarre graphics. There is nothing offensive in this movie by the way. Even the \"fight\" scenes are mild and clean.\n\nNow, the main subtlety on my mind is that Sharkboy (who was the best actor in this colourful, but mindless drivel) has obvious hidden talent. This movie, however, was not the right venue to expose that talent. Sharkboy moves well in action scenes and would be more aptly suited to a martial arts style role. Also, Sharkboy has a wide range of facial expressions (although the ones emphasised by this movie consisted mainly of scowls and frowns). With continued training, suitable roles, and of course (and most importantly) proper direction, Sharkboy could go far with his acting career. Also, he is a decent looking lad, which seems to be a requirement for an acting career these days. I'm certainly hoping we'll be seeing more of Sharkboy in the future.\n\nAnother noted item: If you have the 2D version, it seems to be far superior to the 3D. My son thought the glasses were fun the first time, but after that he didn't want anything to do with them and now only watches the 2D version. Possibly this 3D effect is better if viewed in a theatre.\n\nI'm giving out a rating of 7 for this title, simply because it certainly has the ability to entertain the kids...which was its purpose I'm sure. I would definitely recommend Sharkboy & Lavagirl if you have younger children. For adults it has no value whatsoever."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sharkboy and Lava Girl has achieved a level of infamy few other children's films really reach. This movie is so bad, so ugly, so tremendously incompetent that it's honestly worth studying. Look, I love Robert Rodriguez as a director. I think he's a man with a lot of passion, vision, and drive, and I respect his dedication to film and doing a lot of stuff himself.\n\nBut...it takes a special kind of hubris to take your child's insane ramblings (sorry, I mean...\"dreams\") and turn it into a full length feature film. To be fair, this film does feel like a child wrote it; it's so nonsensical and often, incomprehensible, I genuinely believe Racer Max Rodriguez (yes, his child's honest-to-God name) had a role in the writer's room.\n\nThe two worst things about this movie are its visuals and its performances. This thing is truly an assault on the eyes; it's got some of the ugliest CG I have ever seen and honestly looks like a parody film you'd find on YouTube. The backgrounds, the action, the CG characters all look unacceptably bad for a film from 2005 and come off sometimes actually horrific. (That Lava Girl-as-lava image is indelibly burned in my mind now)\n\nMost of the time, the film's primarily child actors (except the boy who plays Linus - he rules) don't seem to understand what they're supposed to be seeing and acting against. It leads to some truly hilarious moments, like when Lava Girl and Sharkboy are looking in different directions while talking to the same person or the actors don't get what emotion they're supposed to convey.\n\nTo be fair, most of the adults are also pretty bad here as well; there's a scene where Kristin Davis and David Arquette (our protagonist Max's parents) are supposed to be giants and eating from...\"the land of cookies and milk.\" Arquette holds the cookie in the palm of his hand and eats it, essentially confirming he had no idea what he was supposed to be doing.\n\nThis movie is so full of awkward and cringe inducing moments, yet you can't even give Rodriguez credit for being imaginative. This is such a predictable and paint by numbers story, and the world that we enter isn't even that interesting. We have...giant plug monsters and \"trains of thought\" and the aforementioned giant dessert world...is this really as creative as it could've been?\n\nAs it stands, this movie is truly awful. But so bad, it's genuinely hilarious. You need to watch it, preferably under the influence of something."

I'll certainly say that it's better than the third \"Spy-Kids.\" However, the story still lacking a bit. But that's to be expected seeing as it's directed towards kids, not to say that they don't have a clue of what's going on, but it's still directed toward the ones who don't have to think too hard about what's going on. They can just watch a movie that is great entertainment. I sometimes wonder how Rodriguez and his own kid, who did help out with the story, come up with this stuff. It's amazing. Plus, it shows how much Robert Rodriguez loves his son, in that he made this movie for him.\n\nStill, if you have children of your own, see it with them. They'll enjoy it."

I am 17 now. And saw this movie in 2007 when I was 5 two years after the movie came out. And I need to share an experience my friends and I had recently. We were all at a trivia for our school when suddenly we saw a question that reminded us of this movie. We had all seen it since it was a childhood film of ours and we absolutely loved it. So after that trivia night. We went straight to my house. Found it on on demand. And watched the whole thing. Sure. The movie has poor CGI and it has fart jokes. But half the fun of watching the movie is making fun of it as you watch. It's a children's movie. Made in 2005. What do you expect? But it doesn't matter. Cause I can almost guarantee that your children will be inspired by the creativity of this movie. And will want to dress up as the characters for Halloween. This movie is amazing because it brings kids together. And really stirs up their creative side. And if a group of 15-17 year olds can laugh and have a good time watching this movie. Your kids definitely will. Thank you for reading."

        "review_detailed_main": "Max is a 10-year-old schoolboy whose life is not going well. His parents' marriage is not a happy one, and he is not popular at school, often being teased by his classmates for his dreamy, imaginative nature. He escapes into an imaginary dream world named Planet Drool (yes, really). The two main inhabitants of this planet are two superhero-type characters, Sharkboy (who was raised by a family of sharks after his marine biologist father disappeared) and Lavagirl, who has the ability to produce fire and lava. The film follows Max's strange adventures when he is mysteriously transported into his dream world, where he meets Sharkboy and Lavagirl and characters who bear a strange resemblance to his teacher Mr. Electricidad, Linus the class bully and Mr Electricidad's daughter Marissa, another classmate.\n\nThe film was not popular with the critics, much of the criticism being directed at the allegedly poor 3-D effects and the storyline. It does not seem to be very popular with reviewers on this board either; it is rare that I review a film with a rating as low as 3.5. Well, I myself cannot comment on the 3-D, as I saw it in a 2-D television version. As for the storyline, I felt that too many of the critics were forgetting that this is a children's film and trying to judge it by adult standards.\n\nCertainly, judged by the logic of the everyday, rational world the story does not make a great deal of sense. But that is not the logic by which the film should be judged. Its logic is that of \"Alice in Wonderland\" or \"The Wizard of Oz\", that is to say the logic of the dream. As Lavagirl says \"Everything that is or ever was began with a dream\". Much of the story was, in fact, thought up by the children of the writer-director Robert Rodriguez. This is, however, an \"Alice in Wonderland\" updated for the computer age of the 21st century. Mr Electricidad's alter ego on Planet Drool is the planet's electrician Mr. Electric, and much of the film's imagery is drawn from the world of technology, such as a robot or \"plughounds\", dog-like creatures made out of electrical cables. There are, however, more conventional fairy-tale elements, such as the Ice Princess (based on Marissa), who possesses a Crystal Heart which can freeze time.\n\nTrying to judge a film like this one is difficult for me, because I have no children of my own. I have to try and think myself back into my own childhood and ask \"Would I have enjoyed a film like this in those days?\" And the answer is \"Yes, I would\", even though \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" is very different to anything that was actually about in the sixties and seventies when I was young. Yes, the story may be eccentric, even at time silly. But that is just what many kids like. 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The audience intended for \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D\" is for kids to about age 11...at the most. So, having another review by an adult saying they hated the film isn't anything unusual or even totally necessary. The important thing is will kids enjoy this film that has managed to land on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list? I don't know....and assume for many of them the answer is no...though I am not sure.\n\nSo why did I watch the movie? After all, I am not a kid and the film, by many standards, is terrible. It's because I have a weird hobby...watching as many films as I can from the Bottom 100 list. Some of the pictures aren't that bad...some are unintentionally funny...some are just terrible....it's quite the adventure seeing which is the case for each film.\n\nWhen I first started watching the movie, I was taken aback by the CGI. While it's one of the earliest CGI-intensive live-action films, compared to similar pictures (such as \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\"), it is hideous. Much of it is due to the color palate...and the colors heavily lean towards neon green, neon purple and neon pink. It's an assault on the eyes and my eyes kept threatening to either bleed or run away and leave me!! For adults, this alone make the film horrid...though kids often love garish colors (as seen in such movies as \"The Oogieloves\" and TV shows like \"Teletubbies\").\n\nThe story is about a loner, Max, and his two new friends, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, and their attempt to save the world. The friends have obvious super-powers...so why do they need Max? Well, down deep he does have powers...the power of dreams (yick!). And, together they attempt to rid the world of its worst menace....George Lopez.\n\nI hated the film. The writing was sloppy, filled with cliches and the characters seemed like caricatures. To say the movie was like a bigger budgeted bad Nickelodeon live-action show is pretty much on target. But, and I must repeat, it was never intended to please adults....though making it this tough to enjoy hurt marketing because parents (at least sane ones) don't send little kids to the theaters alone....and imagining any parent sitting though this is pretty tough! In additon to the terrible writing and CGI, special attention should be given to George Lopez and his rotten and one-dimensional acting. You can't blame the kids for being bad and in a bad film...but Lopez should have known better. I wonder if he could look at himself in the mirror after making this mess. I hope not.\n\nFinally, I would love to know how this film cost $50,000,000 to make. After all, the CGI isn't good and was apparently rushed. Perhaps the bulk of the money went to Robert Rodriguez. After all, he has something like a dozen credits in this movie...writing, directing, acting and much more. Regardless, it seems like for the money, it should have been much better."

It's about some kid named Max(Rosie O'Donnel is more convincing than him) that has stupid fantasies of superheros that are bad actors. It's a rip-off of Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan, and the only laughs are because of how annoyingly stupid this is. There are several horrid one liners told by Sharkboy(Lavagirl's hair catches on fire and he says, \"Let her cool off some steam\".) Any good reviews that you read of this are from kids 3 and under that learned to type, or mentally disabled adults. David Arquette lends his bad acting to an extremely pointless and brainless part. I had to cringe when Sharkboy started singing an off tune and non sensible song. One of the lines from the song is, \"Go to sleep you little bleep.\"....what? What's a little bleep? Also, the 3-D was horrible and was so dark that I could only stand the first 2 minutes of it, then the glasses went off. All the other people in the theater were either sleeping or putting guns up to their heads if the movie didn't end in a minute. Don't see this horrible movie ever. After you see it, you'll be depressed.\n\nMy rating-0%-F- 90 minutes(way too long). rated PG for poopy humor and some ugly computer generated action."

After the first 5 minutes I knew we in trouble! My husband got a migraine from the poorly done 3-D effects and I ended up with double vision that lasted 30 minutes after the movie. My 12 yr old fell asleep about 15 minutes into the movie, which probably was a blessing for him. That had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Not just the worst kids movie, the worst movie. When you go to see a film made for children you expect a bit of cheesiness, but this was way over the cheese quota. The acting was horrific, the storyline was lame and the special effects were, well, not so special. Yes, I know his son wrote part of it. My 6 yr old wants to be a director and writes his own \"movie scripts\" from time to time and directs his friends. Some are good, some not so good. Everything your child writes doesn't necessarily need to be produced! Save your money, your vision and your sanity, wait for video and left your child watch it alone........"

The plot-pointless adults wandering about (the alternatively wooden and simpering David Arquette and Kristin Davis) to the overt posturing by the kids (especially Taylor Lautner) kept me checking my watch every so often. George Lopez was the one slightly bright spot of the film, but even his caricature teacher or \"Electricity\" villain wore thin after the first half of the film.\n\nAgain, my boys and their friend loved it; children this age rarely catch gaping plot holes when sharks are jumping at them from the screen or a kid's karate chops can defeat an ornery electrical cord. Having seen the vast majority of all American-made \"kid\" or \"kid friendly\" movies, though, made me want to rank this stinker at the bottom of the list."

I saw only a few minutes of the movie when I realized how much worst the movie was from every movie Robert Rodriguez had ever made including Spy Kids. The acting was the worst acting that I had ever seen! I couldn't believe people were actually watching the movie without rioting at the waste of time and effort they were experiencing! So after a few games of \"lets see how long you can stay in the movie before leaving\" i eventually saw a massive amount of this movie with large regret. Parents coming out of the movie with kids looked amazed that they spent money on it and a few wanted refunds. I just thought I would share my agony with others to ensure that no one has to ever go through what I went through.\n\nI obviously do not recommend this to anyone unless they are using it to torture foreign prisoners for information."

He grabbed my shirt and motioned for me to watch, even though I already was. I think I just witnessed my son discovering his first hero.\n\nMy daughter laughed and laughed. She loved Lavagirl. She thought it was hilarious when Lavagirl zapped Sharkboy because he said someone else was prettier. And my daughter is old enough to understand the themes of pursuing your goals and remaining strong in the face of discouragement. So I think she walked away very pleased with the film. She said she wants to be Lavagirl for Halloween.\n\nIf you're 16+ this movie is a loser. You won't like it, and that explains all the low scores you're seeing here. This movie just isn't for adults. But if you are a parent looking to entertain your kids, this movie works. And if you are reading this near the end of 2005 or later, you should probably know that renting this as a video will be a fine way to keep your kids occupied.\n\n-Tony"

But then I heard that it was his son's idea, and I did warm up to it. That said I didn't go to the theater expecting very much, but I knew I wanted to watch it with the mindset of a child. I have a younger brother, and now that I have seen it... I want to take him. But wouldn't have taken him without seeing it first, as he is still quite young. So my girlfriend and I went, and after a heated debate about film with some cinematic idiot while my girlfriend was in the washroom, we went in to see what it was all about.\n\nSo I'm not going to write out all the thing I liked it didn't like as a play by play on this movie. The one main thing that I really hated was the constant puns. But really, if I was a kid, I really think I would like it, a lot. It didn't seem all that different to me than any of the spy kids, and I plan on taking my little brother to see if my theory is true. The 3D worked on me, and while things weren't flying in my face the whole time, it did give the movie a strange depth.\n\nSo what can I say, I was in no way expecting cinematic brilliance but I did enjoy most of what I say created before me. I'm 20 years old, and I think I understood what they were trying to do.\n\nSo, I don't know... give it a chance. Take a kid to see it, or just try to enjoy it for what it is. But try to remember this, when you are a kid your imagination is insane. My brother tells me the most foolish, crazy stories... because he is a kid. The movie lets imagination run free, and I think that is a good thing."

The acting was OK, the plot was very basic, the script was not really good, and the score was kind of creepy. Also, the 3D was not the best 3D I have seen. In fact, it is not really realistic. This is not a film you should brag about seeing. I would rather see a movie like Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. But hey, this is only my opinion. I rate this a 5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, after seeing this film with my younger sister, the only really word that strikes my mind is \"original\". This movie, although very interesting and original in its own way, reminded me a lot of \"The Never Ending Story\".\n\nI'm not going to go to \"slay\" this movie, fair to say that I didn't enjoy it as much as other Rodrigeuz films. But the reason for that is plain and simple...it-is-a-kids-film. The film's story was thought up by Rodrigeuz's seven year old son, Racer. And in those terms the story is very fitting for children of around that age group. My 10 year old sister loved it! And I'm sure many people here would agree that it was a \"poor\" film, or a \"bland\" film or a \"Rodrigeuz's weakest\" film. But simply, the vast majority of every member on this website is above the age required to enjoy this film! It sparked my sisters imagination, and my cousins. So, from a 16 year olds point of view, I'd give this a 5/10. From a child's point of view, I'll give it a 9/10. I'd seriously recommend this film to children below the age of 13, for it was intended for that age range. However, the 3D \"gimmick\" doesn't really live up to expectation, and it makes the colours of the film very two-tonal (red and green) and I think that the film would be much better if it was just simple 2D. The film is very cheesy, but it's message is received loud and clear and adds a certain \"feel good\" factor to the movie. To adults that factor may be \"thank god its over\", to children, it'll be so much more awe inspiring and imaginative! Your kids will most likely start keeping dream journals and invent characters of a similar calibre to Lavagirl and Sharkboy! A film that re-defines imagination as being something that should be open, outspoken and above all cherished. Something that is becoming increasingly rare with children, due to the steady rise of \"video games\", \"TV shows\" and \"Films\","

Whether or not such a thing can be made into something amazing, that is not the case here. Few will contest that. But looking further, this does have some merit. By no means the greatest writer, Rodriguez does have both creativity and a well-developed imagination. He lets them roam free in large parts of this, and actually comes up with a clever thing or two, amongst that which\u0085 isn't. Some of the humor is childish, and certain gags are repeated somewhat ad naseum. Downright cringe-inducing does it become when a character actually follows up his quip, painful enough already, with an explanation of the double meaning. And that even happens more than once. The puns most definitely could have been, well, done without entirely, in an awful lot of cases. Characters are terribly flat and one-note\u0085 fleshing out never has been Robert's strong suit. Designs aren't half bad. The CGI could be better, if worse has been seen. The action is invariably quite entertaining, the fighting in particular. The acting varies, with a larger portion only reaching \"passable\". Like the first Spy Kids(I haven't watched the others), this has a moral to it, if a relatively naive one, and the content is perfectly acceptable to show even to the youngest family members. Everything is fairly simplified herein. I recommend this to fans of Robert Rodriguez, and/or those fond of comic books, a style captured rather skilfully here. 5/10"

Once with a friend and her kids; And again with my 14 year old.\n\nOf course it's a stinker. But then many movies that managed to attain cult status have been worse stinkers than this one ('Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' for example).\n\nOne method whereby movies rise to cult level is by negative recommendation. People tell friends how bad it is, and the friends watch it to see why. And I've certainly noticed a whole lot of negative comments regarding this movie. For a long time 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' was regaled as the worse movie made. I and many of my acquaintances watched it just to see why it got that reputation. 'Plan 9' now enjoys a modest cult following.\n\nAnother contributing factor is unintentional humour. My second viewing of this movie had me chuckling at Lavagirl's constant Cheshire grins, and at some of the tacked in nonsense to show off the 3d effect (Sharkboy throwing a glass of water toward the audience during his \"dance\" routine, for example).\n\nSometimes deviating radically from the \"norm\" can project a film into the realm of cult status also. This movie, while not engaging in major deviation, still has enough strangeness about it to give it a little push in that direction.\n\nWho knows. Perhaps in the future, droves of teenagers (and maybe adults too) will throng to theatres late at night, 3d glasses in hand, to see this little piece...as they do now for 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'.\n\nRight now the future looks grim for this oddity, but I would certainly not be surprised to see it pop up out of nowhere sometime down the road."

A six-year-old?\n\nDespite the horrible quality of the film, I must say that there were some amusing moments in it, I think casting George Lopez was a great idea.\n\nOverall, this film could have had a lot of potential, but instead they turned it into a computer-generated mess of a Planet Drool."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sequestered away on his Austin, TX ranch, much like George Lucas on Skywalker Ranch and ILM in the Nicasio Valley of California and Peter Jackson's digital wizards at Weta Digital in New Zealand, Robert Rodriguez has seemingly created for himself a haven to explore not only his own creative juices, but also whatever creative whims seem to be floating through the minds of his children.\n\nHave you ever had a small child tell you a story? It usually goes something like \"And then... blah blah blah... and then... blah blah blah... and then...\" In other words, it rambles ceaselessly with no apparent meaningful beginning or end. This movie is just such an example--and an object lesson that just because you can do something doesn't mean you should, no matter all the nifty gadgetry you have on your ranch.\n\nIn short, that is \"Sharkboy and Lava Girl\"--coupled with some reigning in by dad who didn't want an otherwise nonsensical story about \"dreams\" or \"the power of dreams\" or \"dreamers\" (or whatever it's about) to wander off too far from a movie's standard three-act set. He squeezed his kid's dreams reluctantly into the movie mold.\n\n\"Acted\" by three kids 99% against green screen, the CG is laid on thick and unimaginatively. This is CG for the sake of CG, because it's way cheaper to pay 10 mouse jockeys $50K a year in Texas then it is to build millions of dollars worth of sets.\n\nThe movie starts actually with decent potential, but the story and plot meanders after Max arrives on his dreamt \"Planet Drool,\" when the CG is put on like a garish suit. Max ultimately discovers his \"true power\" and becomes a \"day dreamer\" and ferrets out the true identify of his dreamt Shark Boy and Lava Girl. This is all accompanied by a mystical synth. track that reminds us which certain moments are epiphanies.\n\n\"Shark Boy\" is a spiky-haired ADD case with WAY too much hair gel and kick-butt karate moves and flips (yes, the \"actor\" is a black belt Karate champ) and \"Lava Girl\" is an uber-cute misfit who is too hot to handle. Lava Girl does a lot of very wide smiles directly into the camera to remind you how cute she is. In other words, there's more ham on the set then there is for Christmas Dinner.\n\nTruly designed for kids who could care less about niggling details like plot, story, structure, and dialog, your wee ones will appreciate the surreal story line and bizarre graphics. My daughter LOVES the movie which may be a clear indication that I've somehow failed to raise her properly."

The actors were pretty bad (especially the kids), and sometimes, the kids would have this whole \"encouraging and make-you-feel-better\" speech. Kids won't understand what the point of the speech is if you take them to see this movie. They'll probably like the action and all, but they will think the whole speech thing is a snore. All I'm saying is that maybe we should try not to make that many kid action movies again for a while, because this is a perfect example of getting carried away with the fact that the main characters are supers. Kids, trust me, when you see this movie twenty years from now, you'll hate it."

But, let me tell you, DO NOT listen to those people. I came into the movie, and within the first 5 SECONDS I was already gripped into this story that hasn't even begun yet. As I progressed through the movie, I only got more and more baffled by all of the negative reviews and comments people were leaving. EVERYTHING about this movie is perfect. Everything was done with the utmost care and all the characters are deftly woven into deep, relatable characters that you really care about and want to succeed. The music is fully orchestrated and truly epic, a soundtrack to truly fit the eminence of everything else in the movie. The CGI in the movie is done extremely well, with certain camera tricks and acting makes it look real. I must say all the computer engineers did a great job on their part, precise to the smallest polygon or pixel. The story is an absolute roller-coaster, one emotion to the next, each scene more breathtaking than the last. In short, everything about this movie was perfection in every aspect.\n\nIn conclusion, do not trust the low IQ nonintellectual degenerates that call this movie \"trash\" or \"only kids stuff\", this is a movie, like many others, which is only for intellectuals and requires a very high IQ to truly understand the depth of what is playing on your television screen. Go see Sharkboy and Lavagirl now, that is, if you're intellect is high enough."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl In 3-D, is a live action film in which during the film you wear a pair of cardboard cut out glasses (given to you upon entering the film) and you put the glasses on when the screen tells you to (ninety percent of the film is in 3-D so you need to wear your glasses). The film is about a young boy named Max, who keeps a record of his dreams and one day shares with his class a dream he had about two superhero kids named Sharkboy and Lavagirl. After telling the class they all laugh at him and his teacher Mr. Electricidad, tells him to stop dreaming and one of the kids who bullies Max, named Linus steals his dream journal. Things also aren't going too well at home because Max's parents always seem to be fighting. One day at school Max's dreams come to life where after a tornado Sharkboy and Lavagirl appear to take Max with them to the planet Drool. While there they have to stop the evil Mr. Electric, who is turning the planet into an unhappy place to be. I usually tend not to see family films but the film is written and directed by Robert Rodriguez (who based this film on an idea he got from his son) who also directed this year's Sin City, which I liked a lot and plus I have always wanted to see a film in 3-D where I would have to wear a pair of cut out glasses so I decided to see this film. I was pleasantly surprised. The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl In 3-D, is very creative and interesting and has a lot of neat visual sight gags with the 3-D glasses and the story is also fun and entertaining and I think that with the 3-D effects and the creative and fun story that kids will love this movie. Parents will also find this movie imaginative and entertaining and should be able to have some fun with the 3-D glasses as well. A fun family film that is entertaining and has a lot of neat eye candy."

As for the two Taylors: Shark Boy came across as sulky rather than macho, and Lava Girl reminded me of a badly shot commercial for some kind of off-brand doll. The parents were useless and their scenes bogged down what action there was; George Lopez had some good moments, struggling to emerge from those that were merely tiresome. It is a pity that this film was so poorly realised, because the story itself was fascinating and, in the right hands, would have been amazing."

Shortly thereafter they meet the evil Mr. Electric, an evil George Lopez robot who's puns (such as \"I'm gonna hit you were it hertz\") are ironically the only parts of the movie that didn't have me laughing, especially since he feels it necessary to take an extra minute to explain them. And just to add to the evil of Lopez's character, he constantly attacks the three daring adventurers with his army of electrical cords. Yeah, it's as bad as it sounds.\n\nHowever, this movie did make me laugh harder then anything I've seen since Anchorman. Don't believe me? Watch this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDHye4Vmho. And that's probably Taylor Lautner's best scene.\n\nSo, in short, Robert Rodriguez needs to retire and become a plumber, what with this and Spy Kids he's gotta be getting used to crap, and George Lopez needs to fire his agent. At least Taylor Lautner solved all his problems my running around without a shirt on for a couple of hours."

I could also gather that the boy, as well as the writer and director of this heap, had no imagination. Maybe it was a low budget film or just an artistic way of doing something that so many other films successfully did before, but the production was horrible. Fortunately it was for kids, because kids are the only minds they could lay this on and get away with it."

It was horribly cheesy and any attempts at 'touching moments' just made me cringe. The children's acting was pretty bad- but the dialogue wouldn't have helped, the only relitavely good child actor was Max, who worked well with some pretty shocking lines. The movie was incontinuous, jumping around with no real point to a lot of stuff that was happening, and the 3D effects were pretty disappointing- the glasses gave a 3D headache. Although this movie was not made for my age group, i can still see it not appealing to younger kids, even little kids will not fall for the cheesy lines. definitely the worst movie i've seen, and a waste of 2 hours of my time."

I really didn't get it. the kid dream about it an he's living it, then again I didn't watch it, well i watched like ten minutes of it. The acting is awful, but what can you expect from kids, and i am ashamed for Latinos everywhere for George Lopez, i mean he's suppose to be a \"Mexican\" and he's doing this crap? What the hell is that about? And the green screen is so totally fake, i thought it was suppose to be like almost realistic and all that, it was so fake that i had to walk out of the room. I hated this movie along with the Spy Kids movies, and again Antonio He's Zorro, not this lame spy guy with 2 white kids that don't have an accent and Antonios accent. Shame on you if you watched more than half-an-hour of this film if you're not a parent, shame. Sorry for my spelling and stuff that didn't make sense. Thank You"

This movie tried to be appealing as Spy Kids, but it gets an effort for trying. The movie starts out with Max, an 11 year old. He is picked on a lot, because he tells the stories of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, who everybody says they don't exist. But Max believes they do. Until one day Sharkboy and Lavagirl ask for help. Is it real, or is it his imagination?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Robert Rodriguez has been rapidly releasing films since his low-budget miracle El Mariachi debuted thirteen years ago. That film reportedly cost a mere $7000 to shoot, but it instantly became its creator's meal ticket. Despite his obvious talent behind the camera and impressive work ethic, Rodriguez had never delivered another unique picture until this year's Sin City. Sadly, he has followed up that groundbreaking effort with a sappy 3-D nightmare based on a short story written by his 7-year old son.\n\nIt would have been better for audiences everywhere if Rodriguez had simply taken his son's story and posted it on the family refrigerator. Instead, he has taken advantage of his current good standing in Hollywood and manufactured one of the worst films in recent memory. The story, paper-thin as it is, revolves around 10 year-old Max and the title characters that exist in his dreams. If you have seen The Neverending Story, you've witnessed a far superior interpretation of this film's familiar themes.\n\nThe 3-D portions of the movie, which constitute most of its 92 minute running time, are shoddy and rarely engaging. It's ironic that a 3-D feature should be populated by such one-dimensional characters. The abundance of painfully corny humor is made worse by the unskilled actors who deliver it. Equally annoying is Rodriguez's inexplicable need to repeat the themes of the film in nearly every line of dialogue. Viewers of all ages are advised to stay away from this patronizing headache of a movie.\n\nRating: D-"

        "review_title": "A Huge Disappointment",
        "review_detailed_main": "I was excited to watch this. I love fantasy. I love kids films. I loved the first couple Spy Kids films and liked the third. I also love the rest of Robert Rodriguez' work, although I knew that most of it wouldn't be relevant here, of course. And even when The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl began, I loved the first twenty minutes of it or so--up until about the time they arrived at Planet Drool, this was cruising along at about a 9 for me. But then, almost inexplicably, the film falls apart. Rather than a nice, tight, fantastical, almost absurdist film about a couple superheroes, it becomes a random series of events taking place in a computer animated world that looks extremely rushed and unfinished.\n\nI say \"almost inexplicably\" falls apart above because as is well known, director Robert Rodriguez' son, Racer, came up with the story, which was supposedly inspired by his dreams. The material on Planet Drool does have a kind of dream logic to it, which in this case is to say that it basically has no logic to it. There are a few problems with this. Dream logic need not be \"no logic\". There actually is a kind of surrealistic logic that functions during most dreams, and most artistic works that we say have dream logic display this surrealistic logic. One event follows from another in a way that makes some sense; it's just surrealistic sense. Further, the material in the film prior to arriving at Planet Drool has that surrealistic logic rather than just no logic. And the most important point here--dream logic as the absence of logic during the Planet Drool section, which is the bulk of the film, makes it difficult to get into/care about what's happening on the screen. On Planet Drool, one event doesn't follow another logically, even surrealistically; it's all just random.\n\nSo it's almost inexplicable, then, because obviously there was a different approach to the first section. Maybe Racer approached it differently, or maybe adults such as Robert edited/revised it in a different way, or maybe the adults tried to edit/revise everything in the same way but just dropped the ball on the Planet Drool stuff. Whatever the reason, when they're on Planet Drool, the rules of the game keep changing, there's no sense of progression or an arc from one event to the next, there's no rhyme or reason to the characters, including the villain, and there's an uncomfortable combination of derivativeness (of everything from The Neverending Story to Wizard of Oz to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to Tron to everything else that Racer has probably watched), groaner corniness (the puns based on heat, fish and dreams/imagination grow more desperate by the minute) and very poorly executed computer animation. The quality of the computer animation is worse than typical early generation PlayStation 1 games. It's not as blocky, but it is as rudimentary and incomplete-looking.\n\nOf course, defenders of the film keep bringing up, \"But it's a kids' film! You're not supposed to like it!\" There are a couple problems with that kind of argument. Whether I'm \"supposed\" to like kids' films or not, I do like the vast majority of them. I've done a good job staying in touch with that side of my nature. It's very rare that I see a kids' film--and I do watch them just as regularly as I watch anything else--that I dislike as much as I disliked The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. I even love Rolie Polie Olie, and the last couple times (not that long ago) that I checked out Sesame Street and Mister Rogers Neighborhood I enjoyed them--although I know I can't enjoy them in the same way I did as a kid. I could easily see the quality of the material. And certainly this isn't targeted to a younger crowd than any of those titles are. So it's not that I would tend to dislike something just in case it is made to appeal almost exclusively to younger kids, and I doubt that's the case with any other critic worth their weight in movie popcorn.\n\nSecondly, most kids are not totally devoid of any sense of logic. I certainly wasn't when I was a kid, and I didn't have any friends who were either. It's basically hard-wired into our brains. It has to be so we can survive in the world. So I can easily imagine a lot of kids not liking The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, either, because in the absence of some kind of internal logic and consistency, there's not much to draw them into the story, not like there is in The Wizard of Oz and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Neverending Story and the Spy Kids Films and Follow that Bird and just about every other kids' film. I agree that very young kids--say, maybe around three of four, may be more prone to liking this film, because it sure is filled with pretty colors and lots of movement. And even slightly older kids won't care about derivativeness (because they won't know) or corniness or anything like that. But you don't have to be very old to tell that there's something missing here that isn't missing in The Wizard of Oz or any of those other films."

We went to the cheap theater so it only cost $8 for the 4 of us for a matin\u00e9e- it was our little guys 1st movie( 5yrs) and he didn't like the glasses- but he was excited by the whole experience, as was his 9yr old sister- not the best for parents but your kids will love it -particularly if they liked spy kids:3d"

        "review_detailed_main": "My Take: Despite good intentions, this dizzying 3-D flick is too juvenile for anyone above 10.\n\nFor starters, \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" sounds like a good idea. It shows us what happens and revolves around our dreams. Simply, this idea sounds terrific, and the fact that director Robert Rodriguez's son thought up the story sounds the more interesting. But the final execution, when finally brought to film, is really disappointing. Too much 3-D, and not much story. I guess you know where this is going.\n\nIt sounds interesting to see what dreams are made of, but is seriously disappointing when finally brought to the screen, as none other than a parade of effects. Sadly to say, sorry Mr. Robert Rodriguez, but this is not what dreams are, and supposed to be. Hollywood must learn by now that CGI doesn't amount to everything. What starts out nice, once again goes horribly wrong.\n\nAnother thing, this movie is a family film alright, but only kids will truly appreciate this one. If scaled, perhaps only 5% of the 100% of the film will be entertaining to the adults.\n\nOverall, leave it to the kids to watch it for themselves. Adults may want to stick to Rodriguez's adult works. Ones that don't ruin a good, fresh story by putting it on murky 3-D.\n\nRating: ** out of 5."

        "review_detailed_main": "...\n\nI liked it.\n\nYep: I thought it was good. I thought it was better than most contemporary children's movies. Why? 1) Sharkboy and Lavagirl have depth. No, seriously, as superheroes go, they take the angst of the Spiderman movies and adapt it well for a younger crowd.\n\n2) It's theme of imagination makes a perfect fall-back. So it seems the movie goes in a stupid direction, huh? Unfortunately I remember my childlike imagination going in that direction as well when I was that age. In fact, almost all of the stuff shown, right down to the ending, fit perfectly the type of random stuff I'd come up with when I was a kid. I related to it perfectly, and I'm usually the type of person who gets angry when a movie doesn't match the type of daydreaming imagination I had when I was little and spent all of my time walking around and around the playground, thinking of random child superheroes to have adventures with.\n\n3) At first the virtual reality world is, of course, too cartoony for real-world characters. However, what ends up amazing is how well they interact in such a fake world. It's seamless, and after a while I forgot how fake it was. Much more beloved and much more highly rated films have CGI/special effects worlds that it doesn't even look like the characters are moving in. This one has them walking along in them as if they're really there.\n\n4) Rodriguez may not make the most artistic or original movies, but he knows what he's doing when streaming together a line of images. Invisible editing and conscientious directing kept the story flowing pretty much as smoothly as the milk in the cookie land. It was nice to see.\n\n5) I didn't get to watch it in 3-D, but it felt like it was in 3-D anyways. GREAT cinematography.\n\nSo yeah. Good movie. Better than Spy Kids.\n\nWhat probably sets people off are the ending scenes (barely, BARELY worked) and the first few scenes with Sharkboy and Lavagirl. They're very discombobulating and the acting isn't exactly the best. Finally, Linus/Minus isn't the best child actor I've ever seen, and his character wasn't as developed as it could have been. These are the reasons people have a hard time getting caught in the rest of the movie.\n\nI can't make other people like it, but I sure do.\n\n--PolarisDiB"

This is probably the best 3D movie I've watched where the 3D and non-3D blend together so well. Rodriguez does a great job of introducing the characters and keeping the story going despite similarities to Wolfgang Peterson's \"Never Ending Story.\" The premise revolves around a family that is falling apart because the parents aren't getting along and the child is caught between real life and a dream world and very often chooses the dream world because things work out the way he wants them to as opposed to real life, where everything goes wrong. Slowly the dream world of Shark Boy and Lava Girl blends with the real world and eventually things work out for everyone. Along the way, there are inventive villains, sets, and basically just a good old fashioned fun time at the movie's. Rodriguez sure knows how to hit the chord on the family movie and connects with the adult audience as well. Keep it going Robert, you are definitely a great alternative to Disney these days."

Sadly, that's where The Adventures of SharkBoy and Lava Girl fails. I like Robert Rodriguez and thought his first two Spy Kids movies were very enjoyable and while mediocre I actually thought the third Spy Kids film was better than this too. I will give some credit, the moral is decent if hardly original and there is some energy. But everything else falls flat.\n\nPeople might say the art direction was colourful and pleasing to the eye. Sorry, for me it was very tacky, gaudy and brash. And as for the 3D, it is actually some of the worst I've seen, it needed more clarity and sharpness and sometimes moved too fast. Also I found it distracting in alternative to enhancing. The soundtrack is rather plodding, generic and unmemorable too.\n\nThe script is absolutely awful too. Any parts that tried to be funny made me roll my eyes to be perfectly honest with you, while the story is unevenly paced and very weak and predictable. The characters are just as weak and bland too, the two main characters have their likable moments but there is little chemistry between them and the audience while the supporting characters fare even worse suffering either from being underused or overacted. Overall, the acting is very uneven and way too broad in some cases.\n\nOther disappointments are the poor pace and plodding direction from Rodriguez. So in conclusion, the result is a pretty awful, overstuffed and disappointing effort of a family film. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Sharkboy and Lava Girl in 3-D: Robert Rodriguez has got to be one of the coolest dads in the world. His inspiration for this movie was some drawings that his son made about two imaginary superheroes. So we know that this movie is appealing to at least one person, the director's son, but that doesn't make it that great for the rest of us. There's not a whole lot to the story, but it has a couple things going for it: For one, I thought the George Lopez role was OK, he had a good line at the end about how a good teacher learns from his students. Also, Sharkboy and Lava Girl have a sort of neat symbiotic relationship with their superpowers. Mostly, the film is about the 3-D gimmick, though, which is quite an experience at times, and enhances a few of the action's more spine-tingling moments. Could it be better served as an amusement park ride than a 2-hour movie? That's the question to be asked"

        "review_title": "Another Creative 3D Adventure by Robert Rodriguez",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3D\" was barely advertised. I just happened to see the trailer for it because I worked at Nielsen and got to see the trailer when we were testing it. I also saw the trailer once again in \"Kicking and Screaming\" but other than that, I never saw any advertising for the film. Therefore, I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the theater today to see \"The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl.\"\n\n\"The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl\" is about a boy named Max (Cayden Boyd) who has a vivid imagination and is a big dreamer. In his dreams, he creates Shark boy (Taylor Lautner) and Lava girl (Taylor Dooley). One day in class, Max tells his class the story of Shark boy and Lava girl, but the class doesn't believe a word of it and just makes fun of him. After class, Max gets in a fight with Linus (Jacob Davich) who takes Max's dream book. You see Max keeps all his dreams written in a book so he always remembers them. When Max, goes home that night he wishes that he doesn't have to return to school but of coarse that doesn't happen. However, the next day something interesting happens, Shark boy and Lava girl show up at school and seek Max's help Max then goes with Shark boy and Lava girl and this is where the fun filled adventure begins.\n\nOne thing I can say about Robert Rodriguez is that he has a knack for film-making. He makes movies that are both creative and have unique stories. I actually liked this film better then Spy Kids 3D but not as much as the original Spy Kids or Spy Kids 2. However, in a Robert Rodriguez film once you throw in the 3D element you lose a little story. But this doesn't make the film bad or any less enjoyable. What amazes me about Mr. Rodriguez is how he can make films like \"Sin City\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" and also make great family films such as the \"Spy Kids\" series and this film.\n\nI don't understand why critics hated this movie but then again I don't always understand the critics. When watching a movie like Shark boy and Lava girl, you have to remember one thing that this is a movie made for the enjoyment of little kids. So if you think in that mindset you will really enjoy it. It's extremely creative and unique. It's a movie where your imagination can run wild. If you get into the film, you feel like you're a little kid again and that's a great feeling.\n\nIf you go into the theater expecting a cinematic gem you're not going to get it. The acting isn't as good as it was in the \"Spy kids\" movies or any of Robert Rodriguez's other work. The story is decent but won't blow you away. However the film is visually appealing and is fun for people with vivid imaginations. Like I said, go into the movie and take the movie for what it is, a great family popcorn flick that both adults and kids together can enjoy if you put your mind to it.\n\nSo in conclusion, If you go into \"The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl\" knowing what to expect you will really enjoy the film. It's like Spy Kids 3D but slightly better because it's more visually interesting and the story is better. I always enjoy Mr. Rodriguez's movies and this one is no different. His directing technique is amazing and he manages to make films for cheap no matter how large the cast or amount of special effects. This movie is a lot of fun and is well worth the trip to the multiplex. It's a great film to bring the kids to and their eyes will be glued to the screen for the entire 95 minutes. I think if you enjoyed the \"Spy Kids\" series then you will probably enjoy this film as well. It's a fun film that is truly underrated.\n\nMovieManMenzel's final rating for \"The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3D\" is a 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie makes no sense- at least, not in the linear, neat, tidy, world of adulthood. But, it captures the messy, gritty, disjointed, weird, raw, non-linear, funky, wild, whimsical, internally inconsistent world of true childhood fantasy better than any film I can remember. The story is based off the \"dreams\" and stories of the director's then 7 year old son. As a mother and teacher, I can tell you that while the characters and situations are unique, they are also completely representative of the types of stories and imagination games that I have heard again and again.\n\nMy own children have certainly created their own superheroes steeped in the same balance of derivative lore and imaginative elements that Sharkboy and Lavagirl possess. When faced with similar fantasies played out on screen, my children responded gleefully. Heck, even before we got the DVD home their imaginations had been so captured by what they read on the box that they could not stop discussing it. And, once they had viewed the film, the conversation continued (and continued and continued!). Almost immediately, characters from the film began showing up in my children's own pretending games- only, not *quite* as they had existed in the movie. The characters grew and evolved and were changed and fluffed until they fit seamlessly into my daughter's world of \"Sigalates\" and my son's \"Robotland\".\n\nIn other words, the film did beautifully what all good fantasies do- it inspired others to create, examine and expand their own. In my opinion, that is a near complete success."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me get the story out of the way first. The film is about a boy (Max) who is picked on at school and decides to conjure up his perfect dream world to escape the real world. His world in on the Planet Drool and the superheroes that protect it are Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley). When trouble occurs on the planet Drool, the 2 heroes materialize on Earth. They seek out the only person who can save the planet, which is Max. From there the wild adventure begins.\n\nNow, if you have seen the awful SpyKids 3-D, then you have some idea as to how this movie will look. I didn't care for either movie. The story was just badly written and definitely didn't have anything interesting in it to keep adults attention. Whereas movies like Toy Story 3 and Up have enough entertainment to keep both kids and adults glued to their seats, AoS&L will make you want to run out of the theater. There are some nice special effects and some funny moments, but not enough to keep you there for 93mins. I do get what Robert R was trying to do and he does it right if only 4-12yrs old are going to see his film.\n\nKids 4-12yrs old will probably love this film. It's aim squarely at them just like the movie \"Shorts\". If you were going to the movies, you'd send your kids in to see this and then you would go and see Robert's Grindhouse (Planet Terror) or Machete flicks instead. I do enjoy most of Robert R. movies. I was a big fan of Grindhouse (Planet Terror), Sin City, El Mariachi, Desperado, Spy Kids 1 & 2, From Dusk Till Dawm and even The Faculty. Movies like Shorts and AoS&L just can't keep my interest. They are just too kiddie for me. I'm hoping Robert and Quentin will give us another Grindhouse film, but have it focused on Horror or Japanese Giant Monsters like Godzilla. I would be interested to see how then would make movies in those genres.\n\nIf you are an adult or teen older then 12, don't even waste your time on this flick. Not worth a rent or purchase. If you have kids who are 4-12yrs old, pick up all the Pixar and Disney flicks you can find. That will keep them entertained for a few months.\n\nScore 4 our of 10."

The effects are some of the worst around, and because the film fails to draw us into its imagination, they really do stand out. The performances are mostly embarrassing. But this leads to the one highlight, seeing Taylor Lautner singing and dancing, in an uncomfortably awkward scene. This film was finished very quickly, and it's not surprising. There's nothing to recommend it on unless you like bright things."

        "review_detailed_main": "After having first seen the semi-sequel \"We Can Be Heroes\" (2020), which was generally awful despite, as of this writing, receiving a 69% Fresh score from Rotten Tomatoes critics, and then seeing that this predecessor \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" holds only a 19% rotten score, my expectations for it, to say the least, were low. Indeed, it's bad, yet no worse than its follow-up picture. The atrocious visual effects may've been marginally improved, but the kiddie, if almost psychedelic, dreamscape here didn't demand photorealistic CGI. More importantly, this one is more consistent in its reflexivity.\n\nSo, I wonder, why the 50-point discrepancy between movies? I have three guesses: 1) the pre-\"Avatar\" (2009) 3-D seen in theatres was that ugly, 2) critics don't actually care much for Martin Scorsese's notion of cinema, would rather enjoy the comfort of super-formulaic, shared-universe engineering and, as the sequel was released on Netflix, don't care much for the idea of movies released in theatres anymore, either, and 3) especially after 15 years, one shouldn't put much stock in a supposed consensus of curated entertainment critics, many of whom may not have any interesting thoughts on movies anyways. Of course, all three guesses, or any number of them, or none of them, could be possible at once.\n\nRegardless, for all its juvenile stupidity and eye-soar greenscreen work, the comic-book reflexivity and association of dreams to cinema underlying the narrative is fairly clever. More so, at least, than the generic alien-invasion, superhero team-up of \"We Can Be Heroes\" that is about the construction of the very same thing, as seen on TV mise-en-abymes within the movie. Even that, too, is largely secondary to the rest of the picture's less-appealing nonsense. This one, by contrast, is all about children dreaming their own superhero adventure and drawing and writing it down in a (comic) book--actually, two kids competing for narrative control, with the dream eventually seeming to take on a mind of its own. As opposed to the extended school metaphor of the sequel, here is a dream of escaping such constricts, including by \"The Wizard of Oz\" tornado literally tearing through the school. Never mind that volcanic ash actually blocks sunlight, there is some light to this one, whereas the artificiality of the extension cords and such here seem to have won 15 years later in the sequel. Plus, this one is funnier, as the humor relies on puns instead of on the obnoxious supposed cuteness of bad child acting."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently just finished watching the movie \"The Adventures of Shark boy and Lava girl\". I have sisters and I managed to catch the movie with them while I was bored, and words can't describe how much I have come to hate this movie.\n\nThe movie involves a boy who's emotions inexplicably shift during the movie, a villain who clearly has George Lopez's face pasted in the middle, and a little kid with a mow-hawk for a villain. The movie is almost entirely shot in front of a green screen, and it shows. Sometimes the acting is poor and sometimes it isn't, and the environment looks so bad that it made me want to puke, especially because the background rarely matched up with the actors. The layout for the entirely computer-generated world seemed to have been chosen at random by a pre-schooler. I won't reveal the ending, if a viewer can make it that far, but it makes zero sense.\n\nThe acting is sub-par, George Lopez wasn't meant to be a villain, or a comedian but that's my opinion. Shark boy and Lava girl do OK, but they take themselves to seriously. The entire environment is to serious for it's own good. Most of the non-title characters did a poor job, and the villain would hardly even qualify as bad, in a villain sense, not an acting sense.\n\nSome say that the 3-D version of the movie drained the color, and that would explain how the movie managed to be so colorful, but have such a dull environment.\n\nThe story-line is so broken down, twisted, and out of whack that by the end of the movie, you can hardly even describe what happens. I will try to describe this to the best of my ability. There is a boy named Max who is obsessed with dreaming and creativity, and is scolded for it. He writes all of his dreams down in a little dream journal, which is vandalized by a bully named Linus. His teacher doesn't like him and one day during school, Shark boy and Lava girl show up out of a tornado and are real somehow. They take him to the Planet Drool to help them save it. They go on several adventures, with little continuity, eventually trying to save the world in time from Linus (clearly inspired by the bully as they are played by the same actor), as well as trying to find a purpose in Drool for an over-emotional Lava Girl. I won't reveal the end, but it's anti-climactic, and is really when the movie takes a nose-dive into the trash-heap of poor movies.\n\nIn short, the movie sucked, and my little sisters spent all of their time during the movie, either making fun of the poor green screening, or the main character Max. So this movie isn't for kids, it isn't for anybody because it sucked. The only reason to watch this abomination of mankind, is the fact that Taylor Lautner is Shark boy. I am not a Twilight fan, but it's funny to see the kick-flipping actor at twelve years old, kick flipping some really bad looking bad guys. That is the only reason I gave this movie a two, that and George Lopez."

(If you scroll down the reviews until you find his, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about)\n\nBut basically \"repoed2\" says that the boy that plays shark-boy is an ugly, little moronic kid. He also says a friend of his knows the boy that plays shark-boy in real life (because they went to the same school). And finally, he finishes with the fact that he's not very popular and gets made fun of a lot.\n\nWell \"repoed2\" I really hope one day that you come back to this page and see this because as it turns out that boy that played sharkboy is Taylor Lautner who's now one of the most famous, attractive, talented, and successful young Hollywood actors! Hahaha the irony of this situation cracks me up. Yeah we see who's having the last laugh now though"

His dad is weird, and he lives right across from the school. Max's teacher, Mr. Electricidad, is a jerk. Mr. Electricidad makes fun of a kid's name (He called Linus a Minus)My sister said she would cry if she had that life.\n\nSharkboy is an easily-angered child who needs meds. By the time you reach the scene where he fights the plug-in cords, you will take the DVD out. This movie is so terrible and it is super super SUPER boring. Max is constantly embarrassing himself in front of his class. He said Sharkboy and lava girl do exist and he also said to Linus \"He ruined my dream journal!\" Please do not watch this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "A pretty fun and cool children's film but anyone young adult and above will probably struggle. From the mind of Robert's son Racer (such a cool name!), a young boy named Max (Cayden Boyd) lives mostly in his imagination and when two of his characters, Sharkboy (debut film for Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley) come to life, he joins them in an epic adventure to save the world. I think it's a genuinely lovely idea and a great story behind the scenes with Rodriguez and his son teaming together to make a big screen outing for his dreams (there's even a commentary on the dvd from them both which is awesome!). I do also think people have been really unfair in their criticism of the film. Unfortunately though it doesn't quite hang together fully as a film and patience will be tested the older you are. There are some fun performances particularly from George Lopez as the evil Mr. Electric who made me giggle on quite a few occasions. I understand how the visuals may faze some but I found its cartoonish vibrancy quite cool! Overall, fairly unmemorable but a good one to have on for the kids and a sweet experiment for the Rodriguez family"

What I hated beyond all else was the way they cleaned it up to the extreme. For instance, in a crisis, a man says to his wife, not \"I love you,\" but \"You're my best friend.\" That should give you an idea of what we're dealing with here. Every 5-year -old has seen love in every other movie they've ever seen.\n\nAnd plus, \"from the director of SPY KIDS?\" Doesn't that mean you should avoid at all costs?"

You could argue that the CGI hasn't aged well, the story and characters are ridiculous, and that this film can only be enjoyed when under the influence of some illicit substance. But even if you are laughing at the film in an ironic sense, you still can't deny how entertaining it is with the outlandish story, characters, and visuals, and not to mention a good message for young children buried in all of that."

That sounds like a pretty cool theme but the disjointed plot and the weak writing undermine it terribly. The characters are cartoonish - not just Lavagirl and Sharkboy but the 'realworld' characters too. When I read that Rodriguez's 7-year old was given a writing credit it made sense - it comes over as written by a 7-year old, its just embarrassing that it was also written by his Dad.\n\nBet it was the seven year old that included a girl as a main character that wasn't a love interest, though. Rodriguez accidentally let that through, but made sure it doesn't pass the bechdel test.\n\nStill, once you accept you are watching a cartoon - don't expect anything much beyond comic-book characters - and run with it, it is quite fun. My kids delight certainly helped me enjoy this, but I gave myself up to the daftness. The 2D visuals were bright though basic and no more was needed. I'm slightly embarrassed to say it, but watching this with my kids I did enjoy this movie."

Besides, much of the ideas in the movie was from the director's son Racer. Plus, it was laughably bad.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is a poor 3D film made for kids and by an actual kid. Supposedly, Robert Rodriguez's seven year old son, Racer assisted Rodriguez in writing the screenplay for this film, but that doesn't mean I'll treat like anything less than a movie. Just because a seven year old probably wrote more than half of it, it's still a movie in a wide release. I have full right to nitpick it. While I will say Racer has creative and inventive daydreams, I don't think a movie was entirely necessary; especially in the tiresome, droning 3D.\n\nThe 3D dates back to when RealD was never out. The Red/Blue glasses ruled mostly from 2003 - 05. I remember Spy Kids 3D: Game Over and this film being the prime examples and topics for best 3D movie in my school. I disagreed with both films. Both movies' 3D value really sucks. It completely tones down the color scheme and even in 2D the film still has the \"Glasses On\" thing informing you the upcoming scene will be in 3D. It should read \"Colors commencing off in five...four...three...two...one...off.\n\nSo the movie's plot is dam sure a seven year olds dream. It reminds me of when some of the classic stories like Alice in Wonderland were written when the author was on drugs. I could almost drag out my bong and make something like this. Max is a loner at school. He's bullied by everyone, but there's much more than meets the eye about him. He carries around \"a dream journal\" in which he writes down his thoughts and ideas as they stem from his creative head.\n\nWe then go into the world of Sharkboy and Lavagirl who magically appear during a tornado when Max is at school. They take him to \"Planet Drool\" where dreams rule (no pun). The goal is to stop \"Planet Drool\" from being taken over by Mr. Electric. So the whole movie is the protagonists trying every which way and going through every obstacle trying to achieve what one would assume be an easy goal.\n\nIt's another kids film so don't expect much of the plot. The visuals are nice...if the 3D wasn't added. The biggest gripe of the film stems from the 3D as stated before. I dug out the DVD of it and watched it that way and my memories of my assumption of my vision being shot when I watched it all came back. I repeatedly ask my mom if my eyes weren't working because everything looked drab and lifeless. This is the kind of film that has a lot of vibrant visuals and some great shots of water and lava. Don't use 3D which tones down the brightness.\n\nThe Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl is a failed experiment of a movie. It's an unnecessary, predictable film ruined by it's lackluster 3D scheme. While all three kids are fun loving, adventurous, and likable protagonists and the moral of the story is a good one, I think kids will be too busy taking off their glasses, asking lots of questions, and wondering why the colors look like colored Easter Eggs that were put in the dye for thirty seconds to hear what the moral was.\n\nStarring: Cayden Boyd, Taylor Dooley, Taylor Lautner, David Arquette, Kristin Davis, and George Lopez. Directed by: Robert Rodriguez."

From an adult perspective it is pretty awful and Kristen Thomas's (?) performance as Max's mum is shocking.\n\nIt is a children's film and obviously appeals to them. The colours are garish and incredibly bright. I can imagine it looked impressive as a 3D film but some of these effects just become irritating in the privacy of your living room without the glasses.\n\nI would highly recommend it to any parents who want 90 mins of peace to themselves!"

The acting is a little stiff, the dialog is silly, and the special effects are uneven. But young kids won't care. The story is about and for kids. My 7 year old boy and 4.5 year old girl really like it. (It would probably be to scary for under 6's to watch without a parent).\n\nI was able to enjoy watching it with my children on a rainy Saturday morning, but mostly because of their joy at the wild visuals and weird environments.\n\nSo, if your an adult who is a fan of animation, special effects or sci-fi, please give this movie a pass."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whether making over-the-top shoot-em-up schlock, kiddy spy spoofs or pulpy graphic-novel adaptations, it's clear that the ever ambitious Robert Rodriguez is a versatile, respected and resourceful film-maker who's both able and willing to consistently push the boundaries of a limited budget to deliver new experiences seldom-seen at that kind of rag-tag level; a successful if inconsistent director who's reached the point in his career where he has the clout (or rather, the cash) to make just about anything he wants including this bizarre glorified family-protect of his. It is hard to get angry about the chocolate-milk induced ravings of an eight-year-old boy - Rodriguez's own son was responsible for the creation and development of the titular heroes - or even the fact that his father decided to use his skills to bring them to life, considering that this is much more a bonding exercise for one man's family than something to be shared with the world. To be honest, it is competently constructed (in a very nuts and bolts kind of way) with a few semi-decent messages in there for the youngest of the crowd, but that's not to imply that this is anything other than a dreadfully dull, wholly nonsensical, wildly inconsistent, criminally ugly, jarringly intangible, hammily acted mess that was clearly written by a child with a crayon. Imagination should be encouraged in kids and their creations should be stuck to the fridge, but they shouldn't be made into a feature film. 2/10"

        "review_title": "Is this Robert Rodriguez's absolute worst film? Check out my review below to find out!",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D\" (2005), before I get into my review, I thought I would give you a little fun fact about this \"movie\". Film maker Robert Rodriguez's children conceived the majority of the concepts used for this storyline. Yep, he essentially made this \"film\" as a gift for his kids. Now, that's quite a charming gesture, granted. I mean, how many children can say that their father made a mainstream movie just for them? There's only one problem with this \"movie\", it sucks. Big time! That being said, when I first watched this \"film\", I did like it a little bit. However, the more I saw this \"movie\", the more the problems stood out and I just hated it more and more. It's easily, Robert Rodriguez's worst film he's done, so far. How ironic, because my all-time favorite movie, \"Machete\" (2010), is made by him! Any way, let's get back to the review. \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D\" has a boring and clich\u00e9d story, standard to terrible acting and cheap special effects. The plot is, a boy named Max is recruited by his own imaginary friends, Sharkboy and Lavagirl to help them save the world. That storyline just screams basic! This \"film\" may only be 93 minutes, but the whole plot doesn't take up that much time. It's basically 30 minutes of story, with 60 minutes of filler in-between! Seriously, for 2/3 of the \"movie\", nothing happens. Film Making 101: in order to have filler, you have to have a good story to begin with. I can only imagine how embarrassed his children were when they saw the final product! As a matter of fact, in the opening titles, there's a title screen that says: \"Based on the Stories and Dreams of Racer Max\". It's like he knew that this \"movie\" was going to suck, so he added that in as a precaution, so he wouldn't get the blame! Keep in mind, I'm a huge fan of Robert Rodriguez. He's one of my top ten all-time favorite film makers. So, you can probably imagine how much it hurts to write this movie review. Although, everyone in the film industry is entitled to at least one bad movie. Unfortunately, this one is his! As for the acting, it's nothing short of a joke from the majority of the cast! The only ones who seem to be trying, are: Taylor Lautner, Sasha Pieterse and George Lopez. Everyone else's acting is just bad, to all over the place. Probably the most inconsistent performance here, comes from Jacob Davich as the main antagonist; Linus/Minus. Whenever Jacob plays as Linus, he ranges from bland to over-the-top. However, when he plays as his alter-ego, Minus, he actually doesn't do too bad. You can tell that he's wanted to play a villain his entire life, and he looks like he's having a blast! Had his acting been equally as good as when he played as Minus, then he could've been one of the top actors in this \"movie\"! The rest of the cast is just a letdown with their acting. As for the special effects, a lot of them here are actually not that bad. Robert Rodriguez does a lot of the editing and special effects himself on a very low budget. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. In this case, the low budget is prevalent on the screen all the way through. A lot of it looks like a cheap and un-rendered video game! Now, let's get to the only two positive elements in this \"film\", which are the sets/locations and the soundtrack. All of the sets/locations are cool and give the \"movie\" an interesting atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack composed by John Debney, Graeme Revell and even Robert Rodriguez himself is great. John Debney is a decent film score composer, and so is Robert Rodriguez. Not too sure what parts Graeme Revell wrote though. But, if this is any indication, his music doesn't sound too bad! Ironically, I think the music is trying harder than the plot! \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D\" is an abomination in the world of family movies. Like I said, it's difficult to rant about such a talented film maker such as Robert Rodriguez. Why did he make me do this to him?! I rate this \"film\" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I even have to say avoid this \"movie\"? Just stick with the \"Spy Kids\" trilogy instead. That's one of my top ten all-time favorite trilogies, and it buries \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D\"! In the case of this \"film\", it just goes to show, that some dreams should never come true."

All movies do not have to be of the caliber of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. This movie is from the kids point of view and hits its mark right on. For me, knowing seeing the kids enjoy the movie was more important. Had they not enjoyed it I might have had a review similar to others here. For me it was all a matter of perspective. I also liked how this movie was told from a kid of about that age. What adult does not enjoy hearing their kid excitedly talk about something great in their young life? They certainly are not talking as an adult and have all their ducks in a row.\n\nNow, if all kids movies were like this, I might not like that. This took a different route from most kids movies and I think it worked."

The 3D effects themselves are a high standard but the glasses are the old style one-red, one-green eye which don't give a clear image and which reduce almost all of the colour. Lava Girl's hair colour with the glasses off was ideal for the role. However, with the glasses on, which they had to be for the majority of the movie, her hair was almost devoid of colour - very poor effect. Despite the poor 3D colour effects, the movie worked quite well for excitement and action, and is worthwhile seeing."

In a way I can relate to this story, when I was a kid we used to play around in all kinds of fantasy worlds, where the ultimate coolness was a few lame one-liners and a lot of fighting against weird monsters.\n\nNow this film basically takes me back to that. These aren't the exact stories that I used to dream about but they're damned close and the way they are presented are also very close to 'backinthedays'. The film is played out like a video game, with levels and obstacles to overcome, back in my days these obstacles were all in the 2d or top-down view from Mario or Zelda but I imagine that today they are more in full 3d and with much better graphics. The film had all that.\n\nBut as a film. This isn't all that good, it's not the worst ever. And it does have a certain cute playfulness about it, which, I'll assume, would make it good for its target audience. I don't know exactly who the target audience is though, but I suspect they should at least pretty much identify with the protagonist of the film."

Minus Linus is an accurate description of today's bullies and the struggles we have to go through being... \"different\". I found a sense of community through Max and his paracosm. The imagery created in his mind's world was the most astonishing piece of cinema I've ever witnessed. I relate to Sharkboy because of his strong need to please his family (the sharks). He hides his true feelings with a tough exterior, even though deep down he loves his friends. I relate to Lavagirl's internal struggles as she searches for her identity. Overall, I relate to Max by creating other people in his mind to project how he feels deep down, in an effort to hide his true feelings from himself and the outside world. In conclusion, this movie portrays the adventures that take place in a child's mind, and is an intricate portrayal of escapism. I end with a quote, \"Everything that is or was, began with a dream,\" by Lavagirl."

        "review_detailed_main": "After attending the premiere of this film (see comments below) I was amazed that it was poorly reviewed until I saw it at a local theater *without* polarization, multiple digital light projection, an IMAX screen, and state-of-the-art 3-D/non-disposable glasses. Now I know why people complained. What a mess.\n\nAll I can say is this: Robert Rodriguez's cinematic prowess exceeds most theaters' current technology. This amazing kid's film is great fun when viewed digitally. Seeing the polarized version not yet shown outside Austin was like stepping inside a View Master projector -- something I always wanted to do when I was a kid. Unfortunately, what Robert has conjured up can't yet be seen the way he designed it. Someday soon, perhaps!\n\n--------- earlier comments, posted in June 2005:\n\nLittle did I know yesterday that when my eight-year-old granddaughter and I went to see The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3-D we would be viewing a polarized print of the film made exclusively for the Austin premiere. As Robert Rodriguez explained what we were about to see there was no way to imagine beforehand how the 3-D experience would be transformed by the killer combo of the polarized version shown on an IMAX screen through multiple DLPs. Once the movie started, however, I immediately realized I was watching something light years beyond anything I had yet seen. Trust me when I tell you that when Rodriguez waved his magic wand over the audience we caught an unforgettable glimpse of a child's dreams, as well as the future possibilities of cinematic fantasy.\n\nDon't listen to those who say there's nothing new to be had here, or that the story's derivative, or it's just for kids. Forget what you hear from cynical reviewers unable to momentarily access their inner child. This story, written by a kid for other kids, hasn't been tainted by anyone's opinion about keeping the older film-goers entertained through adult-themed inside references and innuendo.\n\nIn making this film, Robert Rodriguez has wisely protected and preserved his son Racer's unique vision without the addition of dumbed-down \"mature\" wisecracks. Mr. Rodriguez, along with his producer--who just happens to be Robert's wife and Racer's mom, Elizabeth Avelan--knows that when it comes to children, play *is* their work. By respecting and valuing the realm of childhood imagination, this unique family team together share a story with us about the myriad ways creative thinking can impact the real world. Awe and wonder are not treated lightly here but rather offered to viewers in a much less adulterated form than that to which we have become accustomed.\n\nToday when I think about it, I simply close my eyes and smile."

Or whether it is simply a made up superhero world dreamt by a young boy. This film enlightens the younger generation to widen their imaginations and create TV's next superheroes. While the film itself is inspirational to the younger generation and where their mind will take them, the graphics and quality of the film are low, even for 2005's standards.

And for that target audience, I personally feel like it works. Taylor Lautner was pretty good in the movie, it's so funny to see him in this after you've seen the twilight saga, he's a baby! Lol. And the rest of the main cast does a well enough job too. The special effects were pretty good, it didn't look too cheap or anything. Now I really did hate George Lopez in this movie, I mean I hated him!!! That is my biggest complaint for shark boy and lava girl, George freaking Lopez! He was annoying as all get out and just didn't fit the role at all, not even close. The script was alright I guess, it sufficed. The acting was a little spotty at times, but overall it was alright. A 6/10 for sharkboy and lavagirl 3D."

No matter you are, Just go ahead and make your own dreams. I love this. By the way Sharkboy you are so cool. All those characters in this movie had done very well. Every single move brings so many happiness. I am glad that I could see this movie on HBO channel. It was just an accident,switch the channel. Hey,above all the songs in the movie are really cool. Sharkboy do have a very good voice. Especially the sleep song(Is that called like this? I guess) Sharkboy sang very well!!~ Hope to see all of you guys make more good efforts. Good luck\n\nA young kid,Kevin who lives in Taiwan."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Matrix meets Spy Kids when 10 year-old Max (Cayden Boyd) blurs the lines between the dream world and the real world in The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl in 3-D. Did Max simply dream up Sharkboy and Lavagirl in some psychosomatic response to his parents' failing marriage? Or did he really go to Planet Drool to fight the evil Mr. Electricity (George Lopez)? Though his 7 year-old son, Racer Rodriguez, technically came up with the story and characters in the film, Sharkboy & Lavagirl is clearly a metaphor for writer/director Robert Rodriguez and his philosophy on life. This is a movie about dreams, passions, and working hard to make your dreams a reality. There is no bigger dreamer in the entire film industry than Mr. Rodriguez, and no one works harder and gets less sleep (he shot this film and Sin City at the same time). But he makes his dreams into realities, time and time again (he works at \"the speed of thought,\" to use his favorite expression). And his dreams also tend to make Miramax and other studios a lot of money, too. But I digress.\n\nVery few movies, even traditional \"kid movies,\" honor kids and their ideas like Sharkboy & Lavagirl does. The heroes of this film are the characters with the biggest dreams and wildest imaginations, while the bad guys are those intent on crushing dreams. Kids are so often belittled in film, depicted as troublemakers or whiny brats. This movie, on the other hand, shows how much Rodriguez loves and honors his kids, and respects the imagination of all children.\n\nBesides the great message of this movie, it's also a blast to watch! I have to admit, this was my first 3-D movie, and I was blown away. I literally reached up and tried to grab bubbles. Why don't more people make 3-D movies? They're so much fun! The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl in 3-D was made by kids and for kids, and kids everywhere are going to love it. And the parents, siblings, and babysitters who have to take them to the theater are going to love it, too."

        "review_detailed_main": "IT seems that when it comes to family, Robert Rodriguez is the ultimate dad. Wouldn't it be great if your father turned round to you and say...hey, why not make a movie together? That's the way Sharkboy was made-by a six year old kid and his dad. The story is of young Max, a dizzy daydreamer who is bullied because of his 'WILD' imagination. He magics up two superhero's, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, who happen to be real...sort of. Well, now Max's enemies better hide in shame, as his creations blast through the walls of school to take us all to Planet Drool, the hype world which the hothead and the coldfish so happen to live on. Confused? you will be in the muddy 3-D effects that follow. Turns out that Max is needed to dream the planet back to life...\n\nBut he has forgot his dream journal!!! Oh no! Like I said, the effects don't work in 3-D and the world of Planet Drool is totally over-the top. Fans of Spy Kids and Robert Rodriguez and kids won't be too disappointed, but those over 14 and really unhappy children won't see eye to eye with the CGI. The cast is relied on three young amaetures (Lautner and Dooley as Sharkboy and Lavagirl and Boyd as Max) however, it is the young cast, and not Latino God George Lopez who carry the story. That is why it has got a higher mark- For its younger casts enthusiasm. The adults are easily out-acted by the young sprogs. Lopez can'y be bothered, Kristin Davies plays the bored mom and David Arquette (the movies most famous star) shows up on screen with boring quotes for just twenty seconds. In fact, the movie has no real stars. just amaetures willing to boost their young careers. Oh well, Drew Barrymore wannabe all round.\n\nIf you like really whacky movies then see Sharkboy. If you have kids then see it. Otherwise, don't bother..."

        "review_title": "Unabashedly silly, yet delightful - a fanciful adventure of, by, and for kids",
        "review_detailed_main": "We try to be open-minded, do we not? It's obvious from the word \"go\" that this was made for kids. \"A Rodriguez Family Movie\" and \"Based on the Stories and Dreams of Racer Max\" are among the first words to greet us on the screen, connoting that this superhero flick was a passion project for filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, his whole family, and his young son Racer. Our main characters are kids, and the very name of the film and its characters reflect the sort of simple, sensationalist tendencies of the imaginations of young children. And of course any promotional art speaks volumes, let alone the premise, further informing that like many other contemporary titles, this is going to be overflowing with computer-generated imagery at a time when everyone and their third cousin thought that the CGI of the 2000s was the Bee's Knees. Viewing years later, one will also reflect that this marked the first starring role for young Taylor Lautner, who - bless his heart - was probably the most significant weak point of the 'Twilight' series, second only to its source material. All told, long before I ever sat to watch this in December 2024, the only thing I've especially known of it was a poor reputation with mocking connotations. But with all this firmly in mind, the question remains: how is 'The adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D,' actually?\n\nProvided one can accept that CGI, and the fact that this was emphatically made for kids - truthfully, it's not bad! Actually, it's pretty good! The foundation of Racer's ideas ensures that we viewers are fully living in the world of protagonist Max, seeing his perspective, and swimming in his creativity. Rodriguez took those ideas and shaped them into a cohesive form that very distinctly suggests something that Nickelodeon may have optioned as a full-length feature, giving us kids' hopes and fears, their sense of logic and discovery, their notions of play and make-believe, and so on and so on. The story really is fairly clever and fun as it completely represents and leans into that childlike whimsy, and no less so the strong scene writing, characterizations, and dialogue. And I do mean strong; the picture is an absolute, juvenile lark, but it was written with obvious, earnest skill and intelligence. I'm genuinely reminded of the sort of nonsense I conjured in my head when I was very young, even if I don't remember particulars all these years later. The cast unfailingly embrace the spirit of it all and sure seem to be having a great time, from adults like David Arquette, Kristin Davis, and George Lopez, to the youthful leads Taylor Dooley, Cayden Boyd, and yes, even Lautner, whose performance is arguably better than what we saw in 'Twilight: New moon.'\n\nWith extremely infrequent exception across the whole medium, digital falsehood ages rapidly and looks worse the more it's relied upon, and the more we see of it. The proliferate post-production visuals in 'Sharkboy and Lavagirl' exist on a spectrum, with some instances holding up better than others and frankly having received more attention than others in the first place - but all things considered, for the most part it's quite decent. The more passive examples, like backgrounds, tend to be rather fetching, and no few of the more active elements are swell, too, such as they are. I'll grant that Rodriguez's direction, and the acting, sometimes struggle with the same issue as more recent mega-millions superhero sleep aids; constantly working in front of a green screen, with nonexistent props or nondescript stand-ins for props, rarely doesn't reflect poorly to one degree or another on filmmakers and players alike. Be that as it may, in the very least I appreciate the energy that the cast bring to the material, some of the acting is really quite good, and Rodriguez's firm capabilities and experience even shine through the limitations of the nature of the production. The result really is a bountiful wonderland of imagination, and as all involved joyfully live or relive their childhood fantasies, I can't deny that the film is ably entertaining.\n\nOh yes, 'The adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl' is very, very silly, and very, very frivolous. But that's the whole point as both on paper and in execution, to no small literal extent, we're entering the mind of a child. For all that, and for all the hard work that Rodriguez, his family, and all other participants poured into the whole, there is some real wit all throughout these ninety-three minutes in one way or another. Not every odd and end comes off as well - some sheer cartoonishness is just Too Much; among a few others, a small sequence of song and dance around the halfway mark is more ham-handed than even I can handle - but many small moments and bits of humor plainly delight, and the sum total is honestly just a blast. The conception and designs of almost every sight to greet us are marvelous, however the CGI (and/or acting) may or may not pass muster, and inasmuch as tangible production design and art direction, costume design, and hair and makeup were employed, they look fantastic. The original music composed between Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell is perhaps not noteworthy in and of itself, but it's very capable complement for the proceedings. With other facets like cinematography, editing, and sound all otherwise meeting the standards of the 2000s, broadly speaking it's duly well made.\n\nI can understand why this had such a mixed reception upon release, and I can't specifically begrudge those who earnestly engage with it and take a harsher view than I do. Yet everyone who had a hand in making it clearly knew what they were creating, and the movie never, ever pretends to be anything it's not. It's a romp of, by, and for kids, and I challenge anyone to take a look at what the Rodriguez Family put together and say with a straight face that their youthful fancies weren't just as outlandish. I'd go so far as to say that a definitive, unmistakable line could be drawn directly to this from one of the most celebrated works of fantasy the past one-hundred-some years, the 'Little Nemo' comics of Winsor McCay and all its subsequent adaptations, and for that matter, a line through other fiction that has pointedly toyed with children's imagination and dreams. Scrutinize the production as we may, for its CGI or the acting or anything else, by and large I believe this deserves far more recognition and appreciation than it has gotten in the past twenty years; one could reasonably say even that the most garish CGI fits in with the thrust of the tale, and how it came about in the first place. I freely admit that I entered with expectations that were mixed to low. However, rounded out with some admirable themes along the way, I say in all sincerity that 'The adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D' is far better than I ever could have anticipated. I truly had such a good time watching, and I think anyone who can get on board with the tenor it adopts - anyone who remembers what it was like to be a kid, with all that our youth entails - is apt to find this just as excellent. For my money this flick is highly enjoyable, and I'm pleasantly surprised and very glad to give it my enthusiastic recommendation!"

But I felt this movie appeals to the 10-12 year old kid in all of us. Despite the fact it was not well acted. I really loved this for its special effects, it had quite the imagination. But the 3-D part of it gave a real Eye ache. The story starts with Max, an awkward 11 year old, who is mocked by other kids, because of his story telling about his two superhero friends named Sharkboy and Lavagirl. But he becomes a big joke when he starts telling everybody they are both real. But we soon find out that they are real, and they both want his help. Like I said expect nothing more or less."

It's based on the director/writer's kid's dreams. Once you accept that dream-logic is at work, it begins to make more sense.\n\nI wasn't expecting much from this movie; it looked, frankly, like it had been made specifically to be a McDonalds tie-in. But I found it took itself lightheartedly enough that most of the plot holes are easy enough to overlook. The acting was spotty, but not atrocious (I wasn't a fan of Max, but both Sharkboy and Lavagirl were fun, and Linus was the perfect little a**hole kid). The score was good, excepting the overly literal closing song. The CGI was only a bit better than TV series quality, but that fits in with the childhood-dream motif. What really surprised me was the impressive fight choreography, esp. where Sharkboy was concerned (and I thought the plug hounds were kind of inventive).\n\nThe weakest spot was Max's home life. I've seen parental troubles done better in plenty of kid movies. Not sure what David Arquette as thinking. The whole \"You're my best friend!\" scene looked like a walk-through for both of them. I found George Lopez's performance spotty as well, but that may have been a reflection of the dialog he had to work with. Yeah, the dialog was kind of stilted sometimes, but it seemed to happen in conjunction with people trying to put on airs.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong, there were some plot holes. Why did they tell Sharkboy to swim away from the eels when he could have gotten out of the water? Why did the ice king say the thing would work i it wouldn't? Idunno. But it was fun."

She loved the prompts to \"put on the glasses\" and \"take them off\" and loved having that interaction and being able to tell me when to do same. I am so irritated at the ADULTS who trashed this movie MADE FOR SMALL CHILDREN! Don't GO or WATCH if you don't want to see a children's movie! Congratulations to the Rodriguez family for honoring the children!"

For these people who are apparently between the ages of 16-27 that say that this movie was horrible and may not have wanted to see it anyways please keep your comments off here. This is clearly a children's movie and should be treated as such. Now to my review.\n\nThis movie was good for children in that it might have more children getting away from the TV,game, etc. and actually using their minds to create new superhero comics, think up new inventions, and possibly even to create something to help all mankind.-though i doubt- This movie was very good but not quite the best movie of the week.\n\nIn closing i would like to say that this is a good movie to see with your children. I am sure that most children would like it very. As i have a 5-year old sister who watched it and was in love with it."

Ditto the scary mini-me of Kirsten Dunst in Interview with a Vampire.\n\nThe plot is senseless but rather sweetly inventive, the graphics campy fun, the acting is exaggerated children cute/annoying.\n\nI bet many of those who thrashed this would secretly enjoy parts of it - unless they are just brainless goons of the Gestapo.\n\nImportantly one gets the feeling the folks involved in the making of this did enjoy themselves making it.\n\nAnd yes the kids to get to learn something good.\n\nDon't be a prude - just watch it."

But there is trouble in Drool as Mr Electric \u0096 who seems to us to be channeling Dr Evil \u0096 is the worst bad dream yet, trapping kids on a roller-coaster of endless fun to stop them from dreaming. Max is the secret weapon that can stop him, if only he can remember his dreams.\n\nThe Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl is sometimes more sickly sweet than the Land of Milk and Cookies, but it is also packed full of the random, bizarre and hysterical stuff that dreams are made of. It is CGI and 3D to the max.\n\nDVD extras: Essential 3D glasses, a 2D version and a home movie of Robert Rodriquez and his sons brainstorming and working on the movie."

The way they were interacting with the 3-D was a riot. When we returned home, my kids kept pretending to be the characters in the movie. They are even keeping dream journals now. Any movie that can promote so much imagination in today's society is definitely a good thing. Overall, this movie was a really great experience for my family."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sharkboy and Lavagirl really do check off all the boxes for a bad movie. And that's exactly why it's so good. This is a campy, relatively poorly acted (but you have to cut them a little slack because the cast was almost entirely underage), the effects are pretty terrible even for their time period, and it just has a general feeling of being off-beat from beginning to end, which is perhaps the only consistency the film has going for it. Viewing this film in preparation for the sequel(ish), We Can Be Heroes was an interesting experience. There are some things that you just don't forget from childhood (the nightmare fuel that is the wonky CG robot-thing in the dream world, for instance, or George Lopez's hammy performance as Mr. Electric), but there were still some pleasant surprises, perhaps the biggest of which being how good of a singer young Taylor Lautner was before Twilight would slightly tarnish his reputation and leave all the girls lusting after his shirtless body. It's hard not to view this film as a half-assed attempt to utilize Robert Rodriguez brand in a world that was experiencing major Spy Kids fatigue, because that's essentially what this film is. But there's just something about it that makes it special and makes it stand out among other children's films released around that time, something that would probably take an essay to really get to the bottom of. It's a movie that works simply because it works; one you can't question, just sit back and enjoy. A lot of people hated it (even more than I realized after taking a look at the IMDb reviews), and it's not great, but it's not all bad either. It held up in a campy B-movie kind of way, and it's still a ton of fun to watch today. I can only hope We Can Be Heroes can either capture the magic that permeated this film, or improve upon it in some meaningful way."

All you need to do is see this movie with a child or let yourself remember your own sense of wonder and this movie will jump off the screen whether you've got 3-D glasses or not! The fact that Rodriguez lets the children have real worries and problems and a trial-and-error approach to dealing with them while learning a universal theme has all the traits that make children's stories timeless. It's not just a dumbed down story to sell toys and video games, although it would actually make a good game. Overall, a very fun film!"

I slipped it into my blue-ray player and have been watching it ever since! This movie was, despite what critics say, AWESOME!

I don't think it's as awful as some of the people reviewing this movie, but let me just tell you how my kids feel about this film.\n\nFirst of all, being an American in Germany, we cannot just go to Wal Mart and purchase any movie we want at any time. Not all internet sites will ship to us. So we rent it, which we are fortunate enough that a local store has at least two copies. That said, we have rented it so many times that we recognize the individual disks that we get from the store.\n\nTo say that this movie is my kids favorite movie of all time would be a great understatement. The kids will play \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" on their own in the backyard or at the park or wherever they happen to be at the time. They fight over who gets to be Sharkboy and who gets to be Lavagirl and who is Max and who is the Ice Princess. (I'm usually Mr. Electric.)\n\nIt's also interesting to note that it is the first serious role played by Taylor Lautner, who many fans will recognize as a particularly popular werewolf in another movie."

Taylor Dooley as Lava Girl and Taylor Lautner as Shark Boy will definitely be the next big thing in Hollywood. Two thumbs up for any kid to go see this movie.\n\nNo matter what the critics say... As a mother I thought it was a great movie... I think there should be more action adventures for young kids to get into.... I would definitely go see any movie Robert Rodriguez does, whether its his sons ideas or his. He obviously can take any idea and run with it. So take your kids to see this movie, watching their faces light up as they take a trip through the land of milk and cookies will be well worth it....."

It is So, So good. It will be seen as an all time Cult classic. Without doubt.\n\nOne of those films initially with mixed reviews that later on become an all time great. That is when people understand it more fully. I went to see it twice, thoroughly enjoying the film from start to finish. Within two minutes of the film I was totally captivated by it, it had regressed me back to an age of happier times. 40 years of guilt, inhibitions and hardheartedness just vanished away, leaving the, \"Child within us\" as we are so widely reported to having, once more alive and kicking. A rebirth of sorts,\n\nIf I could watch this film every weekend at the movies, I would do so. Were I a lottery ticket winner I would buy a single screen cinema and consistently show this film in my town. That is how good this film is. One of my all time top 10 films. I can feel it!.

It combines entertaining action with real moral lessons (that are not preachy or political): you can only make your dreams a reality if you work hard to make them true; those who have had their dreams smashed will seek to smash others' dreams; you cannot escape fear because it exists in your mind; do not dream selfish dreams when the world needs you to make it a better place; and unfinished, unrealized dreams will die inside your mind. Certainly, the characters were somewhat flat, but name a children's film in which they are not. At least this film is smart and fun. It mostly takes place literally in the main character's dream world, a dark 3-D universe where things are changing and he must strive to set things right. The combination of self-sacrifice, maturity, and valiance saves the day and even characters in the real world learn important lessons."

And just as an added plus I enjoyed the movie as well.\n\nI see nothing wrong with knowing who your audience is. There are too many supposedly kids movies that have no concept who their audience is and do nothing more than bore the kids and offend the parents. Movies for kids do not have to be filled with disgusting humor and fart jokes to be entertaining. I hope to see more movies like this one for children.\n\nAgain, this is a great movie for kids!"

It was all amazing to me and that is why I gave it a 10/10.

        "review_detailed_main": "You know how Sharkboy and Lavagirl snuck into Max's house at midnight and ate his mom's cookies? And when they broke into a classroom? I cracked up at those scenes. Wait, it gets funnier, after they find Max and fly off to Planet drool, Max's face expression was funny while the ship flew faster than a hurricane. In the roller coaster scene, it was hilarious when the kids hung upside-down and their faces were like they saw a monster. It was so cool how Sharkboy and Lavagirl can not only jump very high, but they can stand on an upside-down roller coaster. I think this is why people decide to hate this movie, because the 3 adventurers went through a field of brains with a bus. It was nasty, but that doesn't stop me. Sharkboy said that everyone should yell or scream and they did, like little girls.\n\nWhen Sharkboy fell in chocolate in the Land of Milk and Cookies and then he ate it off his shoe, then he spit it out. Max tried using a marshmallow as a pillow to dream some more and when Lavagirl decided to try it, she burned it. They later got attacked by giants. When the giant tasted the cookie, he spit it out. I loved how Sharkboy and Lavagirl sing a lullaby to Max, then Lavagirl burns Max's ass to wake him up. And Sharkboy's funniest quote was \"Still hungry, Max? How about a knuckle sandwich?!\"\n\nWhen they got to the Land of Ice, I liked how Lavagirl had to sleepwalk to walk over an ice bridge. Then Sharkboy and Max p*ss her off by awakening her and the bridge was falling apart so the bad guy won't chase after them. Lavagirl is funny when she's mad, and when she burned Max's diary, she yelled \"Why did you make me like this?! WHY, Max?!\", then got sprayed by Sharkboy. It also gets funny when it rained brains all over Minus, which also could be why people decide to hate it. And when his brain farted causing his head to become giant, I had a laugh attack.\n\nThe scene where Sharkboy and Lavagirl die, it was heart-breaking, but that doesn't stop me from giving this a 10/10. At least Sharkboy came back to life, but he had to throw Lavagirl in a volcano to save her life. Then she later kissed him on the cheek. And it was funny how the Ice Princess froze the main antagonist of this movie and he exploded. The ending was marvelous where Sharkboy and Lavagirl became somewhat boyfriend and girlfriend. And the music of the credits was awesome, whoever wrote the song can sing better than Justin Bieber."

        "review_title": "Advice for Those Older than the Target Audience",
        "review_detailed_main": "Age six to ten audiences usually get the short end of the stick when it comes to major feature films. Although technically films like \"Elf\" and \"Toy Story\" target this demographic, the marketing people insist that these productions incorporate adult elements and humor to expand the target audience and maximize attendance; these are called \"family films\" and the additional elements take much away from the identification experience that children most enjoy. The only escape from these multi-generational things are preschool stuff like \"Clifford's Really Big Movie\" and \"Muppets from Space\" which no one in the 6-10 group would admit to watching, let alone liking.\n\nThen along comes Robert Rodriguez with \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\", a film that gives 6-10 audiences exactly what they want without even the slightest attempt to appeal to older viewers (well maybe middle schoolers will get crushes on Sharkboy and Lavagirl). Since this is a new animal to most critics, it gets blasted for not being what they wanted it to be, a family film. And teenagers complain that it is not as good as \"Spy Kids\", a Rodriguez film that not only targeted a broader audience but which most of them watched several years ago when they were preteens. To be fair, while Rodriguez did not make \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" for 14 year olds who saw \"Spy Kids\" 4-5 years ago, the distributors did attempt to market it to those audiences-who are now angry about being misled although I think the trailer gives a pretty accurate representation of the film.\n\nSo don't let the negative reviews and comments discourage anyone in the target audience from seeing this film. There are plenty of positive reviews and comments from critics who have a clue about Rodriguez's intentions and from the viewers in his target audience. There will be a lot of Sharkboys and Lavagirls out trick or treating this year and the film will become a classic to those who first see it at a young age.\n\nWhich is not to say that only those in its target audience will enjoy the film, it is a fun children's tale that might be described as a cross between \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Yellow Submarine\". But for most adults and almost all teenagers, the only really entertaining part will be watching the pre-teens (both girls and boys) totally getting off on the whole thing.\n\nIn one respect it is better because almost all the actors are kids; Rodriguez understands that a lot of adult characters in a children's film is a less than zero situation. And it has very good messages: emphasizing the value of dreams, how dreaming better (i.e. unselfishly) increases that value, and how working to make you dreams come true maximizes that value (the young hero's name is \"Max\"). Plus Sharkboy and Lavagirl are best friends who demonstrate a willingness to risk their lives to save each other.\n\nSpeaking of less than zero, the advantage of seeing this on DVD versus in a theater is having the option to watch in 2-D. The 3-D version subtracts instead of adding, as much of the brightness and life of the film are lost to the crude 3-D cardboard glasses process they used. The only useful thing about the 3-D (other than a mildly interesting visual effect for those who have never experienced it) is the interactive aspect; as signs flash on the screen telling when to put on and take off the polarizing glasses. The DVD contains both versions and the 2-D one is first rate."

Your kids will going to have a lot of fun and time will convert this movie into a cult movie.

The plot was pretty cute for little kids, and I was really entertained by Taylor Lautner. Wow! I actually took my best friend to see it, and she doesn't really like kiddie movies, and she loved this one.

When offered the choice of seeing SBLG or Madagascar, the girls chose SBLG hands down.\n\nI did not realize until after seeing the movie that it was based on the director's son's ideas and story. I think that explains why my kids were drawn to the trailers and totally loved the movie. It also explains why I thought the movie was so imaginative and original. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I told my husband when we got back that it was unusual to see a Hollywood movie that wasn't a retread of a retread of a lousy idea.\n\nWay to go, Shark Boy and Lava Girl!"

But first, sit down and remember what it was like to be a kid. I don't mean, remember *being* a kid -- anyone can do that. Remember what it was *like*. Then, think about how *cool* it would be if you had been raised by sharks, and had gills and fins and razor-sharp teeth, and your best friend was a girl made of lava, and you both had all these cool powers.\n\nRemember how excited you could get, imagining things. Whether it was GI Joe, Barbie and Ken, or a fort you built with chairs and blankets. Remember? Remember what it felt like? Remember the intensity of an imagination on fire? OK.\n\nNow watch this movie again."

I was expecting a fun, engaging movie along the lines of Spy Kids for my two kids (5 and 7) and I got exactly what I hoped for. So nice to have both male and female protagonists! The humour was juvenile and very appropriate; my children were screaming with laughter at some points. The acting is good, the costumes are fun, and the characters likable. Let your kids make the decision on this one and just go along for the ride--you may not be overwhelmed, but your kids will be acting out Sharkboy and Lavagirl for weeks."

It is the first movie I took her to that she actually stayed in her seat. No bathroom breaks, no switching seats, etc., that is one for the record books for my daughter.

I saw the previews and the quotes at the bottom that said \"exciting and packed with action.\" (or something like that) but I realized that of course they'd say that it's a preview. So I decided to do a little research on the movie and check out the reviews of the movie critics. When I read them I found that they thought it wasn't as good as the other films this director has done. I have to admit, I have never seen any other Robert Rodriguez films so I wasn't sure what to expect. With this thought in mind I went to the movie and looked for the actions that annoyed the critics so much. With this said I think that if you go into the movie with high expectations (like favorite movie potential) you might be disappointed but if you go in with low expectations then you actually might like the movie more than you thought you would. It's a pretty OK-ish movie so give it a chance."

The plot is not subtle, but, um, it's called \"Sharkboy and LavaGirl\", you expected \"Anna Karenina\", maybe?\n\nThe action is good, including a impressive amount of work by the actor playing \"Shark Boy\". The movie gets a bit \"Heavy-handed\" on trying to cram too many \"messages\" in, but the ones that are there are good and well done. But WTH? It's a movie, it's worth seeing if you're under...I dunno...12. I had fun myself, but I dunno that I would have gone to see it on my own.\n\nThe kids?

Find them, and make friends with them!\" Mr Electricidad, Max's teacher advises him. Can you come up with wiser maxims than these for a kid? I'm not even halfway through this precious gem and already I am so delighted with it. Listen, I am over fifty years old I've seen a lot of film, theatre and even drama radio, this is a lovely and fantastic creation. Gorgeous and dreamlike location I mistook for silicon valley was actually filmed in Austin Texas (check out the very remarkable homes in the film) five stars for a fun, entertaining and moral lessons worth remembering."

        "review_detailed_main": "I took my boys to see this movie, they are aged 12, 9 and 7 and they enjoyed it almost as much as the Spy Kids series. The ideas for the movie are supposed to derive from the dreams of Racer Max, who is of course Richard Rodriguez's son. But as I watched the movie I could not stop thinking that I had read and seen very similar ideas before. It dawned on me that the basic premise of the movie is taken straight out of the Neverending Story by Michael Ende. If you are not familiar with it go get the book and then rent the video, it was a bestseller a few years ago and it is considered a fantasy classic. I wonder if little Racer Max has the video or the book at his home, or maybe his father read it to him at bedtime? You can hardly blame a young kid for blending ideas taken from material he has been exposed to with what he thinks are his original dreams, but to have it actually become a multimillion dollar Hollywood production in 3D no less without anyone checking for similarities is incredible. Still, the movie is entertaining enough for the young crowd. My wife did not go to the theater to see the movie last year, but she just saw a few minutes of it of the DVD version we just purchased. Guess what film she was reminded of? Yes, The Neverending Story, and no I had not said anything to her about the film. I wonder why critics have not noticed the many parallels that exist between these stories."
