        "review_detailed_main": "First off, this is a kids movie so certain allowances should be made for its rubbishness. But I expect that the majority of 7 year olds would find High Noon an unrewarding and painful experience.\n\nThe film concerns a group of extremely unscary baddies who decide that world domination can be best achieved by hijacking an amusement park. Two things prevent the villains from carrying out their evil plan. Firstly, the bad guys find themselves easily defeated at every turn by three children and Hulk Hogan. Secondly, those aforementioned bad guys are morons.\n\nThe three children are, of course, the 3 Ninjas. They defeat fully grown men in martial art combat at every turn. Particularly remarkable, since one of the kids appears to be about four years old. Of especial note is the second youngest as he sports a haircut that is so abysmally misguided it makes Billy Ray Cyrus's mullet look tasteful. It is a bowl-cut/pony-tail combo; two haircuts from hell all on one head - it is truly horrendous and should really not be seen by younger viewers.\n\nAn interesting aspect of the movie is that despite the fact that the fairground has been hijacked, no one seems to have informed the extras. They carry on enjoying the rides as if nothing has happened. As I said earlier, the bad guys are essentially idiots, so its just possible that they have not got their heads round the technicalities of hijacking. But, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter as the film is not exactly convincing in a general sense.\n\nDo I recommend it? Not really but it is an ideal birthday present for a child you dislike."

Hulk plays Dave Dragon, some old guy who is not very hard and not very funny - and basically the bottom line of the film is some female terrorist tries to take over a theme park. They fail, thanks to some geeky kids who apparently know martial arts. The most annoying thing though is how easily grown adults get beaten up by pesky little kids. This film is so bad, but, fair play, I watched most of it so it achieved something in that sense. Enjoyable if you like ripping it out of bad actors and rubbish plots."

        "review_detailed_main": "Old sea maps used to leave a warning on the outer edges of the charts. It would read: \"Here be monsters.\" I wish such a message had been written before the opening credits. Oh, actually it was, but it was in code that I deciphered too late to save myself. It was the part which read: \"3 Ninjas High Noon at Mega Mountain.\" WOE! WOE UNTO ME!!!!\n\nI'm a man with, admittedly, unusual and quirky tastes when it comes to film and film actors/actresses. I like a lot of character actors because they tend to get the most interesting variety of parts. I really loved Victor Wong's career. Memories of his performances in films like 'Tremors,' 'Prince of Darkness,' and especially 'Big Trouble in Little China' (with another favourite of mine, Al Leong -- the Wing Kong Hatchet Man!!! *LOL*) have put me on a quest to see as much of his work as possible.\n\nA quest that died Saturday afternoon just past.\n\nThis deeply regrettable, dreckish, foul excuse of a film and the knowledge that Victor Wong appeared in three other incarnations of it is enough to sour even the strongest movie-goers stomach. Victor's appearance in this awful thing is mercifully concentrated in the opening of the film. It gives him no chance to show off any of his inimitable charm and Victor Wong looks like a tired old man weighed down by the two hardest words that any actor will ever have to listen to: Contractual obligation.\n\nMusic: insipid. Direction: insipid. Plot: insipid. Dialogue: insipid. Acting: hit and miss.\n\nThe kids all deserved better than to be stuck in this film. For fear that they will track me down and beat the heck out of me with their ninja skills, just let me say that they all gave academy award worthy performances. Exhibit A: the two younger brothers manage to keep a straight face and wait -- holding their fight stance -- for thirty seconds as the three bad guy adults struggle to get out of their costumes and dress up again so that the kids can yell \"NINJAS!!!\" I don't blame the kids for this despite the fact that they were as unwatchable as everything else here. This film will bore parents to death so unless you want orphans, avoid, avoid, AVOID!!!\n\nVictor Wong (let me return to a bright light for a moment) died after this film. Jim Varney, who also appeared in this film, has also since died. You may draw your own conclusions.\n\nVarney, in all fairness, is probably the best thing in this film. His performance takes him in a scene-stealing direction with a bad guy turn. Out-acting Loni Anderson, Hulk Hogan and all three ninjas, he easily comes across as a bully who is picking an acting fight with unarmed opponents ... I said I wasn't going to blame the kids... this wasn't their fault, this wasn't their fault ...\n\nFinal Verdict: (un)watchable... BEARABLE only for those who are die-hard Wong or Varney fans. Also bearable if one chants over and over again the words: \"this too shall pass.\" All others should give a miss with extreme prejudice."

I defy any child to be content with this dross, and if any adult enjoys it I'm sorry but the men in white coats are coming with the special jacket.\n\nThe plot is nonsense, the dialogue stomach churning and the acting worse than anything seen in a Friday the 13th movie.

The plot is ridiculous & other posters have done a good job at pointing out the shortcomings so I'll keep this brief. As someone alluded to previously & after a secondary viewing last night re-enforced, it is quite comical how the \"terrorists\" go through extreme measures to get into the park (ie; having a ship offshore, jet skis, scuba diving, underwater lasers etc,) when they could just pay the nominal fee to gain access to the park! That was great. Hulk Hogan as always, is a crowd pleaser. I like at the end when he knocks off the tops of the underwater breathing apparatuses with a single blow & they masquerade as oxygen diffusing projectiles! Jim Varney obviously was funny in his role as the antagonist, no doubt ashamed to be cast in such a lousy movie. And the three \"ninjas\"? Don't even get me started. So cheesy with the Ayais! over & over. Terrible actors, but it all adds to the ambiance of a wonderful film, albeit low budget & misconstrued, unintentional comedy. Would highly recommend, & it goes without saying that a solid buzz while embarking on such a journey will no doubt add to the enjoyment derived from this little gem. Cheers!"

It wanted to show compassion. It wanted to show teamwork, brotherly love and it wanted to show Hulk Hogan's acting abilities. It all failed in that.\n\nThree brothers who happened to be in an amusement park will save the day because the amusement park is taken over by terrorists! There are also subplots of Hulk Hogan's character being a has-been (so is he) and the eldest ninja who'll get the heart of this ten-year-old girl. Lame! Colt is played by this kid who will become the future Canadian band Moffats-parody lead singer. Tum-tum is a little Hilary Swank stuck in a Baby Gap model's body. Rocky is this over-the-top, meant to be \"cool\" punk who can't kiss at fourteen.\n\nThe supporting kids are just as weird. The computer girl had not a cinch of fear since there was a four-minute bomb inches away from her face. The \"roller coaster-Come save me!\" girl was the miscast of the entire debacle. Can she even stand still? Why is it such a good idea for terrorists to take over an amusement park? Why cast a has-been wrestler who can't even say his name right? Why are Jamaican men such good computer junkies? Why cast a toddler (who yelps like a strangling cat) into saying those damn \"Ay-Ya's\" over two dozen times?\n\nI liked these ninja movies. The first ones? Great. I was like three when that came to video. But this? This is the limit of underdeveloped. It looked like it was directed by a damn pro-kids pedophile! I would just say that the hype, the story, the climax and the stupendous fight scenes (where the kids close their little eye-dy widey's to kick the bad goons) take the cake as making this pure garbage.\n\nDon't waste your time, I did."

While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the most wooden performance goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. All 6 stars go to Jim Varney. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission for he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. He easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives 100% to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. Maybe if Jim had cast and directed this, it would've been a bigger box office success. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius. If you're a fan of Varney's, then yes, get the movie just to watch him. Otherwise, don't bother."

        "review_detailed_main": "I reviewed this title back in November 2008, about 4 years ago, and while I still come to the conclusion that this movie still gets a rating of 1 because of how ridiculously bad it is, upon seeing it a few more times, I have to dig deeper into this movie and provide some more thoughts and ideas about it.\n\nFirst off, if you've seen the movie, Skip the next paragraph.\n\nIn the recent years of the 3 Ninjas, They've grown older and more mature, and because of this, their interest in being ninjas has taken a backseat to more older things. While Tum-tum is still a young boy, Rocky has moved onto girlfriends, and Colt is merely stuck in the middle. Not only that, Tum-tum's Favorite Saturday morning hero, Dave Dragon, is about to cancel his 15-year long superhero show, due to low ratings and loss of interest. His final appearance will be at the Mega mountain theme park on tum-tum's birthday. So Tum-tum wants to go, and his older brothers tag along with their new friend, Amanda, who seems to be an expert on Computer Programming, hacking, and complex electronics. while at the theme park, a group of mercenary Ninjas, led by escaped convict, Mary Ann rogers, AKA Medusa, take over the theme park and threaten to harm it's people, but will let them go in exchange for a large sum of money. Will they succeed in their evildoing, or will the 3 ninjas save the day?\n\nOK, Upon seeing this movie a few more times and reading other comments left by users, There's lots to say now. First and foremost, i see 2 obvious references to mid-90s Role Playing games - First, look at Colt's hair. not only does it look ridiculous, it's a bad rip-off of Hero-class Bowie from shining force II, A sega Genesis RPG from 1994. Also, look at Amanda. Doesn't her character seem familiar to another girl from a 1995 SNES RPG? she does have thick glasses, knows her way around complex electronics and computers - Kinda like Lucca from Chrono Trigger maybe?\n\nSecondly, kids movies of the 90's can be totally remembered for kids outsmarting adults and leaving a trail of laughter in their wake. It started with Home alone, from 1990. Then it carried throughout the 90s, but around the mid-to-late 90s, the clich\u00e9 got really old. this movie feeds off that clich\u00e9 like Michael Moore feeds off of McDonalds.\n\nThirdly, The aged stars of our show. First there's Hulk Hogan. Now i love wrestling, to me, it's entertainment and should not be looked at as a legitimate sport, cause it's not. Hulkamania was still running wild for the hulk at the time, he was in his 40s (if this was filmed in 1997, released in 1998, and hulk was born in 1953, he would've been 44 years old. For the most part, his acting isn't really believable, but his larger than life character in the ring more than makes up for it. then we have our other aged star, Loni Anderson. this was a few years after her divorce with Burt Reynolds, and i gotta admit, with all the leather, the make-up, lipstick, and sexy cougar voice, I was still turned on to her. How old was she around the time of filming? Well, she was born in 1945, making her 52 around the time of filming. Hot damn! But her acting skills in this film are as follows...\n\nFourth, Loni Anderson might as well have starred in a porno, cause her acting skills, are totally unbelievable. And adding onto another user's comment, The Dialogue between Loni and Chelsey (Amanda) feels like watching a lesbian porno, about an aged beauty queen wanting to have her way with a young woman.\n\nSo the bottom line, 3 Ninjas; High Noon at Mega Mountain isn't what you'd call a memorable film, i'd prefer the term \"Boring Saturday afternoon fare.\" it's totally forgettable, the only reason i'll ever remember it is because Loni Anderson was a total cougar in it. I'd rather remember hulk hogan for his Wrestling matches.\n\n1/10"

But even with a bigger budget, a few grownup \"guest stars\" and three new youngsters in the lead roles, \"Mega Mountain\" won't amount to a hill of beans at the box office. On the other hand, given the series' past track record, homevideo prospects are mildly bright."

The fact that the two older guys are easy on the eyes doesn't hurt anything, either.)\n\nWhat had originally enticed me, though, was the action part of the film. After all, the actors playing Rocky, Colt, and Tum-Tum (see the list) are all black belts. Yep, even the ten-year-old! So if you're looking for spills, not kills, and amusement park thrills, rent this today!"

In fact, the only somewhat tolerable asset was the soundtrack, that was decent compared to how awful everything else was.\n\nWhat made the movie especially bad was the plot. It is incredibly lame and predictable, with one of the dumbest endings I have seen in recent memory. Production values-wise, the movie is not good either, the cinematography, sets and scenery are of shoddy quality and the editing is so slip-shod it hurts the eyes and makes the editing in a movie like The Medallion seem Oscar-worthy. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed with little or no drive or energy, while the script and direction are terrible. Same with the acting, the kids are all annoying, the villains are pathetic in both character and acting while Hulk Hogan has a poor character and is not given much to do.\n\nOverall, an awful film and not worth it. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Uggh! This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene. The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to \"Pocket Ninjas\" (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time!\n\nSoon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6.\n\nSo should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "1st watched 4/6/2008 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Sean McNamara): Harmless fluff, but poorly done at times. In this 3 Ninjas entry, the guys are spending time at their favorite amusement park for Tum Tum's birthday. A group of bad ninjas just happen to be attempting to take over the park for a ransom while they are there. The bad guys are led by Madusa(played by Loni Anderson) and assisted by a rare non-comic Jim Varney, who actually does a pretty good job as a villain. The movie starts with the 3 hero's doing a pretty cool obstacle course at their grandfather's place but learn a valuable lesson when he turns off the power and then makes them attempt it backwards. The lesson they learned, supposedly, is not to get a big head because they aced it going forwards but couldn't cut it backwards without power(believe it or not!!). This is later used by the guys in the final showdown with the baddies, which kind of brings their lesson back to them and creates kind of a purpose for their grandfather's teachings. I won't let you know what happens the 2nd time, in case you want to watch the movie yourself, but you can probably guess. This predictability, some obvious mistakes in the production(boom mikes and wires being visible) and the low acting expectations from most make this attempt at a fun kids movie even dismal to most kids, probably."

It's the youngest brother of the '3 ninjas' birthday, and he wanted to celebrate it at the Mega Mountain them park. At the same time, Dave \"Dragon\", ridiculously played by Hulk Hogan, is trying to prevent himself from being cancelled from his long running syndicated television show- also filmed on the 'Mega Mountain' theme park. The perfect movie intended for pre-schoolers, and a complete waste of time for anyone 8 years and up, considering what kids can watch these days from super hero movies and so forth. It says on the commercial box that 'it's fun for kids' quotation from well known critic from RT by the name of Rex Reed, who may have been paid to endorse this movie. One of the stupidest things I had ever saw was when, the so-called \"three ninjas\" are supposed to be fighting the bad adult ninjas in the dark, yet viewers can clearly see that it's still bright enough for them to see their fighting opponents. Movie, clearly made for white suburban white kids. Bomb, plus another minus 5."

It's boring, there's no direction, and the writing is cringeworthy.\n\nSome of it was kind of funny though, and I think there was perhaps a little tiny bit of effort put in, so I'll give it a 2/10 instead of a 1/10."

The really annoying part was the little brat Tum-Tum, and his annoying war cry. looking back on the film now and taking into account that its a kids movie, I still find it so funny that a bunch of grown men can get their buts kicked by a bunch of kids. I would have much preferred it if they had using firearms, and test the little brats to see if they could dodge bullets like real Ninja's."

Think back to when you were a kid. Wouldn't you love to see a movie where kids your age can take on fully grown men and win?

The humor - bland and just not funny i think i laughed maybe once or twice throughout the whole film after watching the other 3 straight through and getting to this one, it was a full let down. Even my favorite Tum-Tum couldn't even save the film.\n\nThe action - As a child might like it. If you have watched the other ones it was still somewhat reasonable and funny to watch the three boys beat up henchmen.\n\nOverall - I don't know if they were trying to go for the staple of oh look they took on three goons in 2 of the movies they must want it again just no don't ever do that. Do i think its watchable maybe if you're having a few with the friends or baked because I found myself skipping forward 5 seconds every 5 minutes. I'm 25 the other 3 movies still made me feel something by the end. This one was just disastrously bad and not in a good way. They switched up how Rocky actually was ruined Colt which i don't know how they ever could maybe with the recasting, tum-tum wasn't funny and just seemed over cheesy. Just STAY AWAY and go watch the other films."

They just made this film hard to believe because everyone knows there isn't any way that 3 kids could take down that man grown men. It just doesn't happen. I hope there done producing god-awful movies such as this one. Mabey with todays effects they could do a little, well, A lot better in trying to make a kiddie karate movie a little more interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "That math problem sums up this whole movie. It is \"The Karate Kid\" divided into three smaller karate kids. Then you times that by zero effort and you get one big fat goose egg of a movie. It is the fourth installment in the 3 Ninjas saga, and it is by far the worst. The other films I will review in time, but this is the big one. This is the one that everyone hates. It has terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and an awful story. When it comes to the acting the only person I liked was Jim Varney, but that is not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. As you would expect the child acting fails completely. The 3 ninjas are all annoying especially the little one. As for Hulk Hogan I didn't hate the performance, but it is exactly what you would expect. Then we have the action which is terrible. It goes for fighting that is practically slapstick instead of actual fighting. That is something I hate about a lot of kung fu/karate movies. So many of them just go for laughs from kiddies instead of actual honor for the fighting. It insults it, and if I was a karate teacher I would spit on pieces of trash like this everyday. In my opinion martial arts should stay in the more adult categories. The only true exception I have seen for these largely kid friendly martial arts movies is \"The Karate Kid\" that's it. I can't wait for a day when another film like that comes around and shows kids what the art of combat is about instead of constant shots to the balls. Until then we get this. Also another thing terrible about the fighting that is unbearable is how they have weapons with knives, but they never use them. I know it's for kids, but if there is a terrorist in front of you and you have a knife that guy is getting stabbed. Have stabbing or lose the knives in my opinion. Also the fighting suffers from those clich\u00e9 noises that are made when you make a punch. It gets really annoying quickly. Now we move on to the plot. It really all seems like an excuse to have Hulk Hogan. They might as well call it \"Hulk and 3 Ninjas\". He was what sold the film in the first place, but I am going to try and explain the plot. The ninjas go to an amusement park, and it gets taken over by terrorists. The only hope is the 3 ninjas, a smart girl with glasses, and Hulk Hogan......(3 hours of laughing later) Yeah that is one of the lamest excuses for a plot I have ever seen. Then we have dialogue which just like the fighting suffers from way to much childish humor. The jokes are very repetitive. The movie just isn't funny. I'm not going to give this film a 0 star rating. It's bad, but at least it isn't \"Pocket Ninjas\". Just saying the title of that movie makes me shiver.\n\n1/2 of a star out of 4"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has no entertainment value, not even to make fun of because it sucks so much in every aspect. The movie starts out strong by introducing us to a very stereotypical racist Asian grandpa, who is Asian for no reason other than he has to know ninja stuff, and is even more confusing because neither his kids nor his grandkids are at all Asian like him. Also Hulk Hogan is in this movie for no reason.\n\nThis movie was genuine pain to sit through all the actors are terrible and there is a really s wordy love story that shouldn't exist in the first place. The climax of the movie lasts for like 3/4th's of its runtime and consists entirely of terrible fight choreography. The entire cast is super racist stereotypes like a guy with a Jamaican hat who fakes a thick accent terribly. Also the kids for some reason yell AYAH every time they throw a punch or kick which got annoying really fast and by the end of the movie I was genuinely mad. There is only one good scene in which one of the kids yells into a pipe and the bad guy who is standing at the other end flies backwards because of the wind and lands on an exposed metal pole which gets shoved up his a word violently.\n\nThere is no plot at all stuff just happens for no reason and makes no sense like when the bad guys drop their machine guns so they can fight an unarmed Hulk Hogan and 3 five year olds with swords which they have for some reason. Also there is one scene where the bad woman starts a 4 minute timer on a bomb but it doesn't go off for well over 17 minutes.\n\nThis movie really sucks and was actual work to sit through. Seriously f word this movie I hate this movie so much. On the bright side it's not the worst movie with a title starting with a 3. I am only giving this movie a 2 because it wasn't outwardly sexist or racist. After watching Pink, Airplane Mode, and 3 Idiotas, I have lost the ability to give movies lower than a 2.\n\n2/10 -Rajesh P."

Watched it on a hangover with a mate and we couldn't stop laughing the whole time and, despite having a lot of work to do, were compelled to watch to the end to see if the 3 ninjas won. It's the most ludicrous story line I've ever seen in a film, I was just sitting there thinking how is that little kid beating up grown men 'ninjas' - surely just knee him in the head, he's about 6. And that ridiculous girl with all the gadgets, \"Let me just reroute the encryption through the CPU\" or some bollox, on what was essentially a toy computer. The female leader of the terrorist looks like an 80s porn star (so does the Hulk as well, I guess), speaking of which, Mr. Hogan put in one of his best performances since Muppets from Space. It is genuinely the worst, least believable film you will ever see and as a result is truly hilarious. Also, one of the kids has literally the worst haircut you will ever see, it's worth watching the film purely for that. Long live Dave Dragon!!!"

This is also a good movie to watch if you are bored or there's nothing good on. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I've seen all the 3 ninjas movies and enjoyed them all.

It's a true family film, because it isn't very violent, and there's no bad language, which has just completely taken over the movie, and TV industry.
