        "review_detailed_main": "This is certainly a consensus pick as one of the worst (if not the worst) movies ever made - and for that very reason I've always wanted to watch it. Now I have, and my suggestion to everyone is - lighten up. Yes, it's bad. The sets are dreadful - worse than you used to see on Saturday morning kids' shows. The special effects are weak - although to be honest I've seen worse portrayals of space flight. And the costumes are hilarious - especially the polar bear and the robot. But come on - you have to admit that there's a certain \"cuteness\" to the story of Martians coming to earth to kidnap Santa Claus so that he can bring happiness to their children. All the characters are pretty one- dimensional. There's good guys and bad guys and fun guys and kids from both Earth and Mars. No one gets particularly well developed. And then, of course, there's Santa. In all honesty, I thought John Call did a decent job as the jolly old man. In this age of high tech special effects and big budget movies there's no doubt that this looks pretty weak - and even by the standards of 1964 it was still pretty weak. But it's good fun, and for the fun alone I don't think it deserves its reputation as one of the worst movies ever. What's left to say, except - \"Hurray for Santy Claus!\" 4/10"

Certainly film studios could learn a thing or two, in this ridiculous era of quarter-of-a-billion-dollar blockbusters. I for one don't need the equivalent of 'having my eyes masturbated', as one cinema critic so lovingly stated.\n\nI would prefer watching this in a second over any of the ham-fisted, cash-soaked holiday atrocities made in the past three decades (I believe 'A Christmas Story', and perhaps 'Elf' and 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' to be the last decently-made Yuletide films).\n\nBut don't take MY word for it...see it for yourself (without the stupid and condescending MST3K commentary) and make your OWN conclusion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe I have a soft spot somewhere in my heart for poorly written, badly conceived, silly 1960s children's movies - but I really can't understand why Santa Claus versus the Martians is in the worst 100 movies of all time here on IMDb. Sure, most viewers will breathe a sigh of relief when it ends, but this film really seems downright harmless compared to the six month old Kennel Ration Hollywood has been feeding us as commercial film for the last ten or so years. Hey, at least it's not a remake, a sequel, or a 2 hour long CGI cartoon with a few human faces tossed in for effect.\n\nSanta Claus gets kidnapped by distraught martians (white guys with bad green makeup and a few dishwasher parts glued to their heads, as well as inexplicable capes), who want to rescue their depressive, antisocial children from the doldrums by giving them all toys and a big red-suited guy with a beard to laugh at... err... with. Santa adapts to life on Mars very well and starts cranking out the toys with the help of Martian machines, but political controversies surrounding his activities soon threaten the fabric of Martian Society.\n\nI'm not kidding.... really.... this is the plot.\n\nAside from the ludicrous plot and mediocre acting (Bill McCutcheon gives the only really enjoyable performance in this film, though Pia Zadora and Vincent Beck are not too bad), this is no worse than many of the kid films of its time. In the age of ADD and general impatience, however, this film is more than a little dated. The only modern kid I can imagine enjoying this film is one with an extraordinarily great attention span and a penchant for B-films. In terms of production, this film has the feel of a 2 hour, 1960s low budget TV show, and is almost as clever.\n\nI would recommend avoiding this film unless you're compelled to watch films which go to extremes. I found it cute, funny, and more than a tad ridiculous. To most people, it's a film version of your great Aunt's wallpaper - it's just there on the TV, while far more interesting things are happening in the carpet below your feet."

        "review_detailed_main": "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a low budget kid's movie from the early 60's. It has a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made. But, similar to most such famously trashed films, it actually turns out to be nowhere near the worst of the worst. More accurately, this could be described as an enjoyable slice of cheese. Sure, its rubbish on several levels but it also happens to be memorable on several other levels.\n\nThe story, such as it is, has the Martians kidnapping Santa Claus and, in the process, abducting two Earth children as well. You see, the Martians want to enjoy Christmas as well. With a plot-line as moronic as that, there's really no point in splitting hairs over details and instead just sit back and watch what unfolds. The sets, costumes and make-up are all bargain-basement but they all work well enough within the confines of the plastic coated world that they exist in. Some of the highlights of the film as a whole include an angry Martian and friendly but stupid Martian, an impressively unconvincing and fake polar bear, a comedy punch up and last, yet surely best of all, a truly infectious theme song about Santy Claus. In the final analysis, there's enough strangeness here to qualify this as a bona fide cult item. It's poor, yet simultaneously quite good. Come on now; let's hear it for Santy Claus!"

I'll leave that for you. At least they opted not to make Santa a Kung Fu Master, it's all meant to be heart warming.\n\nCould I sit through it again? Absolutely not, but one of the worst movies of all time? I've seen worse."

It's hysterical, but even as you're laughing yourself breathless you can't help but feel bad inside that you're actually chewing down this rotten junk food. Because that's what Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is: a case of food poisoning. There are layers and layers of awfulness in this movie, and it really is an unforgettable experience. The actors are all stoned out of their minds and extremely ugly. The title pretty much explains the plot, although there's not really a lot of \"conquering\". Maybe a better title would have been \"Santa Claus Laughs at Inappropriate Times while Hanging Out with Bad Actors in Silly Outfits\"? Just saying. I know it isn't as catchy, but at least it's not deceiving.\n\nIt would be impossible to sum up all the stuff that sucks about this film, so I'll break it down into what I remember most strongly: a man in an ingeniously fake-looking polar bear costume (funnier than the \"bear\" from Hercules in New York); an extra with the most unnatural laugh you're ever likely to hear; an ex-dope addict martian with tics; kid actors who make sure every syllable of their lines are slowly and caaarreee-fulll-yyy prrooo-noun-ceeed; a newspaper headline stating that Santa's been \"kidnaped\", and a giant robot. Yes, you read that right. A giant robot.\n\nThe worst acting job in here must be when Mother Claus and her elves have been \"frozen\" by the \"Martians'\" weapons. Could they be *more* trembling? I know this was the sixties and everyone was doped up, but still.\n\nThis wins the Dung Beetle Award of the year. Destined to become a Christmas classic for me!"

This film brings artistry to sub-mediocrity. Something so basely horrible defies the physics of cinematography. I could not make a worse movie if I spent absolutely no time at all making it.

Either way, this one will appeal to them.\n\nFor the rest of us, there's the issues of Santa-kidnapping Martians in BRIGHT green makeup and helmets that resemble Yul Brynner's headgear in \"The Ten Commandments\"; other Martians that you either want to punch out (Dropo) or try and talk out of future acting opportunities (a young Pia Zadora-???); Santas that walk around saying \"Merry Christmas\", despite the fact that Christmas is not even close; pop guns that immobilize people; polar bears that have extremely long hind legs; and blah, and blah, and blah...\n\nBut DOES Santa Claus actually conquer the Martians of the title, like it says? Yep, but he doesn't hit, punch, kick, bite, scratch, claw or anything. Sorry kids, green blood does not flow here. You see, Santa puts in a Martian North Pole workshop and wins over the Martians with peace and good will towards men...and Martians too, I guess. He even makes lazy good-for-nothing Dropo a Martian Santa. GOOD; anything that will keep that nutcase on his own planet....\n\nTwo stars for SCCTM; one star for the Christmas spirit and another for the fact that it was half-price beer night when I went in that pub to see it again.\n\nMaybe they should do that for \"The Horse Whisperer\"...."

Reputedly, Gene Lindsey is the man in the polar bear suit, but he can't bee seen; later, he guest-starred as \"Randall Drew\" (Roxanne's brother) on \"Dark Shadows\", a show sparking the imagination on a limited budget.\n\nWith a small budget, your really need a big imagination. \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" has a few good lines, a phallic set statue (as the Martian kids watch TV), and a nice view of the sky as seen from Mars (see Saturn?) - but, there isn't enough creativity aboard. John Call (as Santa Claus) and Bill McCutcheon (as Dropo) try their best with the script, and 1980s celebrity Pia Zadora (as Girmar) debuts.

Yes.\n\nThe plot of this film is that the children of Mars are in some sort of stupor. When a father goes to the supreme leader about the problems his children are having the leader tell s them that \"Children are no longer Children on Mars\". Eventually the Martians are told about how on earth they have Christmas and Santa Claus.\n\nThe Martians then set out to kidnap Santa and they do along with 2 children.\n\nSanta however is facing a problem when he gets on Mars because one the Martians does not approve of his arrival.\n\nIf your a child of the 1970's then chances are you have seen this film. It is fun to watch. You can't help but to laugh at the cheap looking \"Saturday Morning Television\" special effects."

I am watching it right now on Movies TV! It's on their Saturday morning popcorn movies lineup. Since it's the Saturday before Christmas, it's an appropriate time to show it. The plot of martians coming to earth to kidnap Santa Claus in order to get Martian kids to stop watching earth TV programs is a unique idea. It's kind of silly but earth kids back in 1964 would believe most anything. The special effects are OK and the makeup is good enough the time period. There are some legitimate actors in SCCTM. John Call was well cast as Santa. He had a long career both as a stage, movie and TV actor. What with the internet today, modern kids would probably not be too interested. But, it might be an enjoyable movie for really young kids who aren't into the internet and cell phones yet. And for any of us who still believe in Santa Claus."

It's just a rambling mess of mistaken identity and ridiculous situations, going nowhere. Santa is OK in his ho, ho, ho, sort of way, but he even looks bored and confused at times. He is brought to Mars to get the kids to focus on more traditional Martian values or something. They are watching too much TV, I guess. But the pitfalls are that the Martians are so uninteresting. Earthlings with shoe polish on their faces--it even rubs off at times. There is the obligatory bad guy. I guess he's on a power trip because what difference does it all make?

This is the stuff that would make Truffaut proud!\n\nI mean, let's be honest, after watching \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\", Fellini looks pretty terrible, right? I mean, sure, his films have intelligent scripts, strong emotional cores, and playful humor, but they are...lifeless.

I've sat through movies that have put me in more pain than this (mostly sequels) but there really isn't anything good about this. First off the title of the movie is enough to pull in nearly any B-horror fan before they realize that Santa isn't up in the sky blasting away at the Martians. Rather he is kidnapped and ends up going pretty quietly. The problem with Mars is that there is no joy to be had for the children on Mars. Drawing this from the sad looks on his children's faces, the Martian leader decides it'd be a great idea to kidnap Santa and force him to spread Christmas joy on their planet. Again, Santa has no problem with this and goes quietly. However, the evil Voldar sees weakness in joy and decides that Santa must be destroyed before all of Mars becomes a happy place. So does Santa actually conquer anything? No. Is there anything in this movie that's worth seeing? Unless your extremely forgiving when it comes down to children's movies, no. Another thing that should be noted is that I do believe the soundtrack for this movie was recorded in the 7th layer of Hell. It's that bad. Not even worth the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart. If you want a Christmas movie I suggest revisiting Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas."

The opening sequences are still somewhat refreshing and, bearing in mind this was originally intended to be a film for children exclusively, you begin to develop impressions that it doesn't really deserves its notorious reputation of being one of the all-time worst stinkers. All the children on earth get anxious because Christmas time is coming up and jolly music plays from every television set. For some hi-tech reason, the children on Mars receive the earthly TV-channels as well, and they're depressed because they haven't got a bearded fat guy in a red suit that hands out presents. The great leader of Mars \u0096 busy man that he is \u0096 promptly organizes a mission to earth in order to kidnap Santa and return the happiness to his children's green faces. So far so good, the sets and costumes are incredibly cheesy and laughable, but you can't help smiling at the screen. Then it all goes downhill from the moment Santa (and two random kids) are abducted and taken back to Mars. Santa Claus doesn't exactly \"conquer\" the Martians; he befriends them! For you see, there's only ONE mean and ill-natured Martian but all the others are hospitable and friendly. Then the movie just gets plain boring and I imagine even kids from the early 60's would have found it dreadful! The enthusiasm of cast and crew seems to have disappeared and there are absolutely no ingenious gimmicks anymore. John Call has the ideal posture and charisma to play Santa, but even he can't produce a convincing \"Ho Ho Ho\" when the end of the movie nears. Painful..."

NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST\n\nGrowing up in Oxnard Ca this film always played on KTTV Channel 11 around Christmas time. It later moved to KTLA Channel 5 and Pia Zadora even did a fireside chat with television movie host Tom Hatten.\n\nEven today watching this film is a huge part of my \"Christmas traditions\". It was a \"Must See\" when I was a child and today I still watch it (Around Christmas)\". I also still watch \"Rudolph\" \"Charlie Brown\" \"Frosty the Snowman\" and MGM's \"A Christmas Carol\". One of the main reasons why I love this film is because I loved John Call as \"Santa Claus\". He is a huge delight. He is a terrific Santa.\n\nIn this film \"Santa\" gets kidnapped by Martians. The reason is that the children of Mars do not have a \"Santa\". They also do not know how to have \"fun\". So the leader of Mars goes to Earth and kidnaps Santa as well as 2 earth children. \"Santa\" then slowly wins over the Adult Martians even though there are certain forces against him.\n\nNow if you are an adult (and you have never seen this) you will think this movie is terrible. Children (Who still believe in Santa) will be entertained. It is harmless fun! Even the theme song \"Hooray For Santa Claus\" is \"Cute & Catchy\".\n\nThe films low budget is all too apparent here however if this film did have a bigger budget then it might not have the weird charm.\n\nI beg all of you to watch this film. Have a viewing party. It is a film that many people have seen and actually are afraid to admit that they enjoy it.\n\nI am not afraid to admit that I even bought this film on Blu-Ray."

However, it is definitely worth seeing to see how bad it is. I do think the film starts off well, the first twenty minutes are refreshing and entertaining. After that, it is a different story, and although it is a mess it is hard not to be entertained by it.\n\nFirst off, while the sets aren't too bad, the effects are hysterically awful and the costumes especially with the martians are pretty hideous. The cinematography is also rather shoddy. The music is okay, but gets too much after a while. With Hooray for Santa Claus, I wasn't sure whether to cry \"Three cheers for Santa Claus\" or \"Bah humbug\".\n\nThe script is appalling mostly, cloying and unintentionally camp, while the story is incoherent and mean-spirited and there are some real pacing problems especially in the middle. The acting is not great either, John Call initially seemed a good choice for Santa with just the right charisma, but he is too jolly and he looked drunk or out of it in some way. I think a previous commentator is right, maybe he did read the script, knew it was terrible and decided to play along.\n\nOverall, pretty bad but entertaining also. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

Alas, despite the expenditure of a fair bit of money on sets and costumes, every plot opening turns into a dead end.\n\nAdmittedly, not the worst movie ever made but it tries mighty hard to reach that distinction. If the script was meant to be joked up or played tongue-in-cheek, almost the entire cast seems unaware of that fact. In fact, John Call and Leonard Hicks are offered some really splendid comic opportunities but both seem relentlessly bent on playing the script straight, despite prodding by Vincent Beck and Bill McCutcheon (plus Don Blair in a small part as the television news announcer) to follow their examples. Mr Call in particular deserves some sort of commendation for his successful efforts to rob the role of any satiric humor, although Mr Webster's unhelpfully leaden direction must also cop a fair share of the blame."

But also on the trip to Mars are two Earth children who get caught up in this mess by helping the Martians find Santa Claus. Not everyone is too happy about this outcome, as one of the Martians doesn't like this idea of Santa spreading fun to their children, so he goes out of his way to stop that happening.\n\nWhat's Christmas without watching a Christmas flick. But oh my what a film to pick! I remember watching this flick a long time ago, but I didn't remember too much about it and that was definitely a good thing from what I just watched! It isn't the worst film I've seen, but it isn't that far away from it. 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians ' does give the word bad, a really bad name. Ah, maybe bad is too loose of word to describe it. Abysmal, yeah that's better. Sure, this is aimed at children, but really there's whole lot better Christmas flicks out there! Especially since it treats you as if you're damn fool! There's nothing subtle about it with you basically being slap in the face with its heavy handed nature of forced morality and force-feeding you, to where the story is heading. If you're thinking that it might be so bad that it's good entertainment\u0085 far from it, actually. Ed Wood might be proud of it as it does share patterns to his type of work in the cheap effects, lousy costumes (except Santa's, but not the polar bear) and cardboard sets, but his films had heart by being too over-the-top, while this made in the basement production was a total drag and ultimately cold. Even if there's one or two hammy performances amongst many droll ones. That would be John Call as Santa Claus. The Christmas spirit to me came across as false and rather unsettling. Yeah, unsettling. Something about it and all the happiness felt unstable and just got my nerves. When they broke into that unnatural laughter and strained humour, *argh*, don't they know their limitations in this incompetent hogwash. Nice idea, but handled without any real passion and it shows by its restless nature. So, this is how to celebrate Christmas! And to think, is this feature mocking itself or being serious. Ah, I think more so the latter. Bah! Oh my beloved eyes and ears. Why did I put you in this much pain?\n\nOther things that stand out in this uninspired trite has got to be the choreographed action pieces that just blows you away. Blows you away at how amateurish they were. Pretty much it's cartoon style in its action, gags and wait the drowning music. Stock footage is patched in rather elegantly! That's if you got bad eye sight. The diabolically lengthy script with its emotionally touching and you bloody don't say speeches aren't helped by the mostly robotic performances. These mainly came from the kids and the aliens from Mars. Well more so, people who just like to wear green (because it's logically that they be green) and have a hard hat with tubing and a TV antenna on top. Gee, they looked so realistic! It looks like it just comes second nature. Be careful you don't lose any brain cells as the catchy, but annoying opening and ending tune sticks in your head! \"Hooray for Santa Claus\" No, \"hooray it's over\" sounds a lot better.\n\nExpect the unexpected. But that doesn't mean it's a good thing! Oh, by the way, the Martian's stun ray really works a miracle."

Voldar (Beck) doesn't believe Mars needs Santa Claus and so he attempts to undermine bringing Santa home at every turn.\n\nI really can't hate a movie this inept. Obviously the resources and technical savvy of how to make a movie are missing in this case but it's obvious that the filmmaker wants to tell an upbeat story about the joyfulness that Santa characterizes. That he was completely technically inept, that the spaceship looks made of tinfoil, that much of the acting would not be out of place at an elementary school Christmas play, and that the dialogue is wooden enough that it might be possible to carve a canoe out of it is all true. That said, I don't find this unlikable. It is what it is. It's not the vanity project of a completely unqualified singer (Glitter, Swept Away anyone?) or the cynical, calculating Hollywood film which doesn't care about its own cynicism or the intelligence of its potential viewers (Waterworld, just about anything Steven Seagal, Renny Harlin, or Van Damme have been involved in for the last 20 years).

As of April 2011, it is ranked number seventy-nine on the IMDb Bottom 100 with a 2.3 overall rating. It's such an odd little, creature of it's time, it's getting the \"wonderful\" honor of a remake. Completely unnecessary. There is pretty much no way this film could be made to be good.\n\nThe title alone mystifies me. At no point in the film does Santa Claus \"conquer\" anything. Martians are grim after watching Christmas specials on Earth depicting the jolly man St. Nick as a guy to bring happiness. They have no one like that on their planet. So the Martians summon an old man that tells them Mars is awful because there is no Santa Claus. So the Martians capture two earthlings that lead them to the \"real\" Santa Claus at the North Pole.\n\nHow the film is shot is another thing that is difficult to explain. It's 1960, color is quite popular in movies. Being only shot with $200,000 and having a name with \"Santa Claus\" in it probably means they wanted to use essence of color in the film. The color is dimmer than a 3D film. I can't tell what process was used. Obviously, Technicolor wasn't. With this, some scenes are in color, but it's so dim if the color isn't red or blue it's hard to see.\n\nSometimes, on frequent occasions, if something large in the movie is a bright color, like red, the color will spill onto other things around it. I know it's 1964, but color was around. This is lower budget, but if this was black and white it would look a lot less wonky and protruding.\n\nThe acting is unbelievably atrocious, but oh how I love it. There is a scene where the idiot martian Dropo (McCutcheon) is getting yelled at by the other martians for lazy. He runs away and \"accidently\" falls into various levers and is supposed to look like he fell into them. When he actually runs up to the levers, pulls four abruptly, and quickly grabs the other two he \"missed.\" The ship then rumbles uncontrollably. Absolutely, unintentionally scene that was an unexpected delight.\n\nWatching this with a friend was fun because we would talk back to the screen, ask the TV questions, and so on. Nothing is more fun than asking a movie why, what, and how questions that you genuinely want to know. It's like The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\n\nSanta Claus Conquers the Martians is known for it's public domain status in the United States. Public domain is where a film is open to the public and has no copyright on it in any form. Ever see those fifty movie packs in theaters that have fifty films from a specific genre? Like horror, drama, \"box office gold,\" etc. Those are all public domain films. Even though I gave the film a low rating, it's most likely the best public domain film in its own right. Usually all of the films have bad acting, a lame storyline, and poor picture quality clearly diminishing from its frequent copying from one DVD to the next. Santa Claus has all of those qualities; and it's pretty much the strangest Christmas film to exist.\n\nStarring: John Call, Leonard Hicks, Vincent Beck, Bill McCutcheon, Victor Stiles, Donna Conforti, Chris Month, Pia Zadora, Leila Martin, and Charles Renn. Directed by: Nicholas Webster."

By making a low budget film out of it. And that's just what Joseph Levine thought when he released this film onto an unsuspecting Earth. Now I ask you, is this indeed the WORST film of all time? My opinion: NO. In my translation of the meaning \"bad film\" means \"unbearable, unwatchable and disposable.\" Not \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.\" This film is a landmark in the American motion picture industry. The makers of this film actually had the guts to create and release this film. Now that takes some serious talent! Let's not forget the actors either. Surprisingly the acting isn't nearly as bad as it's made out to be (people confuse the 'acting' with the 'plot.'). The children, the Martians and even Santa Claus make one heck of an impression on a shoe-string budget film like this (don't forget that weird professor Albert Einstein wannabe). Above all, clever a production design really create a fine sense of cheesiness. Now, how about a brand new DVD 'Special Cheesy Edition' of \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians?\"\n\n\"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is a rare and satisfying little gem of a film that broke, no, shattered all the rules of making a \"good and enjoyable\" movie. Now if only the bad films we get nowadays would be as bad as this one. Then they would actually be deemed \"enjoyable.\"\n\nI give \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" 5 frozen-stiff elves zapped by Voldar, out of 5.\n\nA true cinematic cult classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "This unflinchingly testament to the tensions of the Cold War represents a typically enterprising choice by Talking Pictures as their Christmas treat for the kiddies. Often reviled as one of the worst films ever made: for God's lighten up, it's for kids, who absolutely lapped it up!! It's all very pretty in colour and it boasts a charming song that later sold well as a single.\n\nSanta himself is portrayed as a genial old cove who smokes a pipe, and his Missus makes a rare screen appearance. The Martians wear probably the silliest outfits - with headdresses that make them look like insects - since the days of 'Flash Gordon' (although 'Lost in Space was soon to surpass it) and one the daftest-looking robots you're ever likely to see.\n\nThe Martians all have American accents, greet each by rubbing noses and seem to consist of just one family and a handful of henchmen. The po-faced delivery by most of the cast is rather at odds with the raucous score by Milton DeLugg, and the sets belong in the shabbier episodes of 'Star Trek'.\n\nIt's good to see both sides of the Iron Curtain united against a common foe. There's also a little bit of what passes for topical humour in that one of Santa's reindeer is called 'Nixon' and the head of America's space programme is called 'Werner von Green' and that one of the Martians is entranced by his introduction to the slinky spring. Although by far the least funny element is predictably the comedy relief."

In different movies, he's been put in jail, kissed by housewives, tried for lunacy, knocked off a roof by Tim Allen, and one time a guy tried to blow up the North Pole. This is the classic among them all, when Santa gets kidnapped by Martians. The Martian kids are depressed, you see, so the Martians abduct Santa to make their kids happy again.\n\nCampiness is to be expected in a kids' movie, but this movie soars far and beyond all expectations of cheesiness. Martians have poorly applied green makeup that doesn't cover all their faces. Also, they wear used helmets painted green with broken antennae attached, for some reason. The robot and the polar bear are two of the most absurd monsters, and the freeze ray doesn't work too well on actors who visibly move while \"frozen.\" There's one character meant to be comic relief, but he's hard to find, since everyone else hams it up as bad as he does. Cheap sets, probably left overs from a grade-school play. Nonsensical dialogue, plot holes, miscellaneous errors, the list goes on. This movie is also the source for a trivia question: Girmar (\"girl Martian,\" get it? lol) is played by whom in her first role?\n\nWith all its blunders and goofiness, I'll give the movie one thing--it maintains a cheerful approach at all times. It even awkwardly manages a message about kindness winning enemies over as friends. It's necessary to approach the movie as a joke, though. Taking it at face value will probably leave you bored. I suspect that the original target audience of children were probably bored, since the movie drags in several places. As a \"so-stupid-it's-funny\" movie, this one is a novelty in its stunning ineptitude."

The Martians are about to discover once they have Santa they may have bitten off more than they can chew.\n\nThis movie is directed by Nicholas Webster (Manbeast! Myth or Monster) and stars John Call (Young Man with Ideas), Vincent Beck (Firepower), Bill McCutcheon (Steel Magnolias) and Pia Zadora (Hairspray).\n\nThis is probably the worst attempt to create martians of all time. There are some funny lines here and there and Santa Claus and the children are well done and fun. The inside of the spaceships look cool though the shots of outer space...not so much. The polar bear and robot in this are hilarious.\n\nOverall, this is a very bad movie that can be a fun watch despite being poorly done. I would score this a 4/10 and recommend seeing it once."

Levine's Embassy Pictures, director Nicholas Webster later at the helm for another trip to the Red Planet, 1967's \"Mission Mars.\" When the Martian leader (Leonard Hicks) decides that his children need some jolly good cheer to snap them out of their doldrums he's advised to travel to Earth in search of a Yuletide figure in a red suit and white beard located at the North Pole, but with a Santa found on virtually every street corner he finds himself in a bind. Fortunately, two earth children direct the Martians to Santa's workshop, all three kidnapped to exile on the Red Planet. Vincent Beck is the lone Martian who opposes such pointless frivolity, yet without him there would be no story and little enough amusement as it is, despite the worst looking polar bear suit ever deigned to be captured on film. Too cheap and listless to be appreciated as an inept cult film and too dull to amuse even the youngest viewers, military stock footage dragging out the running time to 80 minutes (shooting lasted 10 days in Long Island's Michael Myerberg Studios, a former aircraft hangar, surviving kiddie matinees well into the 1970s, its director still earning a $6 residual every year at Christmastime). John Call does at least look the part of Santa Claus, though his laugh needed a bit of work, and the little Martian girl is played by 10 year old Pia Zadora, who first gained a certain measure of celebrity notoriety during the early 1980s."

        "review_detailed_main": "If a name like 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians' doesn't ring off \"worst movie ever\" warning bells in your head, I don't know what will. This is pure schlock, start to finish.\n\nThe plot? Well, the kids on Mars are raised in such a way as they reach the intellectual level of an adult when they are physically children. The current crop of kids are obsessed with 'Earth television', and the concept of Christmas. The solution to this? Well, some sneaky Martian adults kidnap Santa, and for no apparent reason, some kids from Earth, and take them all to Mars so the Martians can enjoy Christmas.\n\nDon't let the title fool you. At no point does Santa actually conquer any Martians. I'm guessing the title refers to his bringing good will to Mars. What a let down. I was hoping for some sort of war-mongering, bad-to-the-bone Santa that handed out whoop-arse instead of toys. I guess I'll have to make my own movie like that, but for now I still have this.\n\nDespite three paragraphs of negative comments, this is fairly enjoyable if you like the 'so bad that its funny' angle. The Martians don't come off as that mean, and Santa is pretty naive, a 'Jurassic Park' scientist kind of naive. The quality of the story defies description, and the special effects could be bettered by a blind chimpanzee. A drunk, blind chimpanzee. If I were an actual movie critic, I would be insulted by this and call it an abomination unto movie making. I wouldn't be surprised if a real critic had said that already, but those guys just can't have fun.\n\n1/10 - Check it if you're into B-movies. In fact, when I acquired a copy of this movie a year ago, it was 16th on IMDb's worst 100 movies. Unfortunately it has been bumped up to 27th, an insult to this fine example of awfulness."

I am of the generation that was reared on \"Astro-Boy\", \"Ultra-Man\", \"Space Giants\" and several Sinbad Movies as well as \"Jason and the Argonauts\" but this was just utterly stupid.\n\nIt's not that the \"idea\" was bad..Mars inhabitants (silly adult ones at that) kidnapping Santa..actually it took YEARS for the idea to be done correctly and with the right factors such as \"South Park\" did with a little parody on \"Black Hawk Down\" and several other factors. This was just so stupid. As a five year old child, I turned the channel on this tripe. The sets were cheap, they were painted green...all that was missing was Santa taking out a bottle of \"ThunderBird\" liquor holding it up to his lips and proclaiming \"Merry Christmas to all and to all, a good night\". Actually that would have been more entertaining.\n\nTake it from me, there is NOTHING nostalgic about seeing this film years later if you're of the generation that had to be put through this on TV like I was. Save your children, don't show them this unless you want to punish them.\n\nBut...Hmmm...come to think of it..making them watch this film is actually better punishment instead of putting them in a corner for a \"time out\"."

Through all the oddness, you can still sense a true \"Christmas spirit\" about it. Santa Claus Conquers The Martians combines a typical 50's-mid 60's B-movie obsession with UFOs with a typical TV Christmas movie feel. One of the things that sticks out about the movie for me was that it didn't portray the Martians as the usual \"evil, murderous aliens\" they usually were in B-movies of this time period (well, except for Voldar). Their desire to make their children happy is what leads them to kidnap Santa Claus. Santa seems more than willing to help out the Martians, even running the toy shop without complaining. All is well at the end for everybody- Santa and the earth children go home, the evil Voldar is humiliated and defeated, and Droppo is inaugurated as Mars' very own Santa Claus. Overall, a decidedly weird but ultimately enjoyable movie."

They are obsessed with the planet's television programs and don't want to do much of anything. In an attempt to get the kids peppy again, Kimar orders the kidnapping of Santa Claus (John Call), hoping that the jolly old toy maker will know how to cheer the children up again.

So some guys from Mars kidnap Santa (and two annoying kids) to bring joy and happiness to the Martian children. It works but they make it clear that Santa is going to stay in Mars...forever. Trust me--this plays even worse than it sounds!\n\nA now classic bad movie. I actually caught this on TV when I was about 6 or 7. Even at that young age I realized the film was HORRIBLE! But it was so badly done you can't stop watching. The basic plot itself is ridiculous--even for a kids movie. All the Martians are green (!!!) and wear stupid helmets. The two Earth kids are played by the two most annoying child actors you'll ever see. The special effects are hysterically bad. The Martian spaceship is obviously a toy and wait till you see the polar bear (very obviously a guy in a bad suit) and the robot bought out to kidnap Santa. When I first saw it I broke out laughing (remember--I was 7 and still found it stupid). The dialogue is terrible and--worst of all--there's a SONG called \"Hooray for Santy Claus\" that will have you wishing you were deaf!\n\nThe acting doesn't help. Leonard Hicks plays Kimar--a good Martian. He's not bad but (understandably) looks embarrassed by being in this. Vincent Beck plays Voldar--the evil Martian. He's pretty terrible. Victor Stiles and Donna Conforti play Billy and Betty--the Earth kids. Their acting is so bad it defies belief. John Call plays Santa and he's CONSTANTLY laughing! My guess is he was drunk or actually read the script! Worst of all (and that's saying something) is Bill McCutcheon playing Dropo--the \"comic\" relief. He spends most of the movie acting stupid and overacting. Needless to say none of it is even remotely funny! Also Pia Zadora has her first role here (as one of the Martian kids). So yeah, it's terrible but it IS harmless for kids--but even they'll find it stupid! A 1 all the way.\n\n\"We don't want to hurt you Santa Claus so come along quietly.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "This strong contender for the title of the \"All-Time Worst Movie\" is, typically, not as painful to watch as it has been played up to be over the years; having just watched its earlier Mexican counterpart SANTA CLAUS (1959) which I recently acquired in tandem, it was a given that I was going to get to this one too before this year was out. Anyway, the plot calls for Martian children to be 'hypnotized' by earthly TV channels and getting particularly depressed at Christmas-time because, unlike their fellow earthlings, they have no Santa Claus\u0085so, the head honcho of the Red Planet (a Michael Gough-look-a-like) decides to kidnap St. Nick (constantly letting off belly-laughs, as played by John Call) to cheer up his kids! Predictably, this plan is opposed by a trio of bumbling villains (led by a heavily-whiskered loser) who sabotage Santa's mechanical Martian toy factory and, eventually, capture the wrong Father Christmas (since, inevitably, the planet's leading comic relief \u2013 a would-be amiable idiot \u2013 dons on the red cloak to try out for the role which is vacated once Santa \u2013 and two earthly kids who were abducted with him \u2013 are transported back to their world). There is not much that I can add except to say that a credited but unrecognizable Pia Zadora apparently plays one of the Martians; while the film is, relatively speaking, livelier than the afore-mentioned SANTA CLAUS, the latter displays a more florid imagination; the odd Martian attire seems to be an amusing precursor to the much-later one worn by the dreaded Teletubbies; and, best of all, the children's ditty \"Hooray For Santy Claus\" proves to be an awfully catchy tune!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Santa Claus Conquers The Martians\" is one of the most popular bad movies ever made. One earlier comment here, defending the film, noted this popularity and said, in effect, \"If it's so bad, how come people are still watching it 40 years later?\"\n\nGood question. I think it begs another question: Is it possible to make a film so bad it actually becomes good?\n\nNot if this is any proof. SCCTM is just bad. Really bad. Bad sets, bad acting, bad direction, bad music, bad costumes (or \"custumes\" as the credits read), bad everything.\n\nThe idea of the story holds some goofy promise. On the planet Mars, children are sad, and in order to cheer them up, their caring Martian parents kidnap Santa from Earth. Santa arrives, bringing Christmas cheer along with a couple of Earth kids who help show their Martian counterparts how to have a good time. Naturally, there's one Martian who doesn't think all this merry making is so great (it's turning his people into \"Martian-mellows\"), so he sets out to stop it.\n\nFine. You know what kind of picture this is. Questions of astrophysical relativity and the available military response to Martian encroachment are really out-of-place. This is a film to watch with a five-year-old, toddlers even, and get whatever enjoyment you can through them. Children's films can be good, great even, when they are served up with the right amount of humor, care, and passion, like any other film.\n\nBut the film fails so miserably that you just cringe at the idea of an audience of any age sitting through it. The broad overacting of Dropo (Bill McCutcheon did forge a decent acting career after this, including a Tony and a memorable role in the under-appreciated \"Mr. Destiny\") sets a low bar the other players limbo right along after. Even Voldar's wacky assistants ham it up, pulling faces in every scene no matter who's speaking like they need Ritalin. I don't know if the actor playing Santa was drunk while making this movie, as some posters here say. I can only hope so.\n\nThere's unintentional comedy abounding, like the \"bear\" that sniffs out Billy and Betty near the North Pole and Kimar (Leonard Hicks must be Martian-speak for the word \"stiff\") stepping on one of the children actors' lines. Normally it's not nice to make fun of bad acting by children, but even if these kids hadn't grown up long ago, it would seem necessary to make an exception. They clearly didn't belong in front of a camera. What's that you say, there's a famous future actor in the bunch? Oh, yeah, Elliott Gould as Voldar, right. I spotted him right away. Actually, the only kid who even could read lines was Billy, and his monotone delivery is pretty much the gold standard for the tykes and adults alike.\n\nI watched the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" version of this movie, and I laughed and had fun. I always wanted to see this film, especially in December, and MST3K was the way to go. But I really, really mostly just wanted the movie to end. I felt sorry for these poor people on screen, left adrift by their producer, writer, and director, trying to be entertaining and just embarrassing themselves. I thought of all the ways the creators could have freshened up the story, thrown in some genuine interaction between the Martian kids and the Earth children, that might get a young viewer to care. Finally, I tried to enjoy it as a kitchy spectacle, but when the film doesn't care enough to take itself seriously, the point is lost.\n\nLike Huey Lewis said, sometimes bad is bad. SCCTM is awful."

The plot is utterly ridiculous, the dialog has as much depth to it as puddle and the characters are as well rounded as a piece of cardboard. Speaking of cardboard, part of the sets look very much like painted cardboard and the costumes hold are on the same level, it' only he stock footage of the air-force that holds any kind of quality. My guess is that this was a low budget film quickly put together without much thought for anything. With that in mind, it's amazing that it doesn't do worse because all in all, Santa's constant mirth is the only annoying thing about this movie, the rest is just dull which is a lesser crime than right out bad."

The Martian costumes are the worst I ever seen almost camp for words. I don't know how the cast did this film without cracking up. Except for Pia Zadora, I don't know anybody in the cast. The Martian costume is more funny than terrifying like a Saturday Night Live sketch. This film was done before we knew Mars was uninhabitable and before USA went into space. The kid actors are fine but still this film is perhaps one of the worst films ever made and perhaps the worst Christmas film of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is possible to get a high quality version of this, on DVD, though the one I got(cheap, don't worry) had no features, apart from a chapter selection. This basically only works as a \"so bad it's good\" kind of thing. How does it suck, you ask? Let me count thee ways: The colors and lighting are hideous and straining. It's soaked to the bone in sweetness, and so thoroughly and consistently ridiculous that there is a genuine chance of viewers getting diabetes and ending up stark raving mad from witnessing this. Almost all of the \"humor\" is painful. I'm not entirely sure how many of the attempts at putting a set-up and a punchline together I would go so far as to actually call \"jokes\". Gags almost invariably crash and burn. A little bit of the slapstick is perhaps not completely hopeless. The majority of the laughs this garners are unintentional. Once this realizes that it might hold the potential to make a point, it continues to mercilessly beat the audience over the head with it, until, presumably, the writers forgot about it. No, I honestly would not expect much from anyone who, during the Cold War, would take the words \"nuclear\" and \"curtain\", and put them together to mean something harmful of great power, in the script for a *family movie*. This can only be appreciated as anything \"serious\" by children, and the kids would still need to be of limited and/or impaired mental capacity. The acting is nonexistent. The pacing is decent. The developments are utterly unimaginative and predictable. The plot details how Santa, here portrayed as a gullible moron who couldn't get himself out of even the tiniest trouble unless inactivity was enough to accomplish that, is abducted by Martians, for the benefit of their offspring, who have clearly learned how to e-nun-ci-ate. The MST3K of this does hold hilarity, but it's not their best. There is no sex, violence or language. I recommend this to fans of B-rate flicks and all who enjoy their sides splitting at the things the creators of this did not mean to be funny. Now, can someone tell me how to treat the reek of cheese this left? 1/10"

It is NOT a horror film, but it has the same science fiction feel as \"Plan 9,\" and the music is the crowning glory of the amusing dreadfulness of this 80-minute foray into \"what were they thinking?\" So, don't show this to your kids as part of your cycle of Christmas flicks (though they may get the joke as well).

Early on in the MST version, when the unctuous TV newscaster bursts into Santa's workshop and Tom Servo enthusiastically intones, \"Get the hell out of my shop!!\", we know we're in good hands.\n\nNew Yorkers and theater buffs get an extra bonus: Wretched as the film is, it was filmed in a studio on Long Island and is rich in New York theater talent. Bill McCutcheon (Droppo) later won a Tony for the \"Anything Goes\" revival. Leila Martin has been with \"The Phantom of the Opera\" since it opened.

Martian kids apparently live in a regimented society with no fun and they watch earth television to see how the other planet lives. After consulting with an 800 year old and I presume those are Martian years oracle it's decided they need a little Christmas on Mars. What to do, but capture Santa Claus and the leader goes to earth to get him. He also picks up a couple of stray earth stowaways as well.\n\nHe faces some opposition of course, but the spirit of Christmas and Santa Claus prevails.\n\nThe only name worth mentioning in the cast is a young Pia Zadora who made her debut in this ghastly film as a Martian kid.

As soon as i read that, i knew I had to see it. J They are not wrong... it was terrible! The story is about the aliens on Mars. Their kids are unhappy, but the Martian parents don't know why. But they have been watching \"Human TV\" and they think that Santa Claus will cheer them up. So they jump in their rocket ship and travel to Earth to kidnap Santa to cheer up their children. To find Santa they ask a couple of kids where he lives, so they kidnap the children too. Santa now has to try and escape Mars and get back to Earth with the 2 kidnapped children. The acting was so bad that they might as well have been reading off of cards. The only actor that seemed to make an effort was the guy playing Santa... The effects were really really bad... the rocket ships that were flying through space looked like toilet rolls painted and put up on strings. I felt like I was watching Button Moon. There were some entertaining bits in the movie, but only because they were so bad that they made me laugh. The costumes were bad... the Martians clearly were just fellas dressed in tight green Lycra with a tube stuck to their heads. There was a couple of fight scenes in the film too, it seems they didn't even try to hit each other. The fists were heading towards their opponents face and then you saw them just push them away with the fist! I am seeing why this would be one of the worst films made, but i will be honest... it was that bad that it did entertain me. I will give it a generous 3 out of 10. Yet, it is still not the worst film I have ever seen!"

If you were a fan of this film when you were young, re-watch it alone before subjecting your children to it so you can remember just how 'good' it was. Unless of course, you wish to cause them pain and regret spending time with you. I suggest if you are a divorced parent, you choose one of the Rankin holiday animated classics if you want something that hearkens back to your childhood."

What I love is that there is no attempt to cover up, change, or otherwise improve the *pop* made by the air-blaster \"Freeze-rays\" used by the martians. And the very nonchalant way the martians fire them, sort of half pointing at the ground. The martians keep their prisoners terrified by their weapons, but then explain \"Oh don't worry, it wears off in a little while.\" I just wish I had the martian space ship console! This movie deserves to be watched several times to uncover the layers of badness. Thank goodness Target had it in the one dollar bin! I was able to get copies for everyone for Christmas! This is what the Sci Fi channel should be broadcasting, instead of that Wrestling Darrick."

It's so bad is comical.\n\nSome of the props are just so terrible it makes you fall out of your chair laughing. To name a few: the man in the polar bear suit, the robot, and the ship which mysteriously changes shapes:one when it is flying through space, and one when it is landed.\n\nAll in all I would suggest watching this movie because everyone should see it once, if only to laugh at it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everybody's heard of movies so bad they're good. In the case of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, I would like to nominate it as the first film that's so bad it's utterly hilarious.\n\nStarring a group of nobodies and a young girl who should've remained a nobody (Pia Zandora), the film battles with a low budget and poor acting all throughout. The story is actually relatively original for a movie of this budget: Martian children are growing bored and listless, causing the adults on Mars to kidnap Santa Claus to try and alleviate this condition.\n\nBeyond the story, most of the rest of the movie is too funny for words. Santa acts like a drunkard, the Martians use a freeze ray on some of our heroes (that doesn't work as the actors don't know how to stand still), a man in an extremely fake bear suit chases two Earth children (who act so poorly that I can hardly believe they're actually children), a robot is made out of cardboard boxes and dryer tubes, and so on, and so forth.\n\nDespite the film's obvious low quality, I think everybody should watch it at least once. The film is so full of unintentional humor that it makes it well worth the small investment. (I've heard there is also a Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this episode, but I've yet to watch it. I'm sure it's quite hilarious, though.)"

        "review_title": "A new contender for worst movie ever",
        "review_detailed_main": "This review is not concerned with the plot or details of this film, rather the aim is to explain why it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. If you're looking for plot details, skip this review.\n\nI am a fan of films; I've seen the AFI top 100, and the IMDb top 125 to name a few. I've watched numerous forgettable films. As a result of my film watching experience, I've determined some criteria for what makes a film truly awful. I am most displeased to announce this movie meets all criteria with resounding success, and may in fact have displaced Ironheart as the worst movie ever.\n\n1. A terrible film should start off with some promise (to raise your expectations against your will), and then quickly and progressively get worse. This film does this wonderfully. As I recall, the first 2 minutes are the best scenes of the film, and look like the movie will score a solid 4 or 5 out of 10. Shortly thereafter, absolute drivel is introduced, and the plot and script spiral into ineptitude with absolute finesse.\n\n2. All the actors are relatively talentless, and of the same caliber. This is necessary, to avoid an actors performance standing out, as good or bad. A good or bad performance can give the viewer a focus for the intense dislike of the film. I'm proud to say, I can't remember anything of the acting at all, except for the first 2 minutes, in which Santa Claus gives a reasonable mediocre performance from his workshop.\n\n3. Most miserable movies tend to fail by accidentally including some scene that results in laughter. Those that do it too much can become enjoyable cult classics, such as Barbarella, or The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This film sadistically and unfailingly pounds the viewer with scene after scene of insipid drivel.\n\n4. An awful film should have an inconsistent plot for the obvious reason that it makes it difficult to follow what's going on. I think the film had a relatively consistent plot, and stuck to it. However, it succeeded here on a new level beyond my wildest imagining. It's clear from the first moment this film starts that it's intended audience is children, or soon to be dysfunctional families. Typical with such films, there is a moral message, and this movie is no exception. I'm delighted to discover I've managed to burn it out of my brain, but I'm sure it was along the lines of be nice and get along, share stuff and don't kidnap people. The point is, as I'm watching this insipid driveling film, minute after minute, I am forced to think of these young kids watching this film, and unwittingly having their innocent minds twisted by this mess. By sticking to the plot, the makers of this film forced me to continue my nightmare visions of mental torture of children. In this film, sticking to the plot made it worse, and thus a more successfully bad movie.\n\n5. The most important criteria from any film, good or bad, is to elicit an emotional response from the viewer. Boredom doesn't count. What I look for in a miserable film are feelings of anger, sadness, or revenge. As with Ironheart, it was a struggle to continue watching this movie. I was angry with the producers of this film, and everyone else involved in the project, including those responsible for it's digitization, so that it's evil could continue to spread. As with Ironheart, I wanted to destroy this film before it was complete. I was deeply saddened by the loss of 90 minutes of my life spent on this drivel. Finally, I wanted to get revenge on everyone involved in the project by subjecting them to repeated watchings of this movie. What surprised and impressed me most about this film, is that I wanted to destroy it much earlier into the film than I did with Ironheart. I think it was about 45 minutes for this one, and about 60 for Ironheart.\n\n6. It should go without saying, but a terrible movie should have no redeeming features at all. Clearly this movie fails in that regard, since it eventually ends. However, the makers save the best for last; a horrible song, with words that appear on the screen so the kids can sing along. I'll never be able to forget \"Hooray for Santy Claus.\" Yes, Santy Claus. Ugh...\n\nThis movie easily scores 0 out of 10, a tie with only one other film - Ironheart. I strongly recommend that no experienced, thinking individual watch it."

Briefly, Martian children don't know how to have fun, but they watch Earth TV constantly and hence know about Santa Claus. The Martians decide they need Santa there to teach their kids how to laugh and be happy, so rather than just go ASK the big guy for help, they decide to kidnap him. Santa takes it all in stride and endears himself to everybody he meets except the bad guy Voldar. Two earth kids get taken to Mars with Santa, and hilarity ensues. The sets, the props, the acting, the lines - you name it, it screams \"low budget,\" but it's done in such a way that you realize everybody KNOWS we're on a low budget so just go with it and laugh yourself sick. Watch it on its own or with the MST3K commentary, and if you don't try to see it as a \"real\" movie, you'll have a ball."

Martians know that he is the most popular figure during the holiday season and he will surely entertain Martian kids if they bring him back. There are good Martians that simply want to kidnap a person to see if he can help them out, there are evil Martians that want to sabotage the entire plan, and then there are goofy Martians that can't do a thing right. Finally, there are bratty Earth kids that want to save Santa. All in all, a clever satire of today's society that's way ahead of its time. No... wait... that's another movie.\n\nI saw this on MST3K and found it to be one of the funniest episodes ever. The characters are extremely annoying, their costumes are ridiculous, and the settings are cheap and pathetic. Mothers, don't expect this to be a silly family flick that your kids can enjoy. NO! This is garbage! However, it contains one positive element. Unlike \"Manos, the Hands of Fate\" (another awful awful movie), \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is not seriously bad, but rather comically bad. The MST3K version is extremely funny and could satisfy all those with a sense of humor on a relaxing or boring day. One of my favorite moments occurs when the two Earth kids are being chased by a man... in a bear costume. For its ridiculousness, this film gets an extra point. Overall, a 2 out of 10."

They have what looks like a vacuum hose on their heads for no apparent reason. They also have coat hanger antenna that the earth children think makes them look like televisions. The two earthling children are really obnoxious. They can always get away from the Martians, but they always seem to get caught. There were at least 2 elements of the script that were never resolved. Why didn't the martians retrieve their robot from earth if they didn't want to be discovered? and Whatever happened to the Rockets Earth sent up after the Martians?

Also the title really doesn't describe the plot. It's more about Santa befriending the Martians rather than conquering them.\n\nMartian parents are very annoyed that their kids are watching too many Earth programs on the TV. That somehow leads them to capturing two Earth kids and Santa Clause to suck the joy out of life, but Santa uses his charm to become friends with most of the Martians, but the few that still hate him plot against him.\n\nNone of the actors, including the man who plays Santa Clause are likable and they all do a pretty bad job. The special effects are better than I expected, but they are still really bad... a guy in a bear costume and a really strange looking cardboard robot. The climax of the film is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen, and any mildly positive thing goes away here. But even with all of it's continuity errors, terrible acting and pure strangeness, it's still better than other bad Christmas movies, such as \"Santa Claus\" (1959).\n\nMy rating: 1/2 out of ****. 83 mins."

Even so, there is a campy creativity at work here that saves the film from being the worst ever, or even worst Santa movie ever (that distinction being firmly reserved for Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny).\n\nWith gaggles of martians bumbling around like Marx Brothers, Martian June Cleavers producing Chocolate Layer Cake Pills as special family treats, a Mrs Claus blushing that \"Television\" has come to her house, a set of pipe-smoking toy-making Little People as elves, and Pia Zadora as child of the red planet, there is enough to keep your brain in question mode for a long time.\n\nDon't ask questions.

The film never does a very good job of explaining why they really need to get Santa so badly, but it takes surprisingly little effort for a small number of earthling heroes to rescue Santa from the Martians so that Christmas can be saved. The acting, particularly by the Martians, is really awful. This movie is better watched and enjoyed as an episode of Mystery Science Theatre. You won't find many worse movies than this, and as an added bonus you can see Pia Zadora in it!"

I do feel the actor who played Santa Claus looked very good, one of the best looking ones iv ever seen.

        "review_detailed_main": "For those MST3K fans out there, \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is undoubtedly a movie you've heard of. For those not so familiar, the basic plot is Martians kidnap Santa to bring happiness to Mars. Sounds pretty bad doesn't it? While it isn't the worst movie ever made, it's easily the worst holiday movie ever made. I simply can't believe how bad it is.\n\nThe worst example of the vomit inducing dialogue includes a scene where Santa forgets the name of his reindeer and calls one of them \"Nixon\". Are you cringing yet? This movie also has some of the worst special effects I've seen, which brings to mind \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\". This movie has a crappy robot and a crappy polar bear. I'm truly scared of these moments not because of their effectiveness, but because of the utter incompetence of the costume department in the film.\n\nStill, despite it's horridness, it's still worth watching. It's in the public domain, so a quick look on Google, Yahoo, etc. will easily result in a few places to download the movie. I must say, Edward Wood would be proud of this film."

But there is one villainous Martian who thinks Santa is nothing but a troublesome fat man in a red suit, and tries to put a stop to him. A bad film to be sure, but I must confess I found the title song \"Hooray for Santa Claus\" fun in a definitely offbeat sort of way. * out of ****"

OK, so the film itself may have some problems with performances, continuity, etc., but the bottom line is that it is made for CHILDREN. And as a child, I thoroughly enjoyed it; so much so, that I still remember it fondly today some 20 years later! Some reviewers may have issues with this film when compared with the technology in films today, but one must keep in mind when this film was made. It was the early 60's, the space race was at it's height and USA had yet to make it to the moon! Misconceptions may abound in the plot, but they were pretty common in the 60s/70s. I love Star Wars although there is a world of difference between the original film and Episode III, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable (although my daughter thinks Star Wars is boring and old fashioned...gasp).\n\nAlthough the film may not be worthy of top honors, it certainly does not belong in the bottom of the heap with the likes of Gigli, Glitter or Crossroads (which I believe has a better rating...WHAT?!?).\n\nMaybe this would be a classic today if it was animagic (like Mad Monster Party) instead of with actors, but I still recommend children see it at least once in their lives."

I can't find any definitive proof but I'm pretty sure this was made for TV.There are little breaks,it's 81 minutes and not rated and it's just very poorly made.All made for TV trademarks. The best part of the movie is Pia Zadora(who???) in the role of a lifetime as Girmar,the emotionless Martian child. So the Martians are advanced enough that they receive earth(American) TV and they understand and speak English. Yet they are dumb enough to think Santa Claus is what their planet needs. There's lots of terrible acting and plot holes. The Martians abduct Santa at gunpoint(the guns are hilarious and they never shoot anything),they also take 2 children so they won't be able to tell anyone what happened to Santa.Two seconds after they leave earth,the entire world knows Martians did it. They use stock US military footage for the space force that goes after the Martians,you know...the United States Space Force....... There are a couple Batman-esque \"Bang,Pow\" fights to counter the rambling dialogues.It's not enough to save the movie but it's something. There are apparently about 9 people on Mars,yet when one puts on Santa's spare costume,half of them think he really is Santa. The abducted children never cry or complain or ask for their mommy or to go home.They also quickly memorize all the Martians names,an amazing feat. Santa is happy and making really bad jokes the whole time and the name is a total lie.Santa Claus does nothing but make toys.At one point,the kids shoot bubbles at one Martian but that's it. At the end he just says goodbye and they leave. If you love terrible movies,you must see this. If you value your time, you shouldn't have even read this review."

Yes, but this film is a comedy and nothing but.\n\nThe obviously bad acting, obviously fake effects and props, the ridiculous plot: all are evidence of an intentional parody.\n\nLooking at this movie from the perspective that it is a Sci-fi movie, it's an atrociously bad movie. Looking at it from a perspective that it is a comedy movie, it's brilliant.\n\nThe directors intentionally made every mistake possible while making the movie, used as low of a budget as possible, and basically did everything to make it so bad, it's funny.\n\nCinematic Titanic recently made a rather funny parody of this movie, but this movie was nothing but a hilarious comedy at the start.\n\nIt's brilliantly terrible, horribly funny."

Even with MST3K protection, I was looking around for sharp objects after enduring the unspeakably horrendous title credits.

The raw pain that eminates from this mess is indescribable, but it will suffice to say that if you dare watch this visual poison, you should pound a pitcher before doing so."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"What's Christmas?\" asks a man with weird paint on his face and a cross between a large tea cup and a flower pot on his head. Well, he's a Martian and over there Santa Claus doesn't exist. This depresses their kids (including Pia Zadora) so much that the Martians decide to kidnap the little fat man in a red coat. Being much more intelligent than people from planet Earth, they kidnap some kids first to tell them where Santa can be found. \"What's that on your head?\" asks the girl. \"An antenna\", replies the Martian. Then the girl asks: \"Are you a television set?\" This aggravates the Martian version of Grumpy, who thinks television and Santa Claus turn the kids into nincompoops.\n\nAnne Robinson (the cruel host from The Weakest Link) once said she hated children's tv because the presenters always shouted and treat the kids like morons. The same can be said for this movie. It's not because it's a movie for kids that it can get away with a stupid plot. A movie where children's footprints are only noticed after the Martians discovered the children have escaped. A movie where Mrs. Claus is portrayed as a brainless plant. A movie where the dwarfs are paralyzed by the Martian's guns (it's a pity the actors can't stand still). A movie where Santa Claus is kidnapped by Martians. And a movie where, due to financial restrictions, the part of the polar bear is played by a man in a suit. Need I say more? Yes, I might end with a joke from the movie: what's green, sticky and roasted over a fire? A martianmellow. I think that says it all. \"Oh dear, oh dear.\""

        "review_title": "what's worst about this infamous clunk o' junk is not the acting or the special effects or even the lack of continuity, but the harrowing impression that nobody is even trying",
        "review_detailed_main": "Allow me to state a firm, sincere opinion of mine right off the bat. \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is one of the all-time worst, most depressing, inexcusably amateurish and unendurable movies ever made. Even at a brief clocking time of eighty-one minutes, watching it feels like eighty-one days. I seldom use the word 'hated' when discussing movies (even bad ones) but I have to here. Because on my list of the five movies I would never, ever want to see again, this ranks at #4. There is not one - not *one* - redeeming element about this clunk o' junk. Everything in it is miserable. But what's most depressingly bad about it is not the directing, the acting, the writing, the amateurish cinematography, or the special effects that are dwarfed in conviction by the amateur monster costumes I saw at the G-Fest this year. What's most terrible about this movie is the harrowing impression that nobody is even trying.\n\nFor those who care, it is a children's' movie. During the other-world month of Septober, the children of Mars (or at least the present-day children of Mars) become increasingly depressed due to a lack of toys and fun and games. So one day, the king of Mars (and father of the only two Martian children I saw) decides to kidnap Santa Claus and have him manufacture toys for his children. With some goons, he kidnaps Santa and two Earth children around Christmastime and bring them to Mars. But, oh no, there's a mean old Martian with a mustache who doesn't want Santa making Martian children toys. And then...and then...\n\nAh, who cares? What a stultification-inducing plot. And believe me, the story is even lousier. But let's shove all of that aside. Let's just pretend we live in an alternate reality universe where movies don't need plots or stories or good writing or acting or directing to be good. Let's just judge it on bad movie standards. Oh, no, it fails on that level too. The movie would like to be a funny, charming, low-key little gem but instead comes off as a shameful catastrophe. I suppose somebody once conceived it might work, but nobody even bothered to try. There are moments that by themselves may induce laughs, but when seen with the rest of the movie just force your eyes toward your watch. The movie opens up with one of the worst, most annoying songs I've ever heard as the titles (with many spelling errors such as \"custume designer\" as Crow pointed out) scroll with horrible animation. Following this is just one headache-inducing moment after another, including an outrageously bad scene with a polar bear, which is the worst monster costume until \"Hercules in New York.\" And would-be laughs with a goofy Martian bumbler just make one click the 'mute' button or hope for some violence to eliminate an annoying character.\n\nNobody was even trying with this awful movie. There's a critical moment after the point where Santa is kidnapped, and then the movie flat-up forgets all about it. It's a scene that takes up a great deal of time and then without any explanation stops. It seems as if the screenwriter wrote the story on paper towels and used one to wipe his lips after supper. Or is it possible that instead of a screenplay, they just made this up as they went along? Heck, the sets are so cheap and the actors so deprived of enthusiasm, they could afford to.\n\nThere was not a single, insignificant moment of \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" that I enjoyed. The entire thing from start to finish is a complete headache and a mind-numbing bore. It isn't quite the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is on the runner-up list and not too far behind. Very few movies have sunk so low. The most shameful thing about is that nobody is even trying. With most bad movies, there is the relieving element that at least *somebody* in the cast or crew was putting up an effort. But nobody was here. The only reason why people watch this movie is to a) see a young Pia Zadora as the Martian girl and b) to test its reputation, as I did. It is a movie that must be seen to be believed. But I implore you to take my word for it. Oh, and incidentally, the movie is called \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.\" Well, at what point, exactly, did Santa Claus conquer the Martians? See? Even the title makes no sense."

Yes, yes, I know some people tend to over-dramatize the extent of their hatred for something, but I assure you, I joke not. This is excrement in its purest form. I have no doubt in my mind that the next time I have to use a toilet, a DVD with \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" on the cover, will plop into the ivory bowl. Did it even have a budget(i.e. man in god-awful polar bear costume)? Aside from the alien mother(who I found to be rather intoxicating for an early 60's film) the other actors seemed to be as clueless as I was about what the hell was going on. I was bored. You'll be bored, too.\n\nI don't know what drugs good ole' Santy Claus was taking when he made this movie, but he could not have looked, or sounded, any more tanked than Colin Farrel at happy hour. They must have told the fat, red man that a mountain of weed would be waiting for him at the end of shooting this garbage.\n\nYou know how there are some movies that are funny and others are just plain stupid? This one belongs in the category of the latter. I literally felt embarrassed for all the actors, especially the children. These poor young lads and lasses would no doubt have killed their film careers by even being mentioned in the opening credits.\n\nWhen the film finally did end (a time period that seemed to span somewhere in the proximity 50 or more years) I promised myself that I would never subject myself to any movie that had the combination of \"Santa Claus\" or \"Martian\" in the film's title. Thank the lord, Jesus H. Christ, I didn't waste any of my money renting this worthless excuse for a film (and I use that term loosely). Do NOT rent this film. Buy a new hat or something."

It's very evident that most people in these comments don't understand how perfect this movie was for the pre-ten year old set in 1964. As another commenter noted, it has Santa, it has Martians, it has elves and magic.\n\nI love the rich color of the movie, and Santa is the best, especially his first scene, being interviewed by the news reporter. This is all a great trip back in time, like to a forgotten old story book. The acting is fine, though I don't think it's an issue unless the kids are absent mindedly looking into the camera when they shouldn't.\n\nGreat hokum. It reminds me of some of the early BAD Hannah-Barbara cartoons and various early 60's surf board movies but I don't mind at all. This is a great artifact of the early Television age (1964).\n\nEnjoy, and don't let the nay-sayers put you off."

Luckily the two Earth kids the Martians also kidnap are not as naive.\n\nNear the beginning, a Martian elder outlines the problem with the latest generation of Martian children and suggests they need a Santa Claus. So the Martians decide to bring Santa to Mars. Once they reach Earth, cover your ears lest the stupid sounding technical dialogue leave you nauseated, but watch for the robot. No other set of cardboard boxes painted gray has ever looked so good.\n\nSanta doesn't get alarmed until a Martian tells him they plan to keep him on Mars. This leads to a toy battle reminiscent of Babes in Toyland. :-)\n\nIt's silly and certainly not for everyone ... and you'll have to be in the mood ... but there are some real laughs in this thing."

I don't know whether it was because of all the food I had consumed throughout the day or just pure boredom but for some reason, I sat down with my father and viewed this hysterical holiday film. First you have the martians, grown men in bright green makeup and funny hats. Their names are so ridiculous that you cannot even remember who is who. These martians are frightened that their children are becoming boring (probably because they are fed math problems and equations through their tentacles all day long) so they ask an 800 year old swamp creature who looks like a cross between Yoda and Planet of the Apes what to do. He tells them to kidnap Santa Claus!!! At this point, I should have walked out on the movie but I continued due to ridiculous curiosity. Basically, the Martians make a trip to earth in a space ship that looks like a Bic lighter and kidnap two innocent children from a park. Along with the Children they head to the north pole. The children escape at the pole and attempt to warn Santa of the Martian plans but are stopped short by a polar bear that looks like the Snuggle bear from those laundry commercials and a robot who looks like corrogated cardboard and crushes things. The rest of the idiotic movie is Santa building a martian northpole on mars and giving \"Dropo the drunken martian\" the position of Martian Saint Nick. Then, Santa and the children head back to earth just in time for Christmas eve. After viewing this insane film and laughing hysterically throughout, I had to review it and warn the public. Do not view \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\"!!! It is without a doubt one of the single dumbest movies I have ever seen."

I don't know who are what is more annoying, the kids, the Martians, Santa Claus, or that guy in that polar bear suit. More annoying is when suddenly burst into laughs, often without an apparent reason, to probably make the movie more cheerful and comical to watch.\n\nFor a Christmas movie it also surely isn't cheerful enough. Instead its actually rather depressing. It has absolutely no Christmas spirit in it and the atmosphere is just totally wrong for this production. It's hard to say what they tried to achieve with this movie. Make a joyful season Christmas movie targeted at children or was it an attempt at making a more 'serious' science-fiction meets Santa Claus crossover, aimed toward an older audience.\n\nOf course the movie also uses tons of archive footage of rockets being blast off and also some more random footage of airplanes refueling in the air and world leader gatherings, to 'discuss the startling sudden disappearance of Santa Claus'.\n\nIt's '60's science-fiction, so it features all of the usual stupid and silly looking ingredients. Next to lots of archive footage, this means that the movie also has fake looking 'futuristic' sets, awful costumes and make-up for the Martians and just also general bad fake looking sets and costumes for the robot and the earlier mentioned polar bear.\n\nDon't, under any circumstances, ever watch this movie!\n\n1/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "There's not a thing that the filmmakers behind Santa Claus Conquers the Martians gets right, but right from the beginning their premise is so preposterous I'm not sure it could have even if it had been helmed by Richard Fleischer on a good day. This is about how martians - who we know are martians because of their awful, vomit-green paint on their faces and helmets that were bought at 1964's equivalent of Party City, despite them not coming from a red planet (for the brief seconds we see Mars it looks more like some green orb with some varying shades of things, I can't describe it at all for the life of me) - see that their martian children are too obsessed with the TV and a news reporter interview with Santa up at the North Pole. This leads them to come to Earth, they end up kidnapping two hapless kids first, and then use a robot (which doesn't do much) to kidnap Santa Claus so they can... do WHAT, exactly?\n\nMaybe the filmmakers thought they were going to make a sweet and dopey little children's movie, but what they got instead is alternatingly obnoxious and kind of insane in how the editing goes, not to mention the casting of John Call as a Claus who may just be TOO close to how kids picture Santa so that he becomes nightmare fuel instead. There's one particular martian named Dropo (Bill McCutcheon) who seems to be the biological father of Rob Schneider as far as being the kind of comic relief one wants to punch repeatedly to make him shut his face. There's also a couple of nefarious martians - one of which a Bryan Cranston stand-in and another who has a mustache halfway to Connery's hairy appendage in Zardoz and Daniel Plainview - who are so uptight that their performances can't help but be laughable.\n\nI think it's advisable to go the MST3K and/or Rifftrax route for this one, but I would be curious to some day watch it without the addition of the commentary. It's so bad that it's mesmerizing at certain times, from the stultifying acting and extremely cheap sets (at one point, and this is when they're still on the ship I think, the martians put a couple of the kids in what looks like a broom closet, no mock-up done to it at all), and how it's all done with a completely straight face. It's almost excusable how one note the child actors are (if they even are actors, I think a couple of parents lost their children at the bus stop and they were plugged in to this for a week or two), but what undoes any even shred of good-will is that its Santa does the same \"conquering\" in scene after scene: he will make the martians LAUGH until they're uh still green in the face.\n\nThis all leads up to a climax where one of the martians is defeated by, you guessed it(?) Santa using his dark arts to use the toys to attack him with their cuteness and toy-ish ways. The way the editing, in a montage style that I'm sure (no, I'm not) was lifted from the Eisenstein cookbook, cuts back to a laughing Santa Claus during this makes it look like he could be a serial killer instead of jolly ol' St. Nick. From the consistently terrible dialog, an occasional appearance by a newsman that looks like a marionette, and the first screen appearance by, uh, Pia Zadora(!) this is a complete mess, but a lot of fun.\n\n(PS: In full disclosure I did watch this with Rifftrax Live, and it made for a spectacular experience)"

The set up has Martians from mars with green paint on their faces, questioning why their own children look so unhappy, so they devise a plan to kidnap Santa Claus from the planet earth. And by the time they get to earth, they bump into a couple of kids and informed them that the real Santa lives in the North Pole which is exactly where they went taking along with them are the two children, since they had just found out their real intentions and don't like the idea of the real Santa being kidnapped. The two kids unsuccessfully did make attempts to warn him, but was later captured by a fake looking robot which is obviously a guy wearing a fake looking robot suit sent by the Martians themselves- also their is also a guy wearing a fake looking polar bear suit who walks with his hands and knees. To say anymore would be pointless, but the thing is that I have no idea how I was able to watch this all the way through without cringing as opposed to some big budgeted movies. And I guess it's because I've used to see my fair share of movies similar to this one during my younger years which it wouldn't take much to entertain me, meaning that low budget production costs is sometimes not a requirement to watch some of these movies intended for kids going into pre-school. Let's see, their was \"Electric Company\", Mister Rogers\" to \"Sesame Street\" which it wouldn't take much to get children entertained when people are wearing fake looking costumes and bad makeup. I don't hate this since it's demographic is clearly obvious, but at the same time I don't like it either."

Sure-fire top forty stuff.\n\nMartian children are watching earth broadcasts and lamenting there is no Santa Claus on Mars. (The tv reception is excellent on Mars, so apparently Time-Warner cable is not involved.) Anyway, the kids' father, Kimar, decides he will go to earth and put the bag on Santa. He is accompanied by the villainous Voldar and the moronic Dropo. They all look like teletubbies.\n\nSanta is a bit senile - he refers to one of his reindeer as \"Nixon,\" presumably the one with the sweat on his lip. The Jolly Old Soul is accosted in his workshop by a Martian robot, who tosses around a few elves before Santa calms it down. Kimar and Voldar arrive and convince Santa at ray-gun point to come to Mars and make the children happy. Santa agrees, and when you see his wife, you'll know why he is anxious to get off this planet. Accompanying him on the trip are little Billy and Betty, who were snatched in the woods after giving up Santa's whereabouts. Stoolies.\n\nThe rest of the film, if you've stayed awake so far, pretty much has Santa making toys and Voldar trying to gum up the works. In the exciting finale, Voldar is toyed into submission by Santa and the kids.\n\nI actually recognized a few people in this cast. Vincent Beck, as Voldar, talked so loudly I kept hoping his moustache would fall off. Ned Wertimer, famous as the doorman on \"The Jeffersons,\" plays a roving reporter. I never heard of Gene Lindsey, but he plays a polar bear and makes one yearn for their extinction. I would never have recognized 8-year-old Pia Zadora as a green-faced Martian kid.\n\nBy all means, have the kids watch this on Christmas Eve. They will be asleep after ten minutes, which will give you plenty of time to get into the attic and try to put their toys together while following directions written in Chinese."

Personally, a bad movie to me is one that has no entertainment value whatsoever (or a movie that has nearly no entertainment value). For example, \"Demented\" and \"Burial Ground\" are bad movies in my book. \"Santa Claus\" is not.\n\nThe storyline is simple: Santa Claus is kidnapped by Martians to provide joy and toys to the children of Mars when they become overly depressed. Sounds like an ingredient for one of the worst movies of all time, right? Wrong! This movie is pure entertainment from beginning to end! It doesn't ever get REALLY boring, instead having long stretches of goofy comedy that isn't funny for the right reasons. The acting is mediocre at best, but I did like the sets they used. Very surrealistic, in my opinion. There is plenty of great dialogue to laugh at (i.e, \"I wasn't sleeping! I just haven't been able to sleep these past few nights...I forgot how! So I was just practicing!\"), most of it coming from clumsy Droppo, \"the laziest man on Mars!\". The little children who are kidnapped by the Martians are a mix of wooden and dedicated. Of course, some scenes' inadequacy are inexcusable! The polar bear costume is obviously fake and the Martian guns are Whammo Air Blasters that freeze people (who manage to keep moving and blinking, for some reason)!\n\nScenes to watch for: the Martians use the robot Torg to kidnap Santa, but Santa makes him into a toy!; the 'suspenseful' space door scene; the 'amazing' toy conveyor belt; Droppo passing as Santa (antennae and all); and the final showdown between Voldar and Santa, utilizing bubbles, water guns, soldiers, and other conveniently placed toys! \"Santa Claus\" is pure entertainment, in my opinion, and all those who speak against it should be sent to Mars!"

The actors ham it up in theatrical fashion and Dropo and Santa Claus give particularly entertaining performances, and the crazy story will certainly be believable for tots and those with a childlike imagination. Plus, it's got a very catchy theme tune.\n\nSo, if you approach it in the right frame of mind and are looking for old Christmas films that you haven't seen yet, you might actually enjoy this!"

While far from great cinema, this good-hearted bargain-basement Christmas flick hasn't aged well but was probably entertaining enough for the youngens back in the day. Acting, script, special effects and production values in general are all second-string (especially the 'polar bear'), but the final product is no worse than some of the treacly 'Xmas specials' that infested our TVs in the holiday season. The are some amusing tidbits sprinkled throughout as well as some unexpectedly 'harsh' moments (a gloating Voldar appears eject the Earth kids out the rocket's air-lock), but unfortunately the 'finale', in which the kids and Santa, heavily armed with toys, get the drop on the green-skinned nasty and his hench-Martians, is painfully juvenile even by the nominal standards of the rest of the pic. Oddly, the film's claim to fame is that one of Martian kids is played by Pia Zadora, whose later 'celebrity' made her the best known member of the cast (which tells you something about the others). Not great but better than a sub-3, especially considering some of the other dreck that floats to the surface every December."

Santa is rather annoying, but he probably is the best actor in the film which is scary. And the less said about the one martian who dresses up as Santa the better. The child actors are not much better and there is really nothing to be said of the sets. Every thing here is rather cheap looking and there is a scene with a polar bear that is just to stupid looking, however it looks great next to the martian's robot. As for the plot, strictly by the numbers, nothing is going to surprise you here. And I know this is probably someone's favorite x-mas movie from their childhood and they are going to want to write me and tell me how this movie is about changing socialistic lifestyles through being more friendly, but please save your breath.

I immediately fell in love with this film, just because of it's high camp level and because how can anyone find fault with a cult classic like this? Sure, the acting is stiff and the story is laughable, but isn't a film supposed to entertain? This one definitely delivers with the camp and entertainment, but it does have some good going for it....John Call has to be one of the best looking film Santa's I've ever seen. He chuckles and smiles his way through the film in spite of the goofiness of the film.\n\nBasically, Santa and two Earth children are kidnapped and taken to Mars, when Martian parents begin to worry about the time their children are spending in front of the video monitors and the overwhelming sadness that they seem to be enveloped with. Of course, you have a rotten Martian who does all he can to destroy Santa, the Earth children and the leader of the Martians, a large robot and a Martian-elf-wannabe.\n\nI love the opening theme and the film, I just wish someone could find a better video quality version to release!"

There is also a bear and a lobster clawed robot. And a guy that looks like Klinger from MASH but isn't. What more do you want, a depressed Yoda-like martian? The movie has that as well!"

It may not have the best in make-up and special effects but once you get past that it is a movie for the whole family to enjoy. I have watched this movie over a dozen times and it gets better every time (maybe because I have memorized all the dialog). On a serious note I would recommend this to you and you should go out to your video store and rent this movie, sit down with the kids and enjoy. Bottom 100 is inappropriate for this film."

Toys. To solve the problem, a ship from Mars arrives and kidnaps Santa and two Earthling children who happened to be visiting his house. But an evil Martian sets out to sabotage everything related to Christmas. The movie has a very low budget and it shows, the special effects are simple and crude but despite everything the movie has a certain charm, the best thing is the soundtrack and the main theme HOORAY FOR SANTA CLAUS, for many the movie can be terribly bad, but I still see it with the eyes of when I was a child and it's genius how with so little they made a show that has remained in the memory for several generations."

All they do is sit in front of the TV watch the \"earth programs\" (LOL). So, then the parents of the children ask the wise man of Mars why they're unhappy. He says that it's because they don't ever get presents. Then he tells them about Santa Claus. The Martians go to earth, kidnap Santa Claus and two kids, and they want Santa Claus to give the children, gifts. He says he'll try to help as best as he can. I own the \"MST3K\" version which I got as a birthday gift for my 14th birthday and it's still hilarious. But don't get me wrong, I'm sure the original version of the film is just as good.

The reviewers here fell for this canard and joined the herd, completely ignoring the fact that Santa Claus is a giant among the 4-year-old crowd.\n\nEvery 4-year-old I have ever known told me that this film left an imprint on their psyche that has lasted well into their grown-up-hood. I can vouch for the truth in that because I myself was once a 4-year-old. I didn't see it then because I was sent to bed that night for what I still consider a minor infraction.\n\nThe writing, the production, the sets, etc., were all created and designed BY 4-year-olds FOR 4-year-olds. Such a notion borders on genius, and has never been duplicated before or since (although it is unclear how it could have been DUPLICATED BEFORE it was first plicated).\n\nInexplicably snubbed by the Academy, it remains deeply embedded in the hearts of the Santa Claus faithful."

As a B-movie, \"Santa\" rocks the socks off of every sock-wearing rocker in the known galaxy. Every last detail right down to the film's somewhat faded look makes this film feel like a terrific surviving ode to a genre that has produced so much garbage (\"Reefer Madness\") and also some sweet sugary goodness (\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\").\n\nDefinitely, though, it is a love-or-hate kind of movie, and the answer to that question all depends on the outlook you take. If you think this was meant to be an Oscar darling, go ahead and hate it. Just leave it to those of us who can appreciate it. And another thing-- we have *got* to raise this past 2.6/10. Such a low rating should be reserved for the absolutely unnecessary (can we say, \"Pirates: At World's End\"?)"

In glorious saturated high contrast colour with the dark skin tone of the Martians changing very frequently possibly due to some of it rubbing off during filming and them not bothering to touch it up. The Martian's helmets seemed to be crash helmets with a ski mask glued onto the front and some tubing attached. The mystery regarding the presence or not of water on Mars was solved due to a water ski being present in a Martin store room, NASA please note. It deserves an 11 but 10 is the maximum allowed."

I have always been a little disappointed Santa Clause Conquered the Martians made it onto the Satellite of Love; to me SCCTM is every bit the cult classic MST3k itself is. The sets, the robots, the acting, the alien costumes, are all on par with contemporaneous Sci Fi classics like Star Trek TOS - an aesthetic MST3k itself pays homage to. And like those shows, Santa Clause Conquers the Martians... is clever.\n\nI have fond memories of watching this movie as a child, it was one of a handful my grandparents kept on VHS as I grew up in the 80s. I played it now for my soon to be 5 year old. He was delighted, and made me rewind the final 'fight' scene three times - once to call his older 'too cool for movies' cousins into the room to watch with him. (They all had a riot.)\n\nSanta Clause Conquers the Martians is unfairly maligned. It's a thrilling expose of 1960s society's hopes and anxieties for the space and arms race. UFOs that can't be tracked, 'nuclear curtains' that will disintegrate you on contact, and a burgeoning US space program that promises to take it all on. And then there is Santa. It's a rebuke of excessive automation and a loss of innocence, in favor of a simpler message of good humor and simple pleasures. In the end, Santa disrupts the entire sociopolitical structure of Mars and cements peace between our planets with a simple message of cheer and good will. In one scene, he unites our two species and rescues the Martian children from the depths of despair with nothing more than an infectious belly laugh. Frankly, it's magical.\n\nRespectfully; diminishing this movie as cheese and camp misses the mark."

Sure it's cheesy and production value is horrible and acting is bad, but that all being said this is a great kids film with fun values and a theme some that will stick in your head for ever. 10 year old Pia Zadora is great can see the talent even at a young age. People dog cult movies as bad, however if you give these low production movies a chance so are actully amazing. The fact that is overly cheap and cheesy makes these film a brilliant example of the perfect cult film. When I was a child this film would show on local tv Sunday afternoon movie at Xmas time. I longed for this movie very year. It's wholesome, no nudity, no bad words, just a fun sci-fi romp with martians and Santa Claus. Watch the original cut or if you like watch the mystery science theater take on this classic."
