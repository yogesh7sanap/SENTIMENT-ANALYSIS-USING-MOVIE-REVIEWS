It was a movie that had a good premise/idea, but didn't execute it very well. I lay most of the blame on script. The main guy in it is a good actor but one can only do so much with a script like that. First, they made his wife a dumb dumb. She was suspicious in the beginning when the guy was being the perfect husband and then when there were shady things, she suspicion went away until it was just too obvious something was going on. She found clues WAY to easily and found the secret room WAY too easily. She read the house blue prints as if she were a master architect. She broke into a car and found a an exact key she needed to open a mailbox later and broke into a house and found an envelope she needed. It was just done in a lazy way. This is what happens when streamers need content badly and they'll take anything. If you skip it, you won't miss anything."

It lives off the actors and their charisma mostly - which is at least something I'd argue."

I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews and people saying it was too predictable but that is complete lies. Unless they can see into the future there's no way they predicted how the film would go.

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes Netflix finally a well done entertaining thriller from you! After I couldn't sit through Sweet Girl from earlier this year I was happy to see that they kind of redeemed themselves with this production.\n\nI saw it without knowing nothing about it or reading any reviews. Therefore I thought it was a straight up home invasion thriller which I like, but I quickly discovered it was more of a standard thriller. And it's good fun.\n\nThere are not a lot of reviews at the current moment, but I've seen two just calling this movie trash, one without presenting any arguments to why he or she found it to be that bad, and the other because it was 'predictable'.. Does that necessarily make a movie bad? Because I don't think so. Yes, it maybe is a little predictable but not AS predictable as some make it out to be. And I really don't think this movie set out to be groundbreaking in the thriller genre. I'd rather see a well produced and well acted thriller, that's not trying to break new grounds in the genre but is just a good and suspenseful ride, that a pretentious thriller that wants to be something that it is not with a complete confusing story line and bad actors. Intrusion maybe does not add anything new to the genre, but that seems to be the case of a lot of movies, and still it is just a fine thriller, and I didn't expect anything else.\n\nThis is not a masterpiece, but it is perfect as Sunday night entertainment. Freida Pinto is great as Meera, our protagonist but Logan Marshall-Green steals the show as Henry. It's kind of a clich\u00e9 but by doing a little he's doing a lot. I really liked him in this one! He is far from a-list material yet, but having delivered so many solid performances in movies like The Invitation and Upgrade and now this one I believe he will get a lot more roles in way bigger productions made for the big screen in a few years!\n\nThe rest of the cast unfortunately isn't that great, and especially Detective Morse, portrayed by Robert John Burke is bland and really doesn't add anything to the story. But again the movie really centers mainly around the married couple so I was okay with that. Then there was a really forced scene that was there only to drive the plot forward, where Meera is watching the news at home while hosting a party that I found quite unbelievable. It's a little thing I know, but who turns on the news when they are having a big house party, when there's no particular reason for it? It was to obvious that the writers needed that. At last I didn't find the ending to be as exciting as I hoped for. It's not a big disappointment and there wasn't a lot of ways it could've ended, but it could've been done a little better.\n\nSo not a masterpiece but very entertaining and it ranks high amongst the recent Netflix Originals, although that's not saying a lot. If you are in it for a well done thriller to spend an hour and a half, I think you will find it fitting for just that. Either way, I think giving this movie a 1-star rating is just ridiculous..\n\nI use to comment on the bad tendencies among a lot of reviewers here where they give 1 star to ok movies. It's very misleading and I think IMDb should have a bigger filter for taking out reviews that are not presenting any arguments besides \"it's trash\". When people go to the site for guidance towards good movies and the first they see is for a movie like this are three reviews giving this a 1-star rating without arguments they might miss out and thats a shame.\n\nIntrusion is probably around 6.5 if you ask me. I recommend watching it without seeing the trailer. Enjoy.\n\nPlease rate fairly."

And even if that was the case, it is still worth watching.\n\nThis only confirms my theory that people reviewing movies love to hate Netflix, and have to appear smart and seasoned so that anything that isn't groundbreaking receives 1-3 stars. This was a perfectly decent thriller in spite of some annoyances. It's not like every single production has to offer something new or groundbreaking. It is enough that a movie keeps you interested and this one accomplished that."

Meera's sifting is the most enjoyable element of the film, as we play detective along with her, ransacking through drawers and asking questions she perhaps doesn't want answered. Where Meera ends up is no great surprise but it's a twist that takes the film to a nasty place.\n\nWhat struck me immediately is the lack of chemistry between the \"handsome couple\". The acting is not that bad, it just does not feel right. A bit forced acting and their characters are not aligned with the story and the plot. There is a gorgeous house, stunning scenery but also a very predictable ending. At the end, you don\u00b4t care about the plot. You just want to get to the end of the movie before falling asleep. Even when Henry talks about his perversity, it is difficult to stay awake before watching another movie.\n\nIt is easy to criticize a movie, I know. I know the actors are good, but this, whatever this is, did not work!"

I happen to watch a lot of thrillers, so it's a little harder to fool me. Personally, I think some people just don't like seeing how depraved some males are or can be. I also watch a lot of true crime and I assure you that if we just used true crime alone, we would never run out of stories to tell. What does that tell you? Give it a chance."

Logan however played his part very well, plus he's eye candy and quite frankly the only reason I sat through this disaster. The movie didn't know whether it's coming or going. Absolute trash."

The directing and cinematography were spot-on, as was the score, especially for a B film, where it's usually unfitting, overbearing and constant. The setting and landscapes are breathtaking and the director did a great job portraying those features. Even the casting and performances were very convincing, I'd even say impressive. The normally comfortable 92 min runtime did however feel much longer with the slow pacing and lack of any real engaging narrative. Thus the issue here was mainly a story that sets up nicely, but has a few plot holes and unconvincing logic-defying scenes, and fails to really deliver much on the thrills with any sort of bang, except maybe towards the climax of the film, which is pretty much predictable. Nevertheless, a decent and one of the better B films I've seen in a while, and fairly enjoyable for a one-time watch if you have nothing better to see."

Following the 'big reveal' they could have done more interesting or unexpected things with the situation, and it felt like those final scenes should have been much more exciting in terms of both action and interaction between the characters. Instead it was kind of flat and underwhelming - and after all the slow build up seemed to be over in a flash.\n\nAll the actors did a good job and I'm surprised Freida Pinto is getting dragged for her performance, which I thought was nicely understated and fitted the character well. Overall it was a decent effort and I particularly liked the colour grade and production design, which contributed a lot to the chilly, slightly off-kilter feel."

Sadly though, a lot of the suspense is caused by the characters making nonsensical/borderline stupid decisions when they find themselves in dangerous situations. From the very beginning, you'll have a suspicion about what is going on, and sadly, everything is exactly as it appears and as such there's little to no surprise or intrigue throughout. Overall, this film was not the worst thing I've ever seen, but I would recommend many other movies over this one if given the choice."

I did not like Freida\"s acting that much but Logan's acting skill and director Adam Salky's beautiful direction made this thriller watchable. The back ground music was not bad too!\n\n8/10 from me ."

This Netflix movie is utterly predictable but still attention grabbing from beginning to end largely because the main actors are so engaging. You stay with it to see how it all comes crashing down because you know it will. Still, throughout this well acted and clean production, it's not hard to predict how it all turns out. The ending scene is still somewhat surprising. A passable warm-up for a double or triple header movie night."

The filming location of the movie was good. Actually, the house was the best part of the movie, it was AMAZING. The characters weren't very interesting, but they were very well-developed. Overall, it was a kinda intense movie, especially the home invasion scene. It wasn't a scary movie and the kills were kinda boring. The plot twist wasn't very unexpected, because many things were \"revealed\" during the movie. The ending scene was kinda intense and I liked it. In my opinion, it was just an average film, but it's watchable."

Also, her character was very one dimensional and very spaced out. At times I thought wow I could have played this role. They could have given her more depth. Additionally the two main characters were just oddly cast. They didn't mesh well together.\n\nBefore the film was halfway through it was predictable. I predicted the plot 100% so that was kind of disappointing. Had Meera not made the decisions that she made the plot could have been more thrilling, more exciting.\n\nOverall it was a decent film but had potential to be much, much better.

But they are powerless to see the strong dark rooms of the abusers and are easily manipulated.\n\nThere is a lot of irony in other details too. It turns out that the head of the family is now the one who controls the home alarm panel. In the past, it was the TV remoter as more important stick of power :))) .\n\nI have downgraded the rating. It's already clear from the beginning who is guilty and what will happen. The film evoked a lot of strong emotions, and undermined classic fears. Thanks to a team of talented filmmakers."

        "review_detailed_main": "The premise of this film is actually good, although not novel. The filmography was decent, the sound and music were good. But the character of Meera lacked emotion and I was surprised to see Freida Pinto is actually not that new to the film industry. She began as a model in India and, honestly, looks more like she thinks she's still modeling here. There seems to be almost no lead-up to the level of distrust the audience is shown after a few vague clues. I felt there should have been something more clever about how we are to associate with what Meera is going through. It felt almost sterile. Yet after her sudden and intense suspicion, Henry is able to allay her concerns with an obviously deceptive story and they go about making plans for the big housewarming. This could have been a much better film but it was not a bad watch as is. To everyone saying what a great house it is -- I'm sorry, but that has to be one of the most bleak structures I've ever seen. Looks like the headquarter building for a prison, at least from the outside. The director had wanted to set this film in the woods using a cabin in an eastern state but couldn't do so because of the Covid plandemic. I think this house actually worked better. Also, this film was made using social distancing and the gambit, so that might explain some of the odd situational shots and lack of human interaction. In that sense, they pulled it off pretty well."

Take his USB with her like she forgot that she should keep it secrets like email out or sent to phone and keep USB at the same desk etc. You name it, she will leave it for you. When she so dump, we don't want to sheers her when bed situations happen. Anyway still not a bad movie, but next time cast someone more sexy and it's going to be a lot betters."

I thought the set design was great, the cinematography was fun and dynamic.\n\nLogan Marshall Green plays a bit of a clich\u00e9d character, but I have to say, this might be his best performance yet.\n\nIt's just a good looking movie that sort of elevates what is otherwise predictable plot. I also think the movie is pretty fun and entertaining, it's the sort of light watch that's perfect for a family party, you know? (Which may say more about how we're desensitized violence, but whatever) And um...hey, it's always great to see Freida Pinto, right?\n\nThe Bad: Unfortunately, this movie's big twist is about as obvious as it gets. I don't know anyone who would be shocked by how things turn out, even if it comes from left field. This trope has been beaten to death at this point. I would have actually appreciated more quiet moments with double meanings to rope us in a little more.\n\nThe Ugly: Is it just me, or is the glut of movies set in desolate locations with small casts increasing lately? (I wouldn't doubt it given the pandemic) We've just seen this movie before. It's nothing special, but it's not that bad either. Even my Mom who recommended it spoke volumes when she left the room to watch something else, despite \"liking the movie.\" I think that sort of sums it up. You'll probably like it, but you'll need to watch it again."
