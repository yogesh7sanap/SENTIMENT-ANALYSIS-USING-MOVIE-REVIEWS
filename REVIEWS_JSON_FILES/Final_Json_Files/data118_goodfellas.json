        "review_detailed_main": "Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.\n\nI'll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn't happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it's like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.\n\nMy vote: 10 out of 10\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

The film crackles with raw energy and enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is nothing short of stunning. The script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning. The cinematography and detail is immaculate, and the ensemble cast is one of film's finest. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. All in all, it is a brilliant film and an instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Chalk me up as another reviewer who found this movie to be vastly overrated. My wife and I saw it a couple nights ago, for the first time, and it just pales in comparison to cinematic triumphs such as The Godfather movies or The Sopranos.\n\nAs much as anything else, there are no likable characters. Part of the reason you could keep turning in to The Sopranos is that you could genuinely like and identify with the principals, despite their brutality and crimes. Here, you can't. None of the principals have any displayed virtues: at best, they're shallow and two-dimensional.\n\nYes, the highly lauded soundtrack has many tunes. But if you're going to use the hoary old tactic of advancing pop tunes down the years to denote the march of time, could you not be so flamingly anachronistic as all of that? They were playing 40s tunes in the doo-wop era, 50s doo-wop post-British Invasion, 60s psychedelic pop in the 70s, and early Eric Clapton in the disco era. Get the freaking DATES right.\n\nSpeaking of anachronisms, the film's jammed with them, and while it's superficially a glittering, gritty portrait of the wiseguy life and the wiseguy era, the goofs just overload. Cars too late for the year. Phones too late for the year. Livery too late for the year. Did Scorsese bother at all with accuracy and continuity, or did they just say \"Eh, get an old looking car out there.\" It pains me to read about how exacting and painstaking DeNiro was to get every aspect of Jimmy's personality true to life, exactly how the real Jimmy Burke did, in the middle of a blizzard of anachronisms.\n\nMost damning, there's just no dramatic tension. There's little by way of plot, little by way of suspense. The actors did good jobs with the material and direction they were given, but that's not remotely enough to sustain this seriously overrated flick.\n\n5/10."

I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song \"Layla,\" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.\n\nHedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"

The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scorcese & Pileggi's masterpiece on the life of Henry Hill as a Brooklyn NY mob wise-guy.\n\nAs much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent, the essence of this film IMO is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.\n\nThe sham of the mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect & principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a \"wiseguy\", breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.\n\nAn example is De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. I use associates rather than friends, as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust, hate and jealousy through the forced smiles.\n\nInteresting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn't think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of Tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat. Some people have actually paid to see The Dukes of Hazzard film, so I shouldn't be surprised."

        "review_title": "The Criminal Mindset",
        "review_detailed_main": "The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.\n\nWith Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath.\n\nFor myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools.\n\nGoodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino.\n\nThere's usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.\n\nFor a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an absolute must."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.\n\nRobert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, \"The man who did the voice on GTA: Vice City?\". This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films.\n\nThe film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first Oscar. But things are going like that."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a gangster biopic covering 25 years of gangster Henry Hill's life. It's set in Brooklyn, New York, from 1955 to 1980, when Hill testified against his associates and entered the witness protection program.\n\nThe film begins when Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone/Ray Liotta) is 12 years old and fascinated by the thugs who occupy a cab office across the street. They appear to fear no one and do pretty much what they want. He begins to work for capo Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino). He later becomes friends with Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci), both sociopaths.\n\nThe movie follows various significant events over 25 years, including impulsive murder, robberies from shipments at JFK Airport, and taking over a restaurant to launder money. Henry marries Karen (Larraine Bracco) and has a mistress, Janice Rossi (Gina Mastrogiacomo). We see Henry's time in prison and his entrance into drug trafficking against the express demands of his boss, Paulie.\n\nThe principal characters all represent real people, though the last names of Paulie, Jimmy, and Tommy have been changed. There are links to the significant events recounted in Pileggi's book, though much of the dialogue was improvised. The language in the film is exceptionally crude and objectifies women in much the same way as \"The Godfather\" does.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is a polished and well-crafted movie, but I don't think the characters had the depth of those in \"The Godfather.\" Joe Pesci won an Academy Award for his sociopathic character. Liotta, De Niro and Sorvino were also excellent."

        "review_detailed_main": "Typical Scorsese effort: average crime movie script dressed up with great acting and pretentious, way overly stylish camera-work.\n\nI'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the \"best movie ever!\" praise you hear about this one. As I said, I didn't think it was bad, it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching, trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me.\n\nAt least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece.\n\nA far, far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertaining--you don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes, which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness, bleak subject matter, unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a low-frequency earthquake hum or day-old shellfish--it's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos: the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason.\n\nArt shouldn't always be uplifting (I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously) but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something.\n\nA good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene, a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this \"the best shot ever.\" As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there."

This movie expresses a lot of the gangster ways and how they really did things.\n\nSummary: This is pretty much a biography on Henry Hill, who as a kid always wanted to be a gangster, and he actually worked for them. It shows how a young kid grew up helping the mafia and becoming a mobster himself. This is a true story and really shows what being a wise guy is all about.\n\nOverall: Definitely a 10/10 movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.\" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.\n\nGangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. \"Goodfellas\"--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his \"career\" throughout the film.\n\nAs he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems.\n\nEventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.\n\nRobert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.\n\nJoe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in \"Goodfellas,\" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.\n\nRay Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. \"What do you want, f&*^&?\" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.\n\nMartin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in \"Boogie Nights\") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh boo hoo, get over it.)\n\nThe movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life Henry Hill, whose novel with Nicholas Pileggi -- \"Wiseguys\" -- was adapted into a screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. The book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. The dialogue is incredible.\n\nAnyway, \"Goodfellas\" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I realize that in many circles, this film is considered an absolute classic and possibly Scorsese's greatest. However, over the course of time, my perception of this film has changed. Having read \"Wiseguy\" by Nicholas Pileggi, I realized that this movie does not conform to the book all that much and tends to stray a great deal. While most of the performances are memorable, they don't really resemble the actual characters that the story is based on. Joe Pesci's performance seems way over the top to me although certain short scenes of his are hilarious. Overall, I'd say his performance was overacted. DeNiro, Frank Vincent, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta turn in very convincing performances and Scorsese's approach to this film was very unique and well done. One of the many overlooked features of this movie is the soundtrack. While not quite chronologically correct in some spots, it does tend to emphasize certain scenes. My major criticism of this film is that way too much time in the second half is devoted to Henry's drug problem. I felt that this segment of his life could have been summed up in one or possibly two scenes. But here, almost the entire second half of this movie focuses on Henry's drug addiction and dealing. Not necessary. Another criticism is that the famous \"Lufthansa heist\" is only mentioned here and not shown at all. I believe that this, above all, was the centerpiece in the lives of Jimmy Burke and Henry Hill and is not given enough attention. I would have preferred to see more detail about the heist and less about Henry's drug use. Other than that, it's a memorable film and worthy of a few viewings. But as an all-time classic, I don't think so."

I can't begin to do justice to all the actors in this film. What I can attest to is the danger that lurks in every scene. In one scene the hard wired character played by Joe Pesci (marvelous and crazy) shoot a guy named \"Spider\" for not getting him the right drink. The rest of the men must sit there, without compassion, because this is a normal day, with \"normal\" events. There is also the second group. The wives and the families who are stuck in the middle of all this, pretending their husbands work nine-to-five jobs, while they are out hitting people. Ultimately, there is Robert de Niro who is the craziest of all. Played with subtle control, he dominates every scene. This is a true masterpiece that's hard to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits\n\nA film (one I'm sure you're all familiar with) charting the rise of Henry Hill, a young man growing up in a neighbourhood in 1950s New Jersey, who is in awe of the wise guys who lurk in his neighbourhood and the respect and power they command. With low prospects and an abusive father, Henry can see no other way to go than to become one of them and we follow him on his journey as he becomes ingratiated in them, the crimes he carries out for them, his marriage that starts well before going disasterously off the rails, a spell in jail after a job gone wrong and finally where he goes wildly off the rails when he starts taking/dealing drugs and him finally ending up having to testify against his former friends when he becomes a liability to them and they put out a contract on his head, which is still in force today.\n\nRobert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci. Three men with faces you wouldn't want to mess with and all perfectly cast in the leading roles in Martin Scorsese's legendary crime epic. All men are on fine form but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy.\n\nScorsese's masterpiece was one of the first films to really make use of the camera in new ways, from the long, lingering shot to the still shot, used excellently at various points in the movie. These are usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them, with some real lingering melodies from that era.\n\nThe story works on two levels, both enlighteningly as an expose of how the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very similar philosophies and worries as normal 9-5 people (with regards to families and staying on top of the competition) as well as showing just why the attraction to that life is so great (hitting home most forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!') and also engagingly as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed, as the film spans four decades, we do leave the film feeling as though we've known these characters for years.\n\nCoppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of all time, but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort, if you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts. *****"

Nothing stood out about any of the characters, they all were just generically portrayed gangsters. The narration almost got in the way of interpreting the movie on my own terms, it felt like i was being spoon fed the story and not to mention the narration was stale and made the movie seem boring. After watching it im conflicted about what to take from it since it skimmed over everything, the heist that was supposed to be the focal point, turned out to be something that was almost forgettable until i realised that it actually happened in real life which made the movie all the more interesting knowing that these were true events but the movie played no part in portraying the severity. The movie was keen on glamourising the gangster lifestyle but failed to actually show it! All you get is the narration. In my opinion there's only so much you can do w a gangster movie but this was just plain textbook i mean you get the cool and clever lead and when stuff gets too real he's fallen under drug abuse, and although that might've been the reality, this is media portrayal which mainly for entertainment purposes so adding to the character development might have been the right move. The movie showcased the 50's till the 80's without any attention to detail, the music, the wardrobe, the cars etc it all seemed as if they didn't care much about it and the only thing that was important was the well-known cast and the runtime. The cast gave their performances but it wasn't enough meet the need of a striking movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "By and far the largest complaint I hear from people is the use of voice-over in film. Many complain of how it destroys the purpose of a movie as a visual medium. \"The actors should convey emotion through their acting, not through voice-over,\" these critics might say. I argue that in certain cases, voice-over can make a film better. \"Goodfellas\" is my proof that v/o helps a film (as well as terrific direction, masterful cinematography, Schoonmakerian editing and a killer soundtrack, but those are givens in a Scorsese flick). How else could we really understand Henry Hill's incredible story of prosperity and joy which eventually turns into one of paranoia and depression?\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a low ranking soldier (or something like that) in boss Paul Cicero's crew of Brooklyn wise guys. It's also about his friends and partners in crime Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco). It begins with good times spread around, but due to some poor decision making on everyone's part, the good times don't last long.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is a mix of black comedy and dark drama which is all the more affecting because of the humanity of the two main characters, Henry and Karen Hill. Karen is especially sympathetic due to her innocence. She tries to rationalize her husband's actions in her v/o, as Henry explains everything he thinks in his v/o.\n\nBack to the point of v/o: It is necessary for Henry to speak his mind in v/o because as \"Sopranos\" creator David Chase said, these guys usually are lying when they talk to their fellow mafia members.\n\nThe one thing I haven't mentioned is the incredible acting by the whole cast. Liotta and Bracco shine here more than anyone else in the cast. (Yeah, Pesci is the most memorable part of this movie according to many other people, but he was much better in \"Raging Bull\" as was De Niro*. That's saying something about \"Raging Bull\" because Pesci won an Oscar for this film.) Everyone else here was great too.\n\nOverall, Goodfellas is a must see for any Scorsese fan. It's my favorite movie of his and I think his magnum opus. Marty grew up around these people, so who better to tell their story?\n\n*Robert De Niro is excellent movie he does. He probably even did research on the CIA and the florist industry for \"Meet the Fockers\"."

It has such great momentum, both dramatically and visually. Ballhaus and Schoonmaker are really at the top of their game in this movie. Fantastic.\n\nBut it's all in the story. If you don't have it on paper, it doesn't matter how many cool camera angles or transitions you can come up with. The movie runs for almost two and a half hours, yet it never gets boring. It always manages to get, and keep, you interested. The script is perfect. I normally have sort of a problem with voice overs. As Brian Cox says in Adaptation: \"God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character.\"\n\nBut here it works wonders, it helps to propel the story along with the excellent soundtrack.\n\nAnd the characters... The names alone... Jimmy Two Times, Johnny Roastbeef, Joe Buddha... Why don't we see people like Frank Cicero and Frank Vincent in more movies?\n\nNot to mention Ray Liotta. I don't get why he isn't hired more often. Regardless how bad the movie is, he usually is able to make something interesting and/or funny out of his character. Take \"Copland\" or \"Hannibal\" or \"Heartbreakers\" or \"Blow\" or why not \"Narc\"? Well, as always, there are exceptions. I wouldn't see \"Operation Dumbo Drop\" or \"Escape from Absolom\" again, even if my life depended on it...\n\nJoe Pesci is... ...well, he's Joe Pesci in this movie. But I gotta hand it to him, no one can pull off a Joe Pesci like he can! He IS funny like a clown, and he DOES amuse me!\n\nRobert De Niro's perfect as the laid back gangster Jimmy Conway who just explodes with fits of rage.\n\nAs I said, one of Scorsese's best. He's one of my all-time favourite directors, but I just wish he'd stop making cr*p like Gangs of New York. The Special Edition of Goodfellas is coming out on DVD in Europe this fall, and I'll be waiting first in line to replace my old version.\n\nI'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie with both a compelling story as well as great characters. Although I have to leave a little caveat, It IS violent."

        "review_detailed_main": "The answer is no. After seeing the hype of the movie and many people saying that \"Goodfellas\" is better than \"THE GODFATHER,\" I watched this movie last night and I say, how can people compare this movie with the epic THE GODFATHER? \"Goodfellas\" is not that great to compare with THE GODFATHER; \"Goodfellas\" is just okay. It's way out of the league to compare with THE EPIC GODFATHER. \"Goodfellas\" is just another average crime/drama film. Why I'm saying that is written in the brief review below:\n\nAs a cinema lover, I approached \"Goodfellas\" with high expectations, but I found it to be more of a chore than an engaging experience. While the film is praised for its direction and performances, I felt it lacked a compelling narrative and character depth.\n\nThe pacing was all over the place, making the story feel drawn out and occasionally boring. Instead of building tension, the lengthy sequences often left me disinterested. The characters, while well-acted, were largely unlikable and failed to evoke any empathy. I found myself struggling to connect with their motivations and choices.\n\nFurthermore, the glamorization of organized crime felt troubling. Instead of presenting a balanced view, the film often romanticizes a lifestyle of violence and betrayal, which can send the wrong message to impressionable viewers.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" didn't live up to the hype for me. It's certainly a cinematic technical achievement, but I was left feeling indifferent by the end. It's a film that may resonate with some, but for others, it falls flat."

        "review_detailed_main": "Exploring the rise and fall of a gangster, Goodfellas dawdles on Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) from his childhood when he first started as an errand boy for the local mob on across the street, to the height of his life when he unexpectedly has to make a decision that changes his life. By this time Henry is so entangled in the mafia that it has become his whole social life \u0096 from his friends, his wife, his job to his values \u0096 he is consumed in a camaraderie. The film is based on a true story and given its content and realistic photography approach, it feels strangely like a documentary. Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up on the gritty crime-infested streets of New York said: \"I remember seeing it on the streets and thinking, this is the way a movie should look like.\"\n\nTo convey this realistic tone, the camera thus coldly follows Henry around everywhere and it does not shy away from violence or unpleasant diversions, as is Scorsese's style. It invests the whole film in a behind-the-scenes atmosphere, where the director expertly wields a long, continuous reel of exclusive footage. Several takes are of steadicams gliding through the world for minutes, as when Henry and Karen park their cark, cross the street and enter the Copacopana where they are pampered by Henry's connections. It's raw and unflinching and truly absorbs you in Henry's life as a wiseguy, climbing the mafia hierarchy. He often botches his way through jobs; he has a hard time whacking people and he clumsily cheats on his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) \u0096 the danger of the character is that you like him. Ray Liotta fantastically sews together the events as they unfold in a patient voice-over narrative flow.\n\nThis flow is the film's fatal flaw. Sure, the pacing starts out nicely enough by having Henry slowly climb the mafia ladder along with his wiseguy friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of whom are equally charismatic characters \u0096 the latter with rapid-fire dialogue and a rapid-fire gun and Pesci winning an Oscar for his colourful performance. It's all compelling at first BUT as is the usual mistake by Scorsese... he dilutes his film. It's like he got so taken with the mafia content that he wanted so much more of it for his own self-indulgence. There are numerous scenes that serve no other purpose than giving us a feel for the mafia family and the way things are run. It is true that some of them are important for establishing the atmosphere, but there are too many of them. The pace thus shifts from patient to lingering and the plot suffers countless detours and diversion into the life of crime. It loses focus.\n\nI cannot figure out whether this 'diluting the film' approach is Scorsese's style or an unfortunate mistake he keeps repeating in every film of his. Nevertheless, it makes Goodfellas dawdle leisurely without any clear sense of point or direction for long periods of time. Everything else in the film is fantastic, no hyperbole. Scorsese takes a deep plunge into wiseguy culture, indulging in mob dialogue that snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace, brutal hits, sleek heists and rats. He navigates moods, themes, characters, and popular music (which is used throughout as a background device) with expert skill and less than twenty minutes into the film, you are so absorbed in the characters' lives of crime that you know of nothing else.\n\nAs for acting, it is Ray Liotta who grabs my attention as Henry, and not the resident scene-stealer Robert De Niro. I also fell in love with Lorraine Bracco's performance as Henry's Jewish wife \u0096 whose kickass attitude and sparkling personality translates well on camera. The greatest sheer presence can best be attributed to Paul Sorvino as the big-shot boss Paulie who, in spite of not saying a word until half of the film has passed, communicates a fantastic lethality. The reason the whole ensemble shines in their performances stems from the fact that they aren't acting like their characters; they are behaving like them. Of course the whole of Goodfellas is of the utmost quality but it could be even greater by being more condensed, as good most of Martin Scorsese's long-winded, diluted and slightly self-indulgent films.\n\n8 out of 10"

It is better than The Godfather in my opinion because of its real life approach to mob life. The film follows Henry Hill as he is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down at the end. The movie is just amazing to watch as it is like watching a documentary on the what is like to be in the mob. Adding to it are the amazing performances put forth by Ray Liotta as Henry,Robert De Niro as his friend Jimmy the Gent who is great in it and Lorraine Bracco who is very good as Henry's wife. But the performance worth mentioning is Joe Pesci's awesome performance as Tommy De Vito. His acting in it is one of the best performances I've ever seen. The film follows a time line from the 1950's to the 1980's and with it accompanies one of the greatest soundtracks ever put together. Scorcese has a knack for putting great soundtracks together and this is one of the greatest he's ever produced. Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever and one of Scorsese's all time best."

        "review_detailed_main": "Goodfellas by director Martin Scorsese is by far my most favourite gangster movie of all times. It's one of those movies that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, I can watch again and again without ever getting bored at any time.\n\nWhat it clearly sets it above other masterpieces of this genre like 'The Godfather' is that every scene gives me something. While many other movies of its kind tend to have scenes that get a bit tiresome or just aren't that interesting or entertaining, 'Goodfellas' succeeds to deliver top-notch entertainment until the end.\n\nThis is, of course, thanks to the extremely well written script and to the perfect cast. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro who play the main characters give so good performances, that I could not think of any other actor to play any of those roles and the rest of the cast is equally good.\n\nThe movie has a perfect pacing which is also thanks to the narration of Henry Hill alias Ray Liotta. His voice accompanies us through the whole movie and is definitely a huge fun factor. He delivers his story so well that you virtually live through this movie with him. When he describes how he got into the organization and what it's like to be a wiseguy, you really comprehend and feel it.\n\nThen there are the technical aspects of the movie. The camera work is brilliant with very long tracking shots and scenes without a cut which take you as an invisible spectator along through the scenes. And last but not least there's the music. Scorsese makes use of well-known pop music of that time, which really adds to the atmosphere as a whole.\n\nIn the end, 'Goodfellas' is my favourite Scorsese and gangster movie as well. There are very few movies (of that length and scope) that manage to deliver such a constant and high entertainment value from start to finish, but this is one that does."

        "review_detailed_main": "To be frank, \"Goodfellas\" is probably the best crime movie ever made. It is more than just a movie; it tells a captivating tale; it is perfectly cast; Scorsese's direction is at its utmost brilliance. In fact, I'd venture to say that \"Goodfellas\" far surpasses what Francis Ford Coppola's much-loved \"The Godfather\" has to offer.\n\nIn the first place, the entire sympathy for the characters of \"The Godfather\" depended on portraying them more as a dysfunctional family. This is not what a crime film should be. A crime film should be about *crime*, not men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other. The characters of \"Goodfellas\" are, above all, gangsters. As a matter of fact, one of the very first lines is \"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster\". At the same time, however, Martin Scorsese does not glorify violence. He does not overemphasize blood spattering or disturbing death sequences. The violence here is realistic, precisely because it's cold, cruel, and emotionless. As a result, this film is one of the more realistic, plausible, and believable crime films out there.\n\nAnother thing that is better about \"Goodfellas\" is its length, 146 minutes compared to \"The Godfather\"'s 175. That might not seem like much at first, but think about it. That's just short of a half-hour. \"The Godfather\", as is, could've easily been trimmed down by an hour. That can't be said about \"Goodfellas\". Things just happen in the film; it's interesting all the way, even during its more contemplative parts. Additionally, the characters of \"Goodfellas\" are really compelling, but I will avoid going in-depth here.\n\nMartin Scorsese is, as I've mentioned, at the top of his game when directing \"Goodfellas\". One particular shot near the end stands out. Scorsese makes use of the (as I like to call it) \"Vertigo effect\" (ie zooming in while tracking backwards; the characters in the foreground remain approx. the same size while there is a significant shift in the background). This shot has been overused to the point of becoming clich\u00e9, yet it works effectively here. This is just one instance of Scorsese's fantastic work on this film. He constantly keeps the audience engaged in the film and the characters. In the blink of an eye, a scene can shift from comedic to horrific. Yet such transitions never seem jarring or awkwardly paced.\n\nOne more thought about the film: the upbeat soundtrack that accompanies \"Goodfellas\" is actually really well pulled off. Whenever a song plays, it fits in perfectly with the action, both in melody and lyrics.\n\nThe Verdict: This is what a crime film should be all about: realistic, entertaining, gripping. \"Goodfellas\" is just about flawless.\n\nOverall Rating: 10/10"

However, watching the movie now, the script and the glorification of the mobsters is silly and juvenile at best."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sad to say, almost everyone I know - at least, the males - who has seen this movie likes it very much. I enjoy it, too. I say \"sad\" because it's a sick film in many ways. Also, when you have 240-plus f-words in a movie, I mean, come on! In that respect alone, I'm embarrassed to say this movie is part of my collection. That's simply because it's a fascinating story, for the full 145 minutes.\n\nThis is a rough film, to say the least. It's not just the language; there are some brutally- violent parts. Joe Pesci's \"Tommy DeVito\" seems to be involved with some of the worst of that violence Supposedly, the movie is a based on a true story but how much of this is true, who knows? It certainly provides a vivid portrait of Mafia life in New York City. I really loved the narration by Ray Liotta - who doesn't? - and enjoyed the music in here. Most people comment about the music; it's a good soundtrack. Pesci, Liotta, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino all make for extremely interesting gangster characters.\n\nWith all the language, which includes at least 15 usages of the Lord's name in vain and some subtle religious cheap shots (not surprising considering who directed the film), the gory spots this film gets a little too rough-edged at times. I've watched thousands of crime movies, and this gets to be a little much here and there but if none of the above offends you, you're in for a treat with an intense crime story that is very watchable."

The amazing thing is that it's no fiction, even if it was, it's still beautiful. It's based on a book called Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi. He met the real Henry Hill and made his story into a best selling book. Scorsese worked with Pileggi after liking the fast pace of the book, and they wrote the script. It was developed into this film. Casting is another great thing about the film, it seems that all the actors fit perfectly in their roles. It also has some really funny bits. Pileggi worked with Scorsese on another great Mob film, Casino."

Joe Pesci is frightening as a psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Liotta's wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence. The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as we are often being told exactly what we're seeing on the screen, but the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "Many people think Scorsese is a great director because he is a skilled craftsman who produces a clear realization of his own weirdly fractured vision. Given the reverence with which some people treat his work, any criticism may be viewed as sacrilege.\n\nHowever, this film is filled with wooden, cartoon characterizations of real people. They do very ugly things to each other, but without any understanding of their motivations.\n\nThe movie drags on far too long thanks to countless scenes that should have been shortened or cut (e.g., the endlessly long prison kitchen scene). The transitions between different phases of the movie are abrupt and without explanation. For instance, the transition to drug addiction and trafficking comes out of nowhere when the main character pulls pills out of his pocket and swallows them on his way to jail in a limousine. No drug use is shown or even hinted at prior to that scene.\n\nWhile the movie certainly progresses over time, and there is definitely plot development, the cardboard characters don't really change, and every scene seems like a repeat of something we just saw.\n\nUnlike \"The Godfather,\" to which this film is sometimes compared because they both depict the \"inner workings\" of the East Coast Mafia, there is no deeper insight into any part of the human condition, and only the shallowest revelations about why the Mafia even exists. The only thing we are given -- explained in clumsy narration at the end of the movie -- is that all the participants are drawn to each other because they enjoy a sense of belonging: of being \"good fellas.\" While the irony between that explanation and the extended depiction of these beautifully bonded people eating their own is certainly acknowledged, in the end none of it really makes sense, and we are reminded of that too-frequently quoted Shakespeare line:\n\nIt is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothing\n\nMacbeth was clearly talking about Goodfellas."

        "review_title": "A majestic, poignant and incredible gansgter epic",
        "review_detailed_main": "For a director, one of the most impossible tasks imaginable is trying to make such greatness for the big screen, and to do it well is even more difficult. However, director Martin Scorsese has succeeded in this near impossible task, as despite the obvious fact that no movie can be as great or complex as he imaginated novel, this 2 hour epic barely suffers from any such point.\n\nI do not believe that comparing the quality of a movie to that of its idea is a very relevant point, as every film stands alone as just that, a film. But if one tries to remain faithful to the source thinkedl, there is a chance some things get hushed up which might result in certain scenes not quite fitting in anymore. Of course, significant part of the stories of Henry Hill, Jimmy Conway & Tommy (Paulie was kind of like a 4th main character in the idea) for example were left out of the film, yet this is made up for quite smoothly by really only focussing on the development of Karen, Morrie & Frankie Carbone. Everything else might be barely developed, but it plays out in such a way as to develop our three main characters consistently. Thus, Scorsese has succeeded in narrowing down the plot to a 2 hour movie, and still maintains the essential continuity of character development in these three characters, and never does he really show that it is about the development of someone else.\n\nMuch lauded, the technical aspects of GoodFellas are all superb. It is definitely one of the most visually astounding pictures ever made. It is also said to be one of the most expensive movies ever made, utilizing thousands of extra's and endless beautiful aristocratic art design. With the red army being called in to supply a lot of the roles of extra's, it is as if almost the entire American nation was involved into making this impossible titanic film. A lot of sequences are just about unparalleled, especially during the action ones. The complex shots of thousands of extra's in sequence in killing scenes, the reflective helicopter aerial shots of death and destruction in the mob, the many steadicam shots watching the movie, changing distances and overviews effortlessly without editing. The many scenes of big bosses society, the beautiful balls, costumes, cathedrals. There is also an incredible one-take shot of a ball sequence where the camera steadicams from the opening towards a certain door and back, ending perfectly symmetrical, that is just an epitome of the directorial smoothness this picture consists of. It is so exquisitely shot that nearly every frame is material for a beautiful painting, and it comes as no surprise that Fincher was highly influenced by these visuals for his masterpiece: Fight Club.\n\nThe acting is also superb in this rendition of The GoodFellas, especially Lorraine Bracco as Karen. She perfectly embodies the vivaciousness, innocence, happiness, artlessness & naivety of Scorsese's character, as if she just walked out of the idea into the screen. De Niro, casting himself as Jimmy Conway, also has this merit, as he perfectly displays the clumsy, idealistic, kind-hearted & absent minded nature of the Jimmy in the thought. And to top it off, the strict and stoic demeanor of Joe Pesci as Tommy also perfectly embodies Scorsese's character spirit. Of course, accuracy to the idea in these terms is not required to create a superb movie, but when the movie is as faithful to the thougtl as this one, it would not make a lot of sense to have your characters utilize traits they should never have had. In any case, these characters feel just as alive as they are in Scorsese's novel.\n\nThe dialogue, well adapted from the source material, is psychologically & philosophically superb, although of course a lot of those credits go to Marty, but the narrative implementation of psychological happenings in the minds of our three main characters is a brilliant addition to add as much scope as possible to a film that already has a scale that is nearly unequaled. A lot of people complain that in Scorsese's next film Casino (1995) there was much scale and little scope, but this is not the case for GoodFellas. As it is both substantial in terms of character, and gigantic in terms of scale. The score is also excellent, and often used effectively as a reflective measure near the end of battles, or beautifully during balls. It is varied, it is epic and it is beautiful at the same time.\n\nIt would be a hard task to distinguish what aspect of GoodFellas isn't great, and due to its incredible complexity largely owed to a 2-hour runtime, there's very little movies that can possibly equal the pure raw incredible power of will that was needed to create such a giant production, not to mention the personal poignancy also evident in its main characters. Thus, despite the fact that this film is not widely known due to various reasons, there is little doubt as to its status of an all-time great among motion pictures."

In fact I think ( apart from Bugsy Malone which probably really doesn't count) this is the first Mobster movie I can remember watching, It's a proper guys movie. I'm a guy but I'm not that much of a geezer. This is probably to movies what Top Gear is to TV.\n\nIt's quite long but it did keep my interest all the way. The acting performances are decent without there really being any stand out performances. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci ( is he really not related in any way to Joe Paquale?) were probably the pick of the bunch amongst this star studded cast of big nosed very Italian looking actors.Robert De Niro didn't really play a big part and for most of the movie it felt like he was just going through the motions and doing a pretty decent impression of himself, if that makes sense.\n\nThe cinematography was good and there there lots of laughs, shocks, blood and twists along the way which I'd expect from a Scorsese film. The big problem from my point of view is that there isn't much of a plot. It's very artsy but there isn't much of a plot to keep me that interested. And I prefer a plot to grab hold of. That's probably because its a true story and they didn't want to make up too much stuff in case they offended the wrong people. I mean would you want to p*** off the mob?\n\nOverall this is a decent movie if you like this kind of thing. It's not really my kind of thing but it's still worthy of an 8 out of 10."

I also would've liked to know how Henry was out of jail in six years instead of ten or why he showed no emotion when he heard what happened to Tommy after Jimmy Conway's phone call. I'm also debating if it needed to open the way it did in the car. We knew it would be repeated later as it felt forced, but still well filmed. Maybe Scorsese should've opened with the characters standing at a parked car with the airplanes flying above."

Pesci steals the show as this hotheaded gangster who is so threatening, funny and scary. The scene of him saying 'why am I funny' was genuine perfection from Pesci. Next, Liotta leads the film as Henry Hill. He is at first out of place, and really building into this society, but soon, he is the one calling the shots and put under pressure himself. We also have Robert De Niro, who is amazing as the mentor to Liotta, who guides him through the film. The whole of the ensemble is good beyond these three, and there may even be too many characters, but the film knows only to focus on the important ones.\n\nScorsese is amazing and every element of what he does is purposeful. He uses a monologue throughout from Henry Hill and his wife to really guide us through the film. A monologue can be annoying, but when done in the way Scorsese does it, it works amazingly. He let the important moments play out, but the build up works even better with pauses, and just hearing how it is going. Beyond that, Scorsese is the gangster king. He really understands what makes these films works and really focuses on that. He makes every single scene engaging, and the film has the structure that was done even better by the Wolf of Wall Street, the rise and fall structure. There is tension like the Departed, and Scorsese just knows the film.\n\nThe story is amazing. We of course have the rise and fall structure, and the scenes done in such an engaging way. The dialogue is amazing, particularly between the three main characters of the film. The film manages to communicate a lot, but it doesn't once get overwhelming. There is a lot to be said, for how well the film works in delivering everything it wants to do. The ending was also really satisfying.\n\nThe technical elements really worked. We of course have the sound and score playing the background songs like in every Scorsese film, and that really brings a heartbeat to the film. We also have the amazing cinematography, which is great because of all the lighting, which demonstrates the evil in these characters. The editing was great, and the pacing just works. It isn't that fast paced, but that doesn't matter to me. It just works for me.\n\nOverall, an amazing film from Scorsese that shows his prowess. The cast is amazing, and the story is great. This is a mob classic, and instantly one of my favourite films.\n\nRelated Scorsese Ranking\n\nSamuel L.

A lot of people bash this movie for being a knockoff of \"The Godfather\", but it is in no way a knockoff. This movie is based off a true story first off. Also, there's no \"mafia\" or \"families\" really to speak of. And a majority of the characters are Irish, not Italian. I liked all the different characters involved, the wiseguys, the losers, the brutes, the smart AND dumb people, you name it. The fighting/shooting/heist scenes were perfectly executed (no pun intended). Ray Liotta is great as Henry Hill, he explains everything so well and makes \"the life\" look great. Robert DeNiro really proved himself once again in the part of Jimmy Conway. And Joe Pesci was perfect to play Tommy DeVito. All the supporting/side characters were great as well. I give this a 10/10, which I don't do very often but this movie deserves it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most of the time when i see a good movie I come to IMDb, and read some user comments. I like to read the negative ones, to see how STUPID people are. Well today after i saw this movie (i'm 20 years old, but never saw this movie before - shame) i wanted to see what do other people say about it. This movie deserves 11/10 stars. I really REALLY don't know why didn't it got an Oscar, but it's pity. Now 1 IDIOT user wrote \"why do people rate movies like this so high?\" The only thing i can say is: Dude, life is not only pink and furry, you have to look at the other side of life, the dark side. In this movie you will find a superb story of how was life back then, when the mobs ruled all. Violence is this guys problem... Dude, take a look around, and see for yourself. There is MUCH MUCH more violence nowadays then there was back then, sad but true. And at the end of the movie Ray really broke my heart: he ordered spaghetti and sauce, and he got ketchup with cheap noodles - NOTHING is like it was back then.. EVERYTHING is falling apart, we eat junk food, have to \"wait in line\", quality of products drop, no good music... (just compare the Mercedes cobra to a new E class.. cobra's simply wouldn't break down - Mercedes almost got bankrupted - new cars, in 5-8 years u have to change em) but lets get back to the movie. Another user wrote \"WHY IS THIS BETTER THAN THE MATRIX? MATRIX IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER..\" well i don't know what to say.. simply no comment. How old are you kid? 13? Matrix.. good movie, but Goodfellas is 1000x better. You will find action, good story, betray, love and all in this movie. Tommy would kill you if he would read that matrix is better lol. and the most important thing is, that it is TRUE STORY. Geee... i wish i could live in the 50-60's. real life, true friends. Watch this movie, and feel it. I just love the old mafia. So brutal, yet so catching. always together.. in good and bad.."

        "review_detailed_main": "Who would you call a nice guy? Probably a work colleague who, to the detriment of his time, agrees to drink a glass of beer with you and listen to crazy talk about lost love. And after the third glass of beer it becomes clearly clear to you that this is, in general, a nice guy. The heroes of this film will not negotiate with you, will not show understanding, and if you owe something to these people, then death becomes not the worst way out of this situation. This is a film about the life of the mafia .\n\nEven when Henry was in school, he saw how simple it all goes to people from the \" family \". They robbed, cheated and even killed people, but their opinions did not change. They were afraid, and therefore - respected. They were not afraid of anyone and they had good reason. Naturally, young Henry was struck by such a life, and in his heart he had long since matured in order to start his own criminal career and, finally, to become a real gangster. And this story is dedicated to his ascent, his victories and his collapse.\n\nDespite the fact that the events of the film occur predominantly in the 70s of the last century, this picture makes us recall our nostalgic memories of the unforgettable computer game \" Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven \", where events took place in the 30s. In addition to the general atmosphere in these works of art, some scenes from the film frankly migrated to the screens of computer monitors. Remarkable is the fact that the protagonist of the film - Ray Liotta was subsequently involved in the sound of Tommy Angelo - the main character of the already mentioned game.\n\nAccording to many sites that are directly related to the field of cinema, and some film magazines, \" Glorious guys \" - this is the most realistic film about the mafia ever created. In this aspect, it is difficult for me not to agree with them, when scenes of beatings, which the Godfather trilogy and the painting Once Upon a Time in America often neglected, are often swept across the frame. Martin Scorsese took the story based on real events, reworked it into a script, and created from it not a banal tale about the mafia, but a hard interesting film that is worth watching several times.\n\nHenry . The protagonist of the film, through whose eyes we see everything that happens in the film. His character performed by Ray Liotta is laconic and not too emotional. But this does not mean that he is boring. His acting potential is revealed closer to the second half of the film, when Henry's life begins to lose its former stability, and now he has to really survive in order to stay afloat.\n\nJimmy I have already seen so many films with the participation of Robert De Niro that it would seem there is nothing surprising. This actor perfectly showed a variety of images, from comedies to strong dramas. And yet, Robert is surprised. He is fully revealed in the film. His character is a gangster with experience, who has engaged himself in all areas of the criminal life of society. His preference is robbery, however, if necessary, he is capable of anything, including murder.\n\nTommy . The brightest character in this movie. In all likelihood, this is the best role played by Joe Pesci . Here he was given a real revelation, which cannot be said about such paintings as \" Home Alone \" or \" Deadly Weapon \". His character is small, obviously with a chronic neurosis, a gangster, with a complex youthful fate, who is very proud of what he has achieved. He does not allow anyone to insult himself, while he will allow himself clearly more than acceptable, at any convenient occasion grabbing a knife or a gun. It is necessary to mention that this is also a very talkative, and therefore very funny character. Honored Oscar for Best Supporting Role.\n\nThe director of the film, Martin Scorsese , the author of such masterpiece films like Gangs of New York and the Oscar-winning \"The Departed, \" created a film that perfectly complements Godfather , telling the most tough and interesting story about the life of the mafia. I recommend viewing this film to anyone who likes masterpieces, to all sincere cinema fans, since this is a really interesting film, which doesn't need a half-hour buildup at a time of two and a half hours. The film clings from the first minutes and releases at the moment when the final credits are on the screen.\n\nWatch it ..."

        "review_title": "Shallow Ultraviolence and Slimy Characters. Overrated Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "I suppose a lot of people found the characters in this film compelling and relatable on a basic human level. From what I saw, virtually all of the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one another and murder for kicks. The protagonist, played by Ray Liota, lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that Cagney and Al Pacino's gangsters had. Liota's Henry Hill has very little that would make him seem like somebody to care about, because he's always willing to betray people and lie to save his own skin. When he gets his comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no reason to take his side. His colleagues in crime, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are equally irredeemable. The only decent qualities about De Niro and Liota is that they are not quick to condone random murder, as Pesci is always apt to do. The level of violence in this movie is gratuitous and disgusting. It does little to glamorize the life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome venture.\n\nThis movie is full of violence and little in the way of decent themes, as virtually all the characters are too slimy to convey anything relatable to the viewer on a basic level, except that we sometimes betray others to save ourselves. The acting is decent, though not something to write home about. The plot is winding and tortuous, so pay very close attention if you want to understand the action. The plot actually seems secondary, more like a framework for a menagerie of blood-and-guts and gangster dialogue. I do enjoy movies that feature prominent ultra-violence, like \"Robocop\" and \"Sin City,\" but those movies had deep characters and themes about morality that this movie does not explore. Watch it if you wish, but don't expect this to be the classic everyone seems to think it is.\n\nPS: Listen for the phrase \"you're busting my balls.\" Virtually all the main characters say it. You could play a drinking game with this movie for all the times the characters say that phrase. This likely inspired a scene in the TV series \"South Park,\" where Cartman says this phrase to people who refuse his offer to buy aborted fetuses. Good times."

I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfather films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nitpick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, & Raging Bull especially) but ever since \"Goodfellas\" I would follow everything he did. I didn't follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this didn't win Best Picture however the fact that \"Dances with Wolves\" did was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been shared. As much as I loved \"Wolves\" \"Goodfellas\" has held up as the better picture. If you haven't seen this film and consider your self a serious film afectiando you need to see this before you are laughed at by actual filmphiles."

The film is also incredibly violent, showing the harsh reality of the 'business' in unflinching detail, opening as it means to go on with the brutal stabbing and shooting of some poor sap in the trunk of a car.\n\nNope\u0085 a life of crime is definitely not for me.

There are no bad guys in this film the only bad guys are the main characters, and somehow you root for them, that's how you make a good bad guy, you can understand their intentions.\n\nAnd the acting? Oh my god. It feels like the cameraman's a ghost and he's just recording these people's daily life, they're all distinct and natural, even the background actors add to the realism of the world. There's narration throughout the whole film, films use this as a tool to dump exposition but this one uses it to explain the thoughts and feelings of the characters, it also shows how insanely twisted these gangsters are. Even though there isn't a main goal except for Harry wanting to be a gangster, this film manages to be entertaining through and through.\n\nIt's another classic gangster flick. And goodfellas is an absolute 10/10"

He enjoys the life of crime until it threatens to jeopardize the security of the life he has as a married man.\n\nIt's a film very similar in theme to \"The Godfather\", but not quite up to that level of achievement. RAY LIOTTA has never gotten enough credit for his leading role while most of the acting awards went to JOE PESCI as the gun happy hood with an explosive temperament in an Oscar-winning supporting role.\n\nIf you like this sort of thing, this will be your ticket. Some of the scenes have a strong impact with startling realism as far as the violence goes, and it moves smoothly toward a satisfactory \"crime does not pay\" conclusion. All of the performances are first rate and there's seldom a dull moment thanks to a soundtrack that includes a lot of pop songs of the period."

I'd rather watch this on repeat than watch something like the remake of footloose, in fact include watching the original footloose also. Pesci in a showstealling performance as not just a mad psycho, a ruthless killer, cunning gangster but a charming character. You could be afraid of him as he isn't pure evil but driven by desire to be feared and respected in the criminal underworld not afraid to start slicing or shooting anyone that gets in his path. You wouldn't want to spend time in a holiday home with him when he is in a bad mood."

        "review_detailed_main": "Goodfellas (1990) is definitely one of my top 3 all time favorite gangster movies and one I recently watched again from my personal collection. The storyline follows a group of friends who work together and quickly work their way up the organized crime ladder. As they grow it quickly becomes hard to identify who can trust who versus who is working for their own personal interest. This confusion can cause problems for business. This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese (Casino) and stars Ray Liotta (Blow), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Joe Pesci (Lethal Weapon 2), Paul Sorvino (Nixon) and Lorraine Bracco (The Basketball Diaries). The depth by which this storyline is delivered is absolutely amazing. The details around every character, the nature of the business, the writing and dialogue lead to a rollercoaster of emotions as the film unfolds. You really get wrapped up and rooting interest in the characters. The acting is absolutely phenomenal by every character and the film locations are perfectly selected (I've actually visited a couple). The soundtrack is also very good. I loved everything about this movie and would strongly recommend watching it regularly. This is a 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been looking at the top 100 movies list of IMDb and it is becoming so disappointing. The top 6 movies are of crime, murder, action and mafia. Casablanca is the only movie that is of its own category standing out alone at 7th place; but this time I at looking at GoodFellas at spot 17 - all time great movies.\n\nThe story is based on true events and characters from a novel named \"Wise Guy\" written by crime reporter Nicholos Pileggi. It is about this boy Henry Hill born (Ray Liotta) in 1943 in a poor working class family who wanted to be in a gang since his boyhood because that gave him freedom, money, and respect from people. He joins hands with Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). This trio starts by hijacking, stealing and selling goods from huge truck loads. Once arrested Hill starts dealing in drugs in prison and when out continues to do so. In the end, with difficult times, of police after him, with new enemies and having difficult times with his wife Karen (Lorriane Bracco) \u0096 he decides to be an informant to avoid prison sentence and gives in most of his gangster friends \u0096 good fellows! The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese, who like Tarantino has earned his reputation with cold blooded killing of people and mafia movies. He directs the movie well in all departments and combines with ample social, family and drama scenes to balance the dark narrative.\n\nAll the actors have acted well, but the best in the lot is Joe Pesci who has played the weird cranky character of Tommy with such conviction that it should be remembered just for its sheer portrayal of characteristics. Ray Liotta who gets to play the central character is okay and his career till date shows that he has lost himself into mundane small roles. Robert De Niro is as good as ever and shows his brilliant insight to understanding deep dark characters \u0096 he loves to play.\n\nThe movie progresses from 1950 till 1980s and Martin captures all those eras with much ease and details.\n\nEven though his movie is in the top 20 list - lately, seeing many of these mafia movies \u0096 I do not feel that much excited. It has become routine and mundane for me to watch the cold killings, glorifying killings, blood everywhere \u0096 showing crazy characters who pull out gun at any point to shoot someone. I feel sick at times for the world and the good directors who have not got over showing it on big screen.\n\nJust a trivia, Henry Hill is still alive but suffering depression and fighting alcoholism and spends most of his time in rehab centers.\n\n(Stars 7 out of 10)"

Dangerous and funny - if you'll excuse the pun.\n\nRay Liotta and De Niro doing their thing and reeling the audience in.

There is no more iconic performance than Joe Pesci. \"What do you mean I'm funny?\" Robert De Niro is only the third most outrageous performer. Even the constant Ray Liotta narration worked perfectly, and I'm not usually a fan of narrations. Scorsese is a true master. The steady cam entry into Copacabana is first rate.

I can't begin to do justice to all the actors in this film. What I can attest to is the danger that lurks in every scene. In one scene the hard wired character played by Joe Pesci (marvelous and crazy) shoot a guy named \"Spider\" for not getting him the right drink. The rest of the men must sit there, without compassion, because this is a normal day, with \"normal\" events. There is also the second group. The wives and the families who are stuck in the middle of all this, pretending their husbands work nine-to-five jobs, while they are out hitting people. Ultimately, there is Robert de Niro who is the craziest of all. Played with subtle control, he dominates every scene. This is a true masterpiece that's hard to watch."

Its iconic, slick, cool, over violent and sickening all screwed into one great movie. There's really nothing else that need be said about this film which is perhaps the greatest ever and in my opinion far superior to the great yet overrated godfather. It's just absolutely flawless, and if pushed to find one i'd say its the fact that the budget isn't large enough"

        "review_detailed_main": "I did not see ' Goodfellas ' back in the 1990's and a day after seeing the great ' The Departed ' I was to be honest bored by it. I felt I had seen it all before in other films, and its being based on a true story and having actors to play real people did not give me a bonus interest. Why ? For me I think it depends on the acting, and the pace of the film. ' Goodfellas ' has a similar opening as ' The Departed ' with a kid on the block being introduced to mob crime, and pursuing that way of life. Similar too that at the opening we witness a brutal killing, this time of a brutalised man in the boot of a car. Maybe I should have watched ' Goodfellas ' first, but I feel that I would have considered ' The Departed ' the better film. For a start I feel a film is as good as its actors and their energy, and other than the late Ray Liotta I was not charged up by the other performances. The off the cuff dialogue seemed tedious, and the four letter words seemed frankly lazy. I read that Scorsese let the cast use ' natural ' dialogue and edited the best, and I found most of it just covering empty time. But Liotta shines as the kid grown up, and it is from his perspective and that of his wife who are in the forefront and narrate the film. Robert de Niro was a disappointment, but at least he bothered to have ageing makeup. The film covers from the 1950's to a couple of decades later. Maybe trivial, but laziness in filming important detail can lead to disbelief, and Liotta remained as young as when he started. I could also have done with less songs of the times on the soundtrack. And unlike ' The Departed ' I did not find outstanding set pieces. I am willing to believe it is one of the greatest films but not for me. I longed for DiCaprio and Damon to explode on the screen and to be completely honest I was bored by most of the acting. One last dislikeable detail was the killing of a black man for no apparent reason that I could account for. A very ugly short scene committed while the killers made a cup of coffee. It left a sour taste in the mouth and maybe then I switched off interest in the characters."

All characters are unpleasant. This movie is completely off balance.\n\nThe inside scenes are too dark. The light is terrible.

We see the ease with which he slips into this world; the rewards and dangers it brings. During this time he works with fellow mobsters James Conway and the psychotic Tommy DeVito; he also marries Karen. While Henry isn't a killer he isn't unaware of the violent side of their business.\n\nThis is often described as the greatest mob movie; I can't say that but only because there are other very well-known mob movies that I have yet to see. The story is gripping from start to finish; there are moments of humour which frequently turn to extreme danger in the blink of an eye; this is usually due to Tommy's hair-trigger temper. The violence is usually sudden and bloody; as a character points out they don't waste time talking before they waste somebody. The cast is brilliant; Joe Pesci stands out as Tommy, it is hardly surprising that he picked up an Oscar. Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro are great as Henry and James; also particularly notable are Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill and Paul Sorvino as \"Paulie\" Cicero, the mobster Henry works for. Overall I'd say that this film is a must see for fans of the genre."

Here, his unstable dangerousness (it's a word, look it up) oozes menace right off the screen. This film is very different from the Godfather films in that these characters are blue collar hoods, rather than top bosses. To me this brought home even more the evil, law of the jungle, credo of the mob. Very powerful stuff.\n\nNOTE: I have the DVD, and the sound on it is not so good.

The sad thing is that, because Goodfellas is a gangster movie, it will always be compared to other gangster movies. for some reason, movies in that genre (gangster/organized crime) are never looked at as individual pictures, but are forever compared and put up against other gangster films. The only exception to this rule, is the godfather of all gangster movies, the Godfather. this is probably because it is the first of its kind (not the first gangster movie, but the first modern-style gangster movie), most gangster movies made after the Godfather are complete rip offs of the Godfather, but every once in a while a movie like Goodfellas comes along that may be similar to on the surface, but is then written off by many. when I say, written off, I mean that it is not getting the credit it deserves. it is a masterpiece, yes it is a gangster picture, no it is not the Godfather. Many people admire it for what it is, but if the Godfather hadn't been made, or even if this film wasn't always compared to it, it would take its deserved place in cinema history. that place is not as a good film, and a great gangster film, it is a artful, entertaining, and near flawless film, and one of the top two greatest gangster films."

Thank God that he finally got to; it was probably his best movie up to that time. It shows the mafia world through the eyes of up-and-comer Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) is Henry's main entry point into the mafia, but Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is also something else. Needless to say, there is a LOT of violence (well duh; this movie's about crime), but none of it gratuitous.\n\nYou may have heard of Joe Pesci's \"How am I funny?\" speech. Let's just say that you have to see it to believe it. In fact, you have to see the whole movie to believe it. And to get a feeling of Martin Scorsese at his best."

Contrary to popular belief this is not a glamorization of The Mob or their lifestyle, in fact, it is just the opposite. No matter how much the narrator/main Character tells us how attractive it is and how desirable it is to be a Wiseguy, the Film denies this in almost every scene.\n\nIt is the rhythm, the staccato of it all that hypnotizes us into believing what he is saying, but not what is actually occurring. The pulsating Music Soundtrack and the uncanny mesmerizing voice over lulls the Audience into a false sense of a wanting place. It is the work of the Devil. Or at least a devilishly good Film-Maker.\n\nThere is nothing attractive here. The People are ugly and unpleasant and constantly do ugly and unpleasant things. The Sets are mundane, gaudy and unattractive, as are the clothes. There is not one appealing aspect to any of this Photo-Play. Yet, Audiences are led by this pied piper Scorsese into the rat-a-tat-tat ruminations of a heel and a turncoat and they actually care about this crumb.\n\nSuch is the magical work of a Movie Maker obsessed with style that cannot be denied His Craft. This is a fugazi. A manipulative Movie. A sinful master work that is a temptation worthy of a great deceiver."

        "review_detailed_main": "Goodfellas is a pretty mesmerizing film. Martin Scorsese at his best is an incredibly dynamic director and Goodfellas is most certainly one of his greatest achievements. For a film that clocks in at two and a half hours it sure moves at a fast pace. This is a movie that never lags. There is no waste. It's a master-class in how to keep an audience glued to a screen.\n\nIt documents the story of Henry Hill the real life gangster. Like the 30's gangster films it's a rise and fall epic, but unlike these the resolution is a lot more ambiguous and the overall presentation is considerably more complex. I'm not sure how close the film is to actual events, but I do realize that some principal characters have had their names changed for some reason. Ultimately, the level of actual authenticity doesn't matter very much as this is a superlative film either way.\n\nScorsese has never been afraid to go to extremes. This film like many of his others is very raw. Language and violence are strong; the latter, very much so in the murder of the character Billy Batts. The brutality adds an undeniable visceral appeal to the film. Yet it does still seem entirely justifiable within the context of the story. Acting is universally top drawer with everybody giving terrific performances. Although special mention does have to go to Joe Pesci whose character Tommy is seriously unforgettable. Tommy is a pint-sized sociopath with a pretty monumental chip on his shoulder. Most film-makers would never have recognized that an actor as small as Pesci would be ideal for the role of this character. But Pesci's size and high-pitched voice only add to his menace somehow, it's as if these defects of his character make Tommy even more at war with the world and make him an even more bitter and dangerous guy. Scorsese's trademark use of popular music is excellently incorporated into the film. The tunes by turns indicate the time period, parallel the events and add an ironic backdrop to proceedings. It's a textbook example of how to compose a soundtrack with contemporary music but in a way that adds depth and meaning.\n\nIn a nutshell, Goodfellas is arguably the best gangster film out there. As a piece of cinema, it is thrilling. Recommended unreservedly."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I saw \"Goodfellas\" I knew everything that was going to happen because it was based on a book called \"Wise Guys\" that I had read a few years before. Though I knew what was coming I was pleased with the acting, at it's best. The character were developed and depicted in a way that I though made them almost like heros. Some, like Pesci's , were amusing and sometimes funny. Conway was presented in a truer light, and I think that only an actor of DeNiro's caliber was capable of showing James Conway as the truly mean and vicious person he was in life. Henry Hill and his wife Karen are presented almost as victims and one could almost feel sorry for them. It's hard not to like Lorraine Bracco in any role she plays and I wish that they had cast someone not as likable as her as Mrs Hill. I, being involved in law enforcement for nearly twenty-five years saw them as criminals. The scenes depicted in the jails was as true to life as possible. I just feel that the way the criminals are made into heroes is a bad message to present to young people. More of the needless murder and suffering, the survivors family and loved ones left to pick up the pieces are neglected and ignored. Henry committing felonies on a daily basis, Karen living a glamorous life, and when they finally get caught and ready to be sent to jail, where they belong, become outstanding citizens by informing on their friends. Hill and his wife are no better than any of the others that committed felonies, condoned and participated in murder, robbery, assault, drug dealing and extortion. The flaw is that these characters are made to be sympathetic victims. It wasn't poor Henry's fault that for as long as he could remember he wanted to be a criminal. It wasn't Karen's fault that she felt all the glamour surrounding a life of extortion and theft. Her mother, presented as a mean interfering woman was another victim as was her father, presented as sickly and spineless. They truly suffered, seeing their daughter getting involved in a life with such trash. A message sent to young people that this type of life is fun, great and carefree is not a good message. Lets face it, Hill continues to be a criminal, even if not on the same scale he still goes into stores and steals from the shelf and we, the general public, have to make up for the vendors lose because of this. Let's present the characters for what they are. Poor Tommy being murdered because he resented being shot by a mean coward. A man trying to make a living running a nightclub having his business being stolen or a poor mailman making his daily round sand being assaulted for doing what he was suppose to do, deliver the mail to the addressee and so many more depicted in the movie not as victims but as an occasional ship passing in the night and happening to be passing a barge filled with garbage. The movie is entertaining, but lets not forget that in real life these characters left a trail of victims and so much unnecessary hurt."

        "review_detailed_main": "GoodFellas, directed by Martin Scorsese in 1990, is a true masterpiece of American cinema. This film is not only a gripping crime drama but also a deeply insightful and richly textured portrayal of the American mob culture.\n\nThe movie is based on the real-life story of Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, a young man who aspired to become a member of the powerful New York mafia family. The film takes us on a journey through Henry's rise and eventual fall as a member of the mafia, showcasing his relationships with fellow gangsters Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).\n\nWhat makes GoodFellas truly exceptional is its flawless execution. From the casting to the cinematography, every element of the film is expertly crafted. The performances by the actors are stunning, particularly Pesci's explosive and terrifying portrayal of Tommy. Scorsese's direction is masterful, keeping the pace brisk and the tension high throughout the entire film. The use of voiceover narration, music, and editing are all spot-on, creating a richly immersive experience for the viewer.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of GoodFellas is its attention to detail. The film is meticulously researched and accurately depicts the world of organized crime in New York City during the 1960s and 1970s. The script, written by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi, is both informative and entertaining, weaving together complex characters and storylines in a way that is easy to follow and deeply engaging.\n\nOverall, GoodFellas is a true classic of American cinema. It is a film that stands the test of time and continues to captivate audiences today. If you have not seen this film, I highly recommend that you do so immediately. It is an absolute must-see for any movie lover and a testament to the power of great filmmaking."

        "review_detailed_main": "The gangster movie has gone through a lot of changes, especially since being reinvented as high drama with The Godfather pictures in the 1970s. Such classics soon become clich\u00e9s and in the 80s gangster movies were often spoofs (Prizzi's Honor, Married to the Mob). Goodfellas opened a new chapter of serious yet very stylish crime flicks.\n\nGoodfellas was, back then, a comparative rarity in the genre in that it is based on a true story. And storywise it is as a much a documentary as it is a good yarn. Most scenes, when considered individually are simply revelations of gangster life, and the almost constant narration more or less acknowledges this. It's only when viewed as a whole that an entire story arc starts to emerge. But there is also continual structure in the arrangement of each little anecdote. Take for example the pair of scenes in the bar with \"Spider\". These go together, but you need to know that some time has passed in between them. Writers Nicholas Pilleggi and Martin Scorsese throw in a quick in-between-scene of Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco arguing. This demonstrates that other events have gone on in the meantime, but also keeps the tense, gritty atmosphere riding along. The vibrant language and frequent diversions into wisecracking make this a forerunner to the dialogue-for-the-sake-of-dialogue school of screen writing which Quentin Tarantino would soon specialise in.\n\nMartin Scorsese's direction closely follows the narration, both in its content and its snappy pace. Like Hitchcock his camera is constantly roving around, leading us by the hand and making us look at things. In effect he's illustrating Henry Hill's words. And often he's showing a little more than that. Sometimes there's a cheeky counterpoint between words and images. There are also some clever pull-back-and-reveal shots. In one early shot we see a close-up of some liquor changing hands. The camera pulls out to show that the booze is being used to bribe a couple of cops. We are continually bombarded with ideas, continually pushed and pulled through the narrative. Of course, a lot of Scorsese's technical business here \u2013 the zooms, jump cuts and lengthy tracking shots are just cinematic wheelies, and headache-inducing ones at that. But so long as you can put up with them you have to admire the rhythmic precision with which the whole thing has been put together.\n\nThere is however another downside to the overtly technical style at work here. We don't really get to see the performances at their best. Poor old Ray Liotta probably did the best work of his life here, but it's all chopped up in little bits, and all we get is occasional looks, flashes, half-gestures. The same goes for Lorraine Bracco. Robert De Niro apparently did extensive research into his character, but there doesn't seem to have been much point since he is more or less the same as all the other Italian American gangsters he has played in his career. The only player who really comes out well here is Joe Pesci. Pesci has such charisma and presence that he commands attention even in small doses. It also helps that his style is very much in tune with the punchy dialogue and staccato rhythm of the whole piece.\n\nComing from the peak in Scorsese's abilities as a director of tight control over every aspect, Goodfellas could easily have fallen into the trap of being nothing but a showy technical exercise. The only thing that saves it is the fact that its subject matter is so interesting. Old and established as the gangster movie is, this one reveals so many sordid truths and fascinating facts about that lifestyle, and does so in such a direct, never-a-dull-moment manner, that it gives the whole genre a jolting jump-start."

        "review_detailed_main": "Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' (1990) is an iconic gangster/mobster movie about the real-life story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), his life in the mob and his relationship with his mob partners Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) in the Italian-American crime syndicate.\n\nIt is genuinely a great feeling when you get the opportunity to review an all-time great film such as 'Goodfellas'! This is the one pure gangster movie that everybody keeps talking about (I don't consider 'The Godfather' a \"pure\" gangster movie)!\n\nI am someone whose number one favorite director of all time is Martin Scorsese and I therefore love a lot of his movies! While 'Goodfellas' is not my favorite film of his, it is certainly Scorsese's most iconic and beloved piece! For heaven's sake, this film is one of the top 20 highest rated films! There are so many good reasons why the film deserves this great amount of praise!\n\nLet me now explain why this film is so great! First and foremost, the acting performances as well as the chemistry between all the actors are both completely on point!\n\nThe protagonist in this film is Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill who also does the voice-over explaining the whole process of becoming and being a gangster. Liotta plays a bit of a socially awkward character who has some weird tendencies, yet he fits in well with his gangster group.\n\nOf course we also have to talk about Robert De Niro, the acting genius! De Niro is an absolute titan in the film industry. He paved the way for so many young actors who looked up to him thanks to his incredible performances over the many decades! De Niro's most iconic role might just be the one of James Conway in this movie! I don't know how De Niro does it, but he can make anything look cool. There is one iconic scene of him just smoking a cigarette for about 20-30 seconds. That scene alone is one of the greatest scenes in film history! De Niro has always had the incredible ability to stir up the whole scene and be an absolute scene-stealer! Many of these mob movies require actors that bring a lot of charisma with them. Robert De Niro is definitely one of those actors who can fool the audience, making them think that he might not be so bad after all due to his undeniable charm and charisma!\n\nWhen you talk about gangster movies, names like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci usually come up very frequently. Speaking of Joe Pesci, he arguably delivers a career best performance in this film! Pesci plays Tommy DeVito, a really funny, yet extremely scary gangster who, if you annoy him a little bit (\"break his balls a bit\"), might end up killing you on the spot. He is THAT crazy! Joe Pesci plays this gangster with such brilliance and precision! It seems effortless the way he just talks and acts. It's like he is a real-life gangster himself! That's how convincing Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito! I also find it pretty amazing that I picture an Italian gangster to be someone like Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito. The way he talks, acts and the things he says.\n\nMoving on, let's talk about the genius mastermind that we can all thank for making this film, Martin Scorsese! Scorsese wrote the screenplay for 'Goodfellas' alongside Nicholas Pileggi. Scorsese obviously also directed the film. Let me get down to the nitty-gritty. This motion picture has some outstanding cinematography! There is one scene when you can see characters walking inside a restaurant through the back and the camera always staying behind them as they move from one room into the next. The way it was shot blew me totally away!\n\nThe film also has really fitting musical choices with lyrics that can partly tell the story without any voice-overs needed. Now THAT is not something you experience in a lot of movies out there.\n\nAs if I haven't given the film enough praise already, I need to commend the editing department for doing such a fantastic job with the pacing of the film as well as the great transitions between the scenes!\n\nOn top of that I definitely appreciate that this is not a predictable film. Furthermore it is a very rewatchable film because, despite being over 3 decades old, it still manages to stay so relevant, fresh, timeless and unique, all at the same time!\n\nBefore I wrap up this review of mine, I most certainly need to compare this film with Scorsese's other mobster movies! In my opinion 'Goodfellas' is better than 'Mean Streets' (1973) and 'The Departed' (2006) while not being quite as great as 'The Irishman' (2019) and 'Casino' (1995) in my opinion!\n\nI only really have two minor criticisms. Firstly the film is more interesting to me when it was about the gangsters interacting with each other. The scenes that were about Henry Hill's family and that whole side story was definitely good, but it was just not on the same level. Finally this movie wraps up a little too quickly for my taste. I thought the ending was a bit too abrupt. Like I said I only have \"minor\" criticisms!\n\nOverall, Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' is one of the best motion pictures ever made! This is an absolute must-see for anyone out there who, for some reason, hasn't seen it yet! 'Goodfellas' has been hugely influential in pop culture and it is still constantly referred to by many people, especially comedians! Martin Scorsese, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Beautiful! 8/10"

Martin Scorsese delivers again.\n\nThere's quite a bit of violence- it can be sudden and unexpected. Also, if you're a bit sensitive to swearing, this may not be the film for you (thanks Joe Pesci). But all in all, if you like Italian mafia films where there's no real winners and constant drama and tragedy, you surely won't be disappointed by this cinematic masterpiece."

Henry Hill is an awesome character, even though he is a villain. I actually really like the ending of this film, although it is not even one of the best scenes in the film. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, even Samuel L. Jackson is in this masterpiece! Watch it, you'll have fun watching it 2 hours and 30 minutes and you'll never get bored. N E V E R. You could watch it 10 Million times and still having fun! The weird thing is that is a comedy. I mean it has some funny stuff you could never see, on other gangster movies like Scarface, The Godfather, The Irishman, or even American Gangster. It is not PERFECT, every movie has a bad thing or two, but this is just amazing."

In this case, the directing is by Scorsese and the acting by Deniro, Pesci and Liotta so its all superb. Throughout the movie you get the classic comedy that comes along with Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro and some great music to go along with all these great scenes. A lot of people claim that the godfather is the greatest movie of all time. To me, watching Goodfellas is just as engrossing but more fun to watch thanks to Pesci, Deniro and Liotta. Goodfellas is just one of those movies that movie critics can enjoy, but so can your average movie watcher."

However, as good as 'The Godfather' is, there's something about 'Goodfellas' that I enjoy more.\n\nMaybe it's the way the story is told, or the fact that the violence in 'Goodfellas' is a lot more ruthless and brutal. It also has more entertainment value compared to the plot-heavy Godfather. Whatever the reason, 'Goodfellas' is a film I enjoy immensely and is up there as one of my favourites in the crime genre.\n\nAside from the story, 'Goodfellas' is a near perfect piece of filmmaking, with a witty and intelligent script, brilliant acting throughout, and terrific cinematography. 'Goodfellas' is a near flawless movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Goodfellas is a wiseguy movie with them doing wiseguy things. You know: robbing and stealing. Beatings and wackings. Extorting and racketeering. Cussing and swearing. I don't want to minimize the movie to just that but that was the gist of it all.\n\nThe movie is told from the view of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a gangster that loved mob life and all it had to offer. Henry Hill is essentially doing a tell all about being a mobster and how mobs operate.\n\nWhat I found most interesting about the movie my second time watching was how sanctimonious mobsters are. Almost like because they have rules that govern their illicit behavior they're better than other criminals. Sure, they'll rob, steal, kill and other crimes but their criminality is not like the criminality of others; almost like there is a nobility to their criminality. The reverence to that lifestyle and the Italian mafioso culture in general could be heard and felt throughout the movie. Henry Hill absolutely loved being a mobster. When I was younger I was fascinated by the lore of it as well (albeit from a great distance, as in from an audience watching on movies) but now I see them as criminals like anyone else. Granted, they are more successful at it than most and they have done very well with their PR but they are still criminals.\n\nGoodfellas actually made me see that as Henry narrated about the beatings and killings of criminal and innocent people. Henry was wrapped into all kinds of lowlife activity. His two pals James Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci) were savages that would murder anyone in their way. And Tommy would murder just because--he had to be the worst mafia representative ever. So, Goodfellas, if anything, was good for drawing back the curtain on how the seedy world of Italian mobs worked."

Who doesn't get a chills through the spines when you get to see Scorsese'sbrilliant one takes and I certainly had goosebumps when the protagonist broke the 4th wall.at times the movie leaves the audience with a quest for high Adrenaline rushes while at times it leaves you cold and spineless.....Words can't describe how organised the screenplay has rolled out throughout this movie.

Its movie-mad references run the gamut from The Godfather to The Great Train Robbery; its soundtrack incorporates everything from Bobby Darin to Donovan, the Stones to Sid Vicious. (After that murder montage, filmmakers are essentially forbidden from using Layla's coda to score a scene ever again.) Its influence is incalcuable - you don't get a million moving-camera showstoppers without that Copacabana tour, and you definitely don't get the Tarantino, et al., mix of black humor and horrifying violence without Goodfellas' getting that combination down to a science first. And though Scorsese had made great movies before and would make great ones after this, this Mob-flick hit feels like a summation of his culturally specific, universally thrilling cinema about men on the edge. There are movies that may be more emblematic of the Nineties, but this was the one that set the pace for the entire decade - a high mark that left most other contenders to the throne looking like schnooks.

But, more importantly, about half way through, I was sickened by all the violence AND depravity that I just couldn't stomach any more and basically \"skimmed\" (fast forwarding about 5 minutes to watch 30 seconds, repeatedly) to the end just trying to see something redeemable that would validate all the unwarranted hullabaloo that was given this piece of crap.\n\nThe shame is that Scorcese has the ability to make great movies that include violence and violent personalities (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) but these are exceptions which everyone seems to remember and not the stinkers like The Color of Money, The Last Temptation of Christ or Goodfellas."

This masterpiece is a very ideal and captivating depiction of truthful gangster storytelling.\n\nDespite its prolonged runtime, Goodfellas will become your top favourite thanks to the marvellous directing of Martin Scorsese and graphically realistic performances, especially presented by the unforgettable stars known as Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Similar to most of Scorsese's crime films, you can expect strong adult content such as drug use, graphic violence and constant language. Explicit material, excellent direction and lifelike performances are all you really anticipate for in a mob movie.\n\nAgain, don't worry about the film's length. Every single scene is entirely necessary and provides you with something. There's always those uninteresting or slow scenes, but they're quickly squashed by the engaging next scene. The soundtrack is also very significant and there's constantly remarkable quotes. It's an undeniably amazing crime classic! And it's certainly one of the best films of all time.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

        "review_detailed_main": "In my mind this is the second best movie ever made after One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. Most people would argue that the Godfather 1 and 2 are the better mob movies. I must admit that the afformentioned movies are also brilliant and deserve to be in the top ten. I think the things that sways me towards Goodfellas are number 1, the dark sense of humour this movie imbues. The tone of the Godfather's can be much too serious at times. Just because it,s a serious drama doesn,t mean thers's no room for a little levity at times. This movie moves along quite nicely,while the Godfather gets a little bogged down at times....especially the wedding scene which in my mind was about ten minutes too long. Both movies had brilliant direction and performances....i guess i'll call that one a draw. If you like this one check out Casino. It's not as good as Goodfellas or the Godfather's but still very deserving of a viewing. Other mob recomendations are Miller,s Crossing, the Untouchables, Once Upon a Time in America, Scar Face and the Godfather Part 3, yes i just said that."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow. This film is it. This is everything that makes a good film great and a great film legendary. Based on a true story spanning 30 years in the Mafia, this translation of Henry Hill's story to the movie screen was executed perfectly and stands as an obvious classic 25 years later.\n\nAbsolutely everything in this film is on point. The directing of 'Goodfellas' by Martin Scorsese is something of a landmark in film itself, how the man didn't win an Oscar for best director for this is beyond me. However, Scorsese's job must've certainly been easier whilst directing this set of actors who absolutely blew me away. The set and costume designs were also fantastic as they create a world that sucks you in and consumes your brain for it's run time.\n\nRobert De Niro and Ray Liotta are both superb in portraying their characters and bringing them to life for an audience on the big screen, De Niro is tremendous as usual and Liotta was a perfect casting choice for Henry Hill. Liotta's scene where he walks across the street to confront the man was sexually harassing Karen and then begins to bash his skull in with a pistol is seriously one of the most memorable, timeless and also haunting scenes in the film. Henry Hill's anger and expression stay with you for a while after that scene, despite it being pretty short.\n\nWhilst my hat is off the whole cast and crew behind this absolutely timeless classic, the man my applauds have to go to Joe Pesci. Pesci's portrayal as Tommy in this film is sensational, he owns the screen in every single scene he is in and undoubtedly deserved his Oscar for this performance. The improvised \"How am I funny?\" scene chokes you out with tension, tension only really being there because you never know what a man like Tommy DeVito could do and that is something Joe Pesci represented in this perfectly.\n\nIn my opinion, 'Goodfellas' is one of the greatest films of all time that has the perfect mix of sensational writing, acting and directing, bringing it all together to create a memorable and beautiful film that is re-watchable over and over."

Long film depicts a lifetime, but as the film shows a Mafia/ at least one crime in his life, I can note that when you do not manufacture and deepening interest in the characters, you just can not make a connection between the character and the viewer. Unfortunately, it happened to me.\n\n8/10 in my opinion"

        "review_detailed_main": "Quite solid for a biography, but it certainly lacks the connection to the main character. So much so, there are some parts that is not told from the protagonist's perspective, but instead exposed by other characters. The same thing applies to narrating from someone else's perspective. Albeit typical for this type of movie, the narration is monotone, plain and explains trivial things that did not need narration - almost as an after-thought. As if what was shown on screen was not enough, and they wanted to make sure they had convinced the audience that the gangsters were rich and powerful...\n\nThe protagonist is difficult to connect with, as some actions are not shown until after the fact, and the lack of expressed emotions, thoughts and motives, makes him difficult to find likeable. The acting overall is quite bad, especially at the times where acting were vital.\n\nAlthough some story was told here, it was not really compelling. A lot of names were thrown around, money-bundles were exchanged and bullets went flying, but overall it felt unnecessary. Sure, the fact that the characters were untouchable was already obvious without the reoccurring narrator, but that also ruins any potential suspense and thus, the entire movie is a breeze - regardless of what happens, the character is unmoved and it perfectly fits with the flat acting."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was first introduced to Scorsese's work with 'Taxi Driver', and was immediately compelled to rush out and rent 'Mean Streets' and then Scorsese's first, 'Who's that Knockin'?' Although these films were both uneven in places, I still saw the same brilliance. So of course I had to rent 'Goodfellas', right? It is in everyone's top 100. And I was monumentally disappointed. There was no struggle with moral issues. These guys were just violent jerks for whom I had no sympathy. I *wanted* them to get caught so someone would get them off of the street (and off of my TV screen). Ray Liotta is such a pretty boy that he could never match DeNiro or Keitel in my book. And the violence in this movie was just sickening and unnecessary. Sorry, folks, disagree with me all you want, but I'm sorry I ever decided to watch 'Goodfellas' and I haven't felt compelled to pick up a Scorsese flick since."

        "review_detailed_main": "Goodfellas (1990) directed by Martin Scorsese himself is a movie that tells the story of a person who becomes involved with a crime family and experiences both success and downfall over 25 years.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" by Martin Scorsese is an amazing movie that takes you back to the 1990s. The film's cinematography is over the top, showing Scorsese's incredible skill in filmmaking. The frames in \"Goodfellas\" are very well done, with carefully crafted camera shots that help tell the story.\n\nThe narration in the film stands out for its engaging quality. It's not just about the story being told but rather it's how it's being told.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is also good at character development. Each character is clearly defined, with their own unique personalities that make the story more interesting. The actors did a great job being real and versatile, which made the film feel authentic. Tommy is a standout character. His funny way of talking and his spontaneous behavior make the movie more entertaining and exciting.\n\nScorsese uses his signature cinematic techniques, like fast camera movements and smooth zoom-ins and zoom-outs, exceptionally well. These elements define the look of \"Goodfellas\" and show Scorsese's artistic style in making movies.\n\nIn terms of sound design, the sound design isn't balanced well, especially when the narrator's voice is louder than other sounds. However, the music in the movie adds nicely to the overall atmosphere.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is a movie that feels real and genuine. The characters' emotions are real and clear, making the characters and their experiences relatable. Hence, the film is worth watching again.\n\nIn summary, \"Goodfellas\" is an incredibly well-made movie. This movie is special because it has great storytelling, interesting characters, and unique cinematography. It stands out among Martin Scorsese's other films. Although it has a few small flaws, it is still an influential and famous movie that keeps people interested."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story follows Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, as he narrates his rise through the ranks of the Italian-American mob in New York City. Alongside his partners in crime, Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), Henry experiences the allure and consequences of the gangster lifestyle. As the stakes get higher and the lines between friendship and treachery blur, Henry finds himself caught in a web of deceit and violence.\n\nMartin Scorsese's direction is masterful, capturing the essence of the gangster lifestyle with authenticity and flair. The film's pacing is relentless, drawing the audience into a world where power, money, and status come at a high cost. Scorsese's use of voice-over narration, dynamic camera work, and a vibrant soundtrack set the mood and propel the story forward with a pulsating energy.\n\nThe performances in Goodfellas are nothing short of exceptional. Ray Liotta delivers a career-defining performance as Henry Hill, skillfully portraying the character's transformation from an ambitious young man to a seasoned criminal. Robert De Niro is magnetic as Jimmy Conway, bringing a mix of charm and menace to his role. However, it is Joe Pesci who steals the show with his electrifying portrayal of Tommy DeVito, a volatile and unpredictable figure. The chemistry among the cast is palpable, adding depth and authenticity to the relationships portrayed on screen.\n\nGoodfellas is an unflinching exploration of the consequences of a life steeped in crime. It delves into the moral ambiguity of the characters, presenting them as complex individuals with their own motivations and justifications. The screenplay, co-written by Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi, is a masterclass in storytelling, seamlessly blending moments of intense violence with dark humor and poignant reflection.\n\nThe film's technical aspects are top-notch. The cinematography, courtesy of Michael Ballhaus, captures the gritty realism of the streets and the opulence of the mob's lifestyle. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is sharp and precise, allowing the narrative to flow seamlessly across decades while maintaining a sense of urgency and tension.\n\nGoodfellas is a cinematic achievement that transcends the crime genre. It explores themes of loyalty, identity, and the seductive allure of power. The film's impact extends beyond the screen, influencing subsequent crime films and leaving an indelible mark on popular culture.\n\nIn conclusion, Goodfellas is a riveting and authentic portrayal of organized crime that showcases Martin Scorsese's mastery of his craft. With exceptional performances, expert direction, and a compelling narrative, the film stands as one of the greatest entries in the genre. It offers a chilling and thought-provoking look into the dark side of human nature, leaving the audience both entertained and contemplative. Goodfellas is a must-watch for fans of crime cinema and those seeking a film that delves into the complexities of loyalty, betrayal, and the pursuit of power."

He enjoys his life of money and luxury, but is oblivious to the horror that he causes. A drug addiction and a few mistakes ultimately unravel his climb to the top. Based on the book \"Wiseguy\" by Nicholas Pileggi.\n\nOne word to describe this film is perfect. All the aspects you look for in a mobster film are just perfect in Goodfellas. From the voiceover in the beginning, to the songs, the acting (from a superb cast), the action, and the visuals; they're all just perfect. And Martin Scorsese can be given credit for a lot of those perfections due to his amazing direction of this movie.\n\nThroughout the movie, many minor events are encountered, which I personally don't like in movies, however this film is crafted in such a good way that the 2 hours and 25 minutes that are filled with entertainment and pure enjoyment pass by so quickly. The script of this movie is stunning as it gives all the necessary details for the audience to feel attached to some of the characters and feel pure hatred to some others and giving us many memorable quotes.\n\nScore:9/10."

Every time I see Pesci I think Mafia stooge; that's just the way he comes off in all his movies. He plays his role to perfection. He definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro was fantastic too, although this wasn't the normal role he plays. He was still a tough guy in this movie, but he was really paranoid throughout the whole thing. Every time I saw him on screen I could tell how badly he wanted in \"the family\", so he played that part perfectly. If the Godfather movies had never been made, then this would be the top Mafia movie out there."

        "review_detailed_main": "The life and times of Henry Hill and his mob association.\n\n'Goodfellas' is Martin Scorsese's classic adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's book that combines brilliant visuals, memorable dialogue and great performances.\n\nI think the subject is a matter of taste based on how much interest you have in violent criminals. The social constructions that attract certain types of people to the lifestyle is one of the strongest aspects and is portrayed in a fairly seductive way by the filmmakers. However, the extreme violence, greed, selfishness, and disloyalty of the main characters is rightly emphasised in scenes that linger in the memory.\n\nIt is notable for naturalistic and entertaining dialogue that stems from improvisation during rehearsals. Virtually all characters have the opportunity to contribute and there are so many memorable lines it is hard to pick favourites.\n\nVisually for me it is a masterpiece. There is so much iconic cinematography, perfectly cut together and enhanced by music from the era. Michael Ballhaus and Thelma Schoonmaker are as much the stars as the actors. I never tire of watching that walkthrough at the Copacabana.\n\nRay Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Paul Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco are all amazing. However, Joe Pesci stands out as a terrifyingly murderous \"funny guy\".\n\nIt is one of those films that is too good in some ways. It has such an impact that it prompts life to imitate art. Just like 'Jaws' made people go out and kill sharks, I know of 'Goodfellas' fans who emulate the mannerisms and personality traits of characters like Tommy, Paulie and Jimmy (minus the brutal murders) because they think its cool. An unfortunate side affect of a great movie of which some individuals miss the point."

Somewhat other details are visible on the scene mostly\n\nThe film talks about liberation, stereotypes, and entering a new world for humanity. It was Ray Liotta (Henry). He wanted, as I said, to break free from stereotypes and enter the world of gangs.\n\nMartin Scorsese (the director) filmed this unfamiliar life and directed it in the form of a film similar to documentaries because he filmed it as if it were a real, realistic life. That is why the presence of Voice Over was important in order to give you the feeling that there is a person sitting next to you telling you the story while whispering in your ear as it happens in the movies documentaries."

Joe Pesci, who I usually find funny, began to irritate me but Paul Sorvino's Pauly truly made me feel like I could identify with these characters...he was awesome! The rest of the cast really helped to pull this amazing movie together. Then to find out it was actually based on a true story, WOW! There is no way that you can watch Goodfellas and tell me you didn't enjoy it! I did and I am super finicky with what I watch....I not only give this movie 2 enthusiastic thumbs up but I encourage you to re-watch it if its been a while!"

While their success grows, troubles begin to arise, and Hill, Tommy, and Jimmy Conway must cover their tracks as the feds, other crews, and other members close in on them.\n\nThe stylish drama contains some of the best shot scenes in history, scenes as mundane as Deniro puffing a cigarette, a celebrational Christmas party, Pesci's funny storytelling, husband and wife stuff, and one of the best filmed scenes itself where the camera longtracks Liotta and Bracco from behind as they go for their first real date to a restaurant and mobster meet up.\n\nOne of the most influential crime dramas in history, Goodfellas also has undeniable consistent dark comedy undertones, and the twists are always shocking and entertaining.

I had high expectations for this movie as it was directed by Scorsese, and featured De Niro from \"The Godfather Part II\" and \"Taxi Driver\" and this movie did not disappoint at all.\n\nThis is along with \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather Part II\" some of the greatest movies out there and really represent the peak for gangster movies. Everything about this movie alone is perfect, from the pace of the movie to the cinematography to the acting. The acting is flawless from start to end and in my opinion, features some of the best performances I have ever seen. The performances were so great that it gave every scene the appropriate level of suspense. Well done De Niro, Pesci, Liotta, Bracco, and other supporting actors.\n\nThis film is very well-paced and goes at its own rhythm and does not feel rushed o slowed-down at any point, and the story just naturally unfolds and is told to us as we are watching. Another note in the plot, the movie is very unpredictable at times and has a great element of surprise, as it includes some very unexpected events occur.\n\nOn the technical side of the movie, it delivers as much as the plot and acting, the editing of the movie is excellent, it is just right for this movie, and does not feel like the editing style is trying to fit in this movie. The soundtrack is nearly perfect and delivers along with the performances of the appropriate level of suspense and intensity in each scene of the movie.\n\nOverall, GoodFellas is one great movie and automatically a classic in the gangster genre and in general movies as well. It struggles to have a weakness at any moment in this film. Everything in this movie feels like a perfect. Do yourself and at least watch this once in your lives. You will not regret it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Goodfellas makes a strong case for itself as the most overrated movie of the 80s or any decade. Never in my life have I encountered a film less deserving of its critical and popular accolades. After watching it for the second time recently (to make sure my impression from a viewing years earlier was accurate), I feel every person involved in the picture, and particularly Martin Scorsese, deserves to be punished severely for inflicting Goodfellas upon me.\n\nGoodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. It has neither the wisdom nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human beings. Anyway, Goodfellas is not interested in that. It just wants to be smart, hip, and funny. With such lofty goals, it's a wonder this entire star-studded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very, very short.\n\nGoodfellas is not smart. It is not intelligent enough to understand what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. It does not somehow explain or explore the mob psyche, the existence of organized crime in America, or anything else for that matter. Despite the fact that it is taken from actual events and people, it seems to desire no contact with reality.\n\nGoodfellas is not hip. Apparently Martin Scorsese was not aware that there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. Goodfellas is full of flashy camera moves, tough looking guys in swank suits, and more fast, colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of Dashiell Hammett, but none of it adds up to anything but slime. Yes, that's right: slime. Goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the page from which they sprang. Is this an honorable aim for a film? To make you hate its characters, to make you hate its voice? Let me be the one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness, and as an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. Real cynicism has no place in art.\n\nGoodfellas is not funny. A complete lack of respect for human life is not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. It is disgusting, really, and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor.\n\nThe performances in Goodfellas, much lauded, are ridiculously one-sided. How wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking tough and looking smug - all except for Ray Liotta who has to do the balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. Bravo.\n\nOf note is Scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the film, presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are busy ignoring his movie.\n\nGoodfellas is trash. Utter trash. The only thing I took out of it is that it is unwise to let a gangster stand behind you."

I thought that the composition of the story of this movie and the atmosphere of the movie was very similar to Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. Especially the first half hour. The camera moved very well, and it was difficult for the audience to get bored at the same time. The shooting is very admirable. Each picture is very beautiful. It was beautiful because it was a film. There is characteristic music everywhere. How to use how music is very wonderful. Inundation of music. The camerawork, photography and music symphony attracted us. If you look at the other films of this director, the scripts are always never a masterpiece. We screenwriters shouldn't try to learn scripts from this director. However. Though, the minimum elements that do not get the customer bored are included in the script. Overall of those is very similar to Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. I was surprised that the great movie had such a good example. And I think that the director's true greatness is to discover a new atmosphere like this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those movies that you can give as a good example anytime you want to mention movie-making brilliance to anyone.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is a true gangster classic; a complete picture of the mafia and its operations. Comparisons to \"The Godfather\" movies are inevitable, but I shall say only this: both are great classics in their respective places and deal with separate stories; \"The Godfather\" movies are a riveting look at the goings-on in the life of the Corleone Crime family, while \"Goodfellas\" is a portrayal of the life of the mobsters who actually do all the jobs that some head of a crime family might want done! Also, \"Goodfellas\" has more of a \"jolly\" mood throughout the movie; you find yourself experiencing a feeling of triumph every time they pull off a job! \"The Godfather\" movies on the other hand have more of a somber atmosphere, enhanced by their sepia overtones, and topped off with a very serious and grave approach to story-telling.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is based on the true story of a young man named Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who grows up to be a gangster in the company of other gangsters he has always admired! These include Jimmy (Robert De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino).\n\nThe movie takes an inside look at the operations carried out by the New York Mob. It also shows how Henry along with his partners Jimmy and Tommy, carries out a number of heists.\n\nAll throughout the movie, these gangsters seem to be having complete fun, with things going their way all the time! It's only towards the end that things start to fall apart....\n\nThere are some terrific scenes which have already gone down as classics and only get better with repeated viewings; there's some very witty and fantastic dialog (most of which is hogged by the brilliant Joe Pesci).\n\nActing: Ray Liotta is great in the lead; but the best performances are by Robert De Niro (even though he has less screen presence), Joe Pesci (awesome, the way he mouths off the sharp dialog) and Paul Sorvino. Lorraine Bracco is superb as Henry's wife, Karen.\n\nWonderfully directed, brilliantly acted, this thoroughly entertaining movie is a must-see! One of Martin Scorsese's best, along with \"Raging Bull\"."

It's speechless for how great this movie was and it still is. GoodFellas is a fantastic crime drama and it's impeccably done throughout. The story is based on a true story ad it's taken place from 1955 to 1980. It tells a story about Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta narrating about his life as a gangster. Lorraine Bracco sometimes narrates as Karen Hill, aside from that, Ray Liotta does all the narrating. It's in the book. It's in the non-fiction book by Nicholas Pileggi called Wiseguy. Of course, everyone knows the scene where Henry tells Tommy that he is funny cause the way he tells stories and Tommy says \"What do you mean I'm funny?\" \"Funny how, I mean funny like I'm a clown, I amuse you?\" This is a famous scene for Joe Pesci as his acting is incredible. As far as this film goes, this is a perfect film for everyone who is a huge fan of Martin Scorsese. It has a great story that is so true, fantastic Oscar winning acting by everyone who played great characters and best direction from Martin Scorsese. It's everyone's favourite film of all time and considered one of the greatest films of all time. Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut."

Based on Nichola Pleggi's book 'wise guy', this masterpiece directed by the phenomenal Martin Scorsese, narrates the true story of an Irish-Italian mobster- Henry Hill spanning over a period of 30 years.\n\nComing from a working class background in Brooklyn, Henry who always wanted to be a mobster was taken under the wings by a local gangster 'Paulie' at the age of 11. Initially running small errands, Henry gradually went up the ladder to become one of the closest associates to Paulie. The fascinating mob culture and its ghastly, gut wrenching business hiding behind the glamourous life of new York city mafia from the 50s to the 80s is exposed through Henry's eyes.\n\nHenry and his associates had pulled up one of the largest heists in American history- The Lufthansa theft after which a number of mobsters where brutally killed by them out of paranoia. However greed, deceit, drugs and certain catastrophic choices eventually lead to the downfall of this mafia in 1980.\n\nThis movie has a stellar cast and mind-blowing performances by the legendary actor Robert De Niro as James Burke or Jimmy- the master mind behind the heist, Joe Pesci who won an Oscar for his role as the psychotic Tommy DeVito, Ray Liotta as Henry and Lorraine Bracco.\n\nProbably one of Martin Scorsese's finest mobster movie this classic is a must watch."

In one way you even want to be a gangster because you see them laughing, happy, having fun and such a good time, but then suddenly it shows them killing or robbing the innocent, and then you don't really want to live like that. Sometimes even a mixture of the two settings to make you feel especially strange. It shows them both so well and at the same time that every person who sees the movie interprets it in a different way. Sometimes the mood they feel depends on the mood before the movie starts. I've heard many different ways people interpreted the movie's expressions and moods, but I always here one thing that's always the same; Goodfellas is one of the greatest movie's of all time."

Meanwhile, Henry is easily cheating his wife : Lorraine Bracco with a lover : Debi Mazar . Cocaine addiction and many wiseguys misteps with maniac fits of fury resulting in death of far-reaching consequences , and ultimately unravel his climb to the top and bitter fall .\n\nThis quintaessential Mafia saga about wiseguys or goodfellas at turns funny and violent , as the familiar elements of the genre are all strongly and gratingly in place . Being based on facts , in fact starring is really Henry Hill , ex-gangster now in the Witness Protection Program. Interesting and twisted screenplay , being adapted from the book written by Nicholas Pileggi . Cared pacing , well photographed and adequate musical score accompany the moving action , adding amazing , senseless bursts of grisly violence . Magnificent and fast-talking interpretations , particularly Ray Liotta , Lorraine Bracco ,Robert De Niro , Paul Sorvino , and Joe Pesci pitching in in around the corners and whose deliberately one-key acting makes his role seems to be the most dangerous .\n\nGreat secondary cast , such as : Michael Imperioli , Mike Starr, Beau Starr, Samuel L Jackson , Frank Vincent , Debi Mazar , Peter Onorati, Ileana Douglas, Frank Silvero and and look for Scorsese' mom as Pesci's mom , Catherine Scorsese . Colorful and visionary cinematography by Michael Ballhaus. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Martin Scorsese, though certanly too long . This master filmmaker has a prestigious career , making a lot of excellent films, such as : \"Mean Streets , After Hours , Boxcar Bertha , Alice doesn't lives here anymore, King of Comedy, Taxi Driver , New York New York, Raging Bull , Casino , Cape Fear , The Age of Innocemce , Shutter Island , Silence , The Irishman and of course this Goodfellas\" . Rating : 7.5/10 , above average . Worthwhile seeing for Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta fans . Essential and indispensable watching ."

        "review_detailed_main": "When he was asked to name the best films of the 1990s, film critic Roger Ebert not only ranked Martin Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" as the best next to \"Fargo\" (1996) but also labeled it \"the best mob movie ever.\" A friend of Scorsese's, Ebert also labeled the filmmaker as the finest director in the United States today. To me, \"Goodfellas\" is not the best film about organized crime. That reward goes to \"The Godfather\" (1972). But if there ever was a film to replace \"The Godfather\" (1972) as the best mafia movie, \"Goodfellas\" would be it.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is one of those rare cases where a true story about violence and ferocity is adapted for the screen but without bringing it to a glorious sense like \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962). The said 60s film took a tale of heroism mixed with narcissistic violence to create a sweeping epic. What Scorsese does is take the dark plot of the underworld and the mafia and make it look exactly like what it was and still is today. It is a fabulous retelling of the story of Henry Hill, a part-Italian kid who grew up amongst the mobsters and sought to become one of them.\n\nUnlike other mob movies, \"Goodfellas\" does not make heroes or role models out of its characters. The movie centers around the people of the mafia underworld and avoids the civilians who would ultimately become victims of them and their ways. Instead, Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi make cruel and dislikable characters and masterfully command the cast into representing them. Most particularly is the character played by Joe Pesci. The character, again based on a real-life person, is like a tender human explosive. Just touch the surface of it and it goes off, tearing or blowing apart anything that provokes it. Pesci's character is the kind of man who if you insult him verbally, even as a joke, he will beat you half to death or just whip out his gun and empty it into your heart and then sit down and finish whatever he was doing in the first place and not shed a tear or let out a sigh of regret over your mangled remains. Like a wild animal, he is unpredictable and cannot be controlled; only put down. And the sickening thing is that Robert De Niro's character is actually fond of this monstrosity of a man. We only learn the bad sides of these men; not their good sides, for they probably lost it all when they joined the mafia. We see them cheat on their spouses, murder people in broad daylight, traffic drugs, destroy property, and again, they do it for their own satisfaction. There's no morality, not even among themselves. The movie opens with a brutal scene of what these men do and yet the Ray Liotta character immediately states afterward: \"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States\u0085it was there that I knew that I belonged.\"\n\nThis is a brutal and savage world these men lived in and Martin Scorsese excellently brings this back to screen to give us a new impression of the mafia and reminds us that these kind of people still exist today and are not heroes or images for civilized people not even in the vaguest sense. In regards to the cast, it is perfect. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for his performance) were quintessentially cast in their roles. The only part I thought was wrongly developed was Lorraine Bracco's character. I just felt the character was either too over the top or Bracco overacted a little, but this is a forgivable weakness and it's hardly a weakness at all. There is also the two-and-a-half-hour running time, which I felt was just a little too long. But these few minor flaws aside, \"Goodfellas\" is certainly one of the most important films of the past twenty years in an era where Hollywood seems to have lost its motivation for films beyond the conventional range."

But none could quite surpass the experience offered by Martin Scorsese's magnum opus, \"Goodfellas.\" A testament to the adage that fact can be stranger than fiction, Goodfellas not only mesmerized me but also reshaped my understanding of the power of storytelling.\n\nWhile Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" is hailed as the greatest film of all time, for me, \"Goodfellas\" ascends a step further. Beyond just being a film, it's an immersive experience, creating a world so compelling that one doesn't simply watch, but rather, becomes a part of it.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is no mere movie.

Scorsese adapts Nicholas Pileggi's novel, \"Wiseguy,\" to present a gripping narrative rooted in reality, thus proving that a true story, when well-told, can be as, if not more, captivating than fictional works.\n\nThe dialogues of the film are a tour de force - memorable, impactful, and infinitely quotable. They're a powerful testament to Scorsese's skillful storytelling, etching themselves into your memory and sparking conversation years after you've left the cinema.\n\nThe cinematography is nothing short of masterful. Each shot, each angle, each frame serves a purpose, painting a vivid picture of a world not many of us know, but are nevertheless intrigued by. Scorsese takes you on a visual journey that's as captivating as it is unsettling.\n\nAt the heart of \"Goodfellas\" is Joe Pesci's electrifying performance as Tommy DeVito, for which he earned a well-deserved Oscar. His ten-second acceptance speech at the Academy Awards stands as a symbol of his raw and pure talent - no frills needed. Pesci's portrayal of DeVito is arguably one of the greatest performances in film history, embodying a character so complex and volatile, it's impossible to look away.\n\nThe pacing of \"Goodfellas\" is a masterclass in filmmaking. There's never a dull moment as Scorsese expertly navigates through decades of organized crime, maintaining the narrative tension throughout. The movie flows like a torrential river, carrying its audience through a whirlwind of emotions.\n\nComplementing the visuals and narrative is the incredible soundtrack that pulsates through every scene, enhancing the emotional landscape of the characters. From the adrenaline rush of the criminal high life to the unnerving paranoia induced by overindulgence in drugs, the music adds a layer of authenticity that amplifies the cinematic experience.\n\n\"Goodfellas,\" in essence, is a cinematic tour de force, a triumph in storytelling that pushes the boundaries of film, and the #1 movie in my list. Its influence stretches far, inspiring masterpieces such as \"The Sopranos.\" Yet, it stands tall in its uniqueness, a beacon of filmmaking that reminds us why we fall in love with movies."

The violence which we saw although harsh was artistic and thus a bit detached from reality. In fact we found the style of the film rather too artistic and atmospheric and after a 40 minutes we looked at each other and agreed we were bored by it. We could not relate to any or the characters in the film nor did we care what happened to them. So we turned it off and deleted it to make space for another film."

I'd never seen this, but knew some of the famous lines, which is no surprise given the popularity and high status this movie has.\n\nSadly, I grew up knowing Pesci from Home Alone and Gone Fishin' and My Cousin Vinny. I never caught him in these career defining roles. The man is terrifying with the intensity he brings. De Niro I knew from Meet the Parents and Stardust, I never got to experience the powerhouse performances. Ray Liotta.. I've seen him in stuff but he never made much impression on me. Aside from the big three, everyone in this is solid, there's no bad performances bringing it down.\n\nSadly, I think this suffers because I've seen other gangster movies. This feels sooooo much like every other mob movie. A lower grade Godfather, a less stylish Pulp Fiction, not as epic as The Irishman, and not as The Departed, it doesn't even explore the taxing nature of these lives as well Donnie Brasco. Almost all of these follow a young man coming up in the mob, loving it at first and then suffering for it.\n\nWhat Goodfellas has gong for it is a collection of exceptional moments. The overall movie may feel oddly derivative to me but there's no doubt that some scenes are exceptional. It's definitely an odd experience because I know this predates almost all of those but that's not been my experience and it definitely suffers in my eyes because of it."

It might be argued that Scorsese is trying to make a moral point here, but it just doesn't wash. A truly repulsive film."

        "review_detailed_main": "What makes Goodfellas such an enjoyable film for me would have to be its hard hitting, witty dialogue. If I have to pick a film that is a winner script-wise, Goodfellas would definitely be one of the top contenders. With a script like this, there are many lines that are good enough to be quotable, and it's very long list to choose from. And the desired effect is not only achieved by the script, it had to be the select number of people who be up to the task at bringing out the sharp wit of the characters and we have a cast that really shines in that department.\n\nWith Ray Liotta playing Henry Hill, his performance in letting you in on the character by putting you through his perspective with his narration alone is enough to pull you in and become captivated by the film. And as he pulls you into his world, we get introduced to numerous criminals he gets mixed up with such as Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci, who he plays with a lot of intensity that brings out a lot of the brutal elements in the film. When on screen, you can always sense something is going to go wrong, and what Pesci brings to this character is deserving of all the praise.\n\nEvery character evokes that sense of intensity that really gives this film its distinctive edge, but one person I seem to be captivated the most by in the movie would have to be Robert De Niro's performance as Jimmy Conway, who is crazier, but in his own more methodical way that is a lot more subtle than Tommy. What Bob brings to the table is something special that again shows how versatile he is as an actor and gives me another reason as to why I think he is the greatest actor ever. He may not be in every scene, but he is the foundation of the movie for me.\n\nThese are all great performances that help to bring out this story and to know that these are true events makes this film even more insane than it already is. While The Godfather felt more graceful and has placed a heavier emphasis on subtlety to make the violent scenes have more impact when they happen unexpectedly, Goodfellas is sharp all around its edges. Whereas The Godfather was violent, it offered insight into the human aspects of the criminals and the reasons they murdered for business. That sense of sentimentality is nonexistent in Goodfellas and offers a bare bones, raw insight into the crooked lives these criminals were leading, and with that, you get a story that is sharp like a knife that when it hits you, you'll know you'll never forget it."

This film kept me interested and engaged throughout, if a bit baffled at the depressingly violent lives that the characters chose to live.\n\nWe follow the life of a gangster with a voiceover (unnecessary in my view) telling us how young Henry is attracted to the glamour and power of the gangster lifestyle from childhood. It appears to be his only way out of a boring working class life.\n\nHenry makes his way up the ranks, although he realises that as a non-Italian he will never reach the top. Other than the money and the power it is difficult to understand what it is Henry enjoys about his maffia life. The mobsters live in a claustrophobic, paranoid world, where supposed friends can turn on each other at any moment. Most of the mobsters are obnoxious, violent psychopaths as well as complete morons. They blow their blood money on tacky homes, cars and clothes, greedy wives and sleazy girlfriends.\n\nHenry's wife gets a voice in this movie too, which is interesting. She willingly chooses this mobster to start a family with, despite the danger, the stress and the trauma it causes to her children (which we see crying a lot).\n\nAll in all, all of the main characters come across as highly unsympathetic and I found it difficult to understand what kept them in the horror lives they were living. But then again, once you've entered the world of crime, it is probably very difficult to get out.\n\nSo, perhaps it was a morality tale: stay away from the world of crime and drugs are bad, m'kay."

Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta would become household names, once this film was released. Martin Scorsese used his skills, as a film auteur and editor, to craft an amazing piece of Mafia crime drama. It is based on true events and characters found in the book \"Wiseguy\". The film chronicles the story of Mafia associate Henry Hill JR. From the years 1955-1980.\n\nAs you see young Henry grow up from selling and moving stolen cigarettes, to his days as an FBI informant, it is not the story that totally drives the film, but the execution by director Scorsese and the actors. It is an Academy Award winner that captures the feeling of the Mafia, as well as, the period pieces that it chronicles. Even though it takes place in a recent history, it still captures a charm from the olden days, which probably owes a gratitude to the great vast Italian culture, that gives it that galvanizing, vintage appeal. It is a film with everything and a modern classic of extraordinary proportions.\n\n9.5 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."

And it ain't - I mean isn't - bad at all, by any means. Nor, in my book, is it anywhere near great. Not by a long shot. It may be due, largely, although not sure yet, to Joe Pesci's one note characterization (way too typical of him). A little \"f\" word here and there never hurt nobody but goes just so far. It becomes not so much an aspect of his psychopathology but, with its over emphasis, weakens it, parodying what might be very legitimate. He was insane, and not a joke, but the character becomes jokey. How Ray Liotta did not get acknowledged for a much more realistic portrayal, and get at least a nomination for a part he brought dimensionality to, is a mystery. But, of course, the whole concept of an Academy Award is a mystery in and of itself. I mean, after all - Charlton Heston (in anything)?; Shirley Jones when you have Janet Leigh?; Rita Moreno opposite Judy Garland as well as Fay Bainter and Lotte Lenya?; not to mention the even more outrageous selection of Chakiris vs Clift and Geo. C. Scott?; Grace Kelly vs. Judy Garland????? Now, really! That one is going too far. And so on and forth. Give me Pesci in My Cousin Vinny anytime (not even a nomination).

Bracco and all the other molls getting their faces and nails done, scanning and re-scanning each of their thoughtless faces; the stop motion a dozen or more times capturing the characters silent, still; De Niro smiling at you with one of his 2 faces barely showing the 2nd face that will soon emerge and become the easy victor; the sense of confusion and then addiction that Liotta captures; the latter part where he describes in repetitive detail, in his drug-addled way, the order of the evening and transporting the pounds of cocaine to another city; dinner table with Mom and the 3 boys while the body in the trunk is writhing. Etc. A story told well enough in all of its pathetic realism. Scorcese is usually very good. It's this film that wasn't."

This film will be classed as one of the greatest for many generations to come. Sadly I missed the chance of watching this in cinema during the pandemic re-release but hopefully I will get to see it on the big screen at some point in the future. This is a film that I think Everyone should watch at least once in there lifetime. I think there will be very few who don't like it but most people will love it and it most likely will be one there all time favourites is well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Goodfellas has got to be one of the best mob movies I have seen. Not only that, it is probably the best Scorsese film I have seen so far. The acting, the dialogues, the setting, everything in this film is brilliant. Anyone who watches this film is guaranteed to love it. The plot is based on a true story of a real life mobster Henry Hill. It follows his beginnings as a kid growing up in Brooklyn who eventually works for a crime family. The reason why he wants to work for a crime family, is because \"as far back as he can remember he always wanted to be a gangster.\" Henry's life as a mobster forms the rest of the movie. Henry Hill is played by Ray Liotta, an actor that I wish to see more on the big screens. His portrayal of the real life gangster is as realistic as it gets. From the mannerisms to the speech delivery, it is almost like we are all thinking this is a real gangster. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy Gent, who takes Henry under his wing and in a way mentors him. The other guy Jimmy takes with him and who eventually works with Henry is Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci. This to me is the best performance of the film. DeVito is a character with a short fuse and Pesci played the character to perfection. This film shows why he is one of the finest actors of his generation and why he won an Oscar for his role. To me, his performance is what you will think of when the movie is over. All in all this was a fantastic film and definitely one of the best mob movies ever. As I said before, everything aspect of the film from start to finish is incredible. This is a film that no one should ever miss, especially if you are one who loves mob movies."

Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit. My Rating:10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Inventive, with some great performances throughout, and some brilliant directing from Scorsese, Goodfellas serves its right as one of the greatest crime dramas of all time- and at times can be a very fun film to watch. My biggest flaw with the film is the pacing, specifically towards the end, where it seems to be dragging on and overstuffed all at once. I feel in total the film could have been about 10 minutes shorter, but besides its lack in a very satisfying conclusion, the film can be very entertaining. For a film to be nearly 2 and a half hours long, it seems nearly impossible to be as entertaining as it often is. The writing, dialogue, and narration throughout is sharp and very intelligent, and the performances are pure gold- Joe Pesci especially. Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Lorraine Bracco also provide some very good performances, as well as the rest of the supporting and main cast. The cinematography is excellent, with some truly inventive and fun shots to follow, that simply make the film more enjoyable and endlessly watchable. The soundtrack is also great, as well as the atmosphere it provides for the film, and you will be sure to have a joy watching the film and its many parts at the very least some of the time. In the end, Goodfellas has its slower moments, but more often than not, Scorsese has made a brilliant crime film with some great performances, and lines that will be remembered for years to come. My Rating: 9.75/10"

Goodfellas is one of those great titles. The way the story begins already leaves the viewer completely caught up in the plot. The story is very engaging and the pacing is sensational. The film is long and at many points it is not even possible to notice the time passing. The actors are fantastic, there is no average performance throughout the film. Perhaps the only lower moment in the film is in the final hour, where a certain moment seems more dragged out than the rest. In short, Martin Scorsese's direction is perfect, all the scenes are beautiful and this is certainly one of the best mafia films in history, going head to head with The Godfather."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a Martin Scorcese fan as much as the next film lover. Having made at least 1 of the best films of the decade for each decade since the 70's, the director and his oeuvre are legendary. That's why when I finally sat down to watch \"Goodfellas,\" a film that many consider to be in the upper echelons of his work, I was surprised at how underwhelmed I ultimately felt.\n\nNow, being underwhelmed does not equate to thinking this is a bad movie. The craft of this film is undeniable. Each setting is lavishly and painstakingly created to transport us into the many different time periods the story covers, the ensemble cast is impeccable, the dialogue is always lively and engaging, and the camera work is timeless. Everything comes together perfectly to portray mafioso life as sleek, stylish, and sexy, as well as cold-blooded, two-faced, and horrific all at once.\n\nWhere the movie falters for me is in a lack of tension, a flaw of both screenplay and directing alike. All the above-mentioned descriptors can be captured in the first scene alone. Crazy mafia activity ensues, and enthralls us for what is going to come next. But then, at least in my experience, nothing comes next. It's scene after scene that can capture a facet of gangster life: how unhinged a character is, the irony of the lives being lived, etc. But it never ramps up to something greater, either in action or drama.\n\nTake the main protagonist, Henry Hill, for example. In the first scene, he utters his iconic line, \"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.\" So he does just that. He becomes a gangster with ease, rises through the ranks, gets married, experiences some hardships, some betrayals, standard gangster stuff. The movie portrays this all as matter-of-factly as I just did.\n\nThere's no character arc to speak of here. He never really changes or even struggles internally. The only things that change are the situations he is involved in. But with all the conflict being of a strictly external nature, even where the set-up is begging for some internal conflict, it never truly hit the dramatic boiling point I thought it should have. To be honest, it never even really got close.\n\nThat was my experience with \"Goodfellas\": all flash and no substance. I can't be too harsh on it, because again, it's about as perfect of a portrayal of the gangster life as there is. For myself however, if I want that experience to include actual drama and tension, I'll be revisiting \"The Godfather\" instead. If I want Scorcese's unique flavoring of the genre, I'll pick \"The Departed\" any day of the week."

Centred on the book 'wise guy', it focuses on how Henry Hill a former gangster worked his way up through the mob family.

I think this movie provides everything you would want to keep watching....Action, Romance, Suspense and even a bit of humour thrown in.\n\nUltimately I would argue this as one of the best movies I've ever seen.

No finer film has ever been made about organized crime - not even \"The Godfather,\" although the two works are not really comparable. GoodFellas,\" scheduled to open Sept. 21 in Chicago, is a memoir of life in the Mafia, narrated in the first person by Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an Irish-Italian kid whose only ambition, from his earliest teens, was to be a \"wise guy,\" a Mafioso. There is also narration by Karen, the Jewish girl (Lorraine Bracco) who married him, and who discovered that her entire social life was suddenly inside the Mafia; mob wives never went anywhere or talked to anyone who was not part of that world, and eventually, she says, the values of the Mafia came to seem like normal values. She was even proud of her husband for not lying around the house all day, for having the energy and daring to go out and steal for a living. There is a real Henry Hill, who disappeared into the anonymity of the federal government's witness protection program, and who over a period of four years told everything he knew about the mob to the reporter Nicholas Pileggi, whose Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family was a best-seller. \"GoodFellas\" is about guilt more than anything else. But it is not a straightforward morality play, in which good is established and guilt is the appropriate reaction toward evil. No, the hero of this film feels guilty for not upholding the Mafia code - guilty of the sin of betrayal. And his punishment is banishment, into the witness protection program, where nobody has a name and the headwaiter certainly doesn't know it."

Joe Pesci should stick to comedy, i.e. My Cousin Vinny or Home Alone. Pesci is not convincing as a maniacal mobster. He is almost cartoonish. Pesci's Tommy DeVito versus Luca Brasi is a huge mismatch. Ray Liotta is mediocre as the character Henry Hill. Paul Sorvino plays his Mafia kingpin character as tongue-in-cheek. Don't compare him to Brando's Corleone. The musical score, screen play, cinematography and directing is slighly above average. AFI 2008 had this movie rated 92nd all time (way too high).
