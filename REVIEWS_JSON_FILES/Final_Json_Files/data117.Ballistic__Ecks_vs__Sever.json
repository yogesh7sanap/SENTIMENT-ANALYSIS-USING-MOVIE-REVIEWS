With a total of 116 reviews, the highest for a film with a 0% score, \"Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever\" is the worst reviewed film in the history of Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe first thing wrong, really, is the title. Not knowing who Ecks or Sever are, why do I care if they are versus each other? Just call the film \"Ballistic\" so it doesn't sound like a sequel to a movie nobody saw. I'm guessing some ticket sales were lost because of the misconception of it being a sequel.\n\nOf course, that would not make it a better movie, but it would at least be less confusing."

I'm told that this has something to do with two assassins fighting each other after some one is kidnapped, but I'm not certain since things just sort of happen for no real reason. I would like to think that this movie was a big joke on the movie going public but no one would want to spend what it cost to make this movie as a joke, especially when there was no hope of ever getting the money back in ten thousand life times. A void unless your eyes need to experience cinematic blunt force trauma applied to them."

All the main characters are current or former US federal agents, presumably to keep it interesting, but all the action takes places in Vancouver, BC, which, last time I looked, was not in the United States. The basic storyline was fairly straightforward (and rather hackneyed), but the motivations of the various characters were utterly incomprehensible. The film was somewhat on the short side, and I couldn't escape the feeling that the three scenes which might have tied together the loose ends inexplicably ended up on the cutting room floor. Banderas phoned in his performance (for God's sake, enunciate, man), and the musical score was just irritating. The only two things \"Ballistic\" had going for it were the presence of some rarely-seen hardware (fun for you firearms buffs) and some spectacular action sequences (though these were plagued by some annoying clich\u00e9s, such as a protective vest preventing all injury to a character, and henchmen showing complete disregard for personal safety), and these were simply not enough to save this turkey. Avoid."

And cool slow motion flips through the air Matrix style and explosions - lots of them - are not going to change that. I have no idea what the background is between the two adversaries, no idea what makes the bad guy a villain, and no idea how they can spin this into a warm family drama, which they attempt to do at the end, I am just supposed to forget about all of those charred bodies left behind in Vancouver.\n\nThe director of this film goes by \"Kaos\". And somebody actually let him direct another film after this bomb. Granted, it was ten years later, but he got a second chance. I guess I could say to look at the video game of the same name for some guidance concerning the plot, but it is nothing like this film.

Everything in every area of filmmaking is wrong with Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever. Even the title as Banderas and Liu are not in competition with each other.\n\nHere's the plot. Oh, wait a minute, I can't tell you what the plot is because it doesn't exist. It just a massive load of old cobblers. And what's even worse is that the nonexistent plot is full of holes. Make sense? No didn't think so. It's not even worth watching to see what I mean.\n\nThe dialogue is the truly worst ever. At least the bad dialogue in movies such as Dolemite is eternally quotable. Ray Park's 'acting' makes Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal on their worst day look like Laurence Olivier. The 'action' is so basic it feels like a made for video production, it lacks anything resembling sophistication and excitement.\n\nI'm surprised Alan B. McElroy wrote this. He's done some good stuff (Wrong Turn, Spawn Animated Series) but this must have been something he wrote without much inspiration. Every writer comes up with a turkey but WHAT a turkey this is. Still, a bad script can sometimes make for a good movie if the delivery and direction has skill behind it. that ain't the case here.\n\nPositive energy does not surround this film!\n\nThe DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen."

But even a mindless action movie needs a lot more than just a catchy soundtrack and a bunch of dynamite to make it more entertaining than a 4-minute long Linkin Park video clip.\n\nEven a marginally decent action flick is capable of making the bad guys so nasty that in the end we don't have any choice but root for the good guys. However, Kaos is not even capable of rehashing that tried-and-true formula. His movie suffers from poor character development. I don't care if the good guys win, since the villains are so laughably two dimensional. They're just empty cardboard props ready to be used whenever necessary. Just like those villainy machine gun-toting anonymous robocops resplendent in their bombproof uniform, who miraculously keep getting back on their feet, even after being bombed at, shot at and booby-trapped.\n\nToward the end, we are subjected to lengthy and rather pointless scene of empty freight trains being blown up to pieces. I didn't really see the purpose of this scene. However, now thinking about it, I think the reasons for that scene is just to wake up the audience for the final showdown between the good guy and the bad guy!\n\nIn the end, when the arch villain asks Bandera's character Sever, 'That's it? That's what you're capable of, despite all that training?' We actually want to ask Kaos that very same question."

I had the impression of listening to a very bad video clip that only had explosions in it.\n\nDialogue 0/10 I think Lucy Lu had 3 lines in the movie. One of Banderas line was: \"Don't worry, I found you...I'll find him\" Wow, I was flabergasted. Unless you prefer...\"What do we do now\". I have nothing against one liner who doesn't love classics a la Clint Eastwood or Arnold great lines. But this...it's not one liners it's one line because they have nothing else to say.\n\nDirection: 3/10 Ok fights were fine, but aside this I could \"hear\" the director say to the actors place yourslef there and say this. There was NO direction plain and simple. All you see is a bunch of clips glued together with static caracters almost reading their 5 words line.\n\nHo I forgot the camera, closer than this and I could have counted Antonio's nose hair. This is just too close man..up in my face.\n\nAll in all really it is one of the worst (I'm in my 40's) Even if you love Banderas and or Lucy please do yourself a favor don't go spoil your image of them.

She was staring at a manatee in an aquarium. Then he shows up, they hug, we go to slow mo and some intelligence patronizing flashbacks and dialogue, and boom we understand the brilliance of the film.

Firstly, a five year old child could have come up with that plot (or lack there of). Second, a seven year old could have written the script. I would like to see the actual script and count the total amount of actual dialogue in the entire film. Besides the lack of dialogue and plot, the action scenes and stunts were terrible also (which unfortunately the producers must have been counting on, oops). Another theory might be that they were counting on mega action stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu. What a joke! At least I got to watch this garbage on television and didn't make the mistake of paying to see this junk in a movie theater for nine bucks."

The worst part of the movie is when Lucy gets a gun off a guy who has come to catch her; she runs out of ammo and magically pulls out a clip of ammo for that particular sub machine gun and continues her rampage. I know she is meant to be this killer rogue agent but to have spare ammo in those tight clothes is just unthinkable. I think this movie started as a good idea and ended up as a movie that could not live up to the trailer. Stay away from it trust me."

Liu can play manipulative and sexy on television programs but she doesn't possess enough physical prowess to exude a threatening demeanor that was required here. There's lots of bombs and smoke by hardly any engaging story or people. Director Wych Kaosayananda could have achieved the same results by pointing his camera at a chess match and then tossing a few firecrackers at all the pawns for an hour and half. I don't recommend this film at all. See The Avengers instead."

The same people that gave \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\" close to six stars gave this only 3.6? Ballistic was disjointed, over-edited, shallow, and cliched, but it was at least entertaining, unlike the barely-watchable \"Charlie's.\"\n\nLucy Liu was the only bright point in \"Charlie's,\" and as such is, in my opinion, completely under-utilized in this film. While she is given a chance to look great, she has few lines and little character building. She does the best she can with what she's been given. Banderas also does a good job with his stereotype character and manages to make him a bit less of a cardboard cutout than he what he started out as. Liu is very believable as a badass. She doesn't even blink when she fires a weapon and does a decent job of fighting in the non-stuntman scenes.\n\nThe blame for this movie's weak points rests mostly on the director. It seems like anything of any substance was cut in one of the \"artful\" cuts of current and past exposition that seem spliced and blended together almost at random. A good editor could probably fix some of this damage, dropping at least 5 minutes of run time, but another 10 to 15 minutes of footage would have to be added to give the story a hint of coherence. On the plus side, some of the photography was beautiful.\n\nBottom line: good action, crappy plot, looks cool, the two main character(s) are babes (depending on your gender/orientation). This is an average action movie that I probably will watch again sometime when I want something that doesn't engage my brain but has pretty things to look at. With explosions. Lots of them."

One stunt after another after another after--all strung together with conspiracy film clich\u00e9s--that, in a nutshell, is this film.\n\nThe film starts with the jaded FBI agent (Antonio Banderas--who seems half asleep in this role) being forced to rejoin....oh never mind, you know how this crappy clich\u00e9s will go. And ultimately, he'll be force to join his old nemesis, the super-dangerous Lucy Liu (!!) to fight the powers of not-niceness that threaten to control the destiny of the Free World. And so, to do this, they punch and kick, blow up stuff and kill. This is punctuated by kidnappings, mayhem and conspiracies--none of which seem anything more than plot devices.\n\nOverall, not a lot to provide interest to anyone--even stupid people. Silly--just the sort of action film you might expect Jethro Bodine to make--if he was real and had his uncle's millions to finance this dud. I could imagine him directing this thing and shouting \"Hoo-Wee--we gots lots of double-naught spies!!\"."

The characters are not developed, the story is confused, there is not acting... only explosions, more explosions and more explosions! I do not know how a producer can spend a large amount of money in such a film. In Brazil, this movie is called `Dupla Explosiva', which means `Explosive Double (Pair)'. Better off calls it `Explosive Garbage'. Tomorrow I am going to try to be reimbursed in the cost of this DVD. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): `Dupla Explosiva' (`Explosive Double')"

Watch her as she runs through an\n\nunderground parking garage in one scene. She runs with her mouth closed, just like that liquid terminator played by Robert Patrick in T2. Watch Antonio Banderas race around on a motorcycle without a helmet on. I was very surprised they let him do that.\n\nThis movie screams sequel to me.

Not only that, but they were unoriginal and unremarkable in every other way, so they did not add much in the way of entertainment value. Antonio Banderas seems far too old for this role, and is not an action hero in this movie whatsoever. The acting is mostly awful, very forced; therefore, emotional interest and character development is completely nonexistent. About the only thing good that I can say about this movie is that Lucy Liu kicks some ass in the action scenes. Unfortunately, she uses only one facial expression throughout the entire movie and has less than 30 lines of dialogue, if you can call it that. Do you remember the E*Trade commercial that ran last year where this guy sees a trailer on TV for a fake movie called \"Blow'd Up\" and then sells his stock in the production company because the movie looks so horrible?

I mean, the only way that you could revive this plot is with 10,000 volts of electricity. This is the type of movie that you find, while channel surfing late night movie channels. Or the type of movie they play on those same channels, at 2 pm on Saturday, as a filler before they bring out the good films. It is utterly forgettable the moment the opening credits start and it is forgotten the moment the closing credit starts. It fits right in there with Stallone's Assassins, umm, and things like Tango and Cash. Its not so bad, its just that it is totally bland. If you don't see it, you are not missing anything. This film will never be brought up in anyone's conversations about films. Let me back up... perhaps it will when discussing Kill Bill and trying to think of films Lucy Liu has been it.

Around just under half of the action sequences are okay, but the rest of them are very poor, particularly when it comes down to the hand to hand combat.\n\nThe story is about a couple of rival assassins who...well, I can barely be bothered typing it out. You know the routine. Antonio Banderas keeps his head down and tries to blend in for the most part, but the stand-out awful performance belongs to Lucy Liu, who once again utterly fails to convince as her supposed femme fatale character. The supporting cast are a little better, with a Talisa Soto cameo and a meaty bad guy part for Ray Park (Darth Maul in THE PHANTOM MENACE) who at least gets to kick plenty of backside without his face being painted.\n\nI admit to enjoying a couple of scenes in this one, particularly a stand-out moment in which a truck is hit by an RPG fired from a bridge; great stuff indeed.

Also, the excessive and unnecessary use of explosives reached to an annoying and \"make-me-want-to-kill-the-director\" level, I just wanted it to be over with this device of mental torture. I strongly urge you not to watch this piece of junk, steer clear from it at all costs and erase it from your memory forever."

It's mainly about two agents who used to work for the FBI and DIA who want revenge on a certain person for their own personal reasons. There really is not romance in the movie which is fine with me. There's almost no cussing that i can recall nothing big at least. some places are a bit unrealistic but hey, it's a movie. It is action packed filled with explosions and gun scenes. so if you're that type of person, go for it :]"

Neither of them we really care about since the explosions take center stage. I left the room about 20 minutes before the ending (I assume this unless there's more to the movie and the audience like me just got up and left) so I can't tell you anymore.

It just needed a little more expanding, maybe another half hour of story telling to flesh it out.

His interaction with Lucy Liu was well done.\n\nAs usual, Mr. Banderas looks great getting us butt kicked. He reminds of that clock that \"takes a licking and keeps on ticking\". There couldn't have been a bone left unbroken in his body.\n\nMaybe I'm too easily impressed, but lots of folks didn't rate this show very highly.

This way of acting suits them both excellently, and creates an attractive ambient atmosphere, energized by their martial encounters and growing mutual sympathy.\n\nThe bad guys (Gregg Henry as Gant and Ray Park as his right hand Ross) do not contribute a whole lot to this movie. Gant is the sinister/smug/self-absorbed crook which Gregg also embodied as Val Resnick in Payback, and Ross' vocabulary is annoyingly redundant, particularly his constant use of the euphemism 'cancel' (one might be inclined to blame this on the script, but more subtle acting could have pulled it off by not emphasizing 'cancel' each time).\n\nPerhaps what I like most about this movie is that Lucy has a major role. In her other movies she is mostly spice to the plot, although Lucky Number Slevin does allow her personality to surface. To me, Ballistic is the best Lucy-movie. She makes a very lovely femme fatale, even agonizingly crisp in a catsuit.\n\nDo not watch this movie if you consider lack of dialog synonymous with shallow acting, or if you are just not a fan of low-key acting. If, on the other hand, you enjoy good atmosphere in a movie, Ballistic may be one of those you want to return to from time to time.\n\nI give it a low 7, and would have gone higher if the feel of the movie were not occasionally fractured by the Gant and Ross characters."

Lucy Liu looked fantastic, her moves were spot on, and Antonio Banderas was surprisingly charismatic as an agent with little or nothing to lose. I had a bit of trouble understanding why they justified an R rating; there's almost no blood, no gore or dismemberment, and a (relatively) low body count. There are a lot of explosions, some relatively decent hands-on action, and lots of spent brass in this flick. It has more plot than a lot of recent action films, and I appreciated the choice to make Sever a woman (Sever was originally a male role). While the action occasionally comes across in the spirit of the old MAD Magazine's \"Spy vs. Spy\" cartoons, it's still worth the watch if you like Banderas, Liu or lots of cars blowing up."

        "review_detailed_main": "What can I say? Shame on the Razzies for not nominating this film for anything in 2002! Its score is zero on RT, and by gosh, I'm telling you that zero is well deserved.\n\nThis is one of the most excruciating messes I have ever sat through. The plot revolves around the kidnapping of the head of the DIA (Gregg Henry) young son by a mysterious agent named Sever (Lucy Lui). Enter Ecks (Antonio Banderas), who is forcibly recruited to the FBI after learning that his wife is still alive. He must track down Sever in order to get some microscopic weapon planted in the kidnapped boy in the midst of an action sequence between the DIA, FBI and the invisible Sever. Sever cannot be stopped as a well-trained assassin who uses every weapon available to thwart the DIA agents led by Ray Park's character. The incoherent plot and action sequences are both as confusing as each other, and neither do you care for either Ecks or Sever's as characters. The plot twist that occur are predictable and riddled with holes, and of course, there is no pretensions that Gregg and Park are really the bad guys from the onset. We know Ecks will eventually team up with Sever to fight them. The actions sequences are god-awful with the exception of one shot in the entire movie. Things just end up happening in this movie with no apparent reason. After all the big explosive gun battles, and lame motorcycle chase sequences, it's no surprise that the when the rivals square off that they throw away their weapons for some badly choreographed uneventful hand-to-hand combat! It doesn't matter if it's Ecks versus Sever, or Sever versus Ray Park- those guns get ditched regardless.\n\nWhen the plot and action are incoherent, it's bad enough that the dialogue and obvious exposition are as well. Antonio Banderas gives one of his worst performances of his career, as he seems to slur his lines consistently. Ray Park acts badly too, and is neither scary nor menacing like he was with make-up as Darth Maul and as Toad in the Star Wars and X-Men franchises But it is Lucy Lui who takes the cake of worst performance in this entire movie, and she proves to be one of the most boring kick-ass women in recent cinema. She should have had a Razzie for worst actress, cause her performance stunk and displays that she has a long way to go without a solid supporting cast.\n\nIn conclusion, this beats 'Crossroads' as the worst I've seen from 2002. And, although, many of you will wonder, \"what did you expect?\" from one of the most panned films of 2002 or from a film directed by a guy named Kaos. Let's just say, that some things are forced upon us, and like my equally frustrated mate said during an extremely long explosive action-sequence, \"God, I wish I was a part of that explosion, instead of watching this movie!\". That pretty much sums up the overall badness of 'Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever'! A big fat zero from me!\n\nNo score. 0 out *****!"

Well, there is one interesting and noteworthy thing to this: One particular stunt, which I'm not sure has been seen elsewhere. Apart from that... oh dear. You know those movies where you're just thinking \"how on Earth did this get made\"? Not so with this one. I know why it was done, because it's actually got a concept or two that could be amazing, if someone with talent had been handling it. No, we're looking at wasted potential, and so much of it you have to be astounded that they managed to fit it all into one 90-minute package of crap. In case you have heard a description of the music herein: Yes, it's awesome, and completely fitting for a flick of this type, however, every single piece is ruined and misused(is it too much to ask for that they at least *try* to make what happens on-screen follow the tunes?). In fact, all of the editing is pretty bad(have you ever wondered how one would go about messing up *flashbacks*, on the very basic level? Look no further). The plot has silly twists and doesn't all make sense... honestly, this whole thing is powerfully unengaging. Thus, not even the action gets the audience going, in spite of it not sucking all of the time. It is over the top once or twice, and someone needs to teach whoever put all those explosions in this thing the meaning of the saying \"less is more\". The martial arts are fairly cool, save for a couple of clumsy moves, and a general tendency to film it in what may be the lousiest way imaginable. Acting is nothing special, then again, they had nothing to work with. The DVD holds interviews(all four are brief and not that worthwhile) with Banderas, Liu, Soto and Park(best thing about this, in my opinion), trailers(...no, they're not the exact same, I swear) and something called \"B roll\", consisting of a behind-the-scenes style look at footage being shot, and it's... cut? No, that's not it... \"thrown\", that's it... together casually. I recommend this... hm... I don't know... to people I don't like, maybe. 1/10"

I think it actually sucks the IQ out of us while we force ourselves to watch this poor excuse of a movie. The plot was extremely thin and thoroughly unbelievable. There may have been another movie in the middle of this one for additional confusion.\n\nI can't believe Lucy Liu is in this piece of trash. After appearing in such a movie she should be lucky she has a trailer marked with a star and not forced to switch her career to selling trailers to the stars. Did she not read the script? Well, I wonder if there was a script. The movie bounced around so much I could have made this with friends as we went along.\n\nAntonio Banderas has made better films I'm sure. Interview with the Vampire was good and so was Philadelphia. Maybe he should stick to the supporting actor role and leave the lead to real actors who would read this script and fire their agent.\n\nDo not waste your money seeing this in theaters or renting this for home viewing. I could recommend it for the winter if you live in a cold climate and have a wood burning stove or fireplace."

Without the quartet, I can not even imagine the abyssal disaster this movie would have been.\n\nLet's face it : the initial idea is not bad.\n\nThe filming is a nightmare (slow motion a 4 years old child would not have tried). The editing (way the story is tell, sorry bad English) is a complete mess. Explosions are silly, the shooting would make laugh anyone.\n\nA complete disaster... I put 4 (one for each of the actors, as a compensation to have this movie on their resume :) ).\n\nPersonnal joke : the animosity between Lucy Liu and Gregg Henry started in Payback (1999) :) As I said, almost good to watch with pals at 04:30 AM (after a very very long day) and with anyone in the bag."

Watching it on dvd did have its advantages, though. Since Antonio Banderas was basically incoherant throughout the entire movie (did he have dental work done prior to filming? Because thats how I talk after all the freezing and anesthetic), I was able to put the subtitles on so I could at least follow the story. I wish I hadn't.\n\nThis movie seemed more like a scenic tour of Vancouver rather than a movie. It starts off in Yaletown, and downtown Vancouver, then moves to Stanley Park, where we get a nice visit to the Aquarium. We also get glimpses of the North Shore from Deep Cove, and the Train Yards as well. I was more interested in spotting landmarks and places that I recognized, than following the sotry!\n\nDon't waste your time. Shaquille O'Neil had better acting in Kazaam.

This film was so bad, Jerry Bruckheimer probably wouldn't have produced this schlock (considering his recent resume). I could tell this movie was going to bad after seeing the trailer. You don't name a movie like this without it being thought of as some straight-to-video type movie. Let's just hope they never show this garbage on TV anytime soon."

Maybe I'm just better than most people at evaluating a movie before seeing it, but I fully expected to get more stylish action sequences, and less plot. And I think that's just fine!

The heroine fighting a whole SWAT squad is unrealistic, Banderas cannot jump or move well in the fights, so there are lots of mistakes. And its full of commonplaces too.

This is a continuously clich\u00e9d, CGI currency burner that will challenge your kindness and your perseverance. Its the kind of movie where the main character walks away, in slow-motion, while a car explodes in the background. Its the kind of movie where Lucy Lui uses a mounted machine gun to mow down multiple nameless S.W.A.T. teams and decimate a downtown CGI landscape in slow-motion. Expect a lot of 360 degree pans, \"the Matrix\" style bullet time shite, horrible fight choreography, and as many story clich\u00e9s as you can think of. In other words, you've seen this movie many, many times before. Trust me. It wasn't even halfway funny. I think we got 2 smallish laughs out of it, and as such, recommend that you skip.

But, why did she wander out of her secure hideout, where her hostage was being held, to go shopping for trinkets? And, how did the bad goodguys happen to know that she would satisfy her trinket lust at a certain shopping venue where they could have undercover agents in place to watch her every move and a gazillion snipers with high power rifles and the standing order not to shoot. Huh! The murdering starts when an undercover guy tries to collar the sweet lady. She apparently doesn't want to go quietly so we see multitudes of arms, legs, and heads busted as more nameless morons rush her. Then the City SWAT team moves in and all hell breaks loose. She kills about 50-70 city police and Federal agents with various fully auto weapons including a tank. Then the hero of the story, Ecks, who just happens to be near by for no apparent reason, rushes in and chases her off by ineptly firing a shotgun in her direction. She decides not to kill him and he decides not to kill her. For a moment I thought they might just get down and mate in the street. Anyway, there isn't a very strong plot. There's just barely enough story to take you from one killing field to the next, with a few car chases thrown in. Frankly, if it wasn't for Heavens Gate, this would be the worst movie I had ever seen."

Lucy Liu dominates the movie and she justly deserve the main character role she is playing. I don't think any other actor/tress could play this role as well as Lucy Liu.Excellent roles with all the actors.Plus the music is great too! It definitely is a good action movie. The plot was all good. The title made sense. It's about revenge,power and payback.I Have not seen a movie like this in a long time, that doesn't have a lot of talking and stupid twists to try and explain what the movie is about.

Everything in this movie looks like some superhero battle between the ex FBI agent Banderas and brutal DEA rogue Liu, but the truth is that i feel relaxed and really amused by watching this kind of movies.

If the producers were going to show Lucy Liu as Super Woman, well atleast make it realistic! I don't know why her or Antonio Banderas took this movie, but what could have been made a masterpiece with some special effects and high quality action ended up as a toal disaster. Don't watch this! See the Four Feathers, that is awesome! Totally!"

As my girlfriend and I was watching it, and saw Gregg Henry as the villain, we started whispering to each other about all the smarmy roles we had seen him play, such as the ex-husband on Family Law. Then it hit us that he was in Payback with Mel Gibson, which also starred Lucy Liu. So if you want to go see a good movie with those too then rent Payback.\n\nAlso before the movie started, they showed a trailer for Femme Fatale, which has Antonio Banderas and Gregg Henry in it. I wonder if my desire to see that movie after seeing this one can wane anymore."

Because of due to too many complaints with too many MTV camera moves from recent action films like Romeo Must Die, Exit Wounds, 3000 Miles to Graceland, Fast and the Furious, XXX, and many more recent action films. But Fast and the Furious was a good movie but one annoying thing about this film was camera moves. So By the way, about Ballistic, I thought this film was well formed action film that I ever seen for a while since early 90's films. Thanks to Kaos for making his own philsophy and I agree with his philsophy for making this film. Well done explosions, action scenes, camera techinques, and the music was great. I prefer this film better than Lord of the Rings. Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever goes for an A+ grade and 100% out of 100 due to many many many negative reviews from people who kissed Lord of the Rings and Titanic asses. I was planning to give this movie a B grade with 85% out of 100 but due to that reason I gave it an A+ and 100. If you missed the greatness about action films from 70's then go see this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think that \"Kaos Theory\" has just found new definition in this movie. Wherein the director, i.e. Mr. Kaos, places his forehead on a baseball bat, spins around a bunch of times and then runs around trying to film stuff. Add a few explosions and a couple of quaffed Red Bulls and you get some of the crappiest action tripe ever seen. This film has but two things going for it. 1) Lucy Lui is friggin' hot 2) The shot of the SWAT guy falling off the building and crashing into the car down below. Now, if you think that warrants the $10 you'll pay to see it, then by all means go attend. Getting back to the drivel at hand, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that reminded me so much of the 80's. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to learn that whatever Hollywood hack penned this script, had taken an old Death Wish storyline and just changed the names. I think Cobra with Sylvester Stallone would be easily interchangeable with this one as well. At any rate, if there is one thing this movie has to teach us, its that you can't win friends with salad. You need meat, potatoes, a few glasses of wine and a dessert consisting of either vanilla ice cream with strawberry glaze and bun cake, or at the very least a custard pie. Ecks Vs. Sever had absolutely none of these. It was straight up salad greens without any kind of dressing. And believe me, if you're a fat kid looking for a hearty meal, you'll be SEVER-ly dissapointed!"

Maybe they were partners in a previous life. Maybe they had a falling out. Maybe they're from rival underworld gangs and have had a beef going back decades. But that would give this too much credit because there is literally none of that here. Calling it simply \"Ballistic\", due to the obscene amount of firearms and stuff getting blowed up real good , would have made sense because that's what happens. But except for a small showdown, there's no animosity between these two. In fact, they team up to fight the real enemy later.\n\nFrom the very start the plot makes no sense. People do things that they have no reason to do other than make somebody look like a badass. Relationships are suddenly revealed that make you wonder why they introduced them in the first place. And, of course, the title is a complete lie.\n\nAntonio Banderas plays Ecks. He's a former FBI agent who's a complete badass. Lucy Liu plays Sever. She's some sort of agent for a some kind of organization and she's also a complete badass. Ecks' wife who is supposed to be dead is really alive and if he takes out Sever his former boss will tell him where she is. Sever blows stuff up and there's a kidnapping plot in there somewhere. They fight. They team up and go after the real baddie. Things are revealed and you're left there wondering what the hell just happened.\n\nI'm serious when I say I don't know what this story is really about. It's like they had several different drafts of this movie, filmed a bunch of scenes for each one and then just stuck them together in the laziest way. It's a complete mess.\n\nThere are some decent action scenes, lots of explosions, Lucy Liu looking hot. But that's not enough to base an entire movie on. It also needs to at least be entertaining in a stupid kind of way and this movie fails that."

Throw in a number of explosions and what you have is 'Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever'.\n\nI'm astounded by the fact that 'Ballistic' - a fun, mindless action movie - is only sitting on a 3.5 on IMDb, while something truly terrible like 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle' can sit on a decent five. This is a sad day for action movies.\n\nSure, 'Ballistic' can't compete with some of the great action movies, but it certainly is better than all the other Hollywood movies that are poisoning the action genre (think 'Charlie's Angels', 'xXx', 'Torque'... the list could go on for a while...). Explosions, decent looking car chases, more explosions, a smattering of decent martial arts and gun fights, a few more explosions, and Antonio Banderas being awesome - what more does an action movie need?\n\n'Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever' is a fun action movie. True action fans aren't interested in a good script, good acting, etc, we just want lots of explosions, and that's what 'Ballistic' is all about - 6/10"

Go out and rent 'The Mask of Zorro' for action, comedy, and Antonio Banderas.

        "review_detailed_main": "Big. Loud. Dumb. Hollow. Notorious train wreck and box office failure. Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever is all of these things, and yet somehow I still got a kick out of it, albeit in the shallow end of the speedometer. I know what you're thinking.. \"wow, another turd that Nate is polishing up with multiple syllable words to make it seem like less of a piece of crap.\" Well, you're not wrong. I fully concede that this is one huge glorious, post Mexican food pile of poop, but there's something about it that pulls me in every time it shows up on SyFy or some such channel. Maybe it's the fact that it's one of those rare films that not only is shot in my hometown of Vancouver, but actually set here too. Mostly Vancity just doubles for Chicago, New York or any other Yankee metropolis, but director Kaos (yes that's his name) chose to tell the story right here in my little burg. Speaking of story, or lack thereof, it's one big shredded mess of a plot involving Ecks (Antonio Banderas) and Sever (Lucy Liu) two former federal agents out to get each other, eventually working together and then both becoming chumps in some ludicrous government conspiracy involving arch villain Gant (Gregg Henry, hammy as ever). It makes little to no sense, it's so convoluted it prompts the viewer to throw their hands up in exhausted defeat and give up hope on any cohesion, instead letting a wave of schitty early 2000's special effects and over elaborate, unwarranted stunt work to wash over them like a tidal wave of rejected video game cutscenes. And poor Vancouver, looking like a ghost town, just gets blown to smithereens by these trigger happy, matrix wardrobed, scowling lunatics. I'd probably stay off the streets too if Lucy Liu massacring hordes of VPD officers was in the forecast, or on second thought maybe not, that sounds kind of hot. I'm rambling, but any review of this film has the right to get sidetracked and ramble as much as this pile of wanton sound and fury does for the entirety of its scant runtime. It's disastrous to be sure, but does that make me pick up the remote and switch over to something else when it's on? Not really. Plus, despite the actual film, this has to have one of the coolest looking DVD cover posters ever designed. I mean, look at it."

        "review_title": "A film called Ballistic directed by a guy named Kaos - you have been warned.",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film is of the variety that either gives you a headache thanks to its action scenes and thus, makes you really hate it or it's one of those that just passes by after watching it, not remembering anything remotely good about it because there wasn't anything good there in the first place. For me, it's the second option.\n\nAs much as it seems people dislike this film, I didn't in fact hate it as much as I thought I would but it was still a silly, over the top action film that is trying to live off two of Hollywood's most recognisable stars (Banderas and Liu) and the action success that was The Matrix (1999) a few years earlier. Somewhere in there, deep down; there is a well shot, well lit neo-noir of a film desperately trying to get out but what we see with Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is a no-brainer action film that is so 'head-shakingly' bad, it's unreal.\n\nThe first hint of what's to come is in the form of the very first action scene. This is an action film after all and was probably sold and marketed by level of its action and it fails to deliver. Agent Sever (Liu) is kitted out like either Neo or Trinity and basically defies all logic in her gun wielding abilities as she becomes a female, Asian version of John Rambo. The sequence is just insane as each gun she uses goes from (in order): small handgun to bigger assault rifle, to sniper rifle and then onto a massive double barrelled minigun of some sort \u0096 pulverising buildings and police men in silly slow motion. The director (Kaos by name chaos by filmic nature) is from Thailand and it's a common known fact that the Asian film industry does rely on its Hong Kong cop thrillers but it seems at times that he was really just trying to pull a fast one here and incorporate one of those into mainstream Hollywood.\n\nAs the film continues, I could feel it dull my brain. Any essence of neo-noir or maybe a plot opening up was counteracted by insane action sequences. Agent Gant's (Henry) character is the key to the plot trying to get out as the whole kidnap, secrets, intrigue and several years of lies aimed at Ecks (Banderas) revolves around him. Gregg Henry's a good actor and he does his very best in the scenes he's involved in but the whole delivery between him and his 'wife' and the way the flashbacks of lies and murder is put across is just forced \u0096 so forced that it just blows over you as there's no real emotion.\n\nAdditionally, when Ecks and Sever decide to partner up (rendering the title of the film false) I had a genuine fear that the wheels would just come off and I'm telling you: all the hubcaps but one popped out as although it didn't quite descend into the chaos I thought it would, it was still full of over the top action. Not only this but it started to do the basics wrong; the actors were suddenly void of emotion, Gant and Sever speak on the phone at about 300 yards from each other before the whole thing erupting into a fire fight, a well shot fistfight between two people climaxes with someone entering the room and throwing in a grenade at the victor \u0096 it's all random, brainless action.\n\nAlthough the clues are there (A film called Ballistic directed by Kaos), it's probably worth seeing just to acknowledge what a low point this is for Liu, Banderas and worst yet; this film probably ruined Gregg Henry's career. I don't think we'll be seeing Kaos make another film in America for a while."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a special place in Hell reserved for directors who put out this kind of torturous cinematic garbage. The \"plot\" of this movie, and I do use the term very lightly, is little more than an excuse to have a series of pointless and poorly done shootouts, explosions, and chase scenes. All scenes come with a generous amount of slow motion included. A little free advice, filming a crappy scene in slow motion does not make it better, it just makes a crappy scene take longer to get off the screen and on to the next crappy scene.\n\nNormally I would attempt to explain the plot now, but I really don't feel like it, mostly because I have very little idea of what the hell was going on in the movie most of the time. What I can tell you is that a small boy is kidnapped, and his father, who isn't really his father, is trying to rescue him because he will die from an experimental nanotech weapon that has been injected into his bloodstream, by the guy who isn't really his father. Confused yet? Don't worry it gets worse. The non-father works for the DIA, never heard of it? Neither has anyone else, but apparently it is a branch of the U.S. government and they have evil, corrupt people working for them and they like to blow things up, especially in Canada, which is where most of the film takes place. Don't ask me why two U.S. government agencies are having a wild west gunfight in Canada and nobody seems to care, it just is.\n\nSo the DIA gets involved in a small war with the FBI in Canada over the kidnapping of the boy by a former DIA agent whose own son was killed by the evil non-father, and....screw it this is giving me a headache now. Suffice it to say this movie really, really sucks. The acting sucks, the excuse for a plot sucks, the action and effects suck, the editing sucks (in one car chase scene the day is rainy and the streets wet one moment, and completely dry the next) there is nothing to like about this movie. I should give the folks at MST3K a call on this one."

(This only goes to show that you can't judge a film by its trailers.) The talents of both Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas are wasted on this would-be action film. It's full of too many explosions, too little of what might be called a storyline, and it's all edited together with scant attention to continuity.

I went to the theatres, I saw the movie and I liked it... a lot. It was good! Sure, I have seen better but I definitely have seen worse!

Heck, in keeping with the Godzilla movies of old, maybe the winner will come back and fight some other action star in a sequel? That would be a good idea; it would be a cash cow for whatever studio pulled it off.\n\nBut, alas, another hack screenwriter gives us something any 10-year-old with an iMac could puke out, and the studio gives too much money to a first-time feature director, who drops the ball.\n\nI'm somewhat familiar with the music video work of \"Kaos,\" as he calls himself, but ya know, David Fincher couldn't make his first feature film into a classic, and neither did Kaos. There are exactly two creative camera shots in \"Ballistic\" -- the slo-mo henchman's plummet off a building is quite stylish -- but that's not plot, character, or consistency. At least John Woo sticks with one idea all the way through.\n\nA big raging fireball just isn't enough to hold anyone's interest. In Act III, the movie stops for at least 15 minutes, just to blow up some train cars. Yawn. Where's the character? (none) The sneakiness? (Ecks and Sever work together?! Cheat!) Fight choreography? (I've seen better in straight-to-video Micheal Dudikoff flicks).\n\nThere is absolutely nothing here worth watching, renting or acknowledging.

There were even a few things I hadn't seen before, which is tough to do in this crowded space. The action was entertaining.\n\nUnfortunately, everything else was a waste of film. Incomprehensible story, pointless dialogue, no character development, intrusive music, who-cares scenes that fizzle into nothing. Antonio is talented but hopelessly miscast. He gave it a valiant go, but I'm sure he had words with his agent each day after filming as he saw what he'd been thrown into. The rest of the actors looked bored and confused.\n\nThis is one of those movies where the scenes could have been edited in any order and it wouldn't have made the slightest difference.\n\n8 stars for the action scenes, 2 for any scene with Lucy, -4 for the fast forwardable filler scenes. 6 stars."

Yet the film LOOKS very cool, the action is non-stop (not a bad thing, with a movie like this) but i still can't see who greenlighted this movie (as it looks fairly big budget, to me) BANDERAS (as entertaining as he is) is hardly likely to become a TRUE Hollywood A-lister (yet he is good) Whilst LUCY LIU is rapidly becoming the laziest performer in Hollywood, at the moment (what's the matter with her, can she not do \"dialogue\"? The plot (of which there's not much) concerns (i think) 2 super spies, who have had someone near and dear taken from them in the past. The link to these two is GREGG HENRY (so good with LIU in PAYBACK) who, in a rather murky set of circumstances, comes looking for BANDERAS's (feared dead) wife (played by the stunning looking, TALISA SOTO 13 years on from LICENSE TO KILL) who he has had a child with (eh?) Either way, any promise in the title of the 2 spies battling it out, is soon gone, when it transpires that LIU has been secretly watching over BANDERAS and his missing wife and kid (eh????) Soon our 2 heroes are batting it out with a huge array of assassins, stuntmen and as many explosions as Hollywood can muster (probably to take your mind off the nonexistent plot!) Director KAOS (oh dear) does give the action scenes some zip though (the shot bad-guy landing oh-so s-l-owly, on the car roof, is the 'money shot' for me) and there's aglimmer of some originality, with a thrown away subplot involving micro-bugs, injected into the bloodstream, to assassinate the organs!) but overall the movie looks as if, there's probably a 'interesting' 140 minute 'directors cut' somewhere. The sad fact is, there isn't, and this is the movie, in it's full 'creative' directors vision\n\nI find it hard to believe STALLONE can't get major studio backing anymore, with films like this around?\n\n3 out of 10"

It's a mediocre imitation, you'll see right away where they just went for copying \"The Matrix\" instead of being original. It's in the action scenes, right down to the moves and weapons, it's atrocious and will have you screaming pretty soon. It does have a consistent script and it could have been a decent action movie if it wasn't for the mediocre imitation of another movie, a blatant rip-off of all the ways and scenes from someone else's work. This said watch it if you don't mind the close copying and if you're able to turn your brain off. Many times that's exactly what we want, so I give it a solid 4 out of 10. No, not a 5 and that's just because the scene-by-scene copy of \"The Matrix\" really annoys me a lot. It's so in your face that you just can't ignore it. There's a reason why it's so difficult to find a copy of this movie and it isn't because it's rare, it's because it's crap."

However, the bits of the story that I did manage to catch, were beyond ridiculous.\n\nI can't lie though, some of the sillier story beats actually caught me off guard and made me laugh a few times, so that's something to acknowledge.\n\nApart from that, pretty much the only other thing I enjoyed about the film was the music. It was great! Or rather, it was great during the banging techno tunes... but it was not great when they abruptly cut off said techno anthems to go back to the same bored, droning wail that repeated in just about every scene.\n\nI do find it quite amusing that Rotten Tomatoes, for example, lists this as their worst rated film of all time. I mean, it's not \"good\" by any stretch, but come on, if you're going to talk 'worst ever made', you've got to dive a bit deeper into the bad movie depths than one which for the most part, just feels like any other bland action/spy film.\n\nAnd ok, maybe its blandness could be why it is so despised, which is fair. In my opinion, the absolute worst quality any piece of entertainment can have is to be boring. However, even then, I'm pretty sure I could name 20 movies off the top of my head that I found far more boring than this one. There are films out there so desperately dull that they've genuinely sent me to sleep (Baby Geniuses 2), or kept my face frozen off from emotion for the entire running time (Star Wars Holiday Special), but this one actually has a few bits to laugh at.\n\nMind you, I don't want to sound as though I'm giving too much praise to this thing, it's still dreadful."

This would have been much better if they altogether abandoned any semblance of a storyline, and just showed more fighting. The story makes absolutely no sense. The action is nothing special. At one point I do believe there are many large explosions, literally for no reason whatsoever.\n\nIf you are interested in watching a film filled with anti-plot, this is the film for you.

Is it the shallow plot that tries to convince you this is a Ludlum thriller? Or is the action scenes - which include increasing amounts of TNT, bullets, bodycount, etc - yet never amount to anything other than an excuse to blow stuff up? What more is that these action scenes are stunningly bad - poorly shot, choppily edited - and that sets a new low in choreography for big budget action films. The 1996 low-budget direct to video no-nonsense action flick \"The Sweeper\" with C. Thomas Howell is infinitely better then this despite being made on a what could only be low budget. But it delivered what it promised.\n\nA strange thing is that this horrible movie reminded me of one of my personal favorites: Where Eagles Dare. That film also has lots of action, suspense and the screenplay obviously prefers that over logic, but that movie had a great plot to back it all up in addition to the overall tone of sheer escapism. It never took itself seriously and during action scenes, \"Eagles\" goes all out.\n\nNone of that here and a motorbike chase scene, right before a \"plot twist\" must top off at what can be at most 30 miles per hour. Awful all across the board. 1/10\n\nRated R for overblown violence"

I was impressed that Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu did their own fight scenes, but it seemed like the filmmakers relied on explosions and gunfire to build excitement. That only works for a little while. One big question I had; why is a movie about battling American intelligence operatives based mostly in Vancouver?\n\nOh, one other huge plot question. Why would you go to the trouble of creating the miniature robotic assassins? The little critter still has to be injected, so it's not like it's untraceable. Might as well slip your victim some slow acting poison and save the billions of dollars in development."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has neither plot nor characters \u2013 even the car chases and kung fu have to be squeezed in among the endless series of explosions and interminable firing off of whole arsenals of weapons. For once I can be absolutely sure I'm spoiler-free, as there's no story here to spoil.\n\nWe have not one but two stereotype rogue agents, played by Liu and Banderas, battling it out with each other and armies of police and bad guys for reasons that never really matter. So why bother to comment on something so amorphously pointless? Well, for one thing it's very well put together. For another, Liu and Banderas are as good as they're allowed to be by the fairly nonexistent script and this is a long way from the worst you'll see. Also Liu's character is rather unusual. She effortlessly deals with all comers, including Banderas, who's soon reduced to wandering about, telling whatever poor sap is next in the firing line: 'She's gonna kill you. Good luck.' Super-tough women are nothing new but, as in Kill Bill, The Long Kiss Goodnight, etc, they're always given some point of vulnerability. Not here. Liu's Sever comes close to being a female James Bond, an unstoppable winner. The sad truth is revealed by a brief exchange of threats with the main villain, a photo, and Banderas' closing line. They actually did mean her to be fallible and vulnerable, but it just got lost along with all the rest of the characterisation.\n\nIf you like explosions, shooting, tough women and either of these stars, and have time on your hands, you could do worse than watch this. But don't go out of your way."

Normally I can appreciate a bad action movie as much as a good one, but this movie really was the worst kind, boring and unfunny. I was worried when the opening titles looked worse than most made-for-tv movies, but that is only the tip of the iceberg. The martial arts are shot too close to tell what is going on, the car chase might as well take place on vespa scooters (I swear no one is going faster than 30 mph), and everything blows up...everything. Please, please do yourself a favor and stay home and watch Predator on TNT, sure you'll already know what happens and there will me no blood, but Ecks and Sever will cost you $20 to see the same thing."

        "review_detailed_main": "20 September 2002. \"Ballistic\" is a cut above average spy thrillers in its action, cinematography, its use of special effects. Lucy Liu is especially interesting because she really plays her role consistently throughout the entire movie and her fighting skills aren't cheapened by obviously phony martial art tricks. Antonio Banderas actually seems to play second in this movie. The chase scenes are not completely stereotyped. This action thriller was involving and really literally blows away many other straightforward spy movies. There is a distinctly serious, deadly interest in the intensity of the action and more psychological goings on among Lucy and Banderas. Totally entertaining and enjoyable."

I honestly don't know what Lucy Liu in particular was thinking. As for Antonio, well I guess he had to do something to make his presence in Hollywood better so I guess I can't blame him..but come on you can do better than this garbage.\n\nAvoid at all costs!"

Banderas was AWOL emotionally here, and Liu was sometimes as well, but the others did alright. Liu is such a cute kitten that the movie gets 1 point just for her.\n\nIs it bad? Yes, it's bad. One of the worst movies ever? I wouldn't say so. Lots of cliches, yes, and things which should have been rescripted. Still, a lot of the action was well-filmed, even if it didn't always make sense, and I did root for the good guys a little bit despite the muddled plot elements.\n\nOn style I give it a 4; had it not been so nice-looking it would have been lower. Do _not_ watch this movie for the plot or the acting; you'll learn nothing.\n\nThe crummy title came from a video game, so I suppose I give this film another half a sympathy point for having to overcome that."

        "review_detailed_main": "You dont see many double named movies these days. Thats generally something you only seen in Batman or Star Wars spin off cartoons. But they only work because people already know what one half of these titles mean. Ballistic? No me neither. The title gives the impression we should already have seen a movie with this title before this one.\n\nWhat this is, is yet another low to mid budget action movie that involves a nice looking woman who is also a master of all types of punch ups. Because theres obviously some guys in Hollywood who make decisions who have a \"special interest\" in this theme. For those of us who don't, the sight of Lucy Liu bashing up 6ft tall police/army/bad guys in groups at a time is just funny. What is strange however is that the other female lead in the movie is also known for martial arts, but she doesn't get a fight in this movie. She plays the mother of a child kidnapped by Lucy, who is then pursued by Banderas and the childs gangster father. Every guy in this movie is simply there to get kicked by Lucy.\n\nQuite a flimsy plot but its really a vehicle for Lucy to kick lots of men, shoot thousands of unnecessary bullets and press red buttons that make things explode. Theres also a sub plot about some superweapon that you will forget exists until the final scene. This movie comes across like one of those shiny Hong Kong action movies of the late 90's, only with fewer Chinese actors. Definitely has \"niche\" appeal."

She was great in Charlie's Angels, I was hoping for more of the same.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie was a complete disappointment. I rented it on DVD, and had to turn it off after 30 minutes, it was so bad. From the pathetically wimpy score to the chopped-to-oblivion plot to the normally decent actors obviously just cashing a check (Sandoval, Henry), it was a movie unworthy of Ms. Liu. I can understand Banderas getting stuck with this movie, but man, Liu should fire her agent right away, and sue them on top of it.\n\nThe score was something a child could create on their $60 Casio keyboard, and the dialogue couldn't have been worse. Two guys in a truck about to be blown up, and one guy says to other \"Take the flank\"?!?!?! You've gotta be kidding me!! LOL I honestly don't know what was going on with the music...the composer was the same guy that did \"The Matrix\" as well as \"Behind Enemy Lines\". Maybe they didn't pay him enough, or maybe he only had a weekend to do the scoring. Either way, it did nothing but make a bad movie worse.\n\nHopefully the group behind this picture will never try to make the public suffer through another monstrosity like this, and I surely hope Ms. Liu doesn't suffer because of it."

Or maybe a different director, who cared about the script more than the special effects.
