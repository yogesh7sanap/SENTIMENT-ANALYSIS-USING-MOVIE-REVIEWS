        "review_detailed_main": "THE SEVENTH SEAL is a film that presents a dramatic fantasy game between meaning of life and fear of death. A knight and his squire have returned to their country after a ten-year crusade. Deadly disease ravaged country. Knight faces Death. He calls Death on the multi-day game of chess...\n\nThe story has touched serious philosophical and religious topics. However, the story is full of intrigue, dark humor and hope. The protagonists are distracted between the vicious disease, self-pity and torture. It is interesting to see a deeply disillusioned knight, a cynical squire who hates women, a cheating wife, evil priests, a mute girl and seemingly healthy and happy family on the same road. The truth is all around them. The main protagonist used to persistently ask questions to which only he has a valid response. This film reveals some controversial issues. Is deadly disease greater threat to man or the man is the greatest enemy to himself? Mr. Bergman has painted realistic effects of fear, horror, cynicism, surprises, love and health on human faces.\n\nMax von Sydow as Antonius Block, the knight is a more serious version of Don Quixote. Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand J\u00f6ns, the squire is a character who never changes his mood. He always has some sort of cynical jokes or words of contempt for each occurrence. Bengt Ekerot is Death in the true sense of that word. Nils Poppe as Jof is a juggler who has strange predictions. Fortunately, no one believes him. Bibi Andersson as Mia, Jof's wife is a beautiful and cheerful woman who does not fit into the landscape.\n\nLife is a hard journey. The rare moments of happiness are a sort of salvation. The end of the film emphasizes the transience of life and the power of death which no one can escape. Of course, only in the eyes of one of the protagonists."

It is a unique film, and unlike any I have ever seen. I have just finished my second viewing of the film. I have watched several Bergman films since I first saw this, but this is the one that has always stuck out to me the most. I would describe it as a dark and powerful film. There is nothing lacking in this film, in my opinion. The soundtrack is perfectly subtle, acting is agreeable, cinematography fitting and well done, etc. My favorite aspect of this film is simply the premise. A game of chess that is a matter of life and death. If nothing else, that concept is enough to make an interesting film at the very least. Death is the most persistent theme throughout the film, and is often juxtaposed to stark scenes of life, often quickly and without warning. This film was one of the first I watched in my everlasting pursuit of classic cinema, and I would readily recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in classic or foreign films. Bergman will not disappoint in this one or elsewhere in his filmography. This is probably his most famous and accessible films. This is a staple of classic cinema, watch it and find out why."

        "review_detailed_main": "Antonius Block - \"Who are you?\" Death - \"I am Death.\" Antonius Block - \"Have you come for me?\" Death - \"I have long walked by your side.\" Antonius Block - \"So I have noticed.\"\n\nThe Seventh Seal, considered by some to be Ingmar Bergman's greatest achievement, is the desperate prayer of a sensitive, introspective, and insightful young man confused by the horrors of the world around him. Ingmar Bergman's films are often very deep, full of symbolism, philosophy, spirituality, emotion, and thought. The Seventh Seal is classic Bergman. Expressing his fear of life with no meaning, death with no understanding, and faith with no validity, Ingmar Bergman takes us deep into the well of his mind.\n\nAs the Black Plague ravages the world, a Antonius Block and his squire, Jons (Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand, respectively), return from fighting in the Crusades. They find their homeland devastated by the plague, their countrymen mad with fear, and their cause lost. Antonius Block is confronted by Death (Bengt Ekerot). Block challenges Death to a game of chess to provide him time to seek answers to the questions that plague his mind as Death has plagued his country. Death accepts, knowing that Block cannot escape his fate, and the two begin their game. As the story continues, Block and Jons meet with several testaments to the agony that the Black Death has brought upon their land. They find a young girl who is to be burned at the stake for having been with the Devil. They find madness in the eyes of all they meet, as everyone is convinced that God is angry and is punishing the world with the plague. They also find a small group of travelling actors, who appear to be the only souls to have remained sane in the midst of all of the death and fear. Block and Jons move across the countryside in the hopes of finding safety in Block's castle, but Death is always around the corner, biding his time.\n\nBrilliantly conceived, and stunningly executed, Bergman's vision is brought to the screen through Gunnar Fischer's powerful cinematography creating images that will likely remain with you for the rest of your life. Strong performances from everyone involved bring humanity to the film. Max Von Sydow's brave and conflicted Antonius Block matching wits with Bengt Ekerot's sinister, omnipotent Death is a microcosm of the forces at work in this breath-taking interpretation of the mortal struggle.\n\nA masterpiece!"

        "review_detailed_main": "One thing that can be certain after watching the Seventh Seal, outside of being thankful for living in this century, is that Bergman knows his film-making- and imagery. He uses subliminal and not so subliminal techniques to convey a dying, frightened world, where making a living is almost impossible and the debate of god's control over life is discussed like un-rhyming yet fascinating poetry.\n\nThe result is beautiful cinema, capturing the always foreboding fear and allure of the almighty and for the waiting death, appropriately staged in post-crusades, mid dark age Europe. Max Von Sydow gives an excellent showing as the opponent of Death (in a clever and meticulous chess game), yet the character of Death, played by Bengt Ekerot with chilling conviction, steals the show, if only for the alluring quality of the character.\n\nEven if the story veers it veers in good and interesting territory, focusing on people who convey Bergman's point and or style. I can't reveal what the bottom line point is (many newcomers to Bergman's work won't either, especially if you're not in the mood for soul searching), but one thing is for certain, an allegory on life and death is shown perfectly in the second to last shot of the reaper and his minions following in a dance across the field. This is one of the most pure of cinema's masterpieces and certainly Bergman's best cine. A++"

        "review_detailed_main": "A compelling contemplation of death and the nature of Man's existence, Ingmar Bergman's `The Seventh Seal' is uncompromising, riveting drama that is every bit as striking conceptually as it is philosophically. In the Fourteenth Century a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), and his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand), have returned after ten years away at the Crusades to their native Sweden, and are beginning their journey home. For Block, it is a pensive time; he is troubled by what he perceives as God's silence, and thirsts for knowledge and some meaning to his life, as well as a resolution of faith, which has deserted him. Jons, meanwhile, is a study in jaded indifference, who believes in nothing beyond the present and whatever his senses and current circumstances dictate. Shortly after their arrival on the coast of Sweden, Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes for Block. But Block strikes a bargain with him, challenging him to a game of chess, to be played as they continue on with their journey. As long as Block prevails, they will go on; if he wins, he will be released. And though Block knows what the outcome must inevitably be, he welcomes Death's acceptance of his challenge, for the game affords him perhaps enough time to fulfill his quest, while adding purpose to what promises to be an arduous trek through a land being ravaged by the Black Plague. Von Sydow brings a commanding presence to the screen as Block, his very countenance bespeaking strength and poise. His subtle, stoic approach to this enigmatic character is captivating, and lends a depth and dignity that makes Block truly memorable. By contrast, Jons' strength seems born of his indifference; he takes things as they come, and is governed by a somewhat fatalistic philosophy. Bjornstrand, a gifted, eloquent actor (and veteran of numerous Bergman films), invests an earthy, gritty quality to Jons that plays effectively opposite von Sydow's more ethereal portrayal of Block. It is significant that in the closing scene the final speech, in the presence of Death, is accorded to Jons; for it elevates the character to a station equal to, if not surpassing, that of the protagonist, Block. The supporting cast includes Nils Poppe (Jof), Bibi Andersson (Mia), Inga Gill (Lisa), Gunnel Lindblom (Girl), Anders Ek (The Monk), Ake Fridell (Plog) and Erik Strandmark (Skat). Written and directed by Bergman, `The Seventh Seal' is a thought provoking, earnest meditation on faith and mortality that is filled with stunning metaphoric and visual images that will forever be indelibly inscribed in your memory. One scene in particular, in which the players link hands and, silhouetted against a twilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill, is breathtaking in it's simplicity. It stands (as does this entire film) as an example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema. I rate this one 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "What makes The Seventh Seal - an apocryphal and uncompromising fable of medieval Sweden - one of the masterpieces of Cinema ? Ingmar Bergman creates a believable world of dark happenings, wherein Death can play chess with a Knight, witches burn at the stake, with flagellants, and plague ever present. Through superb black and white images, each carefully composed for maximum effect, sets and costumes, his fine actors seem to truly inhabit this frightening world. Max von Sydow, Gunnar Bjornstrand, and Bengt Ekerot lead a marvelous cast. But its not all doom and gloom, as the Knight tries to determine in his quest, the meaning of life, and if God exists at all. There are moments of sheer happiness and peace, such as the sequence of the milk and strawberries at dusk, and a number of bawdy comic moments throughout the film. Which balances the darker side. It is unforgettable and I still remember seeing it on its first release, being stunned by the quality of the photography, and the performances. A restored version on DVD is recommended. Bergman is one of the great film makers of our time. Seldom today do we see such precise and considered images on the screen. Not to be missed."

Didn't get many though, the popular thing fans like to say (and please, no pun intended) is that it just takes time to understand and appreciate this movie. To this I quickly reply that my perception of \"Det Sjunde Inseglet\" was that it is a rather dull, if not eventless, movie. It has some really nice moments (and for some reason I really liked the concept of a man playing chess with death itself) but in the end almost nothing is resolved except from the main protagonist who, at the brink of his death, discovers that it's love that makes people want to live ,very roughly put, I apologize, but even this revelation was hidden from the writer of this comment. And this is what bothered me the most, I couldn't read (for the lack of a better word) any of these important details, the movie very coldly rolled in front of my eyes and I just didn't get it! Now the easiest and dumbest thing to say is that this is all the fault of the director for not having a more universal way of film-making, rather the viewer has to decipher such information if he wants to fully appreciate his movies. I've just realized that I could say the same for Kubrick's visionary movies, I didn't like most, scratch that, none of them the first time around, they grew on me after a second viewing. And I dig Kubrick, a lot!!!\n\nI was also surprised with the admiration the cinematography received, it did not impact me whatsoever (and I am more so a visual that a sensual movie buff and love this kind of stuff). All in all, as Antonius Block, I am searching for answers, important ones. It bothers me a lot that I don't appreciate this movie, and I ask anyone to help me resolve my problem.\n\nWhat am I missing? What don't I get? What should I know about \"The Seventh Seal\", its meaning, its importance, its making, its director...?\n\nThank you for your time"

        "review_detailed_main": "Seventh Seal (1957) is one of my favorite movies. I have to rank it up there with A Touch of Zen, Seven Samurai and Battleship Potemkin. If there ever was such a thing as a perfect film, this one would have to be a nominee. I've never seen such a picture (and I probably never will) that was so moving, well shot, written, acted and directed. The chess game between the knight and death is an all-time classic. Words cannot describe how great this film is. There will never be another one like it. Truly amazing piece of celluloid.\n\nA knight and his squire are returning home from the crusades. For the past few years he's been in the middle east fighting for Christ. On his trip home he notices a familiar face, one that he has seen many times on the battlefield. It is death and it wants him to come with him to his new home. The knight strikes a bargain with death, they'll play a game of chess if he can defeat death then he'll spare his life as well as the squire's. Death is amused by this unusual challenge and accepts it. But as long as the game is on the life will continue to live. So he uses this time to look back at life and realizes how precious it is. Along the way he meets a young couple, they're from a performing troupe. They have a baby and are content with life. The husband has visions and can see interesting things like the Virgin Mary and little Jesus. He can also see the darkness that lies ahead as Black Death ravages the countryside. Will the knight defeat Death? Can the couple weather the storm of chaos that lies ahead? To find out you'll have to watch The Seventh Seal, one of the finest films ever made.\n\nIf Bergman never made another film this one would have made him a legendary film maker. But he continued to make even more classic cinema. This one however is his finest work.\n\nMy highest recommendation possible."

        "review_detailed_main": "While I'm not going overboard in extolling the virtues of THE SEVENTH SEAL, I do think it has some striking imagery and had the potential to be the ultimate work of art Ingmar Bergman was obviously striving for. But do I think he achieved it? No...for the simple reason that it leaves us unenlightened on the subject with no new knowledge.\n\nBergman really has no answers to the age old questions we all have about life and death and what happens in the hereafter. And giving Death a human face seems to me the wrong decision on Bergman's part. He should have kept him a hooded spectre and nothing more--faceless and unknown within the shadows of his hood. Humanizing him doesn't work, at least not for me.\n\nA cruel streak runs through some of the more boisterous moments, such as when one of the actors is put through some hazing by a sadistic man who later gets his comeuppance. Everyone laughs and applauds as the man is humiliated beyond the endurance of this spectator for the sake of bawdy humor which seems forced and contrived, as does much of the clowning by the group of actors.\n\nBut there are so many good things about the richly photographed film, that I don't want to give this review an entirely negative impression. But the truth is it offers no new insights into the age old questions of life and death. It's all presented as an allegory with religious symbols (flagellation, the cross, the witch burning) and we suspect that among the many utterances we hear from The Devil will be something to ponder and think about.\n\nBut no. There's only the hopelessness that Death offers when the plague is rampant over the land and is something which cannot be avoided by man, no matter how clever he thinks he is. The chess game that the Black Knight proposes is a ruse that the Devil sees through from the start. And we suspect near the end that he knows the young couple with the infant have escaped since he says that he knows all that is happening, even behind his back. The young couple will be doomed too, eventually. Death will consume all.\n\nBut Max van Sydow is excellent as The Knight questioning his reason for being and his reason for dying. The B&W cinematography evokes the Middle Ages with striking scenes that stay in the mind afterwards and the film, while bleak and disturbing, is always riveting to watch.\n\nIt's a very engrossing film, but there are many weaknesses. I don't consider it the masterpiece that so many others label it."

All I can say is, I was immediately struck by the cinematography, and I started getting interested in the idea of a knight (Max Von Sydow) playing chess with \"Death\" himself, as a means of deciding the fate of his own soul.... but that's as far as it went.\n\nFrom then on, nothing made much sense and the noble core idea of the film (presumably about questioning death, and the existence of God) seemed to go out the window, as we spend our time with secondary characters I just could not become interested in. I wanted to focus more on Max von Sydow's troubled crusader and his crisis of faith, especially since I myself am presently going through some personal bouts of despair in my personal life with my own crosses to bear... but he was only sparingly used, and I just could not follow any type of coherent storyline to this thing, for all its pretty picture style. There was no story, just images... and it's not that this approach never works for me in other films, but it didn't connect for me this time. I can't say that this is going to be my last visitation with Bergman, but this is not a promising start, considering this is allegedly one of his greatest works, if not THE greatest.

It also has many memorable images like with the flagellates, the hawk flying in the cloudless sky, Jof's vision of the Virgin Mary and the milk and strawberries in the dusk. Bergman's direction is superb, Erik Nordgren's score is resolutely haunting and the dialogue is some of the most thought-provoking I've heard with some nice bawdy humour with especially the squire that doesn't feel misplaced. The story is like an allegory and meditation of life, death, love and fear(amongst other things), and it is dealt with in a very intelligent and careful manner. Again there are some timeless scenes like the ending, the scene of the girl about to be burnt, Death being challenged to a game of chess and with the jester. The acting is also exemplary, Max Von Sydow gives one of cinema's finest performances, stoic yet always commanding with a face that speaks volumes about what he's thinking. Bengt Ekerot evokes chills as Death, while Gunner Bjornstrand is suitably dry as the squire. All in all, a really amazing film, fully deserving of its reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The man meets the Angel of Death and is told it is him time to die. The man asks if he can first challenge him in a game of chess--if the man wins, then his life will be spared. The Grim Reaper, not wanting to be a spoilsport, agrees and they play a game that starts and stops again and again. This exact same contest has been used in Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, the cartoon series The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, and an experimental film De D\u00fcva: The Dove (starring Madeline Kahn among others). In the Bill and Ted movie, they did not play chess but a series of games including Battleship and Twister! In The Dove, it was a badminton game! I can't remember what the game was in the cartoon series, but instead of their deaths, the children played the Grim Reaper over the soul of their pet hamster! Isn't is weird how this art film has appeared again and again and in the silliest of places! Give it a try to see the FIRST death-match and because it is a good film--with excellent performances all around--from Max Von Sydow to all the supporting players.

        "review_detailed_main": "I find it strange that \"The seventh Seal\" has always been widely considered to be the best Bergman movie and is so much more famous that all the others he made. Yes, it's very good, especially for its time, but compared with the real masterpieces Bergman made like \"Wild Strawberries\", \"Through a Glass darkly\", \"Persona\", \"Winter light\" and \"Fanny and Alexander\", it really pales in comparison. The ideas and the questions asked in this movie are pretty interesting and profound, but I feel that Bergman has done so much better in his later movies on similar subjects. The theme about the God's silence is much, much better developed in the famous \"Faith Trilogy\", especially \"Through a glass darkly\" and \"Winter light\". The theme about how to cope with fear of death is well developed, but couldn't really convince me. Also I feel that the film has too many \"comic relief\" moments. Many people have praised the cinematography in this movie, quite a few saying that it's one of the best ever. I beg to disagree. It's very, very good, excellent at times, but again Bergman has done so much better in his other movies. Personally I feel that the cinematography in Bergman's movies improved when he changed his director of photography Gunnar Fischer(who worked on this movie and \"Wild Strawberries\") with Sven Nykvist. Watch \"Through a glass darkly\" or \"Persona\" if you want a really stunning cinematography. But even \"Wild Strawberries\", made shortly after \"The Seventh seal\" and looking visually quite similar, is better IMO. Here the settings and the lighting looks too theatrical to me for most of the times. Of course, there were quite a few memorable images, especially the start with Death on the beach, the dance with Death at the end, the procession of the fanatics who whipped themselves through the village,etc. But still, something was lacking in many of the scenes. Bergman had to shoot the whole movie in just 35 days, so it's understandable IMO. After being so critical to the movie so far, it's time to mention its strong points. They are typical of Bergman's movies. Very strong acting(especially from Max von Sydov), amazing dark medieval atmosphere, really makes you think about the important questions. The music was very well and effectively used too. It's a great movie, no doubt, and it established Bergman as one of the all-time greats, which is big plus for a huge fan of him like myself. Still, my advice is: don't limit your Bergman experience to just this movie, watch his others, many of them are even better. 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been finally getting round to checking out old classics I've had on my radar for decades, after the somewhat-underwhelming Rashomon (6/10) and the very good early-60's chiller The Innocents (8/10) comes The Seventh Seal.\n\nThe much-lauded Swedish classic reminds me of Rashomon in a few ways:\n\nwell-known classic film-connoisseur picture. Here at 8+ on IMDB. 50's production. Foreign. Black & White.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth I've been curious about for so long, tho' went in with neutral expectations as I purposefully stayed clear of plot-summaries or watching clips. With both I wasn't entirely satisfied nor surprised by anything, but saw enough to make me appreciate the film on its own merits, and remain curious about the directors' other works.\n\nWith Seventh Seal (as with Rashomon): the narrative & acting is very theatrical: not reality-based. There's elements of dream logic in how some scenes develop. The philosophy, and yearning for meaning from the Knight, is interesting, timeless and portrayed well. The highlights are the flagellants' procession, the Knight's conversation with a woman damned as a witch, and pretty much anything with J\u00f6ns, who acts as both comedy relief and the adult in the room. Stick a northern-English accent on him and he wouldn't be out of place in Game of Thrones.\n\nI missed some inventive uses of camera & sound which I recently got from The Innocents (1961) and Killer's Kiss (1955). Camera work is still good, tho', with some immersive scenes. The story & dialogue drags a little in parts, a couple of times I found my mind wandering off.\n\nThe Seventh Seal isn't exactly a thrilling film, and the famous character of Death isn't all that compelling here. The film is a slow-burning meditation on mortality and faith. In Swedish.\n\nWorth watching if you're curious about historical-cinema and enjoy morose existential meditations. Hard to recommend if all you want is a fantastic & entertaining classic movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those movies, like Seven Samurai, where you watch it for the first time, following one character, and suddenly not-quite-midway through you realize that every character is important and intricately linked into the progression and exposition of the story and themes, so you know before you've even finished that you need to watch it again.\n\nOne of the more blatantly philosophical films out there (which is a good thing in this case, by the way, don't think that I'm using the term \"blatant\" as a negative indicator), Ingred Bergman's The Seventh Seal basically is a contemplation on Death. I'm sure you've read that already, on the back of the Criterion DVD box, on the synopsis written for it at any site where it's listed, in the many reviews, both critical and mundane, and everywhere that even mentions this movie.\n\nSo I'm not going to go so much into the focus of the characters on Death, as it were, because you know it all already, even if you haven't seen it. Instead what I'll focus on is the idea of presenting Death or, roughly, imaging him. One of the key things that sets the events in this movie off is that the knight asks Death to play chess and, when Death asks him how he knows he likes chess, the knight answers, \"I saw it in a painting.\" Throughout this movie are shown many different artists, philosophers, and people trying to present what Death is and looks like via different media such as painting, theatre, prayer, actions, and discussions, and yet the main memorable image of this film is precisely the distinctive image of Death himself, the man with the thin lips and large forhead who holds his arm out to envelop on the front cover of the Criterion DVD. A film that invests its interest in Death needs a way of presenting him in a way that isn't completely stuck in the inspirations of other presentations, else focusing an entire work on Death becomes merely repetitious to what has all been said before. Thus we have a very original and thus very compelling image of Death that becomes the inspiration instead of just being an amalgamation of other's ideas.\n\nThus this movie brilliantly shows Death personified and characterized without holding all the dialog towards Death as a person but Death as a force. By showing that other people \"draw\" Death in various forms and different symbolic ways, the subjective viewpoint of who Death is is reinforced without having to be stated, which can be condescending.\n\nThen we are so pleasantly allowed to sit back and watch the other characters all invest their energy into their ideas of Death, to mix them together and come up with a complete idea of how Death affects us profoundly and psychologically.\n\n--PolarisDiB"

        "review_detailed_main": "Back from the Crusades (where he no doubt carried out some unspeakable acts in the name of God) Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), discovers his homeland ravaged by the plague as he struggles with a crisis of faith. As if that wasn't bad enough, he also runs into Death on the beach, and challenges the reaper to a game of chess to buy himself a little time as he wrestles with metaphysical conundrums. The duel, played on a beach beneath lowering skies, provides us with one of cinema's enduring images and, perhaps, misleads us about the true nature of Bergman's film. I'd always assumed it to be a grim, dour affair with dull, lengthy periods of intellectualising. Well, the film is certainly bleak, but it's also completely absorbing and rewarding.\n\nBlock travels the countryside with his squire (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and finds on his journey a country in the grip of a religious fervour that promises nothing but damnation and offers precious little in the way of comfort. Burnings and ritualistic acts of flagellation are carried out in the name of a God who is conspicuously absent, which does nothing to help Block resolve his inner torment. They meet up with a number of characters: Jof (Nils Poppe), a juggler, his pretty wife Mia (Bibi Andersson) and their small son Mikael; Plog (Ake Fridell), a blacksmith whose wife has absconded with the leader of the tiny travelling theatre of which Jof and Mia make up two-thirds; a girl saved by Block's squire from Raval, an evil former monk who, ten years before, duplicitously persuaded the squire to join the Crusades and who ultimately comes to a distasteful end. Each gives Death an opportunity to add them to his list as they encounter one another on various routes that ultimately lead to the estate of Block and the wife he hasn't seen in ten years.\n\nThe bleakness of the film is offset by the endlessly fascinating scenarios created by Bergman \u2013 many of the incidents are inspired by a mural the director would study as a child while attending his preacher father's lengthy sermons \u2013 and a flavourful taste of the dark ages. Block's crisis is always the motivating force behind the story and the incidents that take place within it, but is never allowed to dominate or control. As Block searches for some sign of God all he witnesses is the devil's work. He questions a young girl sentenced to burn for sleeping with the devil and bringing the plague down upon the countryside. He asks her if the devil exists, for he must surely know God. 'Look into my eyes,' the girl replies, 'The priest and the soldiers could see him there. They wouldn't touch me.' 'I see nothing but terror.' Block remarks, and you can feel his desolation.\n\nThe subject of God, his existence, and the ways in which his presence is made known to us, were an abiding obsession with Bergman, and formed the core of many of his films (comedies aside). This, one of his earliest films, is by far the most direct in its probing, as is probably befitting of a young director at the beginning of his career. For this same reason it is probably also one of his most accessible films. Even those untroubled by the questions that obsessed Bergman so completely, should find enough going on to take something away from the film.\n\nAs The Seventh Seal begins with an iconic image, it also ends with another: Death, carrying his scythe and leading his party of seven on a macabre dance against a brooding sky. It was a spur of the moment decision to film it, and exists only because Bergman and his cameraman were taken by a dramatic cloud formation in the distance. In fact the decision was so impulsive that the figures aren't the actors at all, but members of the crew and a couple of curious tourists."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Seventh Seal is considered on of the best Swedish film ever, and Ingmar Bergman is certainly the most famous filmmaker out of that nation. The Seventh Seal is easily a great example of art-house film making done right.\n\nThe Seventh Seal take place in Medieval period in Sweden with the Black Death is sweeping the land. Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) has returned from the Crusades and a black clocked man who says he is Death (Bengt Ekerot) says he comes for him. Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess, saying if he resists then lives and if he wins he is free. Antonius is allowed to travel and he goes with strong, clever, but less philosophical squire J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand). On the way Antonius and J\u00f6ns form a entourage, including a husband and wife acting team Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson), and their one-year-old son Mikael, a deaf girl (Gunnel Lindblom) that J\u00f6ns saves and a blacksmith Plog (\u00c5ke Fridell) whom wife just left him. As the game continues Death watches and tries to trick Antonius, and he takes an interest in the young family. Antonius needs to save the family so their could live their lives.\n\nThis is a very thematic film, with a focus on the ideas of loss of faith, debates whether God exist and of course, the continuing threat of death. They is excellent dialogue in throughout the film, some of actually a little witty. It also looks at the issues with intelligence and in detail, but in a accessible manner as well. Bergman takes great care with the imaginary in the film. He uses the art of Albertus Pictor who was influenced by the aftermath of the Black Death: his painting often focused on death. He also took great care with his scenes, often using long continuous shots, allowing them to evolve naturally. Bergman also picks the 14th Century as his setting. This is not pretending to be historically accurate film like Braveheart was making itself out to be. But it adds to then scenes of death affecting the world and how pessimistic people were. It also had interesting sub-plots and ideas like Flagellants going to the village. Bergman's direction was excellent through out the film, and shows that he was a real artist.\n\nThe acting is excellent. This was on of Max von Sydow's first big roles, and he shows the disillusionment in this character. Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand was very good as strong, loyal character who didn't think about the grander scheme of live. He just continues with live and had a decent heart, but is willing to use violence. Bengt Ekerot had a good sense of menace as Death.\n\nA excellent, tort film that is a must see for film fans."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ingmar Bergman's world acclaimed 'masterpiece' as a \"self written and self directed allegorical film\" (Bosley Crowther, New York Times) is among the most discussed movies that provokes controversies. Although more than half a century has passed since its premiere, we can bravely quote Peter Bradshaw (The Guardian) that it is still \"an untarnished gold standard of artistic and moral seriousness.\" THE SEVENTH SEAL turns out to speak to the minds of modern viewers even more powerfully than it did in the late 1950s.\n\nMEDIEVAL? Set in the Middle Ages, it seems that the film has much to do with the spirit of the period. Yet...this \"piercing and powerful contemplation of the passage of man\" (Crowther), \"Bergman's spiritual quest\" (Roger Ebert), \"a new dramatic idiom of its own\" (Bradshaw), \"Bergman's medieval drama of the soul\" (Steven D Greydanus), \"magnificent and compelling, brutal and beautiful examination of mankind's strengths and weaknesses\" (Carter B Horsley) is not at all a movie about the Middle Ages but, what remains 'medieval' are two supreme concepts the film is built upon: image and contrast. Let me develop these two aspects before I move to performances because most of its power and charm is, indeed, hidden therein.\n\nThree concepts prevail in the image of the film: people, nature and death. Actually, all of them are embodied in the characters and stand for their feelings, emotions and varieties. However, all of them are made vibrant by unpredictable, surprising depiction. People carry a wide range of psychological sophistication; nature evokes symbols, manifests the interlocked circle, provokes impressions of different kinds; death is, perhaps, the weirdest incarnate. It is not the Christian 'Mors Porta Vitae Aeternae' (Death as a Gate to Eternal Life) nor the hero of medieval danse macabre but \"an enigmatic emissary of the unknown\" (Greydanus), a gloomy character of certain demonic features, the only real representative of the supernatural world that is, anyway, never made accessible to humanity. Nevertheless, Death in SEVENTH SEAL is the only character personified that leads the movie to the \"uncompromising subject\" that defines in \"Bergman's spiritual quest\" (Roger Ebert). But what would it all be without certain contradictions.\n\nContrast, a basis of medieval thought and reality, seems to be predominantly present in many aspects from the protagonist through the modern vs. medieval (sometimes on the cost of historical accurateness) to the very autobiographical traces of the director, Ingmar Bergman himself. Foremost, however, this contrast is inside of man, outside of man and among men.\n\nCHARACTERS: Bosley Crowther basically called the movie \"provocative\" and it occurs to reveal itself most in the protagonist, Antonius Block (played marvelously by Max Von Sydow), an excellent, almost model embodiment of a disillusioned, modern character set in the Middle Ages who embodies the contrast inside of man. He asks questions that could practically never be asked, even thought of in a crusader's mind simply because his vision of the world, of faith, of the afterlife was deeply affected by creed. His character addresses the very silence of God developed in the Greydanus' essay; he is on his way to catharsis but also on the way to the state of absolute nothingness that Bergman himself believed in at a later phase of his career. He is a man of seeming decadence searching for meaning. Here lies his curiosity. He is a man losing his religion because he tries to grasp the supernatural with pure intellect. Here lies his vanity. He is a man locked within the four walls of his 'ghosts and dreams' Here lies his selfishness. Reminds me of Marcello in Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA who cannot fully understand the genuine and cannot communicate with the world of innocence and simplicity (note the aspect of an Umbrian girl in Fellini's movie). And where is this world of innocence in Block's life?\n\nBERGMAN'S 'HOLY FAMILY'? Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson) with their baby son Mikael have inspired a variety of interpretation from many film scholars. Some found the allegories to daring religious manifestations. The meal they are having together as the 'eucharist of natural products' or the family as the Holy Family of Nazareth. I think that the point is elsewhere. Jof and Mia manifest simplicity, common life, austere joys, pure humanity, heart over intellect. That embodies the contrast among men and, along with other characters like a troubadour Skat (Erik Strandmark), contrast outside of man Antonius Block confronts.\n\nTHE SEVENTH SEAL with its impressive symbols, outstanding imagery and greatly versatile characters leaves many questions unanswered, many dreams unfulfilled, yet many hopes disillusioned in its doom. Nevertheless...\n\nit is an important movie significant in its appeal and rarely understood. Believers will find it, perhaps, too daring; atheists will find it thought provoking; cinema freaks will love its atmosphere and Bergman fans consider it the essence of the director's world. With the unforgettable finale open for interpretations, THE SEVENTH SEAL provokes modern disillusion and its pessimistic silence confront the medieval reality and its mysterious dance."

The contradictory nature of man, wickedly intelligent and self-aware on the one hand, a stupid, superstitious and easily manipulated idiot on the other, is what makes the plight of our heroes so simple and yet so profound. In essence, we are asked to respond to God's silence in assured faith, a contradiction to common sense that has somehow has manacled our essence from time immemorial. What is more, this flick flirts with such conundrum by account of the simplicity of not seeking answers but instead a purpose. Indeed! This flick is at times a cacophony of relentless imagery punctuated by wonderful humor and witty dialog. The acting was simply aces on all accounts. Ingmar Bergman's direction hits the bulls eye here, crafting an impossible concept into a convincing and highly enjoyable flick that cannot help but move any human with breathe still gracing his lungs.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ingmar Bergman is one of those directors I tend to watch more out of a sense of duty than for pleasure. This is because he is often ranked among the greatest film-makers of all time, including by some such as Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen whom I would rank among the greatest film-makers of all time, but he isn't really my cup of tea. At times I can find him a very uncinematic director, with little physical action, long, lingering takes and lengthy conversations, which often turn into lengthy debates.\n\n\"The Seventh Seal\" is one of his best-known films. It is set in Sweden during the Black Death of 1349. A knight named Antonius Block has recently returned from the Crusades with his squire J\u00f6ns to find the country ravaged by the plague. Now I know that the Crusades had finished well before the time of the Black Death, but I will not claim this as a goof because Bergman was clearly not aiming at a realistic picture of the period. (The film also shows a woman condemned to be burned at the stake for witchcraft; witch-burnings in Sweden, as elsewhere in Europe, did not begin until the mid-fifteenth century). Block meets the figure of Death, who tells him that he has come to claim his soul. Block, however, challenges Death to a game of chess; they agree that Block will remain alive until the game is finished, and that if Block wins his life will be saved.\n\nI won't set out the rest of the plot; suffice it to say that the other characters include two actors from a troupe of travelling players, the girl suspected of witchcraft, an artist painting a mural of the Danse Macabre inside a church, a blacksmith and his wife, a theologian-turned-robber and a mute servant girl. Bergman, in any case, was less interested in telling a story than in asking philosophical themes about the meaning of life, the question of an afterlife and the existence of God. Or perhaps I should say the \"silence of God\"; Block is less preoccupied with the question of whether God exists than with the question of why, if He does exist, He does not give us proof of His existence by speaking directly to his worshippers. This silence was to be a major theme in some of Bergman's later films such as \"Winter Light\", and indirectly inspired the title of \"The Seventh Seal\", which is a reference to the Book of Revelation, \"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\".\n\nThe film is often considered a classic of the cinema, and frequently finds its way into lists of \"the greatest movies of all time\", but I must say that it is not one of my favourites. Unlike some on this board I would not dismiss it as pretentious nonsense, because Bergman is quite evidently not being pretentious; his philosophical questioning is painfully sincere. It has its virtues; Max von Sydow as Block is excellent, and there is some striking visual imagery. That scene of Block and Death playing chess on a rocky beach against the backdrop of a stormy-looking evening sky will be familiar to many who have not seen the film itself. Moreover, philosophical speculation of the sort attempted here is not inherently uncinematic. In my view one of the greatest films of recent years is Scorsese's \"Silence\" which deals with this same idea of the \"silence of God\".\n\nI think that the difference between the two films is that Scorsese manages to incorporate his philosophical themes into an excellent story (about two Christian missionaries in 17th century Japan) by a first-rate novelist, Shusaku Endo, a story which would be of interest even to those who are not of a philosophical turn of mind. \"The Seventh Seal\", on the other hand, does not really work well as a story; it is more a series of loosely connected scenes, some memorable, others less so. Bergman's anguished questioning of God is the sort of thing which struck me as more suited to the pulpit- he was the son of a prominent Swedish clergyman- or to the university lecture theatre than to the cinema screen. 6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dark, beautiful, meaningful, exploring the most serious themes of faith and searching for God, \"The Seventh Seal\" is known as one of the landmark Bergman's movies. One of the film's inspirations was a painting that Bergman saw as a young boy and was transfixed by: \"There was everything that one's imagination could desire. Angels, saints, dragons, prophets, devils, humans. There were very frightening animals: serpents in paradise, Balaam's ass, Jonah's whale, the eagle of Revelation. All this was surrounded by heavenly, earthly and subterranean landscapes of strange yet familiar beauty. I remember Death playing chess with a Crusader, Death sawing at a tree to a branch of which clung a naked man with staring eyes, and across a gentle hill Death leading the final dance towards the dark lands\" (Bergman in Hart). The film follows the journey of a knight Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) returning from Crusades through Sweden ravaged by plague. The knight has lost his faith in the blood and horrors of the battlefield, \"Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.\" On his way home, he encountered people dying from starvation and disease, being burnt as witches as well as Mr. Death himself who challenged him to play a game of chess and the family of a happy juggler, his wife, and their infant son. This family is happy because they love each other. They represent the simple joys and hopes of ordinary life.\n\nEverything about \"The Seventh Seal\" is extra-ordinary including acting. I especially liked J\u00f6ns, Antonius Block's misogynist squire - the best performance in the movie by Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand. His quotes about love are hilarious:\n\n\"Love is the blackest of all plagues... if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love, but you don't die of it.\" \"Love is as contagious as a cold. It eats away at your strength, morale... If everything is imperfect in this world, love is perfect in its imperfection.\"\n\nI know the film's reputation and I enjoyed watching it but it did not click with me completely the way the others Bergman's films did (\"Fanny and Alexander\", \"Persona\", \"Smiles of a Summer Night\") and I found myself bored few times. I keep thinking why? It seems to me that the movie is slightly overdone and overheated with its attacking images, abstractions and discursive dialog. I understand that it is a very serious film but while watching it, I could not help thinking how funny its images and dialog would look and sound in parodies. (Not as anything is wrong with that). Woody Allen obviously thought the same. :)"

It is plenty of scenes that stay in mind , such as the appearance of Death , the flagellants parade , the torture and execution by means of a burning pole of an allegedly witch , and , specially , the ending sequence . Stunning casting by Bergman's usual actors : Gunnarn Bjornstrand , Bibi Andersson , Gunnel Lindblon and an awesome Max Von Sidow as the disillusioned knight in his first international great success . Wonderfully directed is all strongest for being brilliantly photographed in an excellent black and white by Gunnar Fischer . It is a masterpiece who made his major impact gaining international acclaim .

        "review_detailed_main": "Ingmar Bergman's 1957 film 'The Seventh Seal' is a story set in the middle ages yet explores the universal theme of how we face awareness of our mortality and inevitable death, and reconcile with a silent God.\n\nThe story follows the protagonist Antonius Block, a knight returning from the crusades to his native Sweden only to find his homeland torn apart by the plague. While Block is tormented by the prospect of there being no God nor afterlife, his squire Jons is content with the material world being all there is, yet fiercely punishes wrongdoers and saves the innocent, lacking faith yet still retaining a strong sense of justice.\n\nOne cannot discuss The Seventh Seal without also mentioning Block's ongoing feud with the personification of Death, who stalks him throughout. When Death first appears, Block tries to stave off the inevitable by outwitting him in a game of chess, played intermittently throughout the film.\n\nThe traveling pair meet a troupe of entertainers including married couple Jof and Mia, and their infant son Mikail. Jof is a carefree acrobat given to occasional spiritual visions, but is not constrained by religious doctrine nor the torments of doubt and the cynicism that afflict the knight and his squire. This unlikely union leads to Block finding a moment of peace and meaning while in their company, which will guide him in performing one last meaningful and life affirming act before arriving home, where his final destiny awaits.\n\nThe Seventh Seal is revelatory in how it portrays the diverse human responses to the prospect of a Godless world, and the absurdity of doing good in the face of a final end. The character of Block would appeal particularly to the doubter, the faith obsessed yet faithless, the perennial lonely soul. The traumas of the world lead some to self flagellation, others to nihilistic criminality, some to asceticism and angst, some remain fools while others just bask in the innocence and joy of family life - A pattern that is recognisable and universal. As universal as the death that awaits us all in the end."

Encountering communal responses to the plague as they travel along Block buys time clumsily attempting to stall the match after unwittingly revealing his game plan.\n\nThis cinematic milestone may have lost a touch of its lustre over the years with a number of sharp homage parodies by the likes of Woody Allen and The Pythons but on it's own it remains a provocative examination of the meaning of life and ultimate fate seen from a variety of viewpoints. It is a film that begs introspection and while you may not identify with any of the characters it forces one to examine their own fate.\n\nDirector Ingmar Bergman's script and imagery are rich in symbolism and his stock company of actors (especially Gunnar Bjornstrand's profane and cynical Squire Jon) up to the task in conveying their purpose of character. Bergman moves them like pieces in a game of chess but preserves their humanity through his signature close-ups and moments of occasional frivolity.\n\nOver half a century after it and a handful of other exports came to these shores and changed the way Americans looked at film The Seventh Seal today may show some of its age but it still retains the capability of being a very interesting conversation piece."

        "review_detailed_main": "Death is the major theme of this 'The Seventh Seal (1957)', with the great plague backdrop acting as an apocalyptic omen for almost everyone involved. The piece is dripping with portent, a low-key but tangible melancholy that's almost oppressive. It's bleak, for sure. It's certainly not fun. Of course, it isn't supposed to be. Instead, it aims to tackle its taboo head-on. It doesn't provide easy answers, with the spectre of the grim reaper seeming to exist entirely separately from any from of God. The search for God is also a major theme. Each character has a unique relationship with their faith, which evolves over the course of the plot. No view is ever expressed as 'right'; it's simply what the character believes. The overall result of the picture is downbeat, despite some moments of hope. Though it feels loose and segmented, it undeniably has an effect. It leaves you with a melancholy that's difficult to explain. In the moment, however, it's never hugely engaging. It's not bad, but it doesn't really connect with you on a conscious level. Obviously, it must resonate in some way in order to leave you feeling the way it does. It's just that the cold, meditative discussions that make up its narrative aren't often all that compelling. Neither are the odd set-pieces which actually feel somewhat 'random'. It has its moments and isn't constantly grim. When the portentous stuff gets more overt, it's really effective. A scene of mass self-harm is genuinely rather upsetting, for example. Thankfully, the piece doesn't always deal in overt sadness. The previously mentioned moments of hope help to elevate its dour effect, making for a relatively rounded experience. In the end, its message is about acceptance rather than doom. No matter which way you cut it, though, it's still quite bleak. At least it has the guts to tackle something that most people actively try to avoid. As I said, it's not fun. 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Seventh Seal has an odd tone. It feels cheery and comical, and yet it's themes and statements are so serious and profound. Bergman's blurring of comedy and tragedy is very effective, because considering what the movie is saying, irony in feeling and mood is vital.\n\nThe plot seems as if it's a glum farce, as a knight plays for his life in a chess game against personified Death. It is weaved gracefully and mysteriously with symbolisms and metaphors in seemingly very direct scenes of great power, about whether death is escapable or not, and though one can plot against it, the plot may only be a stall for time. The film's tragicomic duality is projected throughout the film, as it has very prominent themes of denial of the prospect of God's nonexistence against the darkly satirical setting: The end of the Crusades in a naive, plague-torn village, a time when faith in God was something stringently and daftly policed.\n\nThe Seventh Seal leaves a great impact upon me, and the cinematography, as subtle as it is, is one of the things about it I love the most. The silent symbolisms, the quiet effects, and especially the silhouetted dance of death on the hill are quite powerful. This could also be one of the best performances I've seen from Max Von Sydow.\n\nIt is one of the true deservedly hailed masterpieces of the movies, and I will see it again several times."

In the age of the Black Plague, the streets are filled with pagans, drunks, artisans, performers, religious zealots and volunteer witch-burners; a knight and his squire, home from the Crusades, stop at the ocean, where a most benign Grim Reaper tells the knight he has been at his side for a long while. They engage in a winner-take-all game of chess, though the knight is just biding time to save the friends he has made from Death's clutches. The barbarism and cruelty aside, writer-director Bergman does show a streak of pithy black humor, resulting in some amazing sequences (such as the juggler cut down from a tree by Death and his scythe). The overlay of brutality in the name of Christianity, the torment of faith and the heavy symbolism are often tough to wade through, while the metaphor of the chess game has left the picture open for parody. Still, \"The Seventh Seal\" is a must-see film, matching its iconic imagery with themes of the eternal struggle. *** from ****"

It is populated with Bergman regulars, including von Sydow as a knight who spews platitudes every time he opens his mouth. The cinematography is impressive.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Seventh Seal\" is Ingmar Bergman's film depicting Sweden during the 14th century in the time of the bubonic plague. The film starts with Antonius Block, a knight and his squire returning from the Crusades to Sweden. Antonius is pursued by Death in corporeal form, and challenges him to a high stakes game of chess. From there the film explores the lives of a number of characters within Sweden with the chess game as a recurring element in the film.\n\nMy favorite of the characters was Antonius Block, the pensive knight in a crisis of faith played skillfully by Max von Sydow. Also particularly memorable were Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand as the snappy and cynical squire and Bengt Ekerot as Death himself. All of the performances in this film were first-rate.\n\nThis film is very effective as a snapshot of the Middle Ages and includes a mix of humorous and somber scenes to chronicle the age. This film covers a range of topics pertinent to the Middle Ages including the effects of the bubonic plague and Crusades, crises of faith, self-punishment as atonement, love, stage performance, the arbitrary punishment of a \"witch\" and naturally, death. One of the film's notable scenes was when a soothsayer from the church bombards a public audience with a message of doom. All of these themes are considered with striking characterizations and sharp dialogue.\n\nThe idea of having a lingering Death figure to represent the uncertainty of the time was an excellent one. The dialogues between Block and Death proved among the most interesting moments of the film, even though they only represent a fraction of the film. My only regret of this film is that Bergman didn't include more interplay between Block and Death, but overall \"The Seventh Seal\" is very engaging and interesting."

When Death takes his knight as they play shortly after meeting Jof and his family, Block replies \"...as you were meant to.\" No one so far has commented on this line, but it seems to me to be talking about a bit more than one move in a chess game.\n\nLater on, when the knight attempts to reset the game, I think it was a last-ditch effort to get for time. Once he sees that he's accomplished his goal regardless, though, the knight finally feels ready for closure. He still pines for answers, but the fact that he followed through on his deed allows him to rest a little easier and accept his fate."

        "review_detailed_main": "Salutations from the dawn! Words aren't enough to describe how powerful is the experience of testifying \"Det Sjunde Inseglet\" (\"The Seventh Seal\") but I'll do my best. Ingmar Bergman's most celebrated work, admired and indirectly copied by many (the figure of Death created here was imitated in countless productions), remains as an essential work, one of a kind. It's something that will never lose its importance, it'll always be relevant no matter the decade, the century or whatever because it works themes that are the main doubt of the human race since its existence, the issue that few are open to discuss all knowing that is going to happen one day: death. Even though it's not everyone who can admire films like these but certainly no film lover out there can't miss such precious treasure.\n\nThe Apocalypse is coming or so it seems to be. In a medieval period the plague is devastating an entire population, that part of the world is crumbling to pieces and there's no much love and compassion among people. It's there in this world that also lives the knight Antonious Block (Max von Sydow, brilliant) and his loyal and sarcastic squire J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand), both returning from some hard battles in the Crusades. But when Death (Bengt Ekerot, fantastic and very memorable) appears to take Antonious to the other world, the knight decides to challenge Death into a Chess match, trying to bargain his staying on Earth. If Block wins he'll live longer; otherwise he'll die, the most frightening thing that can ever happen to a living being, his end.\n\nBetween this game, there's plenty of moments with the knight exposing his doubts and fears, his confusion in trust between God or Devil, to whom appeal in order to stay alive, putting his faith in a complete doubt but still praying, wishing, wanting answers. \"I cry to Him in the dark but there seems to be no one there\" painfully cries this noble knight, trying to believe in something, just as much as when he searches for a so-called witch responsible for bringing the Black Plague to the city. The man is pure agony and he desperately needs to know his destiny (just like we all do since the pre-historic man).\n\nPosing infinite questions and providing very few answers, Bergman makes of the first apocalyptic film ever made a remarkable study that resonates like a Shakespeare work whose main purpose is to better reveal our human condition, our anxieties, our fears, our everlasting wishes for a purpose, and our doubts between this and that, all of this marked with poetry, passion and a complete artistic view of things. It's an relevant and poignant work dealing with real issues but perfectly adding supernatural elements to the story.\n\nIt is an melancholic, dark, grim, somewhat depressive film that doesn't go easy on the viewer. The harder the better, more views you'll wanna do it (and you'll love doing so). The author talks about faith and God without evoking religion or certain beliefs and fanaticism (even though the main characters fought in the Crusades, so there's some Catholic perception here but that's it), and we can't blame this quoting Bergman was an atheist. And if so, he was perhaps the most believer between the atheists (check his remark about God in the last lines of \"Through a Glass Darkly\", the finest description of what God's love is, so far from what priests and others tend to tell people about). In short, \"The Seventh Seal\" works controversial themes without being controversial, without causing hysteria or angered reactions by audiences.\n\nAbout the film as a work of art: splendid from minute one, with that famous opening with Death appearing to Antonious on the shore, where he receives the warning that he must die, evolving to the chess game. The beautiful yet oppressive cinematography of Gunnar Fischer, the way he uses darkness, lighting and effects are a must-see. Also the formidable and very expressive casting, all outstanding. Special credit must be given to Bengt Ekerot and his terrifying (at times very humorous) appearance as the scariest of all presences among the living, very tricky, with soft voice but wrapped in darkness and mystery. The screenplay is fantastic, very enigmatic and very thoughtful, drenched in poetry, lyricism, fantasy. And we all smile at the ending with this wonderful job. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Seventh Seal is a very difficult film to review, it is a very powerful film that raises a lot of questions for the viewer to consider and it achieves that aim very well, but it doesn't really do much else. The Seventh Seal has a large cast of characters who all come together within the film's vague plot (a Knight returning home from the crusades, who plays a game of chess with Death along the way), it does feel as though some characterisation has been lost somewhere as a result of the little screen time given to each one, personally I would have liked to have got to known these characters a bit more, but it is not really necessary for the viewer to do so for the film to achieve it's aims. Which is basically for the viewer to examine himself and ask questions about what will happen when we die. With the main character of the Knight taking to asking most of the questions, as he is desperate to find out where he will go when he succumbs to Death's checkmate. As, ultimately, these questions are not answered in the film, it means that a lot of the impact The Seventh Seal has takes place off screen, in it's prompting of the viewer to ask this for themselves. Can it be that all that's waiting for us is nothing? One of philosophy's most asked questions, and to be honest, one that most human beings have asked themselves from a young age, so most of the dialogue on this subject can hardly be called especially profound. The dialogue is quite philosophical heavy, as you might expect, and does help provide a good amount of interest in the film, the cinematography and acting too, are very good, most notably Max Von Sydow's performance. Not one to watch to entertain your mates, The Seventh Seal is a well made philosophical piece that will give the viewer something to think about, ultimately they have thought about it before so it's nothing new, but more a cold reminder that Death is waiting."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Seventh Seal\" goes beyond the notion of movie. For me it is a miracle. Much simply said, the greatest work of art of the 20th century. The abyssal depth of this film is stunning. The greatest questions that have shaken the human mind and soul from the beginning of the species, Death, God, Love, Evil, Meaning of Life, Desperation, Hope, are here faced with sound courage and outstanding intelligence.\n\nNo doubt that the director Ingmar Bergman was a genius. But his other works, though many of them extraordinary, were just movies, while in the \"The Seventh Seal\" he reached the level of the greatest artists of human history. The images are worth of Duerer, Bosch, Bruegel. The script, the psychological study of the characters and the poetry are worth of Shakespeare and Goethe. The depth of the philosophical and theological investigation is worth of Spinoza and Swedenborg.\n\nThe Middle Ages of Northern Europe are recreated with the accuracy and care for details of a great artist. The monk's sermon on sin and repentance grates to our modern ears, but we realize that it is perfectly coherent and realistic for the Middle Ages. The knight and his squire see the witch executed on the stake. They are disgusted, but they accept it and do not interfere. That's the way people were in those times. And the disturbing scene at the tavern, were, for no reason, the innocent, meek tumbler is abused and everybody laughs at him, is fully realistic, as well. That was people's sense of humor in those ages.\n\nThe ancient Nordic culture is represented in all its terrible splendor: the plague, the flagellants, the witch hunt, the mystic visions of the tumbler, the encounter of the knight and his skeptical squire with the wandering actors, the fool girl, the reading of the Apocalypse. And, of course, the chess-match with the Death, one of the most powerful symbols in the history of art.\n\nAmong uncountable instances, I record a wonderful subtlety of the script. The knight says to the Death \"I don't fear to die, but, please, tell me: is there a God?\" But not even the Death can answer. He just knows his own dreadful existence.\n\nSince, after all, we are speaking of a film, let me remark that there isn't a single moment of bore in \"The Seventh Seal\", in spite of the profound problems it deals with.\n\nAre the above enthusiastic comments somehow exaggerated? I don't think so. Watch \"The Seventh Seal\" and merge yourself into Art at its highest level."

If you've seen one Bergman film, you've seen them all. The poor man put a lot of effort into exploring life's BIG issues but never seemed to get any closer to an answer about any of them. As I've become a more sophisticated movie watcher, I find Bergman's style nearly intolerable. His films are airless and stifling, and hopelessly pretentious. It's been a long time since I've seen \"The Seventh Seal,\" and maybe I would have a better opinion of it on a second viewing, but frankly, I would rather watch \"Snakes on a Plane\" than watch this film again.\n\nOne of the famous images in this film is the shot of the Reaper leading a dance of death across a stark hillside. Woody Allen aped it in his 1975 film \"Love and Death.\"\n\nGrade: B"

However, Antonious is not ready for his life to end. It is not because he is afraid of death, but because he wants to gain knowledge of God. With his faith hampered by ten tears fighting in the crusades and by the fact that his countrymen are rotting to death because of the plague Antonious wants to discover if God truly exists or not. Therefore, in order to gain some time, Antonious challenges Death to a game of chess that the two play throughout the film.\n\nThe main struggle within Bergman's film is the conflict one feels when one wants to have faith in God in times of trouble, however, because God is silent and lets his people suffer one truly wonders if such a God truly exists. However, because one has believed in the God for his or her entire life, one cannot extract go from one's heart and mind thereby making one's wavering faith a source of pain and conflict instead of the bastion of hope it had once been.\n\nA slow, meditative film, The Seventh Seal brings to the fore the extremes some people will go to in times of strife. With its depictions of flagellates, those who beat themselves in order to repent for their sins, and witch burnings the film is obviously not a very happy film, but it is one that will make one think of the unknown and whether or nor within this vast unknown is there anything there or is it empty?"

        "review_title": "The universality and invincibility of Death, the fear of dying, the importance of faith and its use by the Church in a timeless film, but not suitable for everyone.",
        "review_detailed_main": "The film, set in the late Middle Ages, begins with a knight returning to his homeland in Sweden after participating in the crusades. When he spots the figure of Death, who has come to get him, he decides to try to gain time by inviting her to play chess: if he wins the game, Death will not take him.\n\nWhat follows is a huge film essay around the themes of death, beliefs, faith, religion and the role of spirituality in human experience. While the plague is raging and claiming victims, we see people increasingly scared, and blindly resorting to faith to protect themselves from what looks like the end of times. We see people's daily lives, with their mistakes, virtues, sins and difficulties. We see the knight himself, with a growing fear of dying and struggling with deeper and deeper doubts about faith, the existence of God. Furthermore, we also see how the Church exploited the fear of death to reinforce its power, influence and relevance within uneducated communities shaken by the epidemic. The ending is simple, but there is a deep meaning in it.\n\nSwedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece seems to have its origins in his own fear of death. Max von Sydow, who gave life to the knight, is the greatest actor present in the film and gives us a strong and impactful performance. The film has gained notoriety over the decades and has become one of the most timeless and culturally significant classics of European cinema. However, it is not a film for everyone. Its simplicity, the way it approaches very complicated and philosophical themes and the ending that is difficult to understand at first glance are more than enough reasons why many people do not like this film, and I have to admit that there is a reason. For me personally, it wasn't a success, it's not a movie you want to see regularly, but I recognize its value."

        "review_detailed_main": "We are in Europe, 14th century. After ten long years, the knight Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) makes his return trail from the Crusades with his J\u00f6ns squire, Squire (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) in the ancient land. Antonius Block has the semblance of those who have seen and gone through everything and fear nothing, a fascinating character, in fact this actor is extraordinary.\n\nBergman's cinema is full of meanings, or rather symbologies. It may go unnoticed but it's there. Right in the first scenes we have a powerful semiotic sequence that indicates the scope of the conflicts treated within the drama.\n\nWe open the first scene with a sky that is difficult to describe, the tension is perceptible, it is not a sky that conveys peace, it is not only dark either, there is a conflict. The intensity rises to the volume of orchestrated music and signals the imminence of something on the way all in a few seconds, right after.... Silence.\n\nA crow flies over a rocky, typically Scandinavian, rocky coastline, under the low light of high latitude, an unmistakable cinematographic photograph when, in Bergman's film, only the second scene is created. \"When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour... Then I saw the seven angels standing before God: they gave them seven trumpets\". Silence.\n\nThey sleep on the beach, the horses drink water, the sun is over the horizon. Antonius Block lifts his face in the sea and looks beside him, and there is a macabre figure, Death, also known as The Reaper (Bengt Ekerot) Here's the dialog:\n\nKnight: Who are you?\n\nDeath: I am death.\n\nKnight: Have you come to get me?\n\nDeath: I've been with you for a long time.\n\n(...)\n\nThese are just the first 2 minutes of the movie. It is very dense and at the same time beautiful how Bergman quickly builds an immersive, dreamlike and fantastic environment imbued with a psychological density, building a surrealist situation but absolutely embedded in a realistic and pertinent logical discussion.\n\nThen we move on to the key metaphor of the film, the very enigmatic, incredibly symbolic classic scene. Antonius Block proposes to Death, always in fabulous dialogues, a game of Chess, the game would last several days, each move in a place on the path of his return, if he won, Death would leave him. Death just smiles in acceptance. Here we have another subtle interesting point, why would death accept and smile so confidently? Chess is a game of many possibilities... Philosophically we can think that no one can ever escape death and she knows that, so by accepting it, what does she intend?\n\nThis scene of the beginning of the chess game between Antonius Block vs Death is perhaps one of the most famous scenes in cinema, it is full of meanings. We have here, infinite paths. My intention is to create an environment of immersion and reflection, proposing multiple interpretations. In my view, I found a beautiful metaphor, chess as dialectic, each move is an argument and so on. This dialogue will develop in a profoundly poetic, philosophical way about human existence and the meaning of life in the face of death throughout the film.\n\nHere, a possible point of conflict for the character, also due to the historical context itself, begins to emerge. What was the point of fighting for faith in God for 10 years, winning and receiving death after a sacrificed victory? We only try to sharpen awareness of some possible points of analysis, as there are many. Survive through the Middle Ages, survive famine, survive disease, fight for God for 10 years in a religious war, survive, return on a long journey and be surprised by death."

        "review_detailed_main": "Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, \"The Seventh Seal\" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality.\n\nTaking its title from the Book of Revelation, \"The Seventh Seal\" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: \"I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me,\" he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented.\n\nBergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (\u00c5ke Fridell), squire J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality."

        "review_detailed_main": "***SPOILERS*** Traveling back to his castle in Scandinavia Christian Knight Antonius Block, Max Von Sydow, has seen enough death and horror in the Crusade that he went on into the Holy Land, where he fought the last ten years. The Crusades took almost all the faith that he had in man as well as his belief in God out of him.\n\nTogether with his squire, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Block found that his native land as well as the whole of Western Europe is being ravaged by the Black Plague that's destroying even more lives that the Crusades. Block begins to wonder if the plague is God's retribution to man for the evils that he committed over the centuries.\n\nBlock and his squire have another person traveling with them through the hills and forests and along the coast of Sweden and he was with them throughout their entire journey back home from the hell-fires of the Middle-East Death, Bengt Ekerot.\n\nSensing who he is when Block sees him at the seashore he knows that his time has come but talks him into playing him a game of chess to for stall his eventual demise. Even more to get from Death the knowledge about good and evil and the existence of a God before he ends up at the tip of the Grim Reaper's scythe.\n\nThe chess game goes on and off throughout the movie \"The Seventh Seal\" and as long as Block stays in the game he stays alive as well as those who he picked up with him in his going back home to his castle where his lovely wife Karin, Inga Lanogre, is waiting for him.\n\nBeautifully and eerily photographed and directed by Igmar Bergman \"The Seventh Seal\" show us how we can be deceived into thinking that what were told is good can easily turn out to be evil, by those whom we trust and believe in. Like in the case of the many thousands of men like Block who believed enough to be willing to give up their lives for it.\n\nLater in the film we see Raval, Bertil Anderbern, stealing the gold and silver jewelry off the dead to enrich himself. Raval was the local religious leader who's fiery speeches to go to Jerusalem and drive the unbelievers out of that holy city and the entire holy land. Reduced to being a Godless grave-robber and unfeeling liar Raval ends up falling victim to the very horror that he profited from in stealing from the dead: the plague.\n\nAs it begins to look that Death is slowly winning his game of chess with Block and the end is almost near for him he in desperation goes to talk to this young woman, Maud Hansson, who's about to be burned at the stake for being a witch by the local townspeople. Block trying to find out if it's true that she can see and even communicate with the Devil feeling that if the Devil exists God has to exist too. Since one can't exist without the other.\n\nMercyfully giving her a potion that would ease her pain from the torch and fire thats about to engulf her all Block gets from the woman is a mindless and empty stare as she awaits the horror thats about to end her short and so mournful life.\n\n\"The Seventh Seal\" is considered my many to be Bergmans best film and since he made it back in 1956 he never came close to making another motion picture, with the many fine movies that he made over the years since then, as good as it was and still is even now. The movie not only makes you wonder if there's any truth that God as well as good and evil exists but also makes you think about yourself and that final journey into the dark and great unknown that we all eventually will have to travel."

Maybe those serious, somewhat dull Woody Allen films where he would try to emulate his idol Bergman; he would even get Sven Nykvist to be the cinematographer sort of put me off.\n\nHowever I felt it was time to enter the stark monochrome world of Ingmar Bergman and his most celebrated film, The Seventh Seal starring Max von Sydow as the medieval knight Antonius Block.\n\nVon Sydow looks as young as I have ever seen him before, he is an actor who has always looked old. I find it hard to believe that I am older than he was in films such as The Three Days of the Condor and he looked old in that movie.\n\nBlock has returned with his squire from the Crusades to find Sweden ravaged with the plague. Death surrounds them and pretty soon Death comes for Block but he holds him back by challenging him to a game of chess in the hope that if he beats Death, he cheats death by being reprieved.\n\nHowever Death has few tricks up his dark sleeves and they are non chess moves as he fools Block in revealing his strategy. However Block also has motives of his own, an endgame where he wishes not to save himself but someone else.\n\nThe story introduces other characters such as the blacksmith and his cheating wife, a lustful theatre manager, a band of actors including a resilient married couple. We have vignettes some comic, some tragic such as a girl being burned on the stake as a witch.\n\nThe film is episodic and existentialist. It is thought provoking with stark symbolism. I admit I never fathomed what it was all about but to me it was Block trying to do one good deed by cheating Death so others could live."

More than anything else, it looks at the questions that surround people in their lives, and shows that they don't necessarily have clear-cut answers. The ever-imposing Max Von Sydow plays Antonius Block, a Swedish knight returning home after having fought in the Crusades. He and his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) meet Death (Bengt Ekerot). The not-so-Grim Reaper is of course planning to take the men to the afterlife, but the knight makes a most unusual deal: he and Death will play chess, and he will get to stay alive as long as he wins.\n\nWhether or not Antonius wins is not the point. The movie is a philosophical look not only at how the Bubonic Plague was affecting Europe, but probably also at how certain things are always creeping up on us. The final scene affirms this, and the movie affirms Ingmar Bergman as a director unlike any other."

Because of Bergman's recent death, I once again had a chance to see it on TCM. And once again I barely made it past the \"famous\" opening scene with Death playing chess on the beach. I finally do have one thing figured out though. The opening scene is the best known scene from the film because hardly anyone can get beyond it. Oh sure, the Black Leather Art Crowd will tell you they watched the whole film, but don't believe it. They watch that stupid Death plays chess on the beach scene, rate the film a \"10\" and then post a glowing review here on IMDb to prove they know art when they see it! When it comes to Bergman films though, I'm simply too stupid to \"get\" them. So please don't flame me for my obviously ignorant opinion.

        "review_detailed_main": "Welcome to my blog. It is not without reason that I have chosen this film as the first post ever, certain it will bring good vibrations our way. In any case, what a better way to start, than with a master!\n\nThe Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's 1956 gem of a feature. I don't think I am really suitable to give an impartial opinion on this movie, because I simply love it in an almost morbid way. Maybe because of its landscapes, barren and desolated; maybe because of its close-ups: paintings, section-views of a human's spirit; maybe because of the beauty, angelical, yet full of vitality and passion, of the female interpreters; maybe because of its hieratic stillness, alternated with the utmost dynamicity, the timeline blurring at the edges, both in the movie, and in real-time; maybe because of Antonius Block and his obsessive quest, exemplar of the struggle we face against fake spirituality, and his all-consuming receipt of the final strike of the scythe.\n\nBlock is a noble knight, returning to his native Sweden after ten years spent fighting in the Crusades, with his faithful squire, who shares the same whole-heartedness, only to find a country ravaged by the Black Death, and people trying what they can to save themselves from what they think is a divine curse. We come to identify with him, and we come to love the simple goodness of Jof (Joseph) and Mia (Mary), and their symbolic role in this allegoric tale, which grabs us by the throat from the start, with the scenes of desolation in a plague-ridden Sweden. The realism of the small countryside village where the story first develops is proof of Bergman's mastery with the alternation between wider frames and close-ups, between general and particular, between society and inner individual life, and their collision, a theme dear to the Swedish master, as we can see in later films, such as Persona.\n\nBut I'm digressing now. It's time for you to enjoy the show: whether it is for the first or the tenth time, I know you will..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I genuinely feel sorry for people who can only describe this film as \"boring.\" No, there are no explosions, car chases or sappy romantic scenes. `Lethal Weapon 3' this film is not. But that fact is only one of the many virtues for this film! I think that people really deny a part of their own humanity when they cannot look past the surface of things.\n\nI can't believe that any thoughtful and feeling human being who allows him or herself to recognize the passionate and profound themes in this film can help being somewhat moved by them. If you have ever pondered questions about life deeper than \"What are we having for dinner tonight?\" or `Should I wear white past Labor Day?' this film is for you. And the story is told with excellent imagery and symbolism that combines into an overwhelming experience for the senses and the intellect.\n\nOf course, some may be disturbed by the \"answers\" this film provides. I guess for me, I identify strongly with Bergman's thesis, that perhaps everything we utter about what lies beyond death is a mere projection; that, in the final analysis, we know nothing. But I also identify with the `silent protest' of the squire.\n\nOne of the lines that sums up the film for me is:\n\n\"I want knowledge. Not belief. Not surmise. But knowledge.\" -- Antonious Block"

        "review_detailed_main": "What else could be said about this larger than life masterpiece? The visuals, the acting, the beautiful script, everything connects here and gives birth to the brilliant tale of a knight's quest for the meaning of his life.\n\nThe plot is well known, a knight who returns from the crusade faces Death, but instead of accepting it, he challenges it to a game of chess. Antonius Block, the knight, will be alive as long as he does not lose. He continues the journey home while he plays chess. Pretty simple.\n\nNevertheless, what Block(played by wonderful Max Von Sydow) will find in the journey home is a long series of questions and answers about life, death & God. With his loyal squire, J\u00f6ns(Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand), he will be part of a series of events that will serve as catalyst to Block's meditations(and ours). J\u00f6ns' particular cynicism and Block's bizarre(for the time) view of life contrasts with the traditional way of life of the age, and the innocence represented by Jof and Mia, a couple of traveling artists who also joins them in their travel.\n\nAs many critics and historians have pointed out, the visual imagery used by Bergman in this film has become an immortal image of the history of cinema. Since the very beginning, the image of Death(Bengt Ekerot) is at the same time Haunting and mesmerizing. Bergman understood very well the language of images and created a beautifully shocking image.\n\nMax Von Sydow and Gunna Bj\u00f6rnstrand shine in the lead roles, giving their characters a personality of their own. The mere look in the eyes of Block give a very powerful insight of the man's emotion. Max Von Sydow really gives one of cinema's greatest performances.\n\nFinally, I can't stop recommending this movie. It may be boring at first, and maybe difficult to understand; but certainly it's an experience that will stay in the collective mind of humanity for many years. It's a true masterpiece.\n\n10/10"

As a Swedish person, though admittedly co-bombarded by american/Hollywood \"culture\", I see the tradition in which the test-audience screened Hollywood type movies are the epitome as a special class of movies. Investment type flicks which serve the explicit purpose of making money. The Seventh Seal on the other hand represent what real, honest movie making is all about. Something which of course Hollywood is not unable of!\n\nA am truly happy for all of you who have managed to see beyond your often highly explosive \"mainstream\"!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the kind of movie that requires attention from the viewer. It is metaphoric, not about medieval times but about all human beings, at all times. The story is simple, a Knight (Max Von Sydow) coming home from the crusades to a land ravaged by the plague. He encounters death and challenge him to a game of chess. He is not really seeking to prolong his life instead he is really seeking answers. He has seen death in the crusades and he is facing more death as he comes home.\n\nThe scene with the Knight and Death playing chess by the seashore is one of the most haunting scenes in this movie. There are many of them. Ingmar Bergman really pulled out all the stops to create a movie which will haunt you and at the same time make you ponder. It's not just about a Knight on a pointless game but about all human beings. The Knight represents all human being asking the same questions.\n\nThe scene that affected me most is the scene when the knight arrives at a monastery and is confessing to who he thought was a monk or a priest. The questions that the knight asked are the kind of questions that we all have asked and the response that he gets is pretty much the response we will get. The movie delves into the question of mortality and the meaning of existence. Anybody who has thought about it will understand the Knight's frustration and despondency, for the answer is perhaps nonexistent.\n\nFor me the brilliance of this film is that it asked the important questions early and left us with no real answers. By asking the questions, scenes in this movie are not just images but they have underlying meanings. Meanings that we the viewer then create for ourselves. What was the scene with the strawberries and milk mean? If it had any meaning at all. I find myself thinking that that scene is about joy of simple pleasure and being with pleasant people providing us with good feelings and memories that we will treasure.\n\nI have to admit I have rarely seen a movie that affected me as much as this movie. It was one of those movies I personally would like to have seen again back to back. The movies that I frequently would watch back to back were light weight stuff comedies or action films. Rarely do I wish to see serious drama again back to back.\n\nRight now I will have to admit it barely missed being in my top ten greatest films. I have a feeling that the next time I see it again I will have to move it very high."

        "review_detailed_main": "There seem already to be a lot of good comments (although some may be overstated). The only thing I believe I can really add is an interesting note about the circumstances of the film: it's one of Bergman's earlier films, and Bergman later almost disowned it (along with \"Wild Strawberries\") because he believed that their subject matter was unimportant. He was \"much happier,\" he said, after he left behind the agony of the quest for God and became a secular humanist.\n\nFor me, this simply underlines the intense difficulty with which one truly confronts the search for God. It is, I suppose, to be expected that Bergman had to leave his search behind, since it caused him so much pain-- a pain which is beautifully crystallized in his film. But I hope his movie remains popular, if only because I believe the struggle is an important one in the human legacy, one which every man must confront.\n\nFew movies can even begin to approach the subject of religious agony without tending either toward the disgustingly sentimental and revisionist (a la \"schindler's list\") or the stupid \"cool\" atmosphere that seems to pervade movies these days. Ingmar Bergman does it in what is quite possibly the best way: taking a minimalist approach, he doesn't veer toward flashy camera techniques that dazzle, nor toward lingeringly emotional scenes. There is just enough of everything: just enough plot to tell us what is going on without confusing, just enough cutting to relieve us from longer shots without jarring the eye with too much motion, just enough dialogue to convey a singular tone that has both focus and depth. This film reaches an \"arete\" that is rare in cinema: its subject meets the medium perfectly, and the stark purity of the cinematography is met by the lonely nature of the ideas which it deals with."

While the aforementioned are undoubtedly great in their own right, this movie addresses mortality, faith, and opposing world views in an incredibly powerful fashion. Though it is very theatrical for a movie, it works because the ideas are so widespread and perennial. Also, the writing is fantastic.

        "review_detailed_main": "No argument, no doubts, no reservations! This film is a genuine masterpiece of the highest quality.\n\nNot a particularly difficult story but Bergman adds to the common strand a morality & immorality of God's existence along with the eternal contradictions of what the purpose of man's existence is upon this sacred Earth.\n\nAfter returning from the Crusades hundreds of years ago, Sydow (Antonius Bloc) and his squire return to a plaque ravaged Sweden where people are dying a horrid death and the sinners tour the country pleading to be exorcised of their sins.\n\nBloc is confronted by the Grim Reaper (Bengt Ekerot) on (of all places )a beach. But before Death takes his soul Bloc offers him a game of chess for his life.\n\nThe chess match continues throughout the film and as we do we see Bloc's tortured mind unravel as his rides between towns seeing the misery the plague (and its owner, Death) is causing. And he wonders why God is punishing these people so harshly.\n\nIn addition we see other characters living their humdrum lives playing very close to the 10 Commandments, where individual steal, murder, lie & betray. Very gradually these sad but doomed individuals all gather along with Bloc and end up in a great castle where their ultimate fate awaits them.\n\nYou really have to see this movie at least twice to unravel the mind of both Bloc & the director, Bergman, for although the story is relatively straightforward, its the intellectual philosophising & existentuality that you really have to understand.\n\nEach character is nothing more than a symbol or parody for some human weakness or foible. Each character believes in God but sees him in a different way when it suits them and often don't realise until its too late that Death doesn't just reach out for the old, sick or the sinners of their world.\n\nBut it is to Sydow's grand Knight that the real pain of human existence is focused upon. Having returned from the many battles of the Crusades, preaching the word of God & righteousness to foreigners he returns to his homeland to find a country ravaged by a plague that knows no social condition: young, old, rich, poor, believer or sinner, they are all doomed.\n\nSydow character is racked with so many feelings of guilt & hatred for both God and Death. Yet he wonders why he should die so soon when he has done God's work and is still left with so many things to do.\n\nBergman is the master when it comes to magnifying our human frailties; his characters are nothing special, just ordinary people and yet they, like us, hide so many sins, that eventually we will pay for our crimes.\n\nBergman doesn't have to hurry the film along, although you sometimes feel nothing very much happens between scenes. But everything is timed & framed for a reason that is not immediately obvious but only becomes clear later in the film.\n\nAnd of course filming in black & white gives the story a very bleak feel, and could also be seen as an allegory of life/death & good/bad. I was especially moved by one scene near the beginning where Death & Bloc play their first moves with the sea in the background & dark clouds surrounding both of them like a deathly shroud.\n\nTo some THE SEVENTH SEAL will appear too pretentious to really appeal; and I suspect a lot of the symbolism & reasoning will not be recognised. But its a film to be patient with, it deserves our respect because when we see these poor innocent characters waiting for their Calling, we are in fact looking at ourselves!!!\n\n*****/*****"

This is picture filled with the horrors of life, the apocalypse, for the black death has come and few can accept that.

But what is amazing is that Bergman within this dark and pessimistic movie managed to put lighter elements (conversation between Antonius and the actors at the sunset) or even humorous (seduction of blacksmith's wife, Death cutting down the tree), which make \"The Seventh Seal\" more absorbing. He put two opposites: cynical and pessimistic Jons and Antonius versus Jof and his family, common people who live a simple life, and therefore are close to God (Jof has visions of the Virgin Mary); and somehow gives answers to Antonius' questions.\n\nIf you don't know any of Bergman's films start with this one.

I have no doubt that Bergman was totally honest in this act of catharsis, to purge his fear of Death. Yet, I'm left cold.\n\nThe inspiration is Albertus Pictor's art, who Bergman casts here as a character. Medieval art is typified by certain characteristics (abandoned in the Renaissance): geometric shapes do not have a vanishing point; figures are depicted hierarchically in order of religious importance. If Bergman had played with these cinematic ideas, if he had relocated us in relation to the image, if he'd framed the actors hierarchically, he'd have done something for me. See Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\" for a period example of how to align the subject with the visual narrative through perspective.\n\nMaybe my own 'perspective' is ruined. I can't look at this without immediately thinking of all the later borrowings I've seen...my personal favorite has nothing to do with movies...Seinfeld's \"The Nose Job\" episode (Jerry's penis vs. Jerry's brain in a chess match over whether to pursue or dump a physically attractive but vacuous actress).\n\n*Spoiler/PS*...My own interpretation is that Von Sydow and co. were dead all along, and were only returning to a haunted land...ideas later used in such pop examples as \"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"Sixth Sense\"."

Some people might analyze each and every scene and dialog and come up with their own interpretations of what Bergman wanted to say. Jacksh*t.\n\nNow usually i love such kind of movies. I am not a fan of commercial craps like fast and furious or the recent man of steel. I am a sucker for good stories, script and character development but this movie had nothing.The dialogs were so darn lame a 14 y.o. could have written them. The pace was so slow the movie felt more like 150 minutes instead of its 90 minute run time.\n\nThis is the second Bergman film i have viewed, the first being Persona which i also felt was overrated but at least kept me interested and concerned with it all along.\n\nI am sure this guy knew his movies but one doesn't make movies only for their fans but for a wider audience. How could you call this guy an artist. All he ever does is try to make a deep engrossing movie that asks its viewers certain important questions about life and the idea of a god but what he ends up making is a sh*t sandwich that should never be viewed under any circumstances.\n\n1/10"

As for my students, it's more than the usual black and white, strange language problem that all film teachers now recognize. It seems to me to be part of the post-modern \"understanding\" that all meaning is as random as any other meaning, and that the search for God is a fake. In many ways I accept that notion, as it does fit in with the way the universe seems to be. My students watch Antonious Blok, and don't understand what his problem. (Bergman did understand that view, and created the character of Jons the squire, as a fill-in for the modern cynic.) Each time I show the film, and see it again for myself, I ask myself if in really is more than my own 60's romanticism, when we were discovering life. There are some films which I stop showing. However, my appreciation for \"The Seventh Seal\", and for Bergman, grows, and I feel it is time for a renewed interest in his films, in spite of our post-modern cynicism."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's something with Ingmar Bergman, after just seeing the first ten minutes I notice his skill as a director. Each scene is just perfection. Having heard a lot of good about his movies and his style I don't have a real explanation of why I have never seen this film or his others, the truth is sadly that I at times can't stand the old Swedish language in movies, it's always over dramatic but here you don't really mind it as you focus more on the excellent camerawork and the visual story telling as almost each frame is perfection.\n\nMax Von Sydow recently passed away and Sweden, my country lost a legend. I saw his second last performance (Kursk) at the cinema and now I go back to one of his best acting performances, as the knight in The Seventh Seal. The dialogue are poetic in a way, the characters were mostly interesting, all of them having their own attributes and thoughts on the black death and Christianity. The acting was good, a bit too dramatic. Max Von Sydow was perfect as the troubled knight, whilst Bengt Ekerot's portrayal as Death will go down for a classic performance in my opinion, remembered for 50 more years.\n\nI understand why this movie isn't for everyone but I loved it, a piece of art and a masterpiece. Ingmar Bergman is a filmmaker worth checking out, starting with this one is a good idea as you get to see his capabilities as an incredible director and writer."

        "review_detailed_main": "A masterful and timeless pondering on mortality and faith produced in the late 50's, Det sjunde inseglet (The Seventh Seal) is undoubtedly one of the most introspective films, with deeply self analyzing characters all coming to terms with the sudden realization of their own death.\n\nBlock, a knight returned from the crusades, is faced with the imminent threat of death and struggles to find answers to his questions, all deeply connected with faith. His curiosity leads to a game of chess with Death itself. With stunning contrasting visual the allegory comes to life in a very theatrical manner with death itself personified. The eternal and frustrating try of self understanding is at the core of the film communicated by deeply dramatic dialog, aided by stunning medieval iconography and symbolism such as the famous danse macabre. There's also a heavy contrast between characters like Block and Jof. Jof represents the simple minded, uncomplicated, serene, with a certain ease in living and loving. While the other characters are absolutely consumed with the though of death, Jof and Mia remain care free for the most part. This dichotomy presented in so many other characters gives the film a theatrical and allegoric feeling but still accessible meaning. The imagery is remarkable with some of the most recognizable shots in film history, from the beginning to the ending frames.\n\nHeavy contrasts both in character, philosophy and cinematography make the film an unquestionable 10."

He continues on his journey back home playing the game. He is disillusioned and encounters various people.\n\nI really love the idea of Death as a character. Max von Sydow has superior presence that elevates his character. The strict Christianity and the intense stuff are very compelling. I'm not as interested in the other characters and I wish the movie stays with Block. It's a bit uneven and slow at times. Nevertheless, it has some fascinating aspects."

As Death is very busy he has to run in and out of the game. Meanwhile Antonius tries to find out if there is a God that can save him, for which a clear answer he of course is not given. On the way however he stumbles into a acting couple that experience true happiness that makes him forget for a little while what he's running from. 'Det Sjunde Inseglet' is typical for Bergman full of clever allegories and questions. It takes more than a lifetime to answer them all."

        "review_title": "\"Nothing escapes me\" - Death",
        "review_detailed_main": "Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) has shipwrecked on the shores of Sweden with his squire J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) having returned from a Crusade in the Holy Land. In these shores he meets Death (Bengt Ekerot) and challenges him to a game of chess. If he wins, he will not die. The atmosphere back home is that of death and decay; it is the 14th century and the Plague is rampant.\n\nThe Seventh Seal is a meditation on the various philosophical and theological implications of death. As the story progresses, Block's deadly game unfolds, during which time he enjoys a reprieve. Death is a cunning opponent; sneaking up on Block repetitively when he least expects it.\n\nBlock is tormented with the notion of God, he wishes God to show himself, he yearns and thirsts for knowledge of God. His words when he believes to be confessing to a priest in the church reminded me of the narrative of Kirilov in Dostoyevsky's Demons, when he speaks of \"killing God within himself\", God as fear, fear of the unknown, fear, ultimately, of death. He refers to it as a \"mocking presence that won't go away\". In the end, though, he seeks God (he falls in prayer at the last hour), yet his faith is not gratuitous and without rationale; in this he is like Fyodor himself. His squire J\u00f6ns is, on the other hand, a cynic, and refuses to believe the folklore, as he tells the church-painter Albertus Pictor (Gunnar Olsson).\n\nWe are also introduced to a family reminiscent of the Holy Family: Jof/Joseph (Nils Poppe), his wife Mia/Maria (Bibi Andersson) and their young child Mikael. They are an acting troupe, and are also the only characters in the film that, despite the reigning atmosphere of terror and chaos, remain joyful, calm and kind. The innocence of their child cries similarities with Jesus Christ, \"for such is the kingdom of Heaven\". Jof has visions of the Holy. Through his eyes we see the Virgin Mary teaching the baby Jesus to walk, and the Danse Macabre.\n\nAn aspect that makes The Seventh Seal work is the fact there is a tangible and believable story, told in the most simple terms - even if every ounce is charged with the most weighty moral questions and ponderings about life and death - with much comedic relief thrown in, and a deluxe set of actors. Not a single performance in the movie is mediocre. There is also exemplar use of lush scenarios and scapes, which intermixed with Nordic chants with low basses create scenes more chilling than any modern CGI-oriented atmosphere with all the high-tech.\n\nThere are memorable scenes in this movie, such as the squirrel eating at a tree-trunk recently cut down causing the death of one of the characters, and the parading mendicants, lashing themselves and those in front of them, carrying the Ark of the Covenant and the Cross, with raving friars in tow. Even the young girl \"witch\" (Maud Hansson) who is used as a scapegoat \"she is believed to be the cause of the Plague\", a soldier tells Block upon his questioning, is shocking in her look of confusion and innocence, as well as madness. God is not one to chastise, however, as we see in Block's movements, giving the witch something \"for the pain\", that she may not suffer. Another epic scene is that in which the troupe is enveloped in jest on the stage: Bergman is faithful to what is known of the rural acting and theatre of this time, as well as the scene in the drinking den, where Jof, innocent, is made a fool of, and the common folk are seen debating what they believe to be the impending doomsday which \"is at hand\".\n\nSome have hailed The Seventh Seal to be a movie denying God - this does not appear to be the case. The silence of God, a recurring motif, leads one to consider the role of faith \"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\" (Revelation 8:1). The film is a rumination on matters Godly and surrounding death, and it does not give any one answer to the questions it poses: without forcing any conclusion on us. What it does do is treat its viewer with respect; we are shown both sides of the argument: J\u00f6ns and Block, Jof, Death, and left to fend for ourselves in this intellectual dilemma.\n\nThe Seventh Seal is a masterpiece of modern cinema. Anyone who considers himself to know film does not until he has seen this. 10/10."

He comes in contact with Death (Bengt Ekrot) who comes to take him. But Antonius makes a deal with him. They play chess as Antonius is going on his journey, and as long as Antonius is winning he lives. Along the way Antonius and Jons comes in contact with a number of other characters. The most important of which are Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson) a married couple of stage actors who accompany Antonius and Jons as they move. The good things about this movie are plentiful. The story is excellent and the way that Ingmar Bergman tells it is also great. The other really good thing is the cinematography. This film has numerous famous stills. Even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably seen the iconic shot of Antonius and Death playing chess for the first time. It's part of movie history. I recommend this movie highly."

The Black plague is all around and the knight has compassion on a family . It's been a long time since I saw this movie but when I did I new I just witnessed something very rare in Cinema. Satan also reviles the concept of God, and in the movie the Devil shows up to say \"He doesn't exist!\" Most of us think the quest for what is in a mans soul as a afterthought but Ingmar Bergman makes the observer ask, \"Where do we go, after we die?\" Do you believe in a cold god, A Satan. If you believe in the devil then you need to think there is a God, the Judeo/Christian Bible Is the first to mention Satan thousands of years ago. So I'd like to think we are looked after by a God."

Death is imminent, and everyone knows it.\n\nThe film exposes multiple ways to approach death.

But what if there're no answers? What if even the Death, God or the Devil have no answers? What if questions are an invitation to fear, anxiety and emptiness?

The premise is interesting, as well as the setting (Europe during the Black Plague).\n\nHowever, the story and the characters are pretty dull.

The mesmorizing confessional scene is cinemagraphic genious. There are many gems, for movie makers, in this film. It is a great display of cinema art and philosophical \"de profundis\". The Seventh Seal crosses all boundaries. It is a film both endearing and frightening. I can watch it again and again, and be blown away by its magnitude."

It's Bergmans best maybe Nils Poppe could have been a little more serious but I guess that's how he acts. The grim reaper always send chills down my spine especially that scene when he's playing chess with Max Von Sydow (The Exorcist). So if you like Swedish black and white movies about the black death and the joy of life you should really.....you know the rest."

        "review_detailed_main": "My first taste of the work of Ingmar Bergman came late last year, when I first saw The Virgin Spring. My initial reaction to that film was one of bewilderment; being new to Bergman, I just wasn't sure what to make of it. The second Bergman film I saw was Persona; again I just didn't fully grasp the film and in my naivety, belittled the staggering work of art I now hail it as by saying that it needed to make sense. I know understand Bergman's work a little better, and understand that The Virgin Spring was Bergman's least personal film, and one that he accepted as a director for hire. Persona on the other hand is often credited as the director's most complex and experimental film, open to interpretation and definitely not a film for all tastes. Now I have seen my third Bergman film, the classic of art-house cinema that is The Seventh Seal.\n\nThe Seventh Seal is everything a great film should aspire to be, a joy to watch from start to finish and filled with a mixture if wonderful performances and haunting images. It was also nice to see a much more simplistic story after the mind bending Persona. Here Bergman's key concerns are not psychological mind games and disintegrating personalities, instead he looks at the themes that would in later years become synonymous with his cannon of work, religion, and death (or waiting for death, as illustrated in Cries & Whispers as well as here). The film follows knight Antonious Block (Max Von Sydow) and his companion J\u00f6ns as they return from the crusades. Death has long since walked besides Block, and now the hooded figure believes it is his time to go, Block however has other ideas and challenges Death to a game of chess, if he wins, his life will be spared. This gives us the first iconic image of the film, possibly the first major iconic image of art-house film-making, as Block sits by the sea playing chess with the apparition of Death.\n\nAs the film moves on, Block and his companion make their way to the nearest town, where a religious procession enter and warn the villagers of the plague. This is another key sequence in the film, and the way Bergman films the entrance is nothing short of genius. The cutting and camera angles (together with the naturally beautiful black and white film stock) evoke and convey the growing sense of dread that has been following our hero's from the outset. The key theme in this film seems to be not only religion, but also loss of faith. Antonious spends much of his time condemning the crusades for the pointless loss of millions, all in the name of god, and later it becomes more apparent that Block believes god to have abandoned him. This truly is a classic film, and a true work of cinematic art. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Seventh Seal is a truly unique film. Few movies have successfully taken such a direct approach to the questions of life and death. Rather than subtly hide it in some other story, Bergman creates a character who openly wonders about these questions.\n\nA knight, Antonious Block (Max von Sydow) is returning to his native Sweden from the crusades. Finding his land in the midst of plague, and thinking about what he saw in the crusades, he begins to wonder about life, death, god, and so on. He meets death, who has come to take him. He challenges death to a game of chess - if he wins, he goes free, and if death wins, he takes him.\n\nTechnically, this movie is magnificent. The lighting, the camera angles - everything is superb. It is a masterpiece simply as a period film. Everything from the sets to the costumes is top notch. The setting of the film - medieval Europe suffering from the plague - is well suited for to handle the themes portrayed in the film.\n\nMost of the film is symbolic and allegorical. It features little action, but rather contemplation and questioning. While it is not what I would describe as accessible, it is certainly more accessible and entertaining than most of its kind. Highly recommended for anybody who questions death and our existence, not for somebody who wants to see lots of blood and explosions.\n\n**** out of ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "The film \"The Seventh Seal\", directed by the fantastic Ingmar Burgmann, is a film that is a long and moody rumination on religion and what occurs, if anything, when one no longer adheres to one's religion. Set in medieval Sweden the main protagonist is Antonius Block, a knight returning from the crusades, an ostensibly religiously pursuit. But this is the return trip and fighting shall not be found. Consider the opening scene: a close up of Block with his eyes closed, seemingly asleep at the coast. This is followed by the camera panning right to his squire Jon who is equally prone but making faint stirrings. Form here the camera is pointed towards their horses, albeit, briefly, only to return to Block who now strides to the ocean. It is this blending of reality and the fantastic that occurs repeatedly throughout the film. Consider the following dialog between Block and Death himself\u2014gendered no less: Antonius Block: \"Who are you?\" Death: \"I am Death.\" Antonius Block: \"Have you come for me?\" Death: \"I have long walked by your side.\" Antonius Block: \"So I have noticed.\" Death: \"Are you ready?\" Antonius Block: \"My body is ready, but I am not. \" Never had so much been said with such succinctness. But here in lies the problem with the film: so little is left out that the audience can become lost or disinterested as this is an art film and not subject to the usual film trope of problem and conflict resolution as is often found. This combined with music whose function is to invoke tension and foreboding in the extreme. All of this for the audience means one thing: work. This is a film requiring effort to view, understand and ultimately fully appreciate."

Yes the world depiction hit its mark very well, making the audience feel like they sunk into the gloomy world. But for me that's because the whole black and white color and the recurrence of the Death character. The main plot with Blok feels like it'll make this movie a challenging watch to those who pride their faith. What made me rate it a score f 4 is the sub plots that makes this movie look simply stupid. Again maybe this is a cultural gap issue between me and 1950s Sweden, but I fail to understand how Plog's stupidity can have a good impact to the whole story. One thing to add is that I tend to agree with the opinion about the acting. Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot did a splendid job in their roles here that helped a lot in setting up the movie's mood."

        "review_detailed_main": "Seventh Seal doesn't have the strongest cinematography. It was made in black and white in the time when there was color film available. I know it was probably done on purpose but while it may help the message it does not help the visuals. The shots are not grabbing, not on their own.\n\nAlso, the sound effects are not synced well. Quality of the recording is average. The music consists more of effects than of actual melody, which again maybe works for the message but definitely not for the aesthetics.\n\nWhat this movie has going for it are interesting themes, dialogue and good actors to speak it.\n\nThe film is raw and direct. Has a feel of movies like Conan the Brabarian (1982), but with realism and intelligence replacing the action. It is about life, death, love, sex and cruelty, all set against the medieval time period. The dialogue consists chiefly out of the discussion of those subjects and has a poetic colour to it but not overly so. However, you must be prepared for a theatrical feel to the whole thing. Indeed many actors in this film are heavy theater performers.\n\nWhat is really good about Seventh Seal is that it is one of the, unfortunately, rare occasions when art is not pretentious or arrogant. You do not have to wonder hard about the spooky imagery. It does not try to patronize you with its poetry. It is perhaps clich\u00e9 to even mention the scene that is most remembered about this film, that of the protagonist playing chess with death, but it is a good example. What is a more straight forward metaphor than that? This whole film is that way - straightforward.\n\nThe downside of the story is that it does not have a lot happening in it. The storyline is mostly about the characters traveling through the countryside and meeting other people. There isn't one centralized structure to the story. But this does not stop the movie from being interesting.\n\nMax von Sydow is the main protagonist. To start with, this guy has an interesting face. He looks like a medieval knight, in fact almost like a caricature of one, with his underbite and long crudely carved face and short haircut. And he is a good actor on top that.\n\nBibi Andersson who plays one of the side characters is possibly the prettiest woman I have seen in a very long time. She is conventionally pretty, but that is OK. And the film puts her in such poses and in such dresses and her blond hair shines in such light\u0085.in short, I experienced a brief crush on an 80 year old actress.\n\nBut Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, whose name I had to copy from IMDb for fear of getting an aneurysm trying to type it, is the true protagonist as he gets the most lines and gives them his best. Max von Sydow is more of an observer, while Gunnar is the workhorse.\n\nSeventh Seal manages to be funny and grim, smart and blunt. It is totally worth the watch, especially if you are afraid of watching it because you got the impression of it being an overly artsy film. It isn't."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ingmar Bergman gave us an incredible film here. A knight goes wit to wit against death in a game of chess to buy himself more life. The movie takes a very philosophic bend, and takes us through the thoughts that every human has thought since nigh on the beginning of mankind. Is there a God? Why can I not perceive him with any of my senses? Yet, why can I not rid myself of the thought of God? No point in this film can be looked at with a glance; every scene is a deep well of meaning, and every character meant to show us a different way humanity deals with the inevitability of death. There isn't a moment to miss.\n\nSet in medieval Europe, we are confronted with a world obsessed with the end. Religion is at its peak of making noise; the plague travels the land and leaves nothing but death, boils, and terror. Amid this horror, a knight returns from the crusades convinced that the ten years he spent there at war were worthless, and left with no faith in God. Death comes knocking, but the knight cleverly challenges him to the ultimate game of wits, chess, since he had heard in ballads in tales that Death plays. During a reprieve in the game, Death gives the knight a chance to do one last deed on earth to search for meaning.\n\nI feel a bit bad giving out perfect scores, but what really lies at fault here is that I decided to see an amazing movie. There's nothing else to do with Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece than to give it a perfect score. The lack of technology cannot take any points away from it, and the story is both gripping, entertaining, and more meaningful than I care to talk about at any more length. This is a movie you must see, take an hour and a half to sit and consider your own life, because as Socrates said, the unexamined life is not worth living, and this movie forces you to consider your life and how you handle its end. Even the simple painter in the film knew this was important, and you would be completely remiss in not seeing this complete 10/10 classic.\n\nThis was a snippet from my full review.

An hour and a half later when the credits rolled I had the sensation that I had just watched something truly special. I was captivated by the beautifully constructed, hauntingly quiet scenes and the understated sense of foreboding that lingered throughout. I am pleased I had never before heard of the scenes of the knight playing chess with Death as for me they took me by surprise and were a delight.

The craftsmanship of this movie is superb, there are images that you won't see in current cinema, and they are really good."

The movie makes fun of the humanity, religion etc. There are not of things to be thought in depth. Thought provoking films are hard to write about. You need to watch them over and over again, think about it and get the inner meanings and find a conclusion yourself.\n\nA highly recommend for serious film lovers. A Must watch.\n\n#KiduMovie"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is supposed to be rated as one of the best films of all time, uhh. Not for me. I recorded this recently and read a good few reviews before watching, what a load of sycohphants !! Twaddling about artistry, existentialism and the such. To me it was like a dark Swedish Don Quixote.\n\nDon't get me wrong, its a good film, the acting is excellent, particularly Gunnar Bjornstrand , Max von Sydow was a bit out of place but still good, although he should have had a bit more screen time with more dialogue, he is a very magnetic actor, I think they could have taken the Chess game between himself and Death a bit further, made more of the escape of Jof and his family, and possibly had a stalemate so that his Knight could get a stay of sentence either for him or others. The photography is excellent, I hope they convert it to colour, I'm not keen on B&W, but nevertheless I still rate it.\n\nHowever the ending is a bit of a let down, I know what it is supposed to represent but it was a little unbelievable, why would they all be taken by Death at the same time, just because they all came into contact with someone who was supposed to be already dead ? or was the inclination The Plague? no, it would not seem probable, if the Knight were to die, and possibly his squire, the surely the others should have been left to live, there was no reason why all should die, only that the Knight/Squire should die in the first place, i.e. the opening sequence, for the rest it does not make sense in any way you look at it.\n\nOk everyone dies sooner or later but not all at the same time. The story of the Knight looking for answers, trying to understand why he should die should have been taken much further, and with a different ending, the Knight gaining a stay of execution for the others by doing better at the chess and gaining some answers before being taken, with his Squire settling down with the woman he had earlier saved, the blacksmith and his wife sorting things out, the Knights wife getting to spend some time with him before he perished after not seeing him for several years and a son appearing just before he was taken. I know not everything has a happy ending, and I know that is part of the idea, but even a little bit of hope would be better than none, after all that is what life (and death) is all about, i.e, we die with the knowledge that our children continue and pass on our genes.\n\nFor me the best thing about this film was the Swedish medieval period it was supposed to represent, very interesting and well done."

        "review_title": "A universal tale of faith and fate, of men hopelessly cheating Death, while insolently cheated by God...",
        "review_detailed_main": "A knight named Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) returns from the Crusades, only to find his country ravaged by the Plague. He meets a strange, black robed figure (Bengt Ekerot) leaving no mystery about his identity, he's Death. Yet Antonius gets himself a suspended sentence by challenging Death to a chess game. Then comes the most iconic moment of \"The Seventh Seal\": the blonde Nordic knight and Death, face-to- face, a chessboard in the middle, and for us, viewers, readings as infinite as the ocean in the background.\n\nIngmar Bergman doesn't just gratify us with one allegory through his personal take on the Grim Reaper, we also have the chess game symbolizing the eternal cat-and- mouse-like battle between men and death. After ten years of exile, fighting the Barbarians, Antonius must have cheated Death many times, but did that gave him all the answers to the meaning of life for all that? Did he perceived gratitude from the very God, in the name of which he expressed his bravura? With too many questions in mind, it is too soon to conclude his journey, a situation calling for a last attempt to cheat Death.\n\nThe irony of Antonius' condition is that Death plays fairer than God on many levels, if only for its presence. We know Death, and God knew how to inculcate the fear and the knowledge of Death in medieval ages where you could either die by a sword, or a disease devouring your entrails. The context mirrors the pessimism that overflowed Europe after the Holocaust, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War. Being the son of a Lutherian priest enhanced Bergman's quest for answers transcending the rigor of burdensome certitudes, much more at a time that didn't leave much for optimism regarding the fate of humanity\u0085 or should we say, faith?\n\nIndeed, how can be Death so ubiquitous, when the only 'being' that can help you to accept it is absent or expressionless. The absence of God, a recurrent theme in Bergman's movies is the source of Antonius' torment, one that echoes a similar character Von Sydow played in \"Winter Light\". Reviewing the film, I concluded that the existence of God was a part of human civilization, but his absence part of human condition. From Bergman's standpoint, this is illustrated by the way each character's behavior and personality derive from a personal relationship (or lack of) with God. \"The Seventh Seal\" is also a character study, evoking many interpretations of the value of Death and life.\n\nAnd as the cynical relief of Antonius's interrogations, there's his disillusioned squire, Jons, played by Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand. Jons is a more disillusioned and careless character, the sight of a corpse inspires no prayer or religious questioning, only macabre humor and what is left of his faith is shaken when he finds a painter drawing scary portraits in a church and Raval (Bertil Anderberg) the very theologian who sent him to the Crusade, stealing a dead's bracelet and about to rape a villager (Gunnel Lindblom). The priest-turned-thief, dies later of the plague, probably infected by the bracelet he stole. Incarnating corrupted religion, as he got a taste of his own medicine, ironically proving that God (or Death) wasn't that senseless.\n\nThe film features more sympathetic characters: Jof (Nils Poppe) actor and juggler is married with the beautiful Mia (Bibi Andersson) and together they have a little boy. The family provides a much needed escapism from an upsetting reality, and for the first time, makes Antonius smile and forget about his torment. Enjoying the sunshine, the sight of Mia and her boy, he savors some wild strawberries and a bowl of fresh milk. He'll remember that moment, he says, and at this time, it is impossible not to make a connection with a similarly existential Bergman's film of the same year \"Wild Strawberries\", illustrating the cathartic value of good memories. The two films, elevated Bergman's standing as a major international director and were also meant as personal catharsis, curing from self-questioning\u0085 at least, temporarily.\n\nIndeed, even a joyful actors' show is interrupted by a cortege of people whipping themselves, carrying a cross and planning to burn a witch, as purification from God's anger. And Antonius' quest for truth is so desperate that he even tries to find the Devil in the witch so he can question him, but he only finds terror and emptiness in her eyes. That's the most provocative and thrilling irony of the film, for all the supernatural presence of Death, of Jon's visions of Mary and baby Jesus, for our total suspension of disbelief, God remains Silent. The closest to his representation is the very title of the film, an extract from the Revelation, evoking the silence of God after the lamb opened the seventh seal.\n\nAnd that Seventh Seal is the start of what would become the backbone of a colossal oeuvre, a photogenic brainstorm about the meaning of existence. Some would call it 'pretentious'? Actually, Bergman has no pretension to bring any satisfying answer, except that we should enjoy the suspended sentence given by life. Not everyone who encounters Death in the film deserves it, not everyone reacts stoically, some protest, some are scared, others embrace it with an illuminated smile. But even within its haunting climax, Bergman doesn't forget to keep a cinematic effect, and manage to cheat death in order to provide a sort of 'happy ending'.\n\nBecause \"The Seventh Seal' is also a cinematic journey, whose first and penultimate shots, (parodied countless times, becoming in fact a trope of art films) translated into cinematic language the moral turmoil of centuries, still relevant today in a world of doubts and uncertainty. Actually, the film might be still relevant in a future as distant to our present as Middle Ages is now, if there's still humanity at that time, this is how timeless and universal \"The Seventh Seal\" is. And how essential it is, because it asks essential questions."

Practically everybody I meet who is anxious about conveying an image of themselves as culturally minded, praise this movie, but gives few reasons why. The fact is, this movie is much too long, and could have been a much better product had it been condensed to around 3 minutes. It could then contain the shots the self-proclaimed \"cultural elite\" talk so much about: The beach in the beginning; the introduction of Mr Death; the game of chess between Block and him.\n\nOne could make it even more appealing by converting it into a music video. One would have people in traditional Swedish clothes playing folk music at the summer solstice celebration(midsommar in Swedish), while Mr Death chases Block around the midsommarst\u00e5ng, in the end catching up with him.\n\nThe great problem with this movie, is that there is hardly anything interesting in it. There's only a number of long, meaningless dialogues without any real connecting story. My version would at least not cause you to fall asleep.\n\nEven though I'm an educated person, having read among other classical works the Bible, John Milton's \"Paradise lost\" and \"Paradise regained\", I only find this movie pseudo-cultural boredom.

        "review_detailed_main": "Few images in film surpass that of the knight Antonius Block playing chess with Death by the sea at the beginning of Ingmar Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal'. Also fantastic are the scenes of him asking for knowledge of God in a confessional, and the danse macabre on the hillside at the end. This film established Bergman on the international film scene, and while it may not be perfect, it will always be one of my favorites.\n\nA knight (Max von Sydow) and his squire (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) have returned from the Crusades to find Sweden ravaged by the plague. Under the torpor and ignorance of religion, the people flagellate themselves and blame and burn a witch. Death is all around, even in the form of a mask used by a troupe of circus performers, which include an innocent young married couple (Nils Poppe and Bibi Andersson) and their small child.\n\nIt's the Dark Ages but the things we find are timeless: cruelty, hypocrisy, lust, and yet also the simplicity of love and the quest for God, however ridiculous His absence may seem. We see the knight faithful to the end, trying to give his life meaning by saving others, and his squire cynical of it all. \"I could have purged your worries about eternity,\" the squire says, \"but now it's too late. But feel, to the very end, the triumph of being alive!\" Death is a certainty and he makes his presence felt, but where is God? Death himself has no answers to this, and wisely, neither does Bergman. Life simply goes on without us, and we must hold fast to sweet memories while they last. Magnificent.\n\nA couple of passages\u0085 This is the exchange at the confessional: Block: I want to confess as best I can\u0085but my heart is void. The void is a mirror. I see my face\u0085and feel loathing and horror. My indifference to men has shut me out. I live now in a world of ghosts\u0085a prisoner in my dreams. Death: Yet you do not want to die. Block: Yes, I do. Death: What are you waiting for? Block: Knowledge. Death: You want a guarantee. Block: Call it what you will. Is it so hard to conceive God with one's senses? Why must He hide in a midst of vague promises\u0085and invisible miracles? How are we to believe the believers when we don't believe ourselves? What will become of us who want to believe, but cannot? And what of those who neither will nor can believe? Why can I not kill God within me? Why does He go on living in a painful,humiliating way? I want to tear Him out of my heart\u0085but He remains a mocking reality\u0085which I cannot get rid of. Do you hear me? Death: I hear you. Block: I want knowledge. Not belief. Not surmise. But knowledge. I want God to put out His hand\u0085show His face, speak to me. But He is silent. I cry to Him in the dark, but there seems to be no one there. Perhaps there is no one there. There life is a senseless terror. No man can live with Death and know that everything is nothing. Death: Most people think neither of Death nor nothingness. Block: Until they stand on the edge of life and see the Darkness. Death: Ah, that day. Block: I see. We must make an idol of our fear\u0085and call it God.\n\nAnd this while eating strawberries with milk, the sweetest scene in the movie, with Block remembering his youth and pledging to remember this moment with his new friends:\n\n\"We were newly-married. We played and laughed. I wrote songs to her eyes. We hunted, we danced, the house was full of life. \u0085 To believe is to suffer. It is like loving someone in the dark\u0085who never answers. How unreal that is in your company. It means nothing to me now. \u0085 I shall remember this hour of peace\u0085the strawberries, the bowl of milk\u0085your faces in the dusk. Michael asleep, Joseph with his lute. I shall remember our words\u0085and shall bear this memory between my hands\u0085as carefully as a bowl of fresh milk.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "The Seventh seal is a wonderful movie. A knight's returns home after years. But the most important aspect of his life seems to remain unanswered. He searched for truth and hasn't found it yet and it's getting clear through the film it's not going to happen. The question of the existence of god and the relations of human to him is one the most important issues in history. I think this film should be considered as pictorial manifest of the existentialism. Are we alone in the world or not? Is there any hope to feel the God through our life in any way? This film could happen in our age too, because it has the same questions yet we haven't found. Interestingly, no one will forget the face of death in this movie which was played by Bengt Ekerot. The death only carries out his duties but no one knows is there any one to order him to do that? The knight never find out if god is out there or not even when he asked death about it. The death is not able or allowed to answers to the knight whether anything really exists beyond life or not. If there is emptiness or something else beyond it? What happens then? He remains mysterious and silent about these questions all over the film. I think Ingmar Bergman let us free to judge about these matters and there is no clear answer to them. We are all that knight too who seeking for the truth.\n\nIt is one of the most interesting movies which I ever saw. Ingmar Bergman has many great ideas to talk about. If some one likes to see a movie which could help him to think more about himself and the world around him, I suggest this film.\n\nAlso the power of humanity is evident in this film. At the end of the film we see that small family comprised of three who escaped the death and saw the others leaded by the death to the end of their destiny. They are plain and good people which don't have complicated ideas about life. They only want a simple life to live. It's clear they are some how similar to the father, Christ and the holy Mother and this could be one of the reasons why they didn't go with dead. Life goes on"

These people may be a little dim, but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in Antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time.\n\nBut the main aspect of Ingmar Bergman's arguably best film are Antonius Blok's grim encounters, as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake, as a scapegoat for the plague. And the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of Jof and Mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed; hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about God, religion and mankind as The Seventh Seal."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just as Ingmar Bergman, the director and screenwriter of this film, began in his foreword to the screenplay, so shall I begin.\n\n'The Seventh Seal is an allegory with a very simple theme: man, his eternal search for God and death as the only certainty.'\n\nWe start with the returned crusader Antonius Block and his squire J\u00f6ns on a rough, rocky beach. Figuratively speaking, they are stranded, lost and visibly abandoned by their faith. Visually, this is emphasised magnificently by the composition. The knight's inner emptiness is also immediately recognisable.\n\nDeath, cloaked in black, suddenly appears to take the crusader Block to him. But he is able to persuade Death to play a game of chess with him, in which his life is at stake.\n\nFrom now on, we accompany Block and his squire J\u00f6ns on their journey. They encounter different characters on their journey,who seem almost like chess pieces, who play certain roles in the game of life but cannot escape this game and therfore cannot escape death.\n\nWhilst Block claims that he can no longer believe, he is unable to give it up. His inner journey continues to revolve around the search for God, for meaning, for certainty. His squire J\u00f6ns, who probably comes across to most people as a modern man, is different. You could describe him as a realist. He no longer struggles with his faith, but relies on his reason and sees the world as it is. Not the way he would like it to be. At first glance, he seems like a hard man, but he is nevertheless full of compassion for his fellow human beings.\n\nBoth represent opposites. Faith vs. Reason. But also thinking vs. Being.\n\nSo, does this film deliver what it promises? Yes. The aim was to portray the search for faith and thus also the meaning of life. We see inner struggles, serenity but also lightness and an alternative to the eternal search for meaning. Because those who do not seek do not have to find.\n\nAll of this is embedded in a wonderful film aesthetic and with believable and entertaining characters. The pacing is a little slow at times, which underlines the atmosphere of the film but could occasionally be boring for some viewers.\n\nHowever, the core theme of this film is still modern and therefore worth seeing!"

But with film, Ingmar Bergman tries to deal with existential angst of the human populace.\n\nThroughout the movie, it seems as if the main protagonist, Block, is coming to terms with death and how meaningless life is in a world without god. Later, he finds meaning in a simple bowl of strawberries. Even though the character deals with existential angst, Block envies the life of Jof and Mia, who live relatively happy life. Does this movie argue for 'Ignorance is Bliss' attitude is one of the questions I am not sure about. As Mia and Jof seem to be relatively happy without having to deal with angst.\n\nSquire Jons is probably a reflection of a man, who has realized there is no meaning to life and instead of creating his own meaning, and dives to hedonism.\n\nThis is what I could grasp from the overall movie, I would love to hear other interpretations as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "My first Bergman film. I'll need to read up on this more, because it's one deep film. I honestly don't think I fully understood it. My initial thoughts were that it was a great film with great cinematography and very well executed it's themes of death and questioning of faith/religion and its meaning, and that's probably exactly what it is. However, I feel like it's more than that. Some of the symbolism that was distinguished throughout this film probably flew over my head, however I am aware that it was there. On a technical level, this is a masterpiece, just like many of the other foreign black and white films I've watched recently. But, once again, this was just not my kind of movie. A tad boring and too artsy, you have to constantly be hooked to something that may not interest you all that much. I COMPLETELY understand everyone's love for it and the high ratings, but art films like this one are just not NECESSARILY my cup of tea. I emphasize necessarily because there are certain art films similar to this that I really like. But some are slightly more tedious than others. However, this is a must watch for film watchers. I definitely do recommend this one to anyone who has a taste for that sort of thing that i mentioned above^, you will absolutely love this one. But for a casual who just wants to watch an entertaining yet artistically enthralling film, there are many better choices than this one, but I still urge that you watch this some time in your life."

        "review_detailed_main": "This one it's certainly going to my list of favorites. The Seventh Seal manages to mirror a moment of society we're desperation leads people to act in extremes for fear of death. In a parallel way we see a group of people that share the same world, exposed to the same risks but instead of giving themselves to death even before being caught, they continue to live their life and worship it. The main character specially prefers to understand it instead of letting himself be scared by it. The entire story, the characters and the scenario make this movie brilliant and a gift for those who love cinema. The fact that it's in black and white gives it a certain mystery that nowadays movies sometimes lose. This movie is a perfect example that aren't big scenes, big visual effects or famous actors that make a good movie. I most certainly advise it but for those who aren't accustomed to see this kind of movie, keep your mind opened to different ways of presenting a story and ending it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Seventh Seal\" is a historical fantasy. A knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) and his squire, J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) return after 10 years from the Crusades in the Holy Land during a time the Plague was raging through Sweden. The title, beginning and the ending in the play are all based on the text about the seventh seal in the Book of Revelation.\n\nThe film follows the knight's travel back to his castle and the people he meets along the way. Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes to claim Antonius early in the film, but Antonius gets Death to delay taking him by challenging him to a chess game. The idea of playing chess with death came from a painting in the 1480s by Albertus Pictor that Bergman chanced to see.\n\nIn any event, Antonius wants to come to some resolution about his doubts before he dies. There are many references to death and the meaning of life with the many interesting characters and subplots, including a drama troupe, a woman accused of being a witch, a mute woman, a former minister who become a thief, a doomsday preacher, etc.\n\nAs always with Bergman the film is beautifully crafted. The story is easily followed. What it all means is beyond me, save for facing doubt and death.\n\nOne observation by a commentator that I read before watching \"Seventh Seal\" that stuck with me was that \"Death\" looked an awful lot like the U. S. President of the day, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Consequently I kept seeing Eisenhower every time Death came on the screen. My favorite character was J\u00f6ns the squire, who was the most literate character as well as being a cynical observer of much that went on.\n\nThis is not the kind of film I normally gravitate towards, but it was easy to see why it became an early favorite of \"art house\" aficionados."

        "review_detailed_main": "Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. Ingmar Bergman profits immensely from medieval iconography, traditions, events and beliefs to draft a wonderful example of existential cinema. It's a pity that Death as a character is so underused nowadays; there's so much strength in the image of the Grim Reaper talking with its victims, trying to decipher the meaning of all of this.\n\nThe Black Plague provides an excellent scenario for the exposition of the very contemporary questions about the existence of God, the meaning of life, the fear of death. This seemingly apocalyptic event must have really seemed like the End of times, and the horrific images of infected people whipping themselves, of supposedly witches being burnt as scapegoats, do an amazing job in telling without the meaninglessness of life, the darkness that wraps us all once we know we'll eventually die. Unless we have faith, of course. But, as Antonius Block says: \"Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.\"\n\nThis movie is full of memorable quotes. It's one of those movies where the dialogues have no interest in seeming realistic, but rather, like in a theatre play, aim to show the language skills of the scriptwriter. I shall keep many of this movie's lines with myself, \"I shall try to remember them. I shall carry this memory carefully in my hands as if it were a bowl brimful of fresh milk. It will be a sign to me, and a great sufficiency.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "When I read the plot of The Seventh Seal years years before, I sured that when I get a chance to watch it, I would be definitely impressed. The idea of playing chess with death is very inventive, brilliant, but if you put it in a good story. Ingmar Bergman was the best director to do that in the best way, but this time, impossible to accept, he could not turn the idea to good account. The movie's content is not about playing chess with death, this is very important. This is just a sub story. Yes, the film is not about the fellowship of two chess players anyway, but when I read the man who plays chess with death, I supposed that the story would be like: one day, a crusader encounters death. Death requires a chess game, if the man wins, he is set free, if the death does, the man dies. The chess game continues for months and till the game ends, his questions about life, death and God are answered. In the end, the man loses. The whole movie focuses on this deadly chess game with certain intervals. In these intervals, you also can show us the villagers who are suffered from plague. It might sound weird, but this had been my expectation. After the first thirty minutes, the story is scattered, collapsed, then we loose our attention, because the movie changes its route. As a result of this, the potential of the story gets out of hand. We are forced to forget the crusader, the crusader's situation. Bergman is not interested in this character enough and also the chess game that seems the heart of the movie, but it is not and it should have been. The chess game cannot be named as a metaphor, because, this is not the point, thus the image which the man who plays chess with death exists as just an image. The crowd make a celebration, they start to sing a song, there is a husband and wife, I mean we see pictures desultory from each other. Those pictures are like theater, but in contrast, not dramatic, not impressive at all. This is the story of 'black death' more, not death. As for direction, only one sentence can summarize the film: the way of storytelling is not powerful. By the way, the crusader encounters the death and the death says I am death, look at the reaction of him; nothing. He is like OK, what's that to me? Sorry, but the name of this is not art. It is stressed that he is a nihilist? However, it looks unconvincing at the end. This is not so important, but this scene deserves to be dramatic. I watched The Virgin Spring and Smultronstallet after The Seventh Seal in order to rehabilitate and I did. Lastly, almost everyone writes the same thing: the film questionnaires the meaning of life, death, faith and the existence of God. Some films have a repetitious sentence and The Seventh Seal's sentence is this. Another commonly used word for the film is symbolism. I cannot give a movie 10 out of 10 owing to only its symbols and themes."

        "review_title": "The Seventh Art",
        "review_detailed_main": "Quintessential European art film reminding us that we're all going to die while God is silent though it is, \"The Seventh Seal\" is typical of Ingmar Bergman's oeuvre in being visually striking, and it might just feature the most dramatic narrative construction from his career--and one of the most impressive in film history. There's an entire chess board of pieces and game of moves going on in the plotting. It's sublime how all the subplots and themes efficiently come together in the taut journey and every part entangled and multi-layered: the repetition of the titular sevens quotation from the Book of Revelations and even complemented by an emphasis on dissolves at the beginning and near the end; the multitude of Deathly imagery from Death himself and his guises to painted image, mask and skull; cuckoldry and dance on and off stage; the proscenium arch of the stage and shore, the frame of the fresco and prisoner stocks; and the seven plots of the knight and his squire, the troupe of performers, the thief and the mute housekeeper, the cuckold blacksmith and his wife, the procession of flagellants, the witch burning, and the chess game with Death. Largely, all the seven arts are here, too: actors playing actors, song and dance, the danse macabre of the church fresco, as well as all the rest of the architecture and Christian iconography and the Good Book--until it all goes up in the flames of a sight analogy in search of the seventh art that is motion pictures.\n\nThis is such an all-time-great masterpiece that I don't care to harp on my reason for revisiting it as part of my seeking out a bunch of pandemic-related movies during a real-world plague; that's only part of the religious musings that comprise the trappings of the tale, which is secondary to how that story is told. I also don't wish to get overly into one of my favorite metaphors of film as death, although it is, of life stilled in a series of images reanimated in a projected afterlife on screen. That, even before film, as I mentioned in my review of the Lumi\u00e8re \"Dancing Skeleton\" (1897/98), persisted in screen projections of danse macabre in Christiaan Huygens's magic lantern, the dancing skeleton slide of Beale's Choeutoscope and in the ghastly imagery of Robertson's Phantasmagoria.\n\nBecause this is Shakespearean, or the Swedish equivalent in narrative complexity of classical 1940s and 1950s cinema of \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) or \"Rashomon\" (1950). Much imitated but never surpassed. Stylistically, there's even the ambiguity of the obscured sunlight here from one and the extreme foregrounding of figures for pan-focused shots from the other. Gunnar Fischer's cinematography is uniformly excellent, aptly and hauntingly in black and white, although the dolly movements on Death and the striking scenery, such as the rocky beach, have become iconic for good reason. The death dance silhouette also gets considerable attention, but I think the most telling moment is of the return gaze upon the cinematographic apparatus that is Death.\n\nTwo arguments to note here in favor of this film as obliquely about itself as the seventh art involve this final meeting with Death before the dance and that the character with visions and who thus does not need confront the cinematic gaze is an artist, the actor and juggler husband from the traveling troupe of performers. Unlike the knight and at least different from the witch, he sees and is faithful and acts upon those visions--something of the on-screen surrogate filmmaker. We, the spectator, however, mostly identify with the character of Max von Sydow's knight, who as the main protagonist is strongly associated with the camera's gaze. Thus, note that when the camera is finally most strongly associated through Death with our gaze upon the screen that the only character who refuses to return that gaze, to look into the mirror, is Antonius Block. To do so would truly be annihilation--the disassociation of identification with the spectator and an acknowledgement of being a mere flickering shadow on a screen. This is the search for seeing God, the face of death."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Realists\" may not be the right word, but \"cynics\" doesn't fit either. I'm talking about people who are confused, frustrated, or just plain hopeless about the state of existence. Atheists, agnostics and even religious folks who are questioning their faith, yet who cannot be appeased by a Disney flick or a movie that ends with a hot air balloon as a philosophical salve, this movie is for you.\n\nPlot summary: Some time around 1350, during the Crusades, a weary and disillusioned knight returns to his home country after 10 years only to find it ravaged by the Black Plague and worse: the madness of men. In the opening scene Death comes for him, but our tricky knight goads Death into a game of chess for his soul. As they play the game over the course of several days, the knight uses this brief time to try to find out if god really exists--something which he believes can be done by accomplishing 1 meaningful act in an otherwise meaningless existence.\n\nHeavy stuff, right? It's like Camus' \"The Stranger\" and JD Salinger's \"Catcher in the Rye\" and Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" all wrapped into one--in other words it's a careful balance of existentialism, altruism, insanity and religion rolled into one beautiful allegory. For that alone it's an absolute classic. But here's the part that's often overlooked: there's a lot of humor in this flick.\n\nIn that respect, \"The Seventh Seal\" is not just a heavy, brooding, beard-stroking art film, but it has almost a playful, comedic Shakespearian vibe through it that keeps you entertained rather than reaching for the sharp metal objects. This wonderful humor is achieved through the use of colorful characters whom the knight encounters and travels with on his surreal anti-pilgrimmage. And if you're paying attention, you'll realize that each character represents a different philosophy with regard to gods, life and death.\n\nThe knight's squire, J\u00f6ns, is completely faithless, jaded and cynical but with a good-natured spin, kinda like that favorite uncle of yours who isn't allowed to drink at family gatherings. They cross paths with a cheerful juggler, Jof, and his equally happy young wife, Mia, and their newborn child, and this trio represents raw optimism and faith--not necessarily in any god but in the idea that life is worth living. Then there is a very cryptic but ultimately pivotal character, a young silent girl (nameless) who doesn't say a word but whose facial expressions convey compassion, yearning and sadness. Then there's the blacksmith Plog, a stumbling, boisterous, drunken simpleton who can't seem to think beyond the moment. There is a terrified girl who is accused of being a witch and set to be burned at the stake, and she comes to represent an interesting delusional philosophy: brainwashed by the priests into thinking that she herself is evil but that Satan will protect her--and yet her \"faith\" is as effervescent as our hero the knight's faith in God.\n\nI could go on, but maybe you get the picture. \"The Seventh Seal\" is a fascinating portrayal of each facet of humanity when dealing with the horror of the unknown. The presentation is very heavy but with a lot of humanity, emotion and often humor to keep us entertained as we peel away the layers of belief (and non-belief).\n\nI'll skip the wordy analysis of cinematography and artistic presentation, and instead I'll just say: IT LOOKS MAGNIFICENT.\n\nAs far as acting goes, this film has some of the most gripping performances I've ever seen on celluloid. There aren't really any dramatic, thunderous monologues \u00e0 la George C. Scott in \"Patton\" or F. Murray Abraham in \"Amadeus\", but here the acting is captured by the camera lingering on the actors' faces. In particular, pay attention to the eyes. In one subtle yet overpowering scene, the knight asks Death what he knows about god. And Death replies \"I know nothing\" ...but pay close attention to the look in Death's eyes after he says this. It's the only time Death shows any hint of emotion, and I think director Bergman saved it all for that one fleeting look. Similarly, the young silent girl, the pivotal one I mentioned earlier, it's the look in her eyes at the end that gives this film its moneyshot. Bergman generously lets us absorb her eyes without any distractions, until there is no doubt as to what she feels and it's the perhaps the underlying message of this whole film.\n\nIn the nearly 1000 reviews I've posted on imdb (yeah I really need to do something else with my life), I've only given a perfect 10 to a handful of films. Without hesitation, I give 10 stars to \"The Seventh Seal\"."

Very strong and clean, don't know how else to describe them. They create very powerful images."

Ubiquitous, cunning, clever Death.\n\nMy only problem with the film was that the promised thought-provoking religious and philosophical viewpoints were replaced with meaningless comedy scenes.

A story which doesn't advance much but merely serves as a medieval backdrop for the protagonist's spiritual journey - in this film Bergman asks if God exists.\n\nThe film is supposed to take place in 14th century Sweden during bubonic plague (aka The Black Death), which fits the theme perfectly. However the costumes and props are rather low quality which doesn't make the film credible outside of its metaphysical introspection. Camera work is mediocre at best; the scenes consist mostly on static one camera shots focused on narrow view. The lack of production values is quite apparent while it was shot in one month, mostly inside a studio and with a budget of 150k dollars. In other words you can't make great panorama takes if there are only two medieval mock up shacks inside the studio...\n\nThe story is somewhat entertaining, not as boring as I expected from essential art cinema. The dialogue is often intellectually interesting and some images are very artistic, mainly on the scenes where the protagonist struggles with theological issues. So those are strong points of the film: dialogue and occasionally impressive, haunting, images.\n\nOn the meaning of grim reaper and chess, the talking point of the film... I wasn't quite convinced with grim reaper following Sydow's knight in first place - he seemed in perfect health to me, as did other characters. Yes, the knight had cheated death when returning alive from crusades but still. Perhaps the point was people seeking answer whether God exists from death while the grim reaper doesn't have the answer either. If this was the meaning then that would make it an atheistic film, or agnostic the very least. 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I just laugh out loud when I read national critics gushing over Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman and his films, particularly this one which they love to label \"his greatest work.\" Do you know why? It's because Bergman liked to show God and Bible believers in a negative light. Since almost all critics are Liberals, they love this kind of thought so, like Martin Scorcese, he can do no wrong. It's as simple as that.\n\nBasically, this story is nothing but one man's diatribe against faith, and why the man lost it. He lost it - get this - because God didn't audibly answer his prayers. Since he didn't hear a booming voice from a burning bush answering his prayers then, he surmises, there must be no God.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nAnyway, all of this sounds good to atheist/agnostic film critics. However, I believe Bergman might have been more of a believer than he let on because God was a topic in a number of his films. At least, he was wrestling about His existence, and that's not unusual. Too bad that in none of his films does he come up with a pro-God answer.\n\nEven if all the \"religious\" talks means nothing to you, I think most people would find this film way too boring so the entertainment value is not going to be there. For honest questioners of Faith and those who would find the visuals and direction intriguing, I have no problem with it. I just think it's overrated because of the reasons I stated above, and the fact it IS a boring movie with unappealing characters."

For the record, I have never been religious, but this film has such an ambiguity to it that people of faith can definitely find it meaningful too. I found it to reaffirm how I feel, especially after the ridicule I've faced over the years for it because of where I'm from. I've also struggled with my own mental health issues for a long time, so the internal struggle to find any answers hit me hard. Ingmar Bergman was a master of ambiguity. This movie could also be looked at as a test of faith for someone who is religious. It's a heavy movie, but I highly recommend it for anyone struggling with life, death, faith, or just the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was my introduction to Bergman and I have to say that this and The Virgin Spring convinced me of the director's great talent.\n\nThe Seventh Seal follows Antonius Block and his cynical squire J\u00f6ns as they return home to a medieval Sweden dealing with an outbreak of the plague. Prior to their journey, we see Antonius on a rocky beach where he is approached by Death personified who tells him that it is his time. Antonius responds by challenging Death to a chess match to which he accepts. Wrestling with doubt about the existence of god and his own nihilism, Antonius seeks to delay Death long enough to perform \"one meaningful deed\" prior to his death.\n\nThis is a taut, intelligent drama which covers differing perspectives about the meaning of life and the existence of god. Each person we meet during Antonius and J\u00f6n's journey gives us another perspective on these big questions while still leaving it up to us to decide what is right for each of us. The story is executed very well and the cinematography is excellent. Even though this film was shot during the era of color, black and white is the right format for this type of subject. I highly recommended!"

Off course this is not for the mainstream American cinema lovers. But it is worth a watch. Not all scenes are interesting. But the verbal battle between a young Von Sydow (always good) and Death are a great watch and the Swedish language adds to the flavor. A shame there is no more of it in the film. Looking to try something different and willing to give maestro Bergman a chance? This is an ideal starting point."

        "review_title": "Rife with ambiguity and symbolism, The Seventh Seal is a detached intellectual experience",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Seventh Seal is a movie that seems to be all about symbolism and ambiguous existential musings. It's set in 12th century Europe, as patriarchal Catholic society is the norm and the plague is ravaging the land. Our primary plot line is our protagonist, The Knight, struggling with his faith and plays a chess game with Death to determine whether he can extend his life. He is presented in stark contrast to Jof and Mia, a married couple with a kid who are far less concerned with faith and existentialism than The Knight is. The discussions between The Knight and Death were my favorite scenes in the movie, as we understand The Knight's point of view better and, like the rest of the film, the conversation has deeper meanings. The Knight is frustrated by the silence and absence that God is in his life, and badly wants to know the truth of his nature. Death, however, says that he knows nothing. The existential questions of whether a God exists, whether he cares, and whether there is a larger purpose to life are central to the film, and while there is ample room for interpretation, I think Bergman intended to show that seeking a faith-based connection in life is futile, and the only meaning that exists in the world is that which you impart, primarily from your human connections. The Knight is always shown as completely independent from others, even his traveling partner of 10 years, while Mia and Jof are happy because they value their art and shared bond. While The Knight looks for something greater, they accept their life as it is. The backdrop of the plague adds another layer to the symbolism of the film - it emphasizes the hollowness of the church's claims. The church says that those who do good will be rewarded and sinners punished, but of course the plague is indiscriminating. I still need to grapple much more with the ideas of the film, because it's so dense and layered, but my experience with the film was a purely intellectual one. It had its moments of levity (which could have been inspirations for Monty Python), but for the most part was a detached experience in understanding the complex meanings behind scenes and dialogue, rather than a personal or emotional connection to the story. There's nothing wrong with that, and my thoughts on the film will surely evolve as I interpret more parts of the film, but it did feel heavy in philosophy and symbolism."

I don't have the sophistication or film school background to be able to enjoy the makeup or sets if the plot and characters are awful. But I do enjoy an intelligent film, and (with the proper mindset that I was viewing a very old film), I found the Seven Seals quite accessible and powerful.\n\nWhich is to say that it wasn't very, but I can see how when it came out it must have been a wild sensation. It's original, has something real to say about life. If you're going to watch one of the old classics, and want to know where that scene with Death comes from in \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\", you should be able to get through this film.\n\nWho should see this film:\n\n-- art buffs & drama fans with a flair for classics: a must-see\n\n-- regular people like me who can see watching a film like this sort-of like visiting Taiwan or South Africa. Fascinating place, not my kind of thing and wouldn't want to live there, but glad I had the cultural experience.\n\nI'll give The Seventh Seal a showing its age but still packs a punch 5 out of 10.

        "review_detailed_main": "Here we have Bergman's best known movie. The one movie that broke through the cultural consciousness to leave an imprint most people take for granted. The vision of death playing chess, as said in the movie itself, was a common enough medieval subject for paintings, but our modern culture's image and the source comes straight from Antonious Block challenging Death to a game to extend his life.\n\nAnother thing about the movie that has suffused the culture is the idea that the movie is dour. It has dour elements, but it's also surprisingly light and funny at times. Well, surprising if you're coming at the movie blind, but if you're knee deep in Bergman movies like I am right now, the light elements fit perfectly. Bergman was serious, but he wanted to entertain. I'm not just pulling that out of my ass. He said that his first aim was to entertain.\n\nBlock, a knight just returned to Sweden from the crusades, and his squire Jons have just washed up on shore. The way they are laying there implies the remnants of a shipwreck, where Death arrives. Block makes his challenge in an effort to win his life, or, perhaps merely just extend it long enough to get back home. Along they way, they band together with several people. There's a small troupe of actors, a smith and his loose wife, and a young mute woman Jons takes on as his handmaiden. Along the way, as Block continues his game with Death, tricking and being tricked himself on the board, we see the little lives of these people. Jons is the most entertaining character because his nihilism is delivered so drily and with such wit that he's a joy just to watch. The comedy between the smith, his wife, and another actor (that Death ends up claiming) is a combination of physical comedy and witty repartee that provides some of the most concentrated elements of comedic relief in the film.\n\nBut there are darker elements along the way as well. The country is in the middle of a plague, and people don't know who to blame or who to turn to for salvation. People scourge themselves in a procession where the leader chastises everyone else about the meaninglessness of their lives. There is a witch that the locals insist consorted with the devil and is the cause of the plague. Block's deepest moment of despair comes when he speaks to the witch, begging her for proof of the devil, for if the devil exists, so must God. But she cannot provide anything beyond crazed visions.\n\nThrough it all, God is silent. It's a common theme in this era of Bergman's career. Every movie he made from about the mid-50s on touched on it, but The Seventh Seal is probably the most overt and vivid in its treatment of the idea. In the face of massive suffering, Block looks for any answer and sees nothing.\n\nBut, that's not all. The troupe of actors becomes comprised of only three people, Jof, his wife Mia, and their son Mikael. Jof sees things. He has visions. When we first meet him, he has a vision of the Virgin teaching the Child how to walk as a toddler, but there's doubt about the truth of his visions. He admits to having concocted one in the past, but he insists that he didn't ask for these visions, someone gave them to him. Just before the whole party makes it to Block's castle deep in the forest, Jof has another vision, he sees Block playing chess with Death, and he takes Mia and Mikael away. They flee and hide in terror at the storm passing overhead, which he calls the flight of Death.\n\nAt Block's castle, the remnants of the party meet Block's wife, and they begin a meal until Death arrives and claims them all. There are mixtures of emotions. Jons looks on firmly, ready to meet his end. The mute girl says her only line of dialogue in celebration of the end. Block cannot even look at Death and remains in profile in the background, his hands clasped together as he prays to God.\n\nThe movie ends with Jof waking up after the terrible night to find a beautiful day. He begins to pack up Mia and Mikael when he has another vision, the other famous image of the Dance of Death. Death leads the party over a hill, each hand in hand, and they dance behind Death who leads them on. Is Jof a crazy person who just sees things? Or was he divinely touched in a way that saved him and his family from the end the rest of the party shared?\n\nOnce again, it's Bergman begging for signs from God he can interpret. It's not a rejection of God, but a plea to hear something from the Supreme Being who treats him with nothing but silence."

        "review_detailed_main": "When it comes to deciding the forefathers of emotional, psychological cinema that deals with potently devastating topics, one of the films that definitely comes up is Ingmar Bergman's utter masterpiece \"Det sjunde inseglet\". We begin by seeing it as a small, independent film from Europe that may be interesting to observe if only for the culture and the obvious linguistic differences. By the end of the last minute, we can't believe how such a seemingly small film has been able to move us, and how it has been able to force us into thinking about heavy and potentially disturbing topics that we've all come to wonder about at some point of our lives...and it does so with such precision and searing accuracy, that we wonder how we couldn't have noticed such a gem before.\n\nThe film deals with a 14th century crusader (Max Von Sydow) who's returning from the Holy Land after many years of endless battle, and on his way home, he encounters the Angel of Death on a long-forgotten beach. Death has, obviously, come to claim him at last, as He has been known to do so for quite a while, what with the Plague finishing off most of Europe with the pest. This particular crusader, an important and intelligent man, decides to challenge Death in a game of chess: he forestalls his demise until the game is over, and if he wins death will move one and let him live for many more years. If Death wins...well, you'll see.\n\nAs the crusader fights an endless game of chess with Death, he travels with his faithful but constantly reproaching squire back to his castle. On the way, they meet a number of interesting characters that help (or, actually, make up) the plot of the film. Each character embodies a different take on the religious aspect of the Dark Ages, and provides, each in his/her own way, a particular point of view on the themes of death, the afterlife, and moral correct-ness.\n\nThe crusader himself has doubts about this, doubts that never let him sleep and that are troubling his existence: What is there in the afterlife? Is there a God and a Devil? Is there even an afterlife or is there simply nothingness once you die? Death is, naturally, vague about these topics and refuses to relinquish any information as he plays chess with the crusader, but the characters he meets provide their own hypotheses to these questions and add to his infinite wisdom. Our crusader decides that he will die only until he has corrected some wrongs in his life and, more importantly, until he has performed a good deed that will finally make his existence on earth valuable.\n\nBut these are very difficult questions to be answered, and Ingmar Bergman makes a point of heightening the difficulty by placing the moral and emotional struggles smack down the middle ages and their obscurely slovenly society. The dialogue and reflective monologues from the characters establish the ideas that torment the characters, and the images that are presented heighten the intensity of the topics (unflinchingly) to astronomical heights, involving the viewer not only in the story and development of the film, but on the director's point and art as well.\n\nThe images seen are some of the most famous and remembered in all of cinematic history; they're short episodes the characters witness, and they're burned into the viewer's mind forever: a procession of martyrs who travel around the country in self-flagellation and pleading for God's forgiveness; a woman who has consorted with the devil and has her hands and feet stoned and broken, and is finally burned at the stake; a poor and kind-hearted juggler who dances like a bear to save his life from an amoral and sodomite crowd; the Virgin Mary walking with her naked infant in a meadow; a joyous picnic between newfound friends (the scene that, I believe, anchors the point of the film and upsets the general angst and \"normalized\" horror the rest of the film presents); and, more importantly, the scene where the crusader confesses himself to Death, exposing in a very well-organised monologue the pain and insecurity humans feel towards nothingness and their man-made need to believe in a God that gives sense to our trajectory in earth and our possible entrance to the Next World.\n\nI won't go into analyzing the characters the crusader meets. Even though they're crucial to a thorough examination of how the moral dilemma is augmented and supported, I'd have to discuss a large list of spoilers that would do nothing to the reader's understanding and enjoyment of the film. Let's just say that, without even seeming to try, these characters move precariously through these dark and dangerous times, sometimes understanding the supernatural world they live in, sometimes overwhelmed by it's implications and finally being able to do nothing about it.\n\nThe screenplay is an obvious masterpiece, but so is the photography (which is all-inclusive and treats the scenes with a special ominous foreboding that keeps us on the edge of our seat every single minute), and so is the acting (which, even though is melodramatic to a large extent, always remains balanced and adequate).\n\nThis is a difficult film to try and explain. It was treated with an exorbitant amount of acuteness and love, and the topics were so well-presented and developed, that I could write page after page about what I learned, what I think, and how each minute of the film could only advance my wonderment. But, thankfully, it is not my job to detail my analysis, but to review the film...and, in conclusion, I find it to be a perfectly made movie that will always be embedded into my memory. See it at all costs! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If a mainstream film, or any type of film for that matter, were to tackle as many themes and morals as Ingmar Bergman's legendary Seventh Seal, it would most likely be an uneven, unpolished work, and not even come close to the realm of depth this film can accomplish so elegantly and calmly. This is the kind of picture that, when it's done, you want to immediately rewatch it because you know there are things that you missed.\n\nOur story concerns a disillusioned knight named Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, who gives one of cinema's finest performances) and his squire J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand), who return home after fighting in the Crusades on an empty, desolate beach. Sweden has been victim to the plague, meaning those that have it are dying right before people's eyes, and those who don't have it are engulfed in fear. It isn't long before Block encounters the personified \"Death\" (Bengt Ekerot), who appears pale - in a black cloak - much like early, vague illustrations of the Grim Reaper character. Immediately, Block, confused about life and death itself, challenges Death to a game of chess, where if he wins, he will be spared his life.\n\nBlock and J\u00f6ns, en route back to their castle, encounter Jof and his wife Mia, with their infant son, Mikael, who are stage actors in a play. From here on out, the film takes us on an unforgettable ride, as we follow both Block and J\u00f6ns's journeys throughout the middle age time period and what unfolds than is a rousing commentary on religion, life, and death.\n\nThe film has the look of a period piece, but with the contents of serene drama and utter bleakness with the nice surprising inclusion of black comedy. The Seventh Seal too asks existential questions about the world around us in a manner that isn't indulgent, and offers many assumptions in its underlying text. Frequently, we see our character, Block, as hopeless and seemingly unimportant in life. He questions religion so much, and with all the mentions of death (even the appearance) we begin to wonder if he is inherently godless or atheistic in his personality.\n\nOften, the film provides us with tonal inconsistency, but it has to be the smoothest tonal inconsistency I have yet to experience. It isn't abrupt, and Bergman successfully manages to hold onto the flow of the story, never becoming too tied up with one of the underlying contexts over the other, and is fair and balanced in his work, including much of his dialog which is not cloyingly absent or annoyingly expository. It is perfectly handled and structured with elegance and purity.\n\nThe Seventh Seal is one of the strongest foreign works of all time, and a film with enough on its plate to develop three or four movies. Ingmar Bergman's sharp director, distinct and graphic writing style, complimented by the cinematography of the great Gunnar Fischer bring the energy, sophistication, and true delight that is The Seventh Seal. And even with all of these heavy topics at hand, never is it depressingly grim or overly optimistic.\n\nStarring: Max von Sydow, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Bengt Ekerot, and Nils Poppe. Directed by: Ingmar Bergman."

        "review_detailed_main": "With The Seventh Seal, Bergman is taking movie realism to whole new level, something he started with Wild Strawberries, which already was quite realistic movie if you ignore the cheesy ending, and some other bits.\n\nThe movie does lack some elements which might be considered standard like no comic relief, but it is essential to leave out these elements for Bergman to achieve his vision as to what The Seventh Seal should be, a sexy, sleek, intense action movie that in should no way parallel Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon. Yes there is less action, but all the action in this movie is much more satisfying than in a ordinary movie, I don't recall seeing so realistic gunfights in any other movie. There is no real beginning or ending in this movie, the viewer is just dropped into middle of it, and it's just seamless realistic experience. No vaporous comedy.\n\nI'm not sure why there is so much hate in reviews for this movie? This movie takes you on a slow ride, a very subdued slow burn that never goes over the top. If you went expecting over the top, say like some people would think \"BAD BOYS\" you will fail to enjoy this film. This film makes Hollywood action films look like cartoons compared to this its dark and gritty realism - at some points I felt I was watching an uncensored episode of COPS gone bad-ass.\n\nBelieve the hype, this movie deserves its high spot in the top 250."

Full of images and iconography from medieval frescos, it tells the story of Knight and his squire returning from the crusades and their journey home across plague ridden medieval Sweden.\n\nHowever, death has come for the Knight, but is challenged to a game of chess.\n\nSo gloomy and full of despair.....not!!! This is a movie full of life. Life is children, beautiful women, death, pain, evil, sex, singing, fear and so on.\n\nThis not a movie about death, except to say, death is part of life. The knight has a desperate desire to beat death, but in truth he knows all he can buy is time. This is the great truth of life and of this movie. (Of course Bill and Ted beat death in Bill and Ted's bogus journey by challenging death to a game of twister, me I would go for Rock Scissors Paper).\n\nIn modern terms it can be seen a good little movie, brilliant in its time, but perhaps nothing too special today. However, any wanna-be film maker must see this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Talking specifically about this title we should mention first the serious part, which I see in the deep commitment to God's Word. It is not by chance that the time in which the action takes place is the Middle Ages - as if the only intelligible world of man then was then religious one. And I must mention the burdens finale in which death refers all.\n\nIndeed, the theme of death is also central and serious, but as in life - to her we give our last thoughts. The action starts on the beach (a symbol of transition to infinity or origin of life on earth), where the main character causes death, that came for him, at chess. The idea is to win some time to buy someone else's life.\n\nDeath is presented as a mystery, as the deadline which is pressing and tormenting our conscience. It is difficult to find higher instance before which the protagonist to kneel, to feel guilt. The only time he decided yet to do so, it appeared that confession was before death. So it turns out that actually the manifest was in front of himself, but in his last hour (death).\n\nHere eminence is given into the hands of intelligent people and artists, then the religious and finally to the ordinary people. The plague rages in the Middle Ages putting to test the faith of believers and asking questions about the meaning of human existence. However, there are many rays of light, saved young lives, there are people who happily lived their lives. Such people exist today and there will always be.\n\nA playful Bergman film which is for true connoisseurs of cinema."

This movie has an existential quality to it and puts you at odds with knowing most of the people he meets will die, but whom? The movie shows the fears and ignorance of humanity confronted with the unknown and trying to blame it on anything and anyone including themselves.

        "review_detailed_main": "Death is a beautiful thing. He stands upon a rocky beach shore \u0096 tall, proud, inescapable \u0096 his gaunt face staring expectantly towards his next victim. War-weathered knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, \"The Exorcist\") is not surprised to see him. The Black Death has already descended upon Sweden, killing all in its path, inciting terror in every village. \"I have long walked at your side,\" proclaims Death. \"That I know,\" is Block's reply. He understands that his time has now come, but he fears death. He cannot undertake what he does not understand. Is there a God? Following death, will he experience the rewards of Heaven, or the vast emptiness of nothing. Block likens faith in God to \"loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.\" His faith is lost; he cannot move on until he has decided upon his beliefs.\n\nDesperate for several more days to come to terms with his faith, Block challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot) to a game of chess. His opponent is actually quite a skillful chess player, but the knight hopes to be able to hold him off for long enough to acquire the \"knowledge\" that he so desires. And so Block, accompanied by his brave and loyal squire J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand), strikes off to see his wife just one final time, each day bringing him several moves closer to the end. Meanwhile, a small travelling troop of actors, comprising playfully-natured Jof (Nils Poppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), their one-year-old son Mikael and partner Skat (Erik Strandmark), try to make ends meet through their theatrical performances. The paths of these two parties will eventually meet, and all those who travel alongside Antonius Block will risk suffering the same fate as he, should the fateful chess game prove unsuccessful.\n\nThis being my first film from Ingmar Bergman, I was immediately astonished at how beautiful the film was. Whether it be the unforgettable close-ups of Death's ghostly white face and captivating gaze, two horses drinking solemnly from the ocean's edge, the ghastly procession of bloodied penitents who haul hefty wooden crosses and sacrificially flog themselves or the distant image of Death leading his followers in a Danse Macabre (Dance of Death) across a grassy mountain-top, 'The Seventh Seal' is brimming with beauty.\n\nThe acting is absolutely stunning. Max von Sydow, the only name I recognised due to his significant later work in such films as Friedkin's 'The Exorcist (1973)' and Spielberg's 'Minority Report (2002),' is superb as Antonius Block, the knight who must decide who or what he believes in before his time runs out. Of the many representations of Death in cinema, Bengt Ekerot's portrayal in this film must be one of the finest \u0096 with his icy black stare, his arrogant and merciless manner and all sorts of devious trickery up his sleeves, 'The Seventh Seal's' Death has to be one of the most memorable villains of all time.\n\nThough not subtle in its symbolism by any standards, this directness is one of the film's strengths. By regarding good and evil with the same physical simplicity as its hero does, we are forced to make up our minds either way. Stunningly beautiful, endlessly thought-provoking, chilling and mesmerising, Ingmar Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal' is a masterpiece of existential cinema."

Of course, the ones flourishing are those connected to the church. When people are desperate, that's where they end up. There is no moral sense at work in the land because death is literally around the corner, played by a round faced character in a black cowl. Max Van Sydow's knight is a fine character who manages to play a game of chess with Death and put off the inevitable. During that time he encounters a group of scoundrels and some very nice people who don't deserve their fate. Bergman's images are incredible. He does more with black and white film than darn near anyone. There is a preponderance of religious symbolism. Most of what I remember is that amazing power generated by the church, the burnings and the fear tactics. When Death comes, after the fear has been exhausted, there seems to be a comfortable acceptance because the life on earth is certainly not worth much."

His career began in Sweden but he catapulted to fame with his collaborations with director Ingmar Bergman. He is quintessential male Bergman lead, able to perfectly convey the sorrow and loss needed to fill out the silences in Bergman's simple, stark films. From the disillusioned knight of The Seventh Seal to the suicidal parishioner of Winter Light, through to the despondent souls of Bergman's late 60s trilogy (Shame, Hour of the Wolf, The Passion of Anna), von Sydow brought real legitimacy and relatability to Bergman's philosophical think-pieces.\n\nOf course, von Sydow's legacy transcended just being a key part of Bergman's symphony. He was one of Hollywood's greatest character actors for over 50 years. In which time, he played Jesus, fought Pazuzu in The Exorcist, and garnered himself 2 Academy Award nominations. He appeared in franchises like Ghostbusters, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones, and worked with directors like Spielberg, Scorsese, and Lynch. His breadth of work is almost unmatched and his talents almost unequaled.\n\nWhen a great actor dies, there is always a sadness to overcome. But in the case of von Sydow, I find myself particularly attached to his work. His early Bergman films were my first forays into arthouse cinema, they are what pushed me to first explore sites like Letterboxd. And his performances, of firm characters suffering with emotional weakness, are as compelling now as they have ever been. Without his remarkable ability to ground the spiritual films he was in, perhaps there would have not been a stepping stone for the uninitiated to enter the world of high art cinema.\n\nDeath has finally won his chess match, but what a game it was.\n\nMax von Sydow, truly a legend. RIP."

        "review_title": "The Seventh Seal: \"A Film of Visual Scope, of Imaginative Concept, of Powerful Content\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "Ingmar Bergman is a director of unparalleled brilliance. Since his first script, 1944's Torment, Bergman has always delivered thoughtful and engaging films that delve deep into humanity. Be it relations between one another, our consciousness and subconsciousness, or any number of various facets of our existence, Bergman cuts to the very core of humanity and bring to light these many layers and elements in exceedingly artful ways. And one of the great tales told by the Swedish titan that demonstrates this well is his cherished and revered classic, The Seventh Seal.\n\nThe Seventh Seal is a masterful piece of filmmaking that explores man's relationship with religion in medieval times, a time when the Church had a stranglehold on feudal Europe. The story of disillusioned knight Antonius Block, played by the impeccable Max von Sydow, returning from the grueling Crusades to lands ravaged by the Great Plague and taking on Death itself, portrayed by the chilling Bengt Ekerot, in a chess match for his life is one of the most simple yet complex tales captured on celluloid. Alongside this central battle is a colorful cast of side characters, including he blissful pair of actors Jof & Mia, played by Nils Poppe & Bibi Andersson respectively, and Block's squire J\u00f6ns, brought to life with delightfully dry wit by Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, who flesh out the dark world of medieval Sweden and provide levity and even humor in the midst of the grim conflict and existential inquires made by Block.\n\nBergman's script, adapted from a play of his titled Wood Painting, is somewhat on the nose in its mulling over of faith, death, and existence. But to a degree, what Bergman crafted was an adult fairy tale. The Seventh Seal is a story you could tell a child as it is simple in its narrative and its developments, but is rich in imagery and allusion, taking its title from and quoting at the outset from the eighth chapter of the Book of Revelations. Block's passionate search for knowledge and constant crisis of faith is engaging on a philosophical and personal level, aided by the impassioned performance provided by Sydow. The premise is a simple piece of high fantasy, but it delves into it themes openly and in depth. British author Melvyn Bragg put it best when he described the film as having an argumentative structure and being \"told as a sermon might be delivered: an allegory.\" Adding to these inquiries and the sharp discussions between Block and Death in the midst of their match are characters such as Jof & Mia that bring a certain level of hope to the piece, as both are pleasant and optimistic for a fair portion of the film, with Jof being almost prophetic in a way, being able to see visions of both Mary and a young Jesus, and ominous premonitions of the effects of the Great Plague. And then there is the squire J\u00f6ns, an unadulterated cynic who, as described by American author and film historian Gerald Mast in his book A Short History of the Movies, \"treats death as a bitter and hopeless joke.\" These supporting roles help to build the world and the themes of death and faith through their interactions with Block. All in all, the script, in spite of its bluntness, is exceptionally articulate and works wonders with its straightforward but fantastic premise.\n\nOn the technical side, The Seventh Seal is a low-budget marvel, knowing that it was made on a pauper's budget of $150,000. Bergman's direction is inspired in its bleak tone that pairs well with the equally dark concepts presented in the script. He approaches the film rather intellectually, showing chilling images of an ill woman writhing in pain being looked over by a monk, and depicting Death as incredibly callous in a famous scene involving the felling of a tree. Every actor and actress is clearly invested. Sydow, Ekerot, Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Andersson, throw a dart, and the name you hit is giving his or her all in the role. The chemistry between the characters is spectacular, with Sydow and Ekerot boasting one of the most impressive dichotomies in committed to celluloid. Gunnar Fischer's expressionistic cinematography was universally lauded upon release, and rightfully so. The gothic and pastoral medieval imagery is elegantly captured with impressive lighting schemes and excellent framing, with the introduction of Death and the \"Danse Macabre\" being the two iconic shots that bookend the film. P.A. Lundgren's production design and Manne Lindholm's costume design go hand in hand in creating the lived-in world of medieval Sweden, with big props going to Lindholm in draping Death with the iconic black cloak. Also of note is the inspired score by regular collaborator Erik Nordgren, whose liberal use of the Latin chant Dies Irae, general implementation of choral passages, and orchestral mannerisms reminiscent of celebrated American composer Bernard Herrmann enrich the film through heightening the grimness and further enveloping the audience in the atmosphere of the period.\n\nAt the end of the day, The Seventh Seal is deservedly a classic. It is a film that blatantly ponders the nature of faith and death, but does so in an engaging and personal way. Through a combination of Bergman's well-crafted characters and each actor's pitch-perfect execution, you become invested in all facets of this world. You are there with Block in taking on Death, and you too want to know the answers, you want the knowledge he seeks, you too want \"God to stretch out His hand.\" The production values are top notch, especially knowing that the budget afforded to Bergman was so small. But at the end of the day, it is a film that has to be seen to truly appreciate. So in closing, go and watch this film. If you consider yourself a fan of cinema, or are an aspiring filmmaker, simply take some time to watch this masterclass of medieval fantasy and world cinema."

I've got my cart before my horse here!), and therefore, his movies are very artistic to watch. (I've often said I could turn off the sound on any given Coppola film and just LOOK at it... same goes for this movie.) Like most hapless folks of my generation, I was weaned on vapid hollywood tripe, testosterone engorged, brain-dead action and the usual bevy of unattractive splatter films. Imagine my surprise at realizing that not only could a movie be moving and intelligent, but it could be ART! What a treat! This film should be on the \"must see\" list of everyone who has a philosophical bent or who has ever questioned the current \"conventional wisdom\" about life, death and meaning. Thanks to this film, I've discovered other classic cinema greats like Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welle's, Stanley Kubrick... the list goes on and on. Movies are fine, but give your eyes and your brain something of substance and treat yourself to some real cinema every now and again. More directly portrayed cold war films which I heartily recommend are Dr. Strangelove, Failsafe, Seven Days In May, The Manchurian Candidate and The Spy Who Came In From The Cold."

        "review_detailed_main": "From the very first frame of 'The Seventh Seal', it is extremely clear that this is a film that successfully strives to be beautiful. The film opens with a brilliant shot of the bleak sky, accompanied by appropriately despairing choral music. The iconography gets better from there. Every single frame is a work of art in itself; from the image of two black horses standing in a wild sea, to the now immortal side shot of Antonius the Knight engaged in a game of chess with Death.\n\n'The Seventh Seal', beyond its visual seamlessness, is a profound and incredibly rich narrative. The doomed protagonists are placed in a bleak, death-ridden environment crawling with the plague and religious extremism. Here, director Ingmar Bergman pits them against the metaphysical; Max Von Sydow's Antonius questions the silence of God in a world which needs him more than ever, Jof the actor witnesses biblical imagery whilst remaining secure as part of the most likable, optimistic family ever faced with such relentless misery, and Antonius' squire dryly and humorously provides a commentary on death and the plague-ridden environment.\n\nThis film is quite literally a masterpiece, both visually and philosophically. It boasts imagery that will forever be synonymous with classic cinema and some of the best performances an audience will ever have the privilege to witness."

It doesn't seem to make much sense, even though it kept me entertained from beginning to end.

It doesn't seem to have a well defined plot, besides a protagonist which plays chess with Death himself during the course of the film and in the end finally looses the match and is sent to the next world.\n\nThe characters aren't complex, they are not emotionally developed, but that's not the point of the movie. It's not a movie about a plot and characters. Though that detracts from my film experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Very rarely such a both great looking and thought provoking movie comes around that makes such a powerful and lasting impression. \"Des Sjunde inseglet\" has some great and thought provoking themes in it and is also beautifully made at the same time, by Ingmar Bergman and his entire cast and crew.\n\nThe movie questions and debates several issues concerning the meaning of life, religion and death. Of course this movie provides no answers to any of that because of the simple reason that nobody knows the answers to these questions and everybody interpret life and belief on their own way. This movie can also be seen as a free interpretation of those subjects and it triggers the mind of its viewers, which is also the reason why this movie can be interpreted in many different ways by many different people. It makes \"Des Sjunde inseglet\" a rare really thought provoking movie.\n\nBut the movie is not only just about this depressing and heavy subjects, it's also about hope, if you at least look deep enough into it. Also the movie is way more accessible to everyone then it might sound. The themes and entire subject of the movie might sound a bit off and difficult and certainly will scare of a large group of the average movie-watcher but the movie is perfectly watchable for basically just everyone. I think that the great surrealism of the movie is a reason why it works out so way and is perfect to watch for basically just everyone, regardless of age, race or religion.\n\nThe movie has a great look in which less is more. The movie chooses a simplistic and more warm approach, to keep the story real and as involving and thought provoking as possible. It gives the movie an unique look and atmosphere and also provides the movie with some beautiful images. The cinematography is really first rate and so are the costumes and sets for the movie, that all adds to its atmosphere of the time period the movie is set in.\n\nThe movie is filled with a couple of beautiful looking sequences that also make a lasting heavy dramatic impression. It's a powerful movie to watch that both provokes and is easy on the eyes.\n\nAll of the actors also did a great job and the movie features some of the best Swedish actors of that generation. Of course most are unknown today by the general public but the movie also features some 'big' names that are known around the world, of which Max von Sydow is of course the best example. I enjoyed watching him in this early movie role, especially since we mostly only know him as an 'old' man, every since his \"The Exorcist\" role. It was refreshing to see him as a very young man and as a beginning actor. Bengt Ekerot is also perfectly cast as the scary looking 'death' itself. His appearance is the best known element out of the movie and is even known to persons who've never watched this movie. This really says something about the impact his appearance makes in this movie.\n\nIt's just a movie in which everything adds up; the cinematography, the music, the atmosphere, the directing, the acting, its themes. Everything is first class work and every little element of the movie enriches the movie and adds up to its total brilliance. The fact that such an 'old' European movie is so well known- and is still being watched all over the world should say enough about its quality and universal themes that are of all time that are handled in it.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Personally, I'm very sorry that I didn't like a classic like this anymore. First I have to say how visually the film is beautiful. The black and white technique fits perfectly with the theme and tone of the film. The theme is great and always current. Life, death, the meaning of life, the existence of God and the devil. I liked every scene with the protagonist Block playing chess against Death, the literal one that isn't really that important (it's more for visuality and aesthetics) as well as that figurative, life duel against Death trying to find out some life secret during games. Chess here represents life, whatever it may be and however great a chess player it may be, Death cannot be defeated. You may be able to extend the game a bit, but in the end Death always sets the checkmate. What bothered me in the film were the numerous supporting actors who removed my emphasis from the \"main\" stories, even though they also participate, each in their own way. I also sometimes get lost in the film from the numerous symbols that seem purposeful to themselves. At the end of the film, I didn't feel like I was watching anything special."

The somewhat pompous knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) is Don Quichotte and the much more pragmatic somewhat cynical Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) is his Sancho Panza.\n\nAntonius Block takes himself very seriously and begins a game of chess with the dead. That the film is all about symbolism is proven by the fact that not the slightest attempt is made to make the dead scary. It is just an actor with a black robe and a whitewashed face. That the film is not without humour is proven by the fact that Antonius Block prepares a combination involving a bishop and a knight. As crusader he knows what a deadly combination that can be.\n\nHis combination fails however and he loses the game. In the final scene he is led away bij the dead in a \"Danse macabre\".\n\nThere are two characters who escape this dance of death, the circus artists Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson). We are back again in Christian spheres because their names are obvious references to Jozef and Maria. They escape the dead because they are neither pompous nor cynical. They are rather naive and take life as it is."

The narrative consists of some fragments from lives of different people but unfortunately there is no concrete subject matter. As expected, it leaves all the questions about meaning of life unanswered and ends in a weird fashion.\n\nThe only enjoyable part is the crusader knight playing chess against the grim reaper for his life which has become an inspiration to many movies. This movie can be deemed \"mesmerizing\" for those who get impressed by disorganized surrealist movies with loads of meaningless conversations -which they think are meaningful- like Bergman's other movies. As for me, it is just a decent movie."

At least you'll get a laugh and your mates won't fall asleep at your terrible choice of film. I nearly cracked my back after I woke up during this film. it's the kind of film you put on to impress a foreign lady and then both of you get drunk and realise it's just philosophising for the sake of it. I did not feel better after this film and it has kind of put me off chess as well, and any film that can do that is pretty much a no-brainer. Avoid, like the Black Plague. That's unless death wheels up to offer you a game of chess. Also, death looks too much like 'Robocop' with his mask off for me to take this film seriously. If you watch it, then enjoy your sleep. If you don't watch it? Enjoy any Eddie Murphy film you've wisely chosen instead."

I mean, nothing in it seems to be there without any reasons or a deep meaning. Maybe i'm reading too much on it, but maybe not. Remember that we are talking about Ingmar Bergman. And technically it is, as well, a very well made film. A beautiful film, in fact. The cinematography is stunning, with some wonderful shots, it has an impressive work in the edition as well, a very macabre soundtrack, which adds a certain dark(even darker) atmosphere to the film. The acting is impressive, a bit over the top, but still good. It may be not 100% entertaining all the time, but I'm sure that it can be an easily watchable experience even for those who don't have that much interest in this kind of films. Also, we have one of the most remarkable moments in cinema history here, when the cross soldier plays chess against the death. Absolutely fantastic.

The to-and-fro between Death and Antonius Block is extremely enthralling to watch. 7. The humour is inserted sporadically, but it never fails to induce a chuckle without being overbearing. 8. The movie serves as a wonderful allegory on how humans respond to death, whether that be to sacrifice themselves for others; intensely fearing death; acting indifferent towards it; maybe even welcoming it; or even treating it with a good sense of humour.\n\nCons: 1. Some lines of dialogue are quite clearly dubbed. 2. The sound design is a little off at certain points."

Moments of dialogue that fit absolutely perfectly that hit you with a sudden power. This film is one of the most poignant reflections on life, death, and Religion. The mood of the film reflects that, moving very swiftly from joy to dark fear.\n\nI will say that some of the scenes come across as slightly ridiculous and overblown, and the costumes too haven't aged quite as well as other films, however these are minor criticisms not difficult to overlook. I don't feel the performances are consistent across the board, with some doing much better than others. Despite these criticisms, where it's at it's best, it's truly astounding."

        "review_detailed_main": "The events and themes of Ingar Bergman's classic The Seventh Seal show numerous examples of existentialism. Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who \"hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles.\" The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choices\u2014as is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival."

It's a rare film that might warrant more than one viewing to fully appreciate its depth and character.\n\nEven though I thought the ending could have been more emphatic and cathartic, it still left me convinced that Bergman intended this film to be his deeply personal take on the excesses of religious dogma and the willful ignorance of those who choose to follow it. It has a haunting feeling throughout and leaves the viewer puzzled and in awe at the same time. One memorable sequence after another. Strongly recommended to anyone, even if he or she is not a film buff."

In the background, the horses are seen drinking the ocean water - again apparently.\n\nCut to a few people sleeping in a sheep wagon. A guy wakes up, goes outside, and starts dancing around. Name ONE guy ever who woke up and failed to take a leak. That's what I mean by pathetic directing.\n\nThere's an overlay narration about some biblical nonsense that fails to give things context because if Revelation did occur in the middle ages, there's be no cinema for this director to screw up."

        "review_detailed_main": "For its time, Ingmar Bergman's iconic \"The Seventh Seal\" was revolutionary for its blatancy in showing the absence of God but the presence of Death. Much of what comprises this film; is not what those who know of it would attribute to it, visually speaking. Most people can only think about the visual of a knight on a beach, just back from the Crusades, the ocean suddenly silenced when a dark figure reveals himself on the horizon. It is Death, cloaked all in black, his white washed face standing out against the backdrop of pure nature. They play a game of chess for the knight's life, and so the film begins. Past that most people don't know much about this film. For one thing, there is very little chess featured in this film. For another, the knight has a comrade who he travels with. They go through the countryside, where the Plague has laid siege to all peoples. Everyone has become mad and frightened at the prospect of death, and belies religion's influence for some help in the matter of their mortality. A large amount of people believe in the religious fervor that is sweeping the countryside, and lend themselves to self-abuse, crucifixions, and murder. Others try to steal from the dead and help themselves through the devastation of the illness. Everyone seems to be trying to find answers to why there is war, poverty, and illness when God is supposed to protect them from their woes. A girl is captured and confesses to consorting with the Devil, which she says brought about the plague. She is only an innocent, content in turning from her God because of his absence, but not really a conspirer with evil. The film encourages exploration and takes a step back from theology by showing the very evils it inflicted in the past. Still, there is a call for people to also keep their faith in the face of Death, even while he's playing chess across from you. There's also a young couple who are very friendly and giving, and their fates are sealed thanks to their faith and love for one another. Bergman may not have known the infinitesimal questions that come from exploring your own doubt and frustrations with life. Though Bergman continually questioned himself in his later films, there is never an answer, only the freedom to question at all."

Directed by Ingmar Bergman, this classic is a deep, brooding dive into the meaning of life, death, and the big question: what does it all mean? Set during the Black Plague, the film's atmosphere is as dark and gloomy as you'd expect-perfect for a knight named Antonius Block, who's just trying to chill after the Crusades but ends up playing chess with Death instead. Yes, you read that right. Imagine challenging Death to a chess match like it's some kind of casual Tuesday.\n\nBergman's portrayal of Block's existential crisis is something we can all relate to, especially in times of crisis. Antonius is grappling with faith, doubt, and the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, much like the rest of us on a Monday morning. His journey through the plague-ridden landscape, alongside a ragtag bunch of characters who represent every shade of human despair, feels like the ultimate road trip through an existential nightmare. The Seventh Seal makes you laugh nervously while questioning the purpose of life. It's a thriller for the soul, with a punchline that hits a little too close to home."

The plot is set in Sweden during the catastrophic period of the Black Death in the medieval times. I was astounded to see how finely Bergman carved the image of terror and horror into the personified image of Death. The concepts of faith, belief, evil and good are discussed in the movie alongside fright and dismay characteristic to the medieval times.

He is approached by Death who's come for him and the knight challenges Death to a game of chess to spare his life. Not knowing, I expected this movie to be focused on the game of chess, when it's really more telling the story of how people dealt with the tumultuous times dealing with the black death that is killing off the people. I'm glad this was the case as it is what really drew me into the story. So many interesting elements. Seeing how the religious officials were blaming people for their sins and telling them it was punishment from God. The most telling scene in the movie was when they were talking to the girl who was about burned alive for being involved with the devil. There was one scene that amused me, probably more than intended...when Death was cutting down the tree with a saw. I really enjoyed the lighter scenes that contrasted the serious ones in the movie. Ultimately I believe it was never the knight's intention to really try and beat Death, but to try to prolong life as long as possible in hopes of accomplishing something positive...in this case helping the couple and their child. This is my first Bergman movie, but it makes me anxious to explore more of his work. While watching, it was easy to spot many parts that have been borrowed/parodied in future films...it was good to finally see the source.\n\n***1/2 (Out of 4) Rank: #3 in 1957"

        "review_detailed_main": "OUTLINE. It is the year the Great Plague hits Scandinavia. A seasoned knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) returns from some ten year's long late crusading venture to the Holy Land, to which he went out a Believer, where he became a Denier, and whence he now comes back a Seeker. He is followed by his loyal squire, the coarsely cynical, still brave and righteous J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstand), with whom he keeps a strong bond and an implicit debate going on. During the journey, he encounters various people and events, all with a particular bearing on the Knight's all consuming Quest for God's Existence and the Meaning of Life; first of all he meets Death himself (Bengt Ekerot), but he contrives to postpone his end by challenging by his sinister opponent to a game of chess, which he intends to win, though he really can't, as he himself in the final analysis knows. Then, we see, among others, the na\u00efvely charming family of entertainers, Jof (Nils Poppe), his loving pretty wife Mia (Bibi Andersson) and the infant Mikael, later we see the unrepenting Witch on her way to the stakes (Maud Hansson), the primitive blacksmith Plog (\u00c5ke Fridell) and his trampy wife (Inga Gill), the silent peasant girl (Gunnel Lindblom). Many join him to a following on the route. Finally they reach his home castle where his noble and faithful wife Karin (Inga Landgr\u00e9) courteously receives them all. He has by now lost his game; and the same night Death comes to claim his harvest, and in the culminating scene they all confront Death with a display of their respective true personal nature. Then follows a short epilogue, where the juggler family, having escaped Death, moves away in a state of happy innocence.\n\nJUDGMENT. This film combines simplicity and complexity in a way never surpassed. The themes, the motives, the characters, they all have a popular and universal quality easy for everyone to recognize and understand; the dialog is simple, terse and exact; but all these general, iconic and \"archetypal\" elements of the story are brought into an interplay producing amazing complexity and subtlety. Consequently, an enormous richness is exemplarily condensed into a minimum of size; in this film nothing is redundant, and one may well argue it's a culmination all the way. It's tragedy; but pastiche and comedy just as well. It's a \"deep\" film if any; and still gorgeous entertainment. In short, this film is, in my opinion, more close to Perfection than any, and the multiplication product of Quality and Interest is simply sky high.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS. Many scenes have been famous: those moments at the chessboard, that \"Totentanz\" end procession on the ridge; the frightening appearance of the flagellants. So, I would like to point out a few scenes no one else here has mentioned: the wonderful little absurdist song show by Jof and Mia at the stage before being interrupted by flagellants' arrival; the calm and surprising reply by Death, when queried about the Mystey he hides and represents: \"Secrets? I have no secrets. I am unknowing.\" - and the ecstatic face of the peasant girl, kneeling and hailing Death at the end scene in the castle: \"It is finished!\" - it's here the film really, so to speak, explodes somewhat koan-wise into a sudden Illumination, how come so few reckon this??\n\nThe acting is great all way through, von Sydow (what terrific makeup, making him so statue-like!) and Bj\u00f6rnstrand are those generally appraised, and quite rightly so; but in my opinion they are both eclipsed by the brilliance of Bibi Andersson as Mia, here fusing beauty and acting ability in a way just knocking me out; just watch her inspired, perfectly burlesque \"body language\" in that silly song performance, it couldn't be more accurate. She's simply phenomenal. - Inga Landgr\u00e9 is perfect as Karin, and Maud Hansson an unforgettable Witch.\n\nDISCUSSION. Some keen observations have been made by other members, but I am surprised finding so many fine points missed. Some dicern an anti-religious tendency, but this is inadequate. The knight Antonius in the end let's it all go spontaneous desperate prayer, at last running into fierce confrontation with J\u00f6ns, to the end the staunch Atheist. We must not forget the crucial part played by Jof, the Fool proving the Wise Man when put to the ultmate test, the only one seeing what it's all about, thus being able to save his his family at the last moment, sparing them for that lucid end scene; and J\u00f6ns' words to the peasant girl he caringly looks after, winning her confidence: \"Don't you see I give you solace?\" and - again! - this enthralling Enigma of that face, and those words in her one single line in the manuscript. This film does NOT argue Atheism, but a positive Agnosticism tinged with a, though tiny, maybe, still bright note of Hope.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS. It's said Ingmar Bergman has \"disowned\" this film. That isn't so. As he himself explains, it's a painful thing for him to recall the agonies of past works, he made this movie as a self therapeutic treatment for his personal haunting fear of death, he probably feels having succeeded striking a precarious balance he is now recalcitrant to jeopardize by some reexamination. Ingmar Bergman himself regards The Seventh Seal as one of his best films, but he does not enjoy talking about it.\n\nThe story is generally presumed to take place in Sweden - but the two towns mentioned, Elisinore and Roskilde - are Danish, not Swedish.\n\nThis film is a literary masterpiece as well. The incisive, powerful language used in it represents the Swedish language at a very apogee of it's high potential of purity, clarity and beauty.\n\nThe film is included in a list of films officially approved and recommended by the Vatican.\n\nIN SHORT. Not a few people regard this film as the best ever made. I think I am one of them."

Of course, in college we read Tolstoy, \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", Kierkegaard \"Fear and Trembling\", \"Sickness unto Death\", Bishop Robinson \"The Death of God,\" and the poetry of murdered UN Secretary Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, and saw the Movie, read the book, \"Sophie's Choice\", and existentialism was the philosophy du jour.\n\nI saw it the other night paired with \"The Naked Edge\" 1961 (both on YouTube) and \"The Seventh Seal\" loses something as one matures. In \"The Naked Edge\" the newly married Gary Cooper has the taint of being a murderer on him, something his new wife is concerned about. And Cooper is concerned that his new wife might think he is a murderer. The movie, being a thriller, by its end the new wife is about to be murdered and the audience is left to wonder until the last moment by whom. Now that is darkness. Considering your spouse to be a murder, the spouse knows that his wife thinks him a murderer...\n\nIn \"The Seventh Seal\" Death is subject of the film in that over the top way. Or fear of death is the subject; but in the Middle Ages with the Black Plague, who would not or should not have feared death. But the viewer wonders: is this too obvious, too over the top? At age 20, the film impressed; by age 74, it had worn thin.\n\nI still give it a 10 for it is an excellent film."

The plot is smart and interesting, and it is compelling from start to finish. During a game of chess between The Grim Reaper itself and the man he has come to take, subjects like faith, life and death are explored. It's rather compelling, and ought to inspire many a healthy debate about aforementioned broad topics. The open and seemingly ambiguous nature of the movie allows the audience to interpret it for ourselves. This is funny at points, once or twice from absurdity, and it never tries too hard. It comes naturally, the clever and witty material as well as the black comedy. The acting is excellent, not a single performance is off for a second. It's really cool to see Sydow, by all respects a great talent, in his native tongue. This is beautifully shot and skillfully edited, if the sound can be a tad excessive at times. The music does also get loud and over the top a little, though it does not put much of a strain on the viewing experience. There is disturbing content in this, as well as brief violence and a few gruesome visuals. The DVD contains an introduction with Ingmar himself, which is three minutes long. I recommend this to anyone who is mature enough to appreciate it. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I started to be interested in films outside the Hollywood standards when I saw Ingmar Bergman in an exhibition at the cine club of the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, in 1983, where I was studying. Many of my friends say that Bergman's films are sluggish, slow, and boring. It's not my opinion. I agree that some are not easy to see, but I like most of the ones I've seen so far.\n\nFor many years, it was difficult to choose which of the films from the Swedish director's extensive filmography to put in my Top 3. My order of preference, until then, was Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal and Persona. Precisely these films are the subject, in addition to Cries and Whispers, of the Bergman Cycle of the Film Analysis Club, of which I have been a member since November 2021.\n\nI reviewed The Seventh Seal for the 28/04/2022 class. As soon as I finished watching it, I was surprised by my reaction that I didn't like it as much as the other times I saw it. Of the latter, the slapstick comedy scenes inserted in such a deep drama, with a literally apocalyptic feel, bothered me a lot, since the book Revelation of the Bible is constantly quoted and/or staged. Apart from the aforementioned comedy, the film still impresses. Strong scenes of religious fanaticism allied with immolation to be able to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, waiting for death, not only for natural reasons of any living being, but also for the Black Death that ravaged the Middle Ages at the time the plot develops.\n\nMax Von Sydow puts on a show as the knight who defies Death to a game of chess. Even knowing his end, he keeps stalling, getting more time to live, to return to his house, where only his wife was waiting for him. Bengt Ekerot is well characterized as Death: dark, sneaky, patient and scary.\n\nBeautiful black and white photography with the intense use of light/dark, with clear references to German expressionism.\n\nMost of the scenes are filmed outdoors, always showing the vastness of nature, be it the sea, the forest or the lands where the knight passes. These elements of nature, although finite, give the impression of being infinite, that they never end, in frequent contrast to the characters' waiting for death. Life passes, but those landscapes stay. They may even be altered, but they will remain in counterpoint to man's finitude.\n\nA necessary film for anyone who likes to study cinema.\n\nIn my ranking, it lost his place to Persona, but remains in Bergman's Top 3."

But even those with highly developed intellects have to examine and observe what they have been presented with in order to form opinions and draw conclusions; and, since I really didn't get much out of it the first time, I would have to watch it again. And this is not a film I would watch twice, nor wish to discuss at any length, since I don't feel my life will be enriched by understanding it better. I found it irreligious. I found it to bear a very heavy one-sided agenda. And, now that it's behind me, I don't care to look back.\n\nHad Bergman not proven himself already before writing and directing this dark tale, I seriously doubt anyone would have been knocking his door down to produce it. Unlike what many others say, I also found the cinematography lacking, the score at best forgetable, and the lighting as amateurish as a home movie.\n\nLet me add that I have great faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ, so that definitely affected the way I reacted to this movie. I wish I could understand fully those who do not believe or have faith; but, regardless, what I can say to them is, unless you consider yourself a true intellectual, I would recommend other ways to explore the meaning of life since this film definitely doesn't reach the heights it aims to reach. And, if you want to see a beautiful movie written by Bergman, see Best Intentions, a fine film about his parents and their life before he was born."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was the first film I watched by Ingmar Bergman, and in my eyes it's one of his very best. Ingmar loved to ask whether God exists or not, and while he may have devised more subtle ways to ask that question in later films, his directness in \"The Seventh Seal\" is one of the film's strong points. Antonius Block returns from fighting in the Crusades (Max Von Sydow) when he gets a visit from The Grim Reaper himself (Bengt Ekerot). But Antonious is not ready to die, and in order to buy himself some time, he challenges Death to a game of Chess. The Black Death has also taken hold of Antonius' hometown, and the villagers have been plunged into fear of the plague (The Black Death and the Crusades did not occur at the same time in real life, and this film is not meant to be historically accurate) The game of Chess continues throughout the film, and it even manifests itself through other characters in the film (one of the very first corpses found in the film could very well be an early pawn taken during the game of Chess). As Antonius travels through a village, along with his Squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand, who steals almost every scene he's in), he meets a variety of people, the most important two people are Jof and Mia, a couple of travelling artists very much in love, who also have a young son. Sven Nykvist may not have done the cinematography, but this is still one of the best looking films you could ever see. The dark and moody atmosphere is brilliantly reflected in the dark clouds, sinister forests and wonderful use of smoke throughout the movie. The soundtrack really adds to the mood, and the acting is nothing short of excellent. \"The Seventh Seal\" is only 90 minutes long, and Ingmar Bergman manages to say more in this film than some directors can say in over twice the running time: The existence of God, man's mortality in limited time, the damaging effects of war on a man's faith and an artist's importance to humanity. \"The Seventh Seal\" is a dark, thought-provoking movie on the human condition. Not only is it classic Bergman, it is classic cinema."

Very often I'll find my admiration for a thematically substantive film tempered by my frustration at how mercilessly the themes are propounded. What impresses me the most about The Seventh Seal is that Bergman's startlingly bold symbolic choices don't result in this kind of excess. We see Death himself - playing chess with a doomed mortal, no less - and yet we (or I, at least) don't at all feel that Bergman has gone too far. The dialogue, even when it deals with such weighty topics as the existence of God, seems honest and natural. (The possible exception is Antonius's musing on how meaningful is his experience with Jof, Mia, and the bowl of strawberries.) Max von Sydow is perfect. He and Ekerot's performance in the confession scene magnificently complements Bergman's masterful dialogue and cinematography. The Seventh Seal unquestionably deserves its status as a masterpiece."

The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, with Ingmar Bergman's use of stark imagery and symbolism enhancing the film's philosophical explorations.

In Bergman's own words \"No form of art goes beyond ordinary consciousness as film does, straight to our emotions, deep into the twilight room of the soul\". Through his art he made many thought provoking movies and The Seventh Seal is one supreme example among others. It is a movie about a knight who plays chess with the death king in order to avoid his own death and win life instead. The setting is medieval Sweden hit by the severe plague. So the knight sees death all around him and takes into a journey with his squire J\u00f6ns to get answers about God and life. He comes across some people like circus group and finds out how they are dealing with death and life, and witch all of them helping him in some way in his quest. In some way he even helps some to survive the death over them. The dialog's in the movie are really good, thought provoking which engages us in our own journey for answers about god and life, if not for long at least for some duration after the movie ends. I like many dialog's but the one I really love is the one when J\u00f6ns tell at almost end of the movie and is \"But feel, to the very end, the triumph of being alive.\" Everything about the movie is very good be it acting, script, music, dialog's but Bergman's direction is astounding. This Bergman classic is a must watch for anyone wanting to enjoy art in its best form."

So hip are the symbols and the abstractions, that the game looked great in cocktail discussions and pickup lines. But a beating heart was always missing.\n\nAnd then, I discovered Olmi.

To create life, Olmi showed that if one is peasant enough to \"cultivate\" Nature into his humble studio, faithful enough to \"sacrifice\" his comfortable concepts for an uncertain hope of a miracle, child enough to \"see\" the blooming colors and patterns of contradictory hues, and artist enough to \"reconcile\" the emerging contradictions into a unifying whole, then not only juicy ideas would organically grow out of the complex whole, but it will be alive in the image of Nature, i.e., on multiple dimensions, just like how a tree is alive to a bee, a bird, a worm, and a human.\n\nOne is a professional surgeon who operates on a created body; the other is an amateur god who creates miniature bodies."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love this film. In my opinion it aims at and successfully displays not only man's fear of death, even when some of the characters believe in an afterlife, but more importantly, man's various emotional and intellectual strong reactions of living life with the great uncertainty of what happens after death, and what's more, the meaning of existence and suffering if there is no God. The sensual squire seems to take the question of life (and death) with an atheistic calmness, while others, particularly the knight, agonize over the absolute senselessness of life if there is not God. It must be remembered that the film takes place in the 14th century during the murderous intensity of the brutal Black Plague, which heightens the question of the meaningfulness or pointlessness of life at all. I think all thinking people, including but certainly not exclusive to Sartre and Camus would enjoy this film. Is life and suffering of any value in what might be a pointless and absurd world. \"To be or not to be\" is really the underlying question here and, just like Hamlet, neither answer is satisfactory."

        "review_detailed_main": "Much like \"Wild Strawberries\", which was released in the same year, both films focus on someone coping with the end of their lifetimes. This movie has a really good concept for a plot, and despite being parodied several times, its plot still seems intriguing today. All it took for me to get interested in the film was by looking up what it was about. There's so much you can do with a plot like this so I was curious what Bergman would do with the film.\n\nAfter a knight named Antonius and his squire return home after fighting in the crusades, he meets Death on a beach who has come to take his life. However, he challenges him to a chess match to thwart him as long as possible since he wants to seek answers on life, death, and God and do one meaningful deed before he dies.\n\nThe chess game that Antonius has with Death is used as a personification of death. Bergman uses it to show how the knight goes through great measures to avoid Death. At one point, Antonius tries to cheat his way out of death by knocking over the chess pieces, but even that doesn't work. However, Death eventually catches up with him in the end. When Death tries to cheat to help himself win, he prevails. Also, Death is a much better player than any of us, and in the end, he always wins. This is another reason why I think that its plot is very good. Bergman makes the most out of this creative plot.\n\nDuring Antonius's search to do a redemptive act, he comes across many people. Many of them tell him their outlooks on life and death. The conversations he has with them are definitely the high point of the film. Their responses are brilliant, interesting, and thought provoking. Each one of them continuously challenges your perceptions of the world around you. Almost every single line is unforgettable and carefully written throughout the film. Its dialogue gives you a lot to think about long after viewing it. On my first viewing, I just tried to get a basic understanding of what happened in the film. On my second viewing, however, I tried to pay more attention to the dialogue, and I liked the film a lot better as a result.\n\nA main aspect of this film is its haunting imagery at some points. The scene when a girl is about to be burned at the stake for supposedly consorting with the devil is one of the grim encounters that Antonius encounters in the film. It's a pretty haunting scene and it lingers with the viewer long after watching it. Another scene is the one where a huge crowd of flagellants interrupt a play of Jof and Mia, and try to convince the crowd that they are doomed. It's very direct in asking controversial and essential questions about the existence of God. Perhaps, the most haunting scene comes at the very end when the film shows a depiction of the Dance of Death. Fortunately, the film doesn't make it too straightforward, and the image at the end gives you a lot to think about long after viewing the film.\n\nSince the film's plot was heavily based on the chess game, I assumed that it was going to be a big part of the film. As I got more into the film, however, I realized that the chess game wasn't going to be in the film that much, and I was right. This may not be necessarily a bad thing for some people, but I was slowly starting to forget about the chess game as the film continued on, and by the time it was introduced for a 2nd time near the 60 minutes mark, I felt like it was being underutilized. It was a little disappointing, because Bergman could have done a lot with it if it was in the movie more. I understand that a lot of the movie should be focused on him trying to do a meaningful deed and the experiences he goes through during the time period. However, Bergman could've easily added roughly 15-20 minutes of the chess game throughout the film.\n\nThe expedition Antonius went through in the film let us know about his questions on life, death, and God. However, I wish that the film informed us a bit more about himself as an individual and how he approaches life. That's not to say that I didn't care at all about him. In fact, his questions opened the film up to some great dialogue. However, that quest did not show us how he approached life on a daily basis. The only scenes which showed a bit of it were the way too brief scenes of him sharing strawberries and milk with Jof, Mia, and her baby. There should've been more scenes like that. J\u00f6ns, Antonius's squire, was a character who was more fully realized. I knew a lot more about him as an individual. As a result, I cared about his fate a lot more.\n\nIn conclusion, this was a pretty good film. The chess game is a really great personification for death, the dialogue is thought-provoking, and it has some haunting imagery which sticks with you long after watching it. However, I was both underwhelmed and disappointed by this film as soon as it started focusing more on J\u00f6ns and the other characters he met rather then him. However, despite what I said, I am a bit interested is some of Bergman's other films, and I'll definitely be checking out more of his films in the future."

Life and death all abound this story.\n\nImages such as death pointing to the netherland remain apart of our culture, as well as the chess game with death. It is for a reason."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Seventh Seal tackles death in a fashion which must have seemed horridly confrontational at the time but now seems too specifically Christian to me. The prince is gripped with existential angst about being unsure if he can meet God or Satan. In the world of the film, neither is there to comfort him; Death is the only sure thing. To some this may seem like a cause for despair, but to me it smacked of forcing the universe into small-minded Western forms. God, Satan, and Death are all names we have ascribed to the general metaphysical mish-mash; even the corpse they meet at the beginning of the movie is only \"dead\" insofar as it is clear from context that it was once a living being but is no more. When it becomes a fertilizer for the grass it will hardly be dead anymore. The judgments we make and feelings we attribute to these things are our own invention. If the prince were Buddhist he'd be handling this subject from quite a different approach.\n\nNevertheless, the imagery of the film still earns it the title of masterpiece. The use of black and white is unlike anything else. A lesser artist would simply cover the screen in blackness when Death arrived on the scene. Bergman knows better how to make a contrast a contrast. Death, in his pitch-black cape, stands in the midst of physical scenery. His whitened face is genuinely spooky. The flagellants and monks are also portrayed with overwhelming boldness. The emotions of the characters are starkly real, very Swedish, and never trip up. The fact that I did not find the philosophy engaging will not stop me from recommending this movie to anyone who wants a chilling and powerful experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Foreign movies can be so cool. Being an 18-year-old film fanatic from America, and trying to rent the best imported movies from the local video store isn't as easy as I wished it would be. Not that foreign titles are hard to find, but you aren't always in the mood to read subtitles through-out a film, no matter how great it is (and I despise dubbing).\n\nIngmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL, a sweeping journey into the last days of Max von Sydow's crusader's life as he tries to find many answers before he is taken away by Death (Bengt Ekerot, in a magnificent performance). Among these questions is the reason behind God's rapidly migrating Black Plague throughout the country. Is it a punishment to the mortals, a comeuppance? von Sydow tries to prolong his life in the film's wittiest scene, by playing a game of chess with Death.\n\nThe medieval landscape is a very romantic quality to this drama, though the dreaded undertones of seriousness keep your feet to the ground. You are always aware that death is around the corner, that the Plague is a serious issue, that people are looking into the skies for answers from a Creator who has supposedly cursed them.\n\nThe film is shot entirely in black and white, which adds a little whimsy into the tale. Especially in the scenes of the beach (it is always interesting and surreal watching a knight admire waves which the viewer familiarizes with surfers and beach bunnies). There are some other cool allegory scenes like Death sawing a man down from a tree as the man tries to escape him. No matter how hard you try, you can never escape death. But the most magnificent scene is the end, where the troupe of passersby seek shelter in a castle and are approached by Death, who takes them to dance upon the hills. Finally, the Black Death has confronted our heroes, and the game of chess is over."

This, and a cluster of films from this era mark one phase of Bergman's inquiries...and probably his best. The film is worth several screenings especially when viewed at a theater. The horror of the young girl suffering false accusations of being with the Devil and consumed by the purging flames is etched in the mind. All the usual iconic symbols are here: Faithfulness, curiosity, innocence, revenge, ignorance, and greed. A must see."

Fate is coming for them, as they live in the time of the plague.\n\nFilm historian Ivan Butler sees elements of horror here (as he does in much of Bergman's work), pointing to the instances of \"death, plague, religious fanaticism, intolerance, torture\" and singling out the scene with Joseph is \"forced at knife point to stand on his head, to climb on the table and dance like a bear.\" How much this is horror and how much it is everyday life in medieval Sweden, I really could not say.\n\nEbert, meanwhile, says this film \"has more in common with the silent film than with the modern films that followed it\", and that \"All of Bergman's mature films, except the comedies, are about his discontent with the ways that God has chosen to reveal himself.\" On that first point, this is decidedly so; Bergman has strong, stark visuals almost needing no sound at all to carry them. As for the latter point, this is an interesting interpretation and I do not know Bergman's work well enough to comment.\n\nI actually first came across this film indirectly, having seen \"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey\" and not being aware of the reference. Next, I came across it in \"Last Action Hero\". Those may not be high culture, but the fact that this film touched such remote genres really gives support to the strength of the work."

When I first saw the piece, I was amazed about how much one filmmaker could make his screenplay and his direction work like sex. The screenplay is dark, I mean, it only as a character called Death in it (literally, Death is death), and it displays the isolation of the Middle Ages just like Larry McMurtry's book, The Last Picture Show, describes the isolation of the 50's. So, how does the direction work? Well, it shows us how human beings cope with death. All the fears and all the hopes of death are dealt with through this fascinating work of genius. Now, don't use the comparison to McMurtry's book to an extreme. I mean, with the circus performers and musicians in this film, the characters are alot more cultural than the awfully horny teens in The Last Picture Show. The isolation is within. Take Jons, the knight, for example. He's trying to escape his own death, which is like escaping humanity. Sonny, from McMurtry's novel, is also trying to escape his life, which goes hand in hand with death. That's where the real epic is in this film, the coping with life and death. A character study at its finest. The direction is dynamic. There's a whole lot of still shots, but then there's a few scenes that are like a 50's style of the D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan. There's also alot of Hitchcockian zooms and pans and close-ups, especially the scene when Death confronts everyone in Jons' castle. Amazing stuff. This is the second greatest movie that I've ever seen and easily one of the most profound. I can't wait to see other works my Ingmar Bergman (especially Fannie and Alexander)."

It doesn't need to use a lot of special effects or anything to achieve this, which I think is something that more movies should do.\n\nThe plot feels very 'loose', as it mostly just follows a group of people around, with the most focus being on the (ex?) crusader who struggles with his fear of death. The square character is super cynical and has some funny banter, which I appreciated.\n\nIt's not a film I'd recommend to most people but the director has piqued my interest, I''ll be checking out more Ingmar Bergman films in the future.\n\n7.5/10."

To sum up, The Seventh Seal has it all, action, love, death, betrayal, thrill, humor. A must!"

The portrayal of death as a tired old man is wonderfully original, the film is beautifully shot and contains some wonderful flashes of humour as well as some extremely poignant moments (such as when the knight claims that, if God does not exist, \"then life is an outrage, an unspeakable outrage\"). A very deep, thought-provoking film."

Wherever I would go I couldn't escape this movie. After reading the comments on this site I decided that I would finally see what this movie is all about. After a long struggle I managed to get my hands on a copy of the excellent DVD. I started by watching the film with the dubbing on. Five minutes into the film I got frustrated and put the original Swedish back on and restarted the movie. After the movie was over I couldn't stop thinking about this movie. Its theme and idea paralleled a struggle in my own life. I love this movie. It is not just another flavor of the week I am praising. It has already joined my top 10. It is so good that I have managed to convince my girlfriend to watch it. She has no taste in movies and this isn't even the kind of movie she would have ever dreamed about watching during any point in her life. Maybe this movie will move her like it did for me and open up the door for her to have a better understanding of the world around her."

Like other films of Bergman that I have seen, this again is a reflection on death and its relevance to life. Taking the context of plague-ridden medieval Europe Bergman discusses various aspects of human existence - religion, happiness, faith, god - against the backdrop of omniscient death. There's really no point in trying to give you the plot summary and stuff like that because this is not about story or characters or drama, it's essentially an illustrative discussion of Bergman's existentialist philosophies and has to be actually seen and absorbed in toto to\n\nbe at all understood in the right perspective. Which is not to say that I claim to understand it completely (I could never feel confident enough to say that about such a magnificently erudite piece) but even the slight glimpses I get of superbly constructed theological questions that Bergman raises through his film are overwhelming enough for this sadly lesser mortal."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Seventh Seal (1957) : Brief Review -\n\nBergman's depressive, Byzantine and intricate speech on ultimatum of Death. Seriously, Ingmar Bergman scores hell of a philosophy every time that i wonder from where did he get those ideas. The Seventh Seal talks about a terrifying issue like Death which we all fear of, and then it also talks about a Human finding the truth behind death and meaning of his life before meeting the ultimatum of death. It's a story about a Knight who meets death and challenges for a Chess game aspiring that he would escape death. But while the game is on he realises the ultimate truth that \"Nobody Escapes Death\" and finds himself fearing to death and asks God to help whom he never believed. The storyline is quite simple purportedly but has lot of deep discoveries about human life and death inside. It is just a matter of not overlooking them. If you overlook them then there is nothing in this film for you, you don't have wait till the end you can easily quit anytime you want. The narrative of the film is very fictitious and set in religious fantasies so there is no need to take it seriously and feel depressed even thought it looks and feels very depressing. Despite the slow screenplay the film doesn't lose it's context and the dialogues are spiritually allegorised. Performances by Bengt Ekerot, Max von Sydow and Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand are notable. Cinematography is of qualifying art nature. Director Ingmar Bergman tried to find out some deatiled and unknown facts of life by providing the theme like ultimatum of death which was a great idea, and somehow he did succeed. The only problem with the film is it is dark toned and intricate which might just cause to lose grip somewhere in the Middle. Apart from that, there's is nothing wrong about The Seventh Seal when it comes to Art cinema so do watch it if such films appeal you.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

Although not perfect, this work succeeds on multiple levels; I found the actors and their characters engaging, the cinematography stunning, the plot, the imagery, and the messages therein worthy of deep consideration. In sum, Bergman gives us a grand treatment of medieval life and existential philosophy. In the hands of a lesser director, the imagery could easily have degenerated into something overplayed and hokey. Instead, we have a subtle movie for the ages."

Bergman mixed up two different centuries: the 11th and the 14th. The 11th century was the time of the Crusades impelled by Urban I; so the knight that comes back from the Crusades can only be placed in the 11th. And the 14th was the century of the plagues in Europe, the plagues that scares so much everybody in the story. Obviously, this is not a mistake; creators can adapt some parts of history because they have a superior artistic mission."

Although I do not understand the language, I found Bergman's tale of religious skepticism, with undoubted echoes of medieval and Renaissance dramas, morality plays and famous western classics such as \"Dr. Faustus\" absolutely riveting. Bergman was the master of the mise-en-scene; his ability to create cinematic pictures using the minimum of cinematic resources was unrivaled. Unlike today's directors of period dramas, he realized that to recreate an historical period was not simply done by spending thousands of dollars on sets and costumes, but rather depended on the selection of individual props and the telling focus on individual images (for example, the horse standing in the background in several scenes, or the moment involving the flagellants singing the \"Dies Irae\"). In terms of cost, the film is low-budget, strongly reminiscent of the B Pictures produced in Britain and the US during the middle part of the twentieth century. In terms of style, however, the film is the work of a genius. I confidently predict it will stand the test of time for another half century to come."

The movie is set during the plague of XIV century and the whole atmosphere is dark and oppressive and leads to a general sense of fear and uncertainty in the people of the time. In this setting everyone has to confront death, both as an idea and as a person. \"The Seventh Seal\" shows a variety of characters that have different faith as far as religion, life and death. There is the one who has a strong faith and thanks to this is able to be less anxious, there is an artist who has a special sensitivity about life and love, there is an atheist who is the most rational and the one who lives more freely than the others and there's the knight who fought in the crusade and at the time in which he has to confront his possible death loses all of his beliefs to became obsessed with the sense of life and what religion is. And his struggles are amplified by the fact that the Church at that time was corrupted and wasn't a real guidance for the believer's souls. The great thing about \"The Seventh Seal\" is that the answers are not definitive because life does not provide them. These important themes are supported by great cinematography, music, choreography and acting making it a very good movie in all of his aspects. \"The Seventh Seal\" is one of the ancestors of the modern cinema and everyone should watch it at least once."

Here we have a range of contrasting figures against a backdrop heavily tinged with death. The knight grapples with the existence of God, his squire is cynical about it all, the actors are just trying to get by, a woman is burned at the stake and the townspeople have a variety of reactions, from the dramatic flagellants to the drunken tavern-goers. All of this takes place in the Middle Ages when meaning has eroded and the Black Death is decimating the country. Overall, the film explores the inevitability of death using stunning visual metaphors and suggests that there are not necessarily any answers to be found about God and death."

After visiting home after years of fighting for an unfounded cause, the knight feels desolate and detached from others and seeks for the light in life that he once had.\n\nThe time at which we pass away will be when we least expect it.

        "review_detailed_main": "50 years have passed since Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\" was released to worldwide critical acclaim. And after 50 years of cinema; how many films have tried to put into debate these same questions that \"The Seventh Seal\" did before. Some of these films have succeeded , others have fallen on their faces flat. But \"The Seventh Seal\" has not aged or it's power diminished a single bit after half a century.\n\nSo what differs \"The Seventh Seal\" from other films in the same category and importance, thus making it great? It lies with Ingmar Bergman. Our story is set in the Middle Ages when the Plague was ravaging across Europe. Two men lie in a beach, a knight and his squire (Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstand), have just returned from the Crusades. They are scarred from the battles and the knight's faith fading. His search for meaning has not come up with an answer as he lies in doubt. Is there really an answer? While the throbbing of the beach waves subside and degrades into silence and Death (Beng Ekerot) is standing in front of the knight. \"I've been at your side a long time\u0085\" remarks Death, as the knight, physically confident yet emotionally and spiritually deprived and frightened, tries to accept his fate. The two shall play a game of chess for the knight's soul. The game continues throughout the film.\n\nBergman has a particularly great talent of representing the world and its characters. And no surprise, The Seventh Seal is filled with many major/minor characters. First of all, the acting troupe comprised of the pleasure-seeker Skat ; and the husband and wife Josef and Mia with their infant Michael. The latter two characters are keenly important to the world of this film; they provide warmth, sanctuary and grace, contrary to The Seventh Seal's cold story. The minor players include Plog , a blacksmith, his wife Lisa , Raval , a seminarist; who sent the knight and his squire to join the Crusades. Raval, a Bergman stereotype of man of God, who is deplorable to the world around him. Also, a witch is included to this big dramatis personae; she casts doubt and anguish to us and especially the knight. And, in my opinion, the most important minor character is the mute girl . She somehow ends up in every scene in The Seventh Seal after her entrance. She remains a big presence (ironically, a presence like Death). This ensemble gives the film a lot more than the original storyline: humor, gentleness, vulgarity and etc. Leaving The Seventh Seal creating its own dynamic setting which we are engulfed into.\n\nGoing back, I suggested that Bergman has a definite answer to the subject of the film: the meaning of life; which has left many critics to many interpretations. But the answer is said plainly in the film; and tragically this response is somewhat fatalistic albeit pessimistic . Almost in a cruel way, Bergman burdens his answer throughout the film until the end. There is no room for sentimentality . Bergman's film and answer is cold, down-to-earth, and truthful . The Seventh Seal is Bergman's fatalistic , to-the-fact revelations hardlined by some of the most stark and beautiful images in the art of cinema. The best example of this is the scene which in the knight goes to church to confess; a hooded figure is standing waiting to receive the knight's anguish. With Gunnar Fischer's black-white, deep-focus cinematography, the knight's faith in God in balance, he pours out his entire soul to the hooded figure, perhaps, waiting for a response from God Himself. In agony, the knight goes as far as telling the figure about the game with Death . The hooded figure in curiosity asks how will he defeat Death. The knight, forthwithingly, tells his strategy. The hooded figure turns to the knight, he is in fact Death himself. No one is there to hear the knight's confession except nothingness, who is Death. From that point onwards, the knight is doomed, and the film has just passed its 25th minute. This is the beauty of the Bergman cinema, his images are as powerful as the story's theme, mostly about the absence of God. These scenes are Bergman masterstrokes, masterstrokes that are one of the most poignant and poetic in the history of cinema, to depict his fatalistic ideals . These scenes of gloom n' doom like the one mentioned lets the audience carry the film's burden even further. But the knight's quest for the meaning of life has not yet been extinguished. Then... he meets a witch about to be burned at the stake, and the knight ironically questions this Devil's servant about the knowledge of God. She tells him to look into her eyes... the knight sees nothing but terror. The witch goes into bragging about her relationship with the Devil, the knight looks down disheartened. As the witch is being burned at the stake, her eyes, the eyes of terror, open up as she fears for her life and with this sight the knight has given up his quest. It turns out the witch was looking at Death. The knight has come to his second dead end, he has tried to talk to God about his search, instead, Death is the one who answers him. Here, the knight tries to talk to Satan but to no avail. Only Death answers yet again this time through the dying witch. It seems Death is the only supernatural force in this world. From the march of the flagellant to the death of one of the minor characters, this scenes of immense poignancy and the meaningless is what makes up the bulk of The Seventh Seal and Bergman's worldy answer. But what about Death, does he know about any saviors? Like a cruel punchline, Death remains ambiguous to us. He remarks, \"I am unknowing\"."

It's an interesting insight to Ingmar Bergman's mind and it is well done but it is also a bit dragged out and IMO not as incredible as the mass of 10/10 reviews would point towards.\n\nIf you historically contextualize it, it is no doubt addressing philosophical questions in a far more open and poetic way than many would dare, all while maintaining a dark & lovely feel buttt it's a little rough watching it in 2018."

He returns home only to find the land savaged by the black death.\n\nThe knight is disillusioned and doubtful in the face of a seemingly absurd world and intensely craves philosophical/spiritual meaning and proof in life.\n\nThough rightly known as a dark film there is quite a bit of humor and wit to this film. But it is essentially laughing at the seeming absurdity of life. Which of course is very dark.\n\nThe film contrasts the existentially tortured knight with a care free and happy group of jesters. And the knight's squire who although aware of philosophical questions chooses to disregard them completely.\n\nDeath is personified in a satisfyingly creepy way. A great performance and look of the Death character.\n\nThe knight plays chess with him, partially for survival but mainly in his quest for answers.\n\nThe game also symbolizes his desperate struggle for meaning.\n\nThe last half/third of the film enters heavily symbolic territory. This is an art film after all.\n\nOne thing I appreciate about Bergman is that he explores deep philosophical questions without making any definitive statements on them. He leaves that to the viewer.\n\nThis may frustrate some but I really like this approach. It respects the audience and stimulates philosophical thought.\n\nThis is not to say the film is without it's messages. It values human connection heavily. In this way it is similar to Wild Strawberries but in a very different way and philosophical territory.\n\nThis film is of course a masterpeice of arthouse cinema and the later third of the film becomes very symbolic and that is what truly makes the film.\n\nIt's very evocative, apocalyptic and enigmatic but there is alot of meaning to dig for in there.\n\nIt elevates the film and increases it's re-watchability.\n\nNow, like Wild Strawberries, this film isn't really about the physical plot. Which may frustrate those who are less perceptive and unfamiliar with art films.\n\nBut to anyone with an appreciation for art films it is quite profound. It has a existential plot ultimately.\n\nThis film came out close to Wild Strawberries and it's fun to contrast the two films.\n\nBut anyhow it is a masterpeice of course that has alot of substance to it.\n\nAnd has a timeless, relevant nature to it."

Travelling with the morose Lord is his cynical, secular squire (an excellent Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand), an actor with the second sight (Nils Poppe) and his small family, and a cuckolded smith and his unfaithful wife. Not a lot happens but the imagery is fascinating and the characters are interesting and well-cast (I watched an English sub-titled version). Despite the profound philosophical tone of the film (notably the ancient conundrum about God's unwillingness to reveal Himself), there are moments of levity - a man hides up a tree only to see Death standing below with a saw, an actor and the smith exchange a barrage of colourful, scatological insults. Although not to everyone's taste, the film is considered a classic by many and is well worth watching (if only to understand the backstory behind the myriad of pop-references to delaying the ultimate departure by playing games with the Reaper)."

What comes as a surprise it that the movie's most iconic image comes in the very first scene; that the philosophical debates take the form of wisecracks; and that Max von Sydow's character is actually among the least interesting in the story. Indeed, with a measure of (deliberate) overplaying, a mediaeval setting and some surprisingly bawdy and direct humour, the film even resembles one of Shakespeare's comedies, albeit an unusually black one. The sub-plot about a group of actors making a play about death, a story within a story, seems especially Shakespearian. I'm not sure this is really a great film, but it manages to be consistently bold and surprisingly entertaining. Even though death, played with superb understatement by Bengt Ekerot, always gets the last laugh."

Not just because our teacher would play it billions of times, but especially because it infected me with existential angst a little earlier than I hoped. It's a film that raises many questions but gives no answer. You could be the earthy and cynic squire; you could be the noble knight always seeking spiritual meaning in life - in the end, the only certainty will be death. Still, the ending feels strangely reassuring for a Bergman film, as if he was trying to convince himself that death is not to be feared but accepted as one inevitable part of life, that the world will keep going on after our time has come.\n\nNot to diminish the value of the visuals, but the film felt almost like a theatre play in the way scenes and dialogues are structured. It's also quite straightforward in meaning, tight in pacing, light in tone and bawdy in humor for a Bergman film. It didn't age particularly well, but is definitely one of his most accessible."

The irony of it all is that like Antonius in the movie everybody knows that death is coming for them and nothing escapes it.\n\nThe strength of the movie lies in its ideology, the dialogues that give words to some of the timeless questions which are deeply buried inside every human.\n\n\"Is it so terribly inconceivable to comprehend God with one's senses?\"\n\n\"Why does He live on in me in a humiliating way despite my wanting to evict Him from my heart?\"\n\nThe movie has a Shakespearean touch to it, like the \"fools\" in Shakespeare's plays Bergman uses the squire and the blacksmith to give comic relief in some scenes of the movie. The dialogues during those scenes are equally witty and sharp as in some of the darker scenes, consider J\u00f6ns description of love.\n\n\"If all is imperfect in this imperfect world, then love is most imperfect in its perfect imperfection.\"\n\nThe use of comedy isn't perfect throughout the movie, the story of blacksmith's wife serves its purpose in plot development but pales in comparison with the main theme of the story. But that doesn't hinder the flow or impact of the story at all.\n\n\"The Seventh Seal\" explores the subject of death and studies it from the perspective of a medieval knight, similar to \"Citizen Kane\" which explores the purpose of life from the perspective of a publishing tycoon."

It's not attend to be critical at anything at all, Just the things that a kid or a simple human being would ask to himself about all the meaning and beyond and death subjects. Would it be challenging? Definitely. But who else could have done it in a better way. Characters are so symbolic and all each represent to a form of human way of thinking and perspective. From a knight crusade to a circus clown they got much different ways of seeing and understand things from whatsoever happen around them to the all philosophical questions in life that would cross our minds. But Bergman is the director that could fit them so perfectly in a frame all together that not only it's so meaningful but still enjoyable to watch every minute of it. you can still watch the movie and enjoy it even if you don't seek a meaning or never questioned things or simply you don't care about these stuff. The plot narrate during medieval period that religions were reigning not only the lands but to more efficiently the thoughts and minds. Where every word of the bishop was absolute and the only salvation were in the hands of church, was there any room to question those things?! Well, You better watch this movie to find out whole."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Seventh Seal (1957), wonderfully written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, is a Swedish film about a lot of things pertaining to BIG questions such as What is God? What is Death? What is the meaning of Life? And other philosophical and theological shizz that comes with it. It is told via a Chess Match between a Knight returning back from the Crusades and Death itself, with the Black Death/Bubonic Plague ravaging the country acting as the backdrop.\n\nAs is the case with allegorical films such as this, one can take away a lot from their perception of reality and their level of consciousness. The film has subtleties as well as in-your-face messages, especially regarding religion. Since the protagonist is on a journey towards his home, we get to see a plethora of people and how they are living under the circumstances they are dealt with along the way and the different types of humans that can exist.\n\nPlenty of characters to keep you interested and thinking, especially since the performances by virtually all of the Actors are top-notch. My top favourites being Max Von Sydow as the Knight, Bengt Ekerot perfection as DEATH, Nils Poppe as the lively artist, and probably my favourite character, Gunnar Bjornstrand as the cynical voice of reason.\n\nThere's a lot of powerful imagery in the film often accompanied by a good score. There are MANY great moments that can hit a person differently. For me, one of the most powerful was when Death says \"I Know Nothing\" and the camera zooms in with Death's eyes correspondingly bulging.\n\nMy takeaway is that people spend too much time trying to understand what God is or who God is or how God works yet they forget to actually LIVE, and living in fear of God is not living. Also, fixating on Death is not the way to go either. Acknowledge those things, yes, but carry on with your own journey while keeping love in your mind, heart and soul. If there is one constant we all can agree on, it's Death... and maybe, just maybe, God is Death. The NOTHINGNESS before everything. The Eternal Darkness. The Dark Divine.\n\nWho knows, I could be way off base here as I have only begun learning. Maybe if I watch this film after several years, my understanding of it would be completely different. Regardless, I would highly recommend this classic film if you are in the mood to ruminate on the big things in life. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it an 8.5/10."

Instead of going quietly into the final night, von Sydow challenges Mr. Ekerot to a game of chess. \"Death\" is in a playful mood, and accepts the contest; if von Sydow wins, he and his friends may avoid the Plague.\n\nDirector Ingmar Bergman had an amazing 1957 (in Sweden, anyway), book-ended with \"Det sjunde inseglet\" (\"The Seventh Seal\") and \"Smultronst\u00e4llet\" (\"Wild Strawberries\").

Still, the former is full of beautifully morbid images, killer camera-work from Bergman and Gunnar Fischer, accompanying a thought-provoking script.

It is up to the viewer himself to make up their own minds to what that is. Personally i believe in the very thing Max von Sydows character is afraid of, \"nothingness\". But as far as the film is concerned isn't death appearing as a person proof of the afterlife? It is not just a bleak film since it has some genuine humor in it. For one i thought the blacksmith was utterly amusing in his acts and dialog. In fact all the characters was amusing in a sense in their own way. So far this is the best Bergman film i have seen. But i have only seen between 5-7 titles thus far."

The film also has a distinct aura that just sucks you in and fills you with this sense of foreboding and dread. I feel it's also one of those rare films that you can enjoy directly or on more intellectual levels.\n\nHowever, for me at least, the film was not exemplary. Perhaps my expectations were too high going in, for after years of hearing film critics rave about The Seventh Seal, truthfully I was a tad disappointed by it. While I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, for some reason it just didn't click with me the way that some other films have. I didn't spend the rest of the night thinking about it. And while I'm sure there is a heck of a lot I missed in my first viewing, I don't feel the need to rewatch it anytime soon. It was good. It made me think. It made me feel things. Once was enough though.\n\nI definitely recommend 'The Seventh Seal' to cinema buffs, however I also recommend going in with more managed expectations. Who knows, maybe 'The Seventh Seal' will be a true revelation for you. It just wasn't for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Thus begins Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece Det sjunde inseglet, or The Seventh Seal if you prefer. A Crusader knight Antonius Block has returned to his home country Sweden with his squire J\u00f6ns to find it ravaged by the plague. Immediately upon their arrival Antonius meets Death and promptly challenges him to a game of chess with his very life as the stakes. From there we follow his journey across the land towards his castle where he believes his lovely wife to be waiting.\n\nThe Seventh Seal is an epic. From the very first scene with Death standing on a rocky beach and sitting across from a disillusioned knight, we enter the realm of myths and legends. The scenes in the movie are somewhat disjointed. We might go from a prolonged scene of travelling actors playing roosters on a stage to a march of flagellants, religious fanatics whipping themselves bloody to earn salvation. Yet they all talk about much of the same thing. Why are we here? And now that we are here, what are we doing with the life given to us?\n\nThe movie also ponders upon the so called silence of God. Why we have to live in uncertainty? Why the requirement for salvation is unquestioning faith? How are we supposed not to fear death when we have no guarantees. Antonius Block struggles with these very questions and the people travelling with him represent the different kinds of answers one might receive. None of them are hundred percent correct. Or perhaps they are, depending on your point of view. The movie lays down the questions and some of the possible answers, but in the end it's up to you.\n\nIt's also a very impressive film visually, especially given the budget. Death, played by Bengt Ekerot, is especially memorable. His figure with a dark cape and a black cowl, almost monk-like in appearance, is one of the definitive images of Death in popular culture. And for a reason. Every scene he and Antonius share together is heavy, filled to the brim, trembling.\n\nThe Seventh Seal was not at all what I expected, but then they so rarely are. Most definitely worth a watch for multitude of reasons, from the imagery to the themes to the story."

The character of Death, and him playing chess with a person which decides whether the person will live or not, is in itself such a fascinating plot which can make quite an interesting film. However, what Bergman has made here is 1.5 hours of random people blabbering nonsense, which is interpreted as an allegorical tale about death, love and what not.\n\nAnd, of course, when nothing in a film makes sense, the intellectual North American movie-critic circle starts hailing it as a masterpiece. It is said to have a very deep meaning, and things like 'we will never know what the director meant by this' are said to emphasise just how stupid the people who hate this film are, they don't understand that the film is 'open to interpretation', that's how deep the film is!"

        "review_title": "Compellingly addresses art's toughest subjects: life, death and God",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Seventh Seal\" is a very literary film, one weighted by philosophical dialogue and thought-churning imagery. Swedish director Ingmar Bergman bravely goes where few filmmakers have ever dared to go in their lifetimes: contemplating death and the existence of God. So few would feel comfortable meditating on such heavy subjects, but Bergman does it uniquely and without coming off as pretentious or preachy.\n\nTaking place in the Middle Ages, this black and white 1957 Swedish film follows the knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) on his way back from the Crusades in the height of Europe's Black Plague. There might not be a grimmer time in history for Bergman's story, perfect for bringing Death in as a character, depicted in his black robe with scythe in hand. Antonius, who sees Death coming for him, challenges him to a game of chess in attempt to prolong his life and get some answers about existence before he dies viewing life as a complete waste.\n\nThe film's language is dense, though not quite Shakespearian. All the characters appear to play a critical role and there are many: Antonius' squire Jons, the happy family of traveling actors, Jof, Mia and their baby Mikael, another actor Jonas Skat and the Blacksmith Plog and his promiscuous wife Lisa. All of these characters' lives are in jeopardy from the plague and each brings something knew to the very fragile and contemplative Antonius. Much of the dialogue speaks directly about life, death and longing for knowledge of God -- there's definitely no surprise that Bergman made his story a play first.\n\nThere are lots of Christian and Medieval Christian tones to the story, with the title coming from a revelation and flagellants whipping themselves in belief that the plague was sent as God's punishment. It's a bleak film with the exception of the young couple with their baby performing musical acts and expressing their love for each other. In Bergman's posed questions about why we exist, it's clear his own thoughts on the answer revolves around love and its mysterious power and eternal optimism.\n\nLight-hearted and comical at times as any good Shakespeare will do, \"The Seventh Seal\" offers multiple avenues for some serious and enthralling discussion. It definitely requires attentive eyes and ears, especially for those not fluent in Swedish, because at times it's nearly impossible to both watch Bergman work as a director and soak in the meaning of the words. It is quite easily one of film's more intellectually stimulating movies."

Early on, the knight finds himself in a chess game with Death, with Block's demise tabled pending the result of the game. This metaphorical backdrop sets the scene for the knight's journey back to his castle. Along the way, he is joined by a set of circus performers, Jof, his wife, and their infant son.\n\nBeautifully shot, the film juxtaposes the bitter cynicism of those long away at war for a cause that seems lost against the fervent belief of the local townsfolk, some or whom are willing to self-flagellate in the hopes of penance against the plague that has befallen the land.\n\nJons the squire steals the show, in his best performance across Bergman's films, and the movie executes excellently on all fronts. Somewhat surprisingly, it deftly mixes humor with resignation and raises profound questions about the meaning of life. It's a film that truly is worth the viewer's time and deserves better stature than a movie notable only as a historical piece."

The plot revolves around a knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), returning home to Sweden to seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), during the Black Plague. The game of chess opens the metaphor: free will vs fate. The chess scenes, which must be said, add a great deal of suspense to the film. In this film, much like most of Bergman's filmography, he explores many existential questions and the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world devoid of warmth.\n\nThe Seventh Seal, which is considered by many to be Ingmar Bergman's greatest film, is the desperate vehicle for a sensitive, introspective, and insightful young man who is confused by the world around him. I really adore Ingmar Bergman's films, they are very deep, littered with symbolism, philosophy and spirituality. In Antonius's perpetual search for answers, he encounters many unique individuals, each have their own outlook on life, and death. The imagery is spellbinding, the wonderful penetrating black-and-white cinematography adds to the relentlessly concentrated internal struggle of the characters, and you can see the stress etched on the face of Antonius Block. Antonius Block knows too well there's a game out there, and the stakes are high. If you stay in the game long enough, you've got to lose. And once you've lost there's no way back, no way at all.\n\nIn essence, the film is an allegory and meditation of life, and death. Maybe Antonius Block knew that God and the Devil are playing a game of tug-of-war game with him. And he never knows which side he will wind up on."

A bold visual poem, beautiful but frightening at the same time, where each viewer is deeply confronted with their own mortality and the search for meaning in life.\n\nIt's not worth asking many questions when the answer is just one, and inevitably painted in black."

It's filled with a number of memorable and impactful scenes, as the indifferent character of Death overhangs the knight's return, and yet it's all colored with a sort of tongue in cheek humor that saves the experience from being cold and bleak. An interesting and engaging movie from start to finish."

        "review_title": "Dance of the Dead",
        "review_detailed_main": "The seventh seal of Ingmar Bergman is a mental exploration and search for perhaps the whole life of a human being, about the existence or non-existence of God and how and what life and death are. A topic that we can say that understanding and finding the answer to it will clarify the general path of a person throughout his life and even the word \"7th seal\", which Bergman chose to name this work, refers to the day of judgment and the end of a person's life. And introduces us to the concept of the film at the very beginning. Also, Ingmar Bergman made this film based on his questions and mental thoughts, and it can be said that he is actually the one who is looking for the truth. A man who put rational, existential, probable, heart and philosophical reasons side by side with his eyes open and reached two opposing beliefs about God. Two beliefs that are completely opposite to each other.\n\nAs Bergman himself says about the content of the film: \"At the time, still very skeptical about religious faith, I put my two opposing beliefs side by side and let each tell the truth in its own way.\"\n\nThe seventh seal is a film ahead of its time from a technical point of view. Bergman's form is a modern form and he uses it to tell a story in the Middle Ages and the Crusades. On the other hand, despite being black and white, the film has a very beautiful visual effect, and its photography and lighting are very professional and excellent. This is especially evident in the dance of death sequence.\n\nThe technical way of using the camera is also absolutely excellent and the same level as the subject of the film. Except for the stunning view of the opening scene, his medieval images are very clear and solid and are made in accordance with the best traditions of cinematic realism.\n\nHe has shown his best ability in the scenes that take place in the privacy of life, that is, Bergman's camera, in its slow and carefree movement, well induces the tension of the environment and brings it to its peak.\n\nThe meaningful state of the faces in contrast with the uncertain realities they see is always tangible and understandable for the viewer. Bergman exaggerates in the presentation of the sun fading scenes, which are very popular and common in Swedish cinema.\n\nBut in showing the inverted robe at the beginning of the picture, which is Alfred Hitchcock's invention, he used a special arrangement that added to the richness of the scene and used this scene in many of his films.\n\nIn this movie, the black cloak of death is very well done. Bergman's editing method in general is to present a regular flow of images to create a visual sequence for the development of each of the successive story plots.\n\nThe plastic symbol of death's skull is shown from a different angle in each shot, and death never has the same movements in its many comings and goings.\n\nThe limited body postures of this character practically makes understanding the meaning of all the scenes difficult. Instead of fully presenting his thoughts throughout the film and creating forced encounters between the characters, Bergman presents parts of his mentality in each incident; At the same time, most of his mentality remains unsaid.\n\nProbably, the seventh seal will be the subject of many contradictory views in the coming years, and like other great intellectual works, its interpretation will be different depending on the mentality and time requirements of its critics."

This is not in any way trying to be disrespectful to the great Ingmar Bergman but this movie appeared simplistically subtle on the theme of the human condition. The artie stuff is there but the result seems to be too static, suggesting it would perhaps be more appropriate on a theatre stage rather than on film. The 10 star awards are rather over-stretching the within reason deserved credits but then again it is a matter of taste, like everything else in life."

Both The seventh seal and Wild strawberries are mediocre movies- not good, not bad. Good ideas, bad execution.\n\nI really appreciate old movies and was excited about exploring Bergman, but his movies only led me to disappointment.\n\nI wish I could say the Seventh Seal is a great movie, but that would be a lie, as it's pretty flawed."

For such a short movie, there were too many characters and I didn't understand why some of them were there or how they contributed to the film.\n\nWhen Death comes for knight Antonius Block, Antonius suggests they play a game of chess. Whilst playing, Antonius shall be kept alive, and if he wins, his life is to be spared. Death allows Antonius to go on his way to do a good deed.\n\nAntonius' squire, J\u00f6ns, travels with Antonius. We meet quite a few people on their journey. There are the travelling entertainers Jof and Mia, and their manager Jonas. There's a young girl whom J\u00f6ns saves from being raped. He insists she travel with him, because he will be needing her when he gets home; hoping his wife would be dead by the time he gets home (!). Then there's a drunk guy named Plog who is looking for his wife Lisa. And all along the way, Death and Antonius keep playing chess.\n\nThere's constant talk of death and the plague, blasphemy and mockery, and the belief of Judgment Day being upon humanity. I found all the talking too much, and actually quite boring. In addition to this, I also found the performances far too theatrical for a film.\n\nThe final 20 minutes made the most sense, and were the most watchable. The film then ends on a thought-provoking note. Unfortunately this was still not enough to redeem the film for me and I will remember 'The Seventh Seal' as a boring film which didn't interest me, 'masterpiece' or not."

Bergman's whip flagellates his homeland (and by extension, Western civilization) and its people (and by extension, Westerners) in the mid-14th century (and by extension, the mid-20th century) after his country sat out the crusade against Satan in WW2. To its eternal discredit, its virulent take on a plethora of points has been proven prophetic, with the virus of insanity that has spread well beyond the faculty lounges at the time of its release. The West has been \"taught\" by biting into the rotten Ham (Hollywood-academia-media) sandwich of nihilism and self-loathing, swallowing it, digesting it, and expelling the Black Death onto the uncontaminated."

Take for example, when Blok is talking with Death: \"No man can live faced with death, knowing that everything's nothingness\". Actually, in practice, 99.999999 % of all people live like that, as they have no way to prove God's existence, which was Blok's \"great dilemma\" in this corny, insufferable thing.\n\nAnd finally 5: Bergman deserves to be with the likes of Ed Wood, Hal Warren (\"Manos\", lol), and other useless directors like him."

I understand some parts of the story, but I guess I did not get the whole thing. Some of the pieces come together in the third act, but other than that, I do not get much out of it. I have nothing against elevated languages, but with an incomplete understanding alongside the slow story and pace, my experience gets pretty dull, unfortunately. Maybe a rewatch will change my mind.\n\nThough beautiful, the slow story, complex dialogue, and cryptic elements of this movie make it a drag.
