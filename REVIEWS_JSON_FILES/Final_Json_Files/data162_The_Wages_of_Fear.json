        "review_detailed_main": "In The Wages of Fear, four men in a remote South American town have the enviable task of transporting a metric buttload (technical term) of nitroglycerin across mountainous roads in poor condition. It's a taut, superbly suspenseful thriller, guided with a steady hand by director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who would go on to direct the classic Diabolique in 1955.\n\nYves Montand, in a rare dramatic role, plays Mario, the ostensible protagonist of our tale. He's been stuck in this backwater for some time, but it costs a lot of money to get out \u2013 plane fares are through the roof, and there's no train, and there's no neighboring village. In short, you're stuck there until you can buy a ticket \u2013 and pay for a passport, of course.\n\nMario spends his days looking for work, wooing tavern worker Linda, and despairing about the lack of work. There's an American oil company in town, but they're no longer hiring. His monotonous lifestyle is interrupted by the arrival of fellow expat Jo (Charles Vanel), a tough-looking older man who quickly wins Mario's favor at the expense of the rest of the men in town.\n\nThe oil company, in fact, has its own problem \u2013 one of their large derricks has exploded, causing a huge oil fire. Company man Bill O'Brien decides to send two trucks loaded with nitro from the town up the mountain to the derrick. (The eventual idea is to set off charges, which will somehow contain or extinguish the fire.) O'Brien has no trouble scaring up volunteers for the task, since the men of the town are largely unemployed. Four men will be selected to take the two trucks. Only one truck is needed; the second is truly just in case there's an accident with the first one. The men will receive $2000 when the work is finished, more than enough to secure passage out of the backwater.\n\nMario and Jo are chosen, as are Mario's roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli) and German expat Bimba (Peter van Eyck). The two trucks depart early in the morning, full of gas and of nitro. Danger awaits.\n\nTheirs is not an easy task. The road is full of ruts. In one place, the wooden deck that trucks use to make a sharp turn up the mountain has been damaged from disuse. It's hot and muggy. And one has to be very, very careful, as even the smallest bump might set the whole shebang off. There's also tension among the four drivers \u2013 Luigi is unhappy that Mario is spending more time with Jo than with him, Mario is unhappy with what he perceives as Jo's cowardice. Bimba seems to get along with everyone, though.\n\nThe whole time I was watching this movie, I was certain not all four were going to make it. I will not spoil what is now a sixty-three-year-old movie, but I was still genuinely surprised by the ending. This ain't no fairy tale or sitcom. This is a movie about desperation, redemption, sacrifice, and comeuppance. It's not necessarily about justice.\n\nThe Wages of Fear is a singularly terrific movie from start to finish, exquisitely shot and expertly written. Its money maker is its tension, something present here in spades. The writing is impeccable; even personality changes make perfect sense within the film's context. There are intricacies within a straightforward plot. This is a must see for lovers of thrillers."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Wages of Fear\" was awarded by unanimous verdict the Grand Prix at 1953 Cannes Film Festival where it won over 27 films, some of which were made by Jacques Tati, Alfred Hitchcock, and Luis Bu\u00f1uel. Cluozot's own screenplay (based a novel by George Arnaud) focuses on four down-and-out European adventurers (Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel) who stuck nearly penniless in a festering town in an unnamed South American country. An oil company need a load of highly dangerous and explosive nitroglycerin to be delivered to a remote well fire 300 miles away burning out of control. The route is through jungles and over crude and treacherous mountains and those men are desperate enough to take the chance. None of these men is heroic or generous, they are in for the money. The four were chosen by the managers of oil company because \"if something happens to them, no one would care, they have nobody to worry about them\". Henri-Georges Clouzot's view on humanity is not particularly optimistic but he finds a way to make a viewer care about disenchanted but desperate characters. Thanks to Clouzot's ability to create not only a gripping action film but a powerful study of failure, the four men will stay for long time in our memory."

        "review_detailed_main": "Georges Arnaud's novel LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR has been filmed twice, by Henri-Georges Clouzot as THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) and by William Friedkin as SORCERER (1977). While both films are worth seeing, the earlier version is the one regarded as a classic, and rightly so. Although SORCERER goes into more detail about the political climate and the various misdeeds that led the four desperate protagonists to the South American hellhole where they accept high-paying but life-risking jobs driving nitroglycerin through treacherous terrain, WAGES... distinguishes the men's personalities better, giving the audience more rooting interest in them. Both films have excellent casts, with charismatic leads in Yves Montand (WAGES...) and Roy Scheider (SORCERER), plus WAGES... also provides feminine charm in the form of beguiling Vera Clouzot as the caf\u00e9 waitress who loves Montand. Both films have tense action sequences as well, but somehow for all the staging and skillful editing, SORCERER's action scenes seem strangely slow, slogging along in the mud just like the protagonists in their less-than-state-of-the-art trucks. Both versions have enough good things in them to be worth a look, but if you only have the time and resources to check out one of them, it's WAGES... that really pays off!"

        "review_title": "One of the greatest movies ever made",
        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is astonishing, a gritty story filmed in an ultra-real style that relies simply on the beauty of lighting and film to achieve its stunning effects. It seems from another world, which in a way, it is. The acting is superb: Montand's Mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, while Charles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest of the cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimba are incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they're all stuck in. Clouzot's directing is flawless - I don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg's early gem, \"The Duel\", but Clouzot's automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I've ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator."

        "review_title": "Macho naturalism extraordinaire",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is an extraordinary movie. From the opening scene showing the squalor of a Latin American town with filth and vultures in the street and naked children begging for food amid the oppressive, fly-stirred heat, to the finale on a winding mountain road, it is just plain fascinating. True, some of the action does not bear close scrutiny. One does not siphon nitroclycerine nor does one avoid potholes or bumps in the road by driving at forty miles per hour. No matter. Let's allow a little license. And the title doesn't entirely make sense because the wages of sin are death, but the wages of those who followed their fear and did not seek to drive a nitroclycerine truck over 300 miles of bad road are life. Again, no matter.\n\nThis is such an original movie, every scene like little or nothing you've ever seen before (and for sure will never see again), that the little inconsistencies and some stretching of what is possible are not important. This is man against nature, man against himself reduced to a simple task. It is life in the raw. One mistake and you are dead.\n\nYves Montand has the lead as Mario, a Frenchman stranded in this god-forsaken town with only one way out: get enough money to pay for airfare. Charles Vanel is the older, tin-horn dandy who ends up with a case of the shakes. Peter Van Eyck is the man with the nerves of steel who finds this little adventure a piece of cake after forced labor in the salt mines for the Nazis. And Folco Lulli is Luigi, the happy, singing baker who hopes to return to Italy with the two thousand dollars they are paying him to drive the nitro-loaded truck.\n\nThis is a film depicting the primitive nature of a macho mentality. There's a lot of posturing. Every event is a potential test of manhood. Status and privilege are flouted. The weak and the poor do not inherit the earth.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzet directs and somehow manages to come up with a work of genius. One wonders how. The story, on the face of it, would seem to belong in the slush pile of a ten-cent pulp fiction mag from the 1930's. The acting is good, very good in places, but not great. The cinematography is straightforward, but nonetheless very effective. It is lean and focused always, showing us what needs to be seen without drawing attention to itself: the invisible style, which is the best. Clouzet's direction is characterized by a vivid depiction of things that we can feel: the mud and filth in the streets, the desperation and the boredom, the cruelty and meanness of men, the oil on their bodies, the singular fact of a ton of nitro in the back seat so that every move is a neuron-exposing adventure. I think that the visceral experience from beginning to end and the fine pacing are the essence of what makes this a great film.\n\nClouzet's wife, Vera Clouzet, plays Linda who first appears scrubbing the floor in an open-air bistro. She is rather extraordinary herself, finely made up and creamy white like a star of the silent film era. She grovels a lot, especially for Mario. She provides the counter-point, the contrast for the testosterone action of the movie.\n\nNo student of film should miss this. It would be like missing Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove or especially The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which it vaguely and strangely resembles. \"La salaire de la peur\" is, regardless of its flaws, one of the best ever made.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)"

Nitroglycerine being transported across the Venezuelan countryside. . .who comes up with this stuff? The remake (Sorcerer) is decent, but doesn't even come close. Outstanding flick."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is richer, tenser, more atmospheric, and in all ways a better film than Clouzot's next one, \"Les Diabolique\" - which is saying a lot. I've never understood why Clouzot isn't more highly regarded. Indeed, for a long time I simply couldn't believe that he wasn't.\n\nOne charge that hangs over his head is misogyny. With regards to \"Les Diabolique\" this is simply ridiculous; with regards to \"The Wages of Fear\", I can see how one could harbour the uncomfortable feeling that there is, perhaps, something in it. But what, really, does the evidence amount to? The fact that one of the heroes is inexcusably cruel to his girlfriend? It's not as if the film endorses this, or invites us to take pleasure in it, or even, for that matter, allows us to. The characters are all flawed, and the film doesn't seek to deny it. It does, however, make an attempt to explain it. That town in the middle of nowhere is, we feel, really in the MIDDLE of nowhere; it must be the dustiest and most demoralising place on Earth. After a while we feel as if we could start kicking someone, just to break the monotony.\n\nThere's no doubt that the initial monotony gives the rest of the film half its strength. William Wyler once said that if you want to surprise or shock an audience the best thing you can do is bore them half to death beforehand - and although I can think of absolutely no reason why this should be so, allowing for a little exaggeration, it's true. The seemingly aimless opening sequences help make every single frame, from the moment the nitro-glycerin is mentioned, electric.\n\nSo much is, in retrospect, amazing. There's the way Clouzot manages to show us the humanity in these seemingly squalid people. (Even the oil magnate, just when we think he's the world's most heartless capitalist, reveals he has a heart with an unexpected remark, and yet the remark doesn't feel at all out of character - it's the kind of masterful characterisation film-goers live for.) Then there's the obstacles these drivers must face. All are memorable; most are so perfectly realised they deserve to be called mythic."

        "review_detailed_main": "My title is not an exaggeration. If you thought OJ Simpson's slow speed chase was insane, you need to change the batteries in your pacemaker and check out \"Wages of Fear\". This 1953 French classic tells the story of a bunch of guys who are stuck in a squalid South American village--a sort of Casablaca-esque purgatory--and will do anything to get out, even if it means getting themselves blown sky high. Slow and lazy for the first half (deliberately), the plot eventually reveals itself to be about a suicide mission to haul a zillion gallons of nitroglycerine across 300 miles of harsh terrain that would make the Coyote & Roadrunner take an early retirement.\n\nYes, nitro is that stuff that you don't want to look at the wrong way or it may send you to the moon. \"Wages of Fear\" ultimately reveals itself to be a gripping character study of how people keep their wits, or come unravelled, when subjected to pure terror... with of course the reward of heaven dangling just out of reach. So again we see this subtle allegory of purgatory, hell and heaven which I'm sure was the intent of director Henri-Georges Clouzot.\n\nAn interesting point of historical note is that when this film was released in the USA, around 15 minutes of its 150 min running time were cut. According to the Criterion mini-documentary \"Censored\", these cuts were largely due to the \"anti-American\" themes (the tyrannical oil corporation that exploits the lives of locals for the sake of a buck) as well as subtle themes of spiritual cynicism (the beautifully poetic \"fence\" monologue which symbolizes the absence of God/afterlife). By today's standards these censored scenes are prime time tv, but back in the 50s this movie was feared by US censors as being godless pinko propaganda. That might put a smirk on your face as you're watching this flick. But definitely look for the full 150ish minute version of this film, not the 130 min censored cut.\n\nBut really, for the entire second half there will be no smirking, only tense gritting of teeth as you watch these rolling nuke trucks inch across the South American jungle. The hazards they encounter, as well as their ingenious attempts to survive them, are extremely creative and expertly filmed with the sort of suspense that would make Hitchcock lose his breath.\n\nContent advisory stuff: There's a scene in the beginning where a fine tarantula specimen gets squashed. After rewinding and rewatching the scene in slo-mo a dozen times, I'm almost certain that our unfortunate arachnid was a fake prop. If anyone knows differently please mention it in a review. The same scene shows a naked woman from behind, at a distance. Later in the film is a scene that shows a topless native woman from a distance--it's very artistic. Language is tame throughout the movie with maybe 1 or 2 instances of \"merde\" (the sh- word). While there is violence, none of it is shown explicitly on camera (some of it is disturbing, though). And unless you're a 1950s American censorship bureaucrat, there's nothing politically incendiary other than the notion that the almighty dollar is the root of much misery.\n\n\"Wages of Fear\" is a well crafted, poetic, suspenseful film that certainly deserves its classic status in the history of cinema. Not unlike the classic Bogart/Lupino film \"They Drive by Night\" (1940), this film proves that a seemingly simple story about a bunch of truck drivers can really get your gears going."

Its only distinguishing feature being an American oilfield some distance away from the village. But then an accident causes a fire to spread into the oil and the only way to stop it is to literally blow it out. With nitroglycerin. The only problem being that they don't have the safety equipment needed to transport the nitro from the village. But \"luckily\" such villages have no shortage of men at the end of their ropes, willing to do anything for a final paycheck.\n\nAnd that's essentially The Wages of Fear in a nutshell. It's about human desperation and about ever-mounting stakes as the tension keeps rising and rising. Every little tremor or stone on the road could send all four men into the sky in a fiery explosion of primordial forces. And even though you're safely hunkered on your coach, behind the reality line of a TV screen, you can't help but sweat in anguish alongside these men. The film is that well shot.\n\nThat being said, it takes its sweet time getting there. The first portion of the film is spent getting to know the village and these four wretched souls. And while they are interesting personalities, played by talented actors, it still drags quite a bit. And that's partly because at that point you don't have much of an idea where the film is going. Most of the loose threads get tied up towards the end, but a good half of the film is a jumbled mess.\n\nBut that other part where they're actually transporting the explosives is so good that it more than makes up for the weaker first half.

In any event, one can only guess at what this might have been like when it first came out. Yes, there were some interesting underlying ideas and some scenes that held your attention, but at this point I would go against my usual feeling and say that there needs to be a remake and since there is one, I will now try to find Sorcerer to see what that's like."

However, the money is very good and their current situation in the town is rather dire - they will do anything to improve their situation.\n\nGreat thriller-drama by French director HG Clouzot. Starts slowly and even once the hazardous journey is in progress, it doesn't seem that brilliant. However, Clouzot builds the tension and from a point it is absolutely nail-biting stuff. The scene with the boulder has to be one of the most tense movie scenes I've watched in my life.\n\nA good character-drama too - the way the characters develop and the relationships between the four change adds a new dimension to the drama and makes for very engaging viewing.\n\nNot perfect though. Some events and plot devices don't make much sense, though aren't crucial to the movie. The ending felt quite silly and contrived. A similar result but with a more plausible, less predictable, less stupid way of getting there would have seen the movie get a perfect score."

        "review_detailed_main": "Four unsavory down-and-outs whiling away their hours in a poverty-stricken South American village accept the fool's errand of transporting two truckloads of nitroglycerin across terrible roads to an oil company accident site. Once some preliminary character development is disposed of and the men are on their way, the movie settles into one hell of a nail-biter, sort of a French, 1950s inversion of \"Speed\" -- if they go too fast, or make one false move, they go up in flames.\n\nThe first hour of \"The Wages of Fear\" is a marvel of production design. Director Clouzot packs his frame with things to look at, and the village, though built specifically for the movie, reeks of authenticity. The mise-en-scene alone is fascinating to watch -- some incidental action going on in the background of one shot (like a hothead smacking his girlfriend) is then picked up as the principal action in the next scene. And the Blu-Ray looks terrific; every mud puddle and heat-dazed fly is clear as a bell.\n\nThe second half of the film is pure suspense. It's a study in male machismo and one-upsmanship. The oldest member of the group, who struts around like Mr. Big Shot in the town when he has nothing to fear, crumples like a baby when faced with the prospect of death for real. But the movie doesn't let us be disdainful of him. As he says at one point, he's scared because he has enough life experience to know what death is, unlike the young hotshots who think to be frightened is to be weak.\n\nClouzot doesn't seem to have a rosy outlook on life, if the film's fatalistic ending is any indication. Or maybe he's just making the point that life is futile for men who approach it in a certain way.\n\n\"The Wages of Fear\" feels way ahead of its time, both in style and substance. I had trouble believing that it was actually made in 1953.\n\nGrade: A"

        "review_detailed_main": "A 4K-restoration screening in the Shanghai International Film Festival, Clouzot's pi\u00e8ce-de-r\u00e9sistance is a vehement testimonial of his aptitude in orchestrating white-knuckle thrills and chills, meanwhile, it is also a scorching dissection of human's abject fear and cruelty. Set up in the boondocks of Las Piedras, allegedly Venezuela, a posse of foreign deadbeats is vegetating under the blistering sun, jobless and hankering for a plane ticket to leave the purgatory, they are churlish opportunists and rowdy bar brawlers, among them stands the French ladies' man Mario (a sexpot Montand), who toys with the affection of the barmy barmaid Linda (Mme Clouzot in her film debut), and has no qualms about jilting his benevolent Italian roommate Luigi (Lulli, truly the salt-of-the-earth type), to hobnob with his blow-in compatriot, the ex-gangster Jo (Vanel), fancying an easy way out, but the truth is, Jo is also at the end of his rope.\n\nA perilous job opportunity emerges when the American corporation Southern Oil Company needs to transport nitroglycerin to extinguish a massive fire in the oil fields, four drivers are chosen to drive two trucks in conveyance of the highly explosive products in a 300-mile rugged haul, with no safety precautions at hand The sideswipe of American capitalistic avarice and callousness is pretty much in your face, yet, for these hardscrabble expatriates, $2,000 is an offer too tempting to refuse, after some backhanded maneuver Jo gets the last spot to drive with Mario, while Luigi is paired with Bimba (Van Eyck, stolid and unbelievably cool), a taciturn German who endures a dark past.\n\nHenceforth, Clouzot viz. the Gallic Hitchcock takes audience on an ensorceling edge-of-the-seat road trip where one single substantial bump can cause their trucks to be blown up to smithereens, like a ticking bomb hanging over our heads. Compelling set pieces, a gripping turn on the precipice, and detonating an obstructing rock, one mobile, one static, are textbook paragon of tension-building and suspense-eliciting, not to mention the effect graced by Georges Auric's captivating accidental music.\n\nHowever, physical obstacles aside, it is the mental exertion that takes a heavy toll en route, Jo, the hard-nosed, savvy spiv, gradually yields to the mounting fear and his cowardice starts to turn Mario from his toady to a hectoring boss, sending contempt and verbal abuse to a humiliated Jo, up to a merciless last-ditch attempt knowingly leaving him mortally wounded, here Clouzot's astutely differentiates true grit from Dutch courage, and examines the phallocratic pride with utter acumen, its reverberations is astounding, much also owing to the two protagonists' unyielding tours-de-force, especially Vanel, completely devotes himself to the grueling condition (that petrol wallowing sequence is awestruck), and more credibly, he tenaciously enlivens Jo's transformation from a despicable wide boy to a resigned old geezer, for whose aftermath we feel deeply sympathetic.\n\nOur compassion towards Montand's Mario also undergoes a sea change when the plot thickens, his raffish charm morphs into an admirable determination midway, until his ruthless color takes the upper hand, Montand perfectly showcases his marquee idol charisma, and his baptism-of-fire triumph is unqualifiedly hard-earned, but Clouzet ratchets up the morbid irony in its dizzy ending, as augured by its opening, the quartet's fate is hanging on the same thread, negligible, expendable and inescapable.\n\nIncontrovertibly, THE WAGES OF FEAR is a daunting progenitor for late comers to emulate but impossibly to surpass, denotes a hefty import of Clouzot's unrivaled cinematic legacy, that reinvented narrative cinema with its high-octane vicariousness."

It's excellent and, frankly, a far more interesting movie than this one.\n\nThat is not to say Wages Of Fear is not without merit. It's just that most of the first hour of this film is wasted. It has little meaning. At least in the 1980 version, it showed how four men from around the world got to where they were and why they took the chance they did. here, even tough the pre-journey intro is much longer, it's vague with too many scenes that mean nothing. Once the action starts - the two-truck, nitroglycerin-filled 300-mile trip through rugged terrain - this is an interesting film as well. Then it paints a better picture of the personalities of the four men while keeping good suspense. That general suspense story is the same in both movies but the obstacles along the way of the treacherous journey are different and the fate of the men a bit different.\n\nThere is some excellent black-and white cinematography in this film and a big reason for me to see it again, this time on DVD. However, I might skip some of that first hour."

Of course, its hugely extended set-pieces aren't the only thing that make the movie great. There's a surprising amount of solid character work, especially when it comes to one particular character who ends up revealing himself to be the total opposite of what he is initially set up to be. It's a remarkable transition and it showcases some really solid acting skills (you've never seen anyone act scared until you've seen this). After a relatively slow opening that makes a point of portraying the lacklustre employment prospects of the town that our unconventional characters are stuck in, the piece kicks into gear and gets a handful of its players started on a journey that turns every bump in the road, every shift in suspension, every pebble in their path into deadly obstacles. This situation is milked for all it's worth; it grips you and never lets you go, forcing your heart into your mouth more times than you can count. It's soaked in dread, too. The film is definitely one of the - if not the - most suspenseful that I've ever seen. Frankly, it's a masterpiece. Though its first half is fairly slow, nowhere near as compelling as its second and showcases a couple of major characters who display some blatant sexism and racism, the affair is ultimately an affecting and memorable thrill ride. It's one of the best of its kind. 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Henri-Georges Clouzot is probably most famous for his atmospheric mystery drama 'Les Diaboliques', but just as good is this film; Wages of Fear. The film gives a commentary on the things that people will do for money, and it follows a treacherous journey across South America for two two-men teams of truckers transporting nitroglycerine across the continent for an American oil company, on the promise of $2000 when they reach their destination. The men taking this task on know very well what the risks are, but they decide to do it anyway just because they need the dough. Rather than just feeding us this premise, however, the great maestro has opted to make sure that we fully understand the situation that our protagonists are in. The first hour of the film just sees the main characters in their native village, scrimping and slowly killing themselves just to make enough money to live on. These guys have to drink lemonade when they go to their local drinking establishment, and this image of themselves is putting them on the back foot further still, as no one in the town will employ the people that they see as tramps. This back building gives the audience something that the main crux of the story wouldn't have otherwise; and that's understanding from the audience.\n\nOnce the action starts properly, Clouzot really lets rips with his awesome directorial talent. Like he did with Les Diaboliques two years later; he really shows that he knows the meaning of suspense. The nitroglycerine loaded trucks in the movie could explode with the slightest vibration, and once again Clouzot makes sure that you understand the situation. The movie firmly balances itself on a short string, and any minute the leads could go up in flames; which gives the action a very potent degree of tension and suspense at all times, even when there isn't all that much going on. There are some very good stunts in the movie, however, and things such as the oil lake and the huge boulder in the middle of the road represent the best of them. The characters are both well introduced and well rounded, and Clouzot has given each of the four main men in the film their own distinctive character and because of the extensive situation building that the director gave us towards the start of the movie, we always care for them; which helps the movie no end when it comes to the more touching moments of the story. On the whole, this is a GREAT motion picture. It's a lesson in suspense and it's a film that anyone who considers themselves to be a fan of thrillers should see."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you want to talk about a film that is exceptionally dark for its time then look no further than The Wages of Fear. The film follows four men in a desolate South American village who are strapped for cash and will do almost anything. They agree to transport a shipment of nitroglycerin by truck across the rugged terrain of Central America. The catch is that nitroglycerin is an extremely dangerous substance that has to be handled with extreme caution. Thus one bad bump in the road could be the end for these men. Along the way then encounter all sorts of obstacles, including each other. But they have no choice but to press on, desperate for the money that awaits them at the end of their treacherous journey.\n\nThe Wages of Fear captures what true suspense is all about. The film is full of incredibly high tension scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat in stomach churning anxiety. You feel every drop of anguish the characters feel as they run into obstacle after obstacle, growing more and more tired and frustrated with their circumstances. The tension amongst the group mixed with the tension of the situations these men get themselves into makes the suspense almost unbearable but wildly exciting. This film engages its audience so fantastically. You feel a part of you amongst the action as the film draws you further and further into the riveting suspense this film delivers. I don't remember the last time I was this engaged in a film and was so anxious about what could happen. The gravity of the film is so immense as it forces its fear upon you so unapologetically powerful.\n\nBut of course it gets better. Not only is The Wages of Fear an riveting suspense film, it is also an intense character study. We have four characters transporting the nitroglycerin, Mario, Jo, Luigi, Bimba. Each of the men have a unique personality and different ideas about this job. Some are desperate for the cash and will stop at nothing, even if it means risking not just their life, but everyone else's as well. Then there are those who would rather give up when things become too harrowing and too risky. The clashing of these two ideas create some intense scenes of psychological anguish. The ironic thing is that these four characters begin the film as friends, but the journey transforms them and turns them against each other in thrilling and disturbing ways. The film has a fantastic script which examines these things intensely and eloquently. It is a truly brilliant cinematic feat.\n\nThe film works so well as a character study, while also being an incredibly intense film full of riveting suspense. The combination of these two elements is done so perfectly, neither one taking over the other. Instead they blend beautifully, making an astoundingly powerful film. I wouldn't hesitate to call this film a masterpiece, so I will. The Wages of Fear is a masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Le Salaire de le Peur\" (\"The Wages of Fear\") is a harrowing journey of four men going down in bumpy roads, miserable places, won over by the most difficult obstacles, a long way performing their jobs transporting a great load of dynamite to be used on a burning oil well. It's a job, it pays well, those guys are the best in it but it's a hard, dangerous and exhausting service that can cost their lives. All the way, almost like descending to hell. This is the road to hell. It's a story about the battle between courage and cowardice and how fear can take over even the bravest of souls. This is Henri-Georges Clouzot masterpiece along with the equally brilliant \"Les Diaboliques\", both featuring a tension that rises into an endless crescent that never leaves you at ease.\n\nI saw \"Sorcerer\" (the American remake), read Georges Arnaud's novel and watched this film. To me, they all stand on the same level. They're incredibly good, very exciting but they're not great. Arnaud focus more on the mission's perils rather than the characters and sometimes the story doesn't turn to other interesting possibilities; neither Clouzot or Friedkin films are the book, lacking of some of its good ideas but developing some new ones.\"Sorcerer\" is an adventure about mercenaries looking for money and thrilling experiences while \"The Wages of Fear\" is a human drama about desperate people risking their lives to earn a living in the only possible way, and therefore more realistic than its remake.\n\nBut Clouzot is a master in creating scary and real danger at practically every frame. A bar fight against local power man; the training closely observed by their patrons with conductors sabotaging each other; a truck making a difficult turn in a place that threats to collapse at any moment; the fear in the drivers eyes and hands, maneuvering as if each turn could be the last. The director delivers one of the most inspired and frightening moments of all time (not present in the book) when a giant stone stands on their way and the solution found to remove it to use part of the explosives. Heart couldn't handle very well that scene so perfectly made, with no soundtrack, very few dialogs and a constant action. And you relate very easily with the characters struggle, amazingly performed by Yves Montand (and I could never imagine him in such role, one of his earliest), Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck and Folco Lulli, similar in being all afraid of what they're doing but their fears are expressed in many different ways. Some panic, some control it, others disguise from time to time trying to look adventurous.\n\nThe difficulties I had with this were the erratic and long introduction of each character, too many humored bits that weren't so effective (those could have been easily trimmed down) and the ending - not in the sense of being a let down but its goofy presentation seems awkward. The treatment given to the theme, the heart of the matter which is their mission and the rest (even the romance involving Montand and the girl, which is slightly distractive but useful) achieves a positive result. Certainly a movie of a different level and exciting even today. 21st Century flicks can only aspire to be something like this. Call me crazy, but Hollywood can even try again with a remake but this time read the novel, make wise choices and you might reach something similar or better. There's themes that can be explored in a very interesting way to make it a more challengeable film and adventurous. 9/10"

The action takes place around the four drivers who in two trucks transporting nitroglycerin at a great distance through the South American jungle, but the roads are full of potholes and obstacles which is very problematic because their cargo is very sensitive and can explode at the slightest impact.\n\nIn the first third of the film develops the somewhat perverse drama in an isolated town where poverty is visible at every step. This part creates the necessary atmosphere and character development. Relationship between the protagonists are not explained. Each one acts on impulse and in their own way to cope with the agony brought by poverty and unemployment. As rescue appears cruel form of economic and corporate imperialism.\n\nOn one side is a fear and hostility by the local population (cheap labor) to the oil company. For Europeans who live there, jobs, no matter how dangerous it was, the rescue or escape from the everyday agony. Then comes the sudden turn in a story that gets qualities of existential and adventurous thriller.\n\nExcitement, tension, danger and ice uncertainty.\n\nThis is a strange blend of action and human reactions. The path of salvation through a nightmare. This approach awakens the worst and the best in man. The lack of sentimentality has contributed to the reality of the experience. This is a harsh struggle for survival.\n\nI wondered whether the protagonists actually brave, or just desperate and hopeless. End of the film did not need to be so ironic. Well, probably it was a low blow to the Hollywood thriller.\n\nYves Montand as Mario is brave and ruthless character. In the end, his madness cost him life. Charles Vanel as Jo is a former gangster at all costs trying to flee the city. It's too dangerous to work and quite a coward when push comes to shove. I would not say that his life is more valuable. Peter van Eyck as Bimba is a character who does not have a specific goal in life. If he survives the accident would not have known what later. Very resourceful character in desperate situations. Folco Lulli as Luigi is diligent and cheerful man. He is faced with disease and in dangerous job offer see only salvation. V\u00e9ra Clouzot as Linda is incredibly beautiful and pretty maid. A faithful lover. Enjoy the woman while she cleans floors is humiliating, but this scene is the responsibility of the atmosphere and theme of the film.\n\nEvery little bump, blow or elevated tone in this film stops the heart."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film runs along the traditional template of any story - a beginning, which unhurriedly and deliberately sets the scene, a middle section that carries the plotline, and a brief ending that resolves everything to no one's satisfaction. The beginning paints a picture of a world unimaginable to anyone from a developed country, of corruption, poverty, and oppression. It simultaneously describes the main characters - a bunch of immigrants who have strayed to this miserable little town, and for whom there is little chance of escape from the baking heat and unemployment. There is Mario, the happy-go-lucky scrounger, Luigi, his hard-working Italian pal, the comically tyranical tavern owner, his much abused maid, and Jo, the suave and dangerous French gangster. Homosexuality, racism, and the oppression of women figure prominently, but are never commented upon directly, as various prison motifs are evident in the lighting and set construction. Suddnly there is a change - a way out for a 'lucky' four of the deadbeats. There has been an explosion at an oil well on the other side of the mountain. The oil company needs to put out the fire with explosives, which are stored in the town. But its nitro-glycerine, and there is no time to get specially-fitted trucks to carry it over the rough mountains roads. Rather than risk their own employees, the oil company offers a large reward to four volunteers. Cue the action as first the men compete for the places on the two trucks, then as the winners embark on their terrifying journey, where every bump could spell instant death. On the journey their true characters emerge. One, Jo, is broken by the ordeal, but is eventually redeemed. 'How exciting could a simple road trip be?' you might ask, but the one and a half hour screen journey is petrifyingly spellbinding. Fate seems to be stacked against these bedraggled heroes, but it is their ingenuity, effort and bravery which captures our hearts. I won't reveal the details or the ending, which is tragic and some say its only flaw. It's in black and white, and mostly in French, but it will never be old-fashioned. The best film I have ever seen - and I've seen a few."

To start with the 39- minute first act is quite hard to follow, especially for a Spanish- speaking person like me: in the novel the action takes place in Guatemala (Central America) , but where does this movie take place, where is this place called Las Piedras that by 1953 still has creoles talking with Spaniards' accents, where indigenous dress as Andean people or undress like Amazonian tribes? The closest town to Las Piedras seems to be Caracas (capital of Venezuela, South America) as seen in a sign of plane fares, or it could be Tegucigalpa (capital of Honduras, Central America) according to a dialog: you take your pick. All this mishmash is possible, yes, but at least I could not deal with the endless parade of offensive \"Latino\" stereotypes, from the taxi driver who stops his car precisely in the middle of a mud pond, the barefoot venal black immigrant officer or the sweaty and greasy owner of \"El Corsario Negro\". Then take act two, which as Georges Arnaud's novel is also the weakest dramatic section of the movie, since the characters have been well established in the first act. So this is mainly a block of action sequences in which the nitroglycerin-loaded trucks go from one obstacle to the next, to reach their goal, the oil field in flames. Admittedly a couple of the pieces are real gems (the long sequence of the rotten-wood platform or the solution to take a huge boulder out of the road), but it is just that, a chain of obstructions and how to deal with them. The last act centers on the persistence of the two surviving truck drivers, leading to a surprise ending that seems too moralistic after everything we have seen before, when all the characters we have seen since the beginning deserve a similar conclusion. As for the critic of American companies in foreign lands, today that is no news and it can also be said of European and Asian enterprises in those alien territories, as well as the local companies: they all give similar ruthless treatment to workers (and the land itself). This is the kind of commercial \"macho movie\" that asks for a remake among the action film crowd. There have been a couple of those and a few imitations, the more remarkable being William Friedkin's \u00abSorcerer\u00bb (1977), in which he wisely reduced the running time from the original 142 minutes to 121."

It is in second half of the film that we witness a flurry of meaningful action.It is quite odd but due to heavy masculine presence Clouzot decided not to have much room for female characters except for a sensual role played by his wife Vera Clouzot.It is a true fact that before this film human misery,desperation and hopelessness were never shown in such vivid details as shown in this film.The sadness depicted in Wages of fear can still be felt in our contemporary world."

Here, he broaches a new topic for him: the adventure movie with \"le salaire de la peur\" (1953) and this is a stunning movie.\n\nYou can divide the movie into two obvious parts. The first one focuses on this bunch of men who lives in this Mexican small town cut disconnected from the world, even the time. If this part is a little uninteresting (but essential in the way that Clouzot emphasizes on their boredom and the mission to carry nitroglyc\u00e9rine with trucks to an oil well is an unexpected opportunity for them), on the other hand, the second part justifies the vision of the movie. When the four men have accepted the mission, they aren't out of the woods: there are a lot of dangerous situations where death can arrive at any moment. Clouzot manages to maintain the interest thanks to an asset whose he is the master: the suspense.\n\nA brilliant and absorbing movie still just as good as it was more than fifty years ago."

Given his background as a singer, his performance is almost uncanny. The story is strong, compelling, simple yet profound. Men risk their lives and nobody really cares. Men reduced to scrounging will do just about anything to make a buck. This movie is about every deck hand, lineman, truck driver, construction worker and blue collar worker on this planet who makes a living by doing the hard, dirty, dangerous work that society still demands. Somebody has to do it. Four thousand years ago workers were hauling and lifting huge blocks of stones to build temples; the same work is being done today. These workers are taken for granted, forgotten until they are needed and then they are heroes, for the moment. This movie is a tribute to the courage of those whose work puts them in harms' way. This movie should be recognized for what it is: a director's personal statement about the condition of mankind, divided along class lines, the exploiters and the exploited, the indifference to human life in the quest for profits and how there are always those who come forward and do the heavy lifting, even when they know that they may not survive."

        "review_detailed_main": "Splendid and famous movie by Henry-Georges Clouzot and remade by William Friedkin as \u00a8Sorcerer\u00a8 in 1977 . Dealing with four distressed men (Yves Montand , Charles Vanel , Folco Lulli , Peter Van Eyck) who undertake a risked journey throughout the Amazon jungle by transporting a hazardous cargo . As an American company : \u00a8Southern Oil Company\u00a8 controls a desolate Central American town whose citizens desperately want money to live , so desperately that four are willing to attempt a suicide mission to deliver nitroglycerine to put out a well-fire raging 300 miles away . As the company's cynical head has offered 2000 dollars to each man , enough to finance theit getaway from the hell-hole they live in .\n\nExciting and thrilling movie which so entrapped us in following the misfortunes of the four men desperate enough to undertake a suicidal journey with a cargo of nitroglycerine along the dangerous jungle and cliffside roads . Multi-dimensional , twisted and complex drama concentrates on character development for the first half . The film contains nail-biting scenes as the cliff frames when a truck is hooked or the petroleum hole , crucial to the movie's greatness . Main role is grittily played by Yves Montand giving a wonderful acting . The remainder of the roles remain perfectly developed such as Charles Vanel , Folco Lulli , Peter Van Eyck and special appearance by Vera Clouzot , George Clouzot's wife .\n\nIt packs a strirring and moving musical score by Georges Auric . As well as evocative and atmospheric black/white cinematography shot on location by cameraman Armand Thirard and in a finely restored version . The motion picture based on a novel written by Georges Arnaud was competently directed by Henry Georges Clouzot . He started his film career as a screenwriter and then Henri-Georges Clouzot switched over to directing in 1942 with Tout pour l'amour and The Murderer Lives at Number 21 . His films are typically relentless suspense thrillers , similar to Alfred Hitchcock's but with far less light relief . He had the distinction of having his film The craven (1943) prohibited by both the German forces occupying France and the Free French forces fighting them, but for different reasons . He shot to international fame with Jenny Lamour (1947) and especially Wages of fear (1953) and consolidated that success with other films as Race for Life (1956) , Les espions (1957) , La prisonni\u00e8re (1968) . He beat Alfred Hitchcock in buying the rights to \"Les Diaboliques\"(1955) with a margin of just a few hours , but continuous ill health caused large gaps in his output , and several projects had to be abandoned until his death . Rating : 7.5/10 . Better than average . And it had a good remake by William Friedkin with Roy Scheider , Bruno Cremer , Francisco Rabal and Amidou."

        "review_detailed_main": "In order to earn $ 2000, four men have to navigate two trucks loaded with nitroglycerin through a grueling terrain. Mistakes mean sudden death by explosion. It almost sounds like a modern reality TV concept, and yes, it's a great premise for a 1953 movie. The location (French Guyana, I suppose, but it could also be Venezuela) is fresh. In many ways, \"Le Salaire\" is a road and action movie avant la lettre. But someone has to take a stand and say it: this movie is terribly dated.\n\nWhy is it dated? For one, the pacing is off. The movie drags and is about 40 minutes too long (and then I liked the long intro!). Second, the tension isn't managed up to modern standards. Clouzot is a great and innovative director, but many scenes are lacking in execution - you can often tell from a mile away what is going to happen. Third, it lacks appealing visuals. Many 40s and 50s movies have great black and white photography, but not this one, except some nice images towards the end.\n\nFinally, I thought the characters were poorly done. Yes, they are macho, and they are MEN. But we've known for a while that men like this don't really exist, something Humphrey Bogart had already found out in '42. \"Le Salaire\" is vaguely similar to \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", but while the latter excels in showing the dark side of humanity through evocative dialogue and timeless conflicts, the characters here left me utterly cold. Sorry."

Perhaps I don't like to stretch myself as much as I should. I approached this film with trepidation. From the first second of this film I was absolutely absorbed into the world it created - a world dominated by desperate men from disparate cultures trapped in a sordid backwater. Without money, passports and marketable skills, they spend their time indulging in drunkenness, indifferent sex and mindless violence until they are offered an escape through a trial by fire, survivor takes all and the chances of survival are slim indeed. Wages of Fear provides the ultimate in suspense, character development, physical and psychological action. It is a visual masterpiece, not because of the beauty it displays but because of the complexity, depth and darkness of the world it portrays. It reminds me so much of Treasure of the Sierra Madres, an examination of courage and character under the most dire circumstances. A wonderful feature of this film -- there is absolutely no background music which increases the reality and suspense because the viewer cannot anticipate the action. You get to sweat and tremble along with the characters as they drive over washboard roads and crumbling mountain paths. The acting is superb, and this from a person who has in the past dismissed Yves Montand as a frivolous song and dance man. Highly recommended."

A perfectly crafted short little sequence that explains their relationship and perhaps Mario's attitude toward women in general better than pages of prose ever could. But the movie is really about the struggle for existence in an unforgiving world where any display of cowardice costs your claim to manhood, and as such, the action and suspense scenes are among the most finely crafted in cinema history. If you're a fan of international cinema, SEE THIS FILM!! BTW, the Criterion Collection edition is first-rate."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has a huge reputation, larger than it deserves, in fact. First of all, everyone likes and admires Clouzot as a director. Secondly, there has been a lot of affectionate admiration for Yves Montand over the decades. So the reverence shown to this particular film has been tinted with the rosy view of retrospection and skewed in favour of 'good old Clouzot' and 'good old Yves'. But the performance of the young Yves Montand in this film, while good, is not in any way remarkable, and the part could have been played just as well by any fifty other actors. In other words, the reputation of this film has been artificially inflated. In actuality, it is far inferior to many of Clouzot's other films. It is difficult to know why Clouzot even wanted to make such a strange and stressful film. It is extremely painful to watch, for almost every minute of screen time, and it is never enjoyable. Surely we all have enough problems in our lives without having to worry about people being blown up by nitroglycerine which they are driving in large trucks on pot-holed roads in a desert. Yes, the film has various creative shots and sequences: the shot where Montand jumps down onto some loose soil and it sprays all over the camera, the sequence of the waltz scene in the seedy bar near the end, especially as intercut with Montand's joyous driving antics. Those things are all touches of the master. But \u0085 and I repeat, but \u0085 but. WHY?? Once again I raise the question which I raise in numerous reviews of films by many directors who make needlessly unpleasant films: why would the director want to make this film? Surely some more worthwhile subject and project could have been chosen for that year of Clouzot's life. Why do directors time and again, apparently for reasons of vanity or perverted notions, make really disgusting films? Everyone in this film except for the pathetic simple-minded maid in the seedy bar is horrible and disgusting, lacking in any positive qualities of any kind. Not one has an iota of compassion or concern for anyone but himself, and most of them are greedy, selfish, violent, criminal, and utterly revolting. A great subject for a movie, then! The film is set in a kind of 'nowhere', which might be Mexico or might be Venezuela, in any case, a country where the rapacious American oil company called 'Southern Oil Company' drills for oil at the cost of the lives of the locals, many of whom are killed in the most horrible accidents, and no one gives a damn. The setting is so grim and forlorn that it is a real wrist-slasher of an experience just to see it on film. Everybody is starving, everybody is penniless, everybody is exploited, everybody is miserable. What a cheerful experience! There is a very touching scene in the film between Montand and a friend who is dying in his arms, when the dying man suddenly reminisces about Paris. For the entire film, Montand has pathetically saved and frequently shown to his friends the Paris Metro ticket from Pigalle station which he used the last time he left Paris. Now, the friend suddenly starts talking about the Rue Galande, a charming little street near the ancient churches of St. Severin and St. Julien le Pauvre. (Rue Galande is also very near the street where Elliott Paul lived, which he described in his famous novel 'The Last Time I Saw Paris', and its sequel.) Montand says he knows the street very well also, so together they discuss the various shops they knew, and they try to remember whether the fence is still there which had obstructed the view of what was inside. The friend says he never could see what was behind the fence. Montand says there was nothing behind it. The friend is distraught, and, looking into Eternity, says: 'So there is just nothing?' and dies. Certainly the director's attention to detail of the transportation of a volatile explosive in impossible conditions by men desperate for money creates fantastic tension, and is gruelling in the extreme. But I don't see why we should give a damn whether those men are blown up or not, frankly, as none of them is sympathetic, and it is difficult to see what difference it makes to the Greater Scheme of Things whether Peter van Eyck and Yves Montand make it or not in their life of hell in that place of hell. To call this film 'a bit of a downer' is a mammoth understatement. There are better ways to spend a couple of hours than watching this."

It has the majestic sweep & the scope & the deep sense of human tragedy that those films have. I don't feel it's a \"suspense\" film, it's much much more. It's a metaphor of the struggle to survive that is shared by every human being ever born. I have no problems with the symbolic images & acts that open & close the film: the cockroach \"dance\" & Mario's last drive. They too are metaphors which would be digestable if such metaphors weren't so out of favor these days. Particularly, the ending: who doesn't believe deep down that when one struggles to keep death at arm's length, one has a chance to postpone it, but if you forget & celebrate your luck, chances are your time has arrived. If I have any problems at all, it's with the casting of Vera Clouzot. She's too immaculately refined & happy-go-lucky for someone in her situation. She certainly doesn't seem to mind the trip up the stairs with the bozo boss. This was the one thing about Wages of Fear that made me think of Hollywood (particularly John Ford). But everything else about this film is so brilliant that its small flaws are easily forgiven. By the way, in the last 30+ years I have seen versions with both the first 40 minutes & the last 15 excised! Abominable!! God bless those responsible for making this version available."

        "review_detailed_main": "Considered to be a classic of French cinema and currently ranked at number 165 on the IMDb Top 250 I went in to THE WAGES OF FEAR with very high expectations especially since the version I was going to watch was the director's cut running at almost two and a half hours . After seeing it I have to admit I felt rather disappointed by it\n\nThere's a good story at the core . A handful of men are paid by an oil company to transport nitroglycerin through a South American jungle . Nitroglycerin as you might know is a highly volatile explosive substance . Shake it about then it's BOOM BANG and there's not enough of you left to have a proper funeral , only a memorial service . If you don't know this don't worry because there's a scene where someone points out how dangerous nitro is . This does lead to the question if it's so dangerous then why use it ? Surely dynamite is a much more stable explosive for putting out oil fires . As it turned out I consulted Wikipedia and indeed nitroglycerin is the explosive of choice for putting out oil fires and has been ever since oil fires have happened . I guess you have to overlook otherwise there wouldn't be a story\n\nThe problem is there just isn't enough of a story justifying a film lasting two and a half hours . The first half hour is taken up with introducing the characters and everything moves with a slow languid pace . Then after that we get to the story proper of men driving trucks with a highly explosive cargo down bumpy third world dirt tracks . Director Henri-Georges Clouzot does very well in convincing us the action is taking place in South America when in fact it was filmed entirely in France but I didn't think he achieved much else . For a story involving characters whose lives could end in a blink of an eye at any moment there's a singular lack of tension , I know it's not the fault of the director but the version I saw had some dodgy subtitles where when characters speak English the words appearing on screen aren't matching what is being said by the characters which led me to wonder if the French and Spanish translations are also similarly mistranslated . Regardless of that point I still felt short changed by THE WAGES OF FEAR"

The only reason I bothered to get to the end of this muddled mess was, I was putting together a piece of furniture so I had a distraction from this story. The other reason I stuck it out to the end was I was curious how this could get a four star review from Turner Classic Movies. The story line itself makes little sense, and the adventures these men have a ridiculous contrivances. The first forty five minutes of the movie are just there to establish that these are bunch of down and out men who would do anything for money; a lot of the interactions between the characters are silly, and add little or nothing to this story. After that they have a series of adventures that make little or no sense. Things that no one would do, things that are not possible, and things that would be just plain stupid to do. There are just to many things to outline here. I would not recommend watching this film unless you want to see a stunningly poorly written story line. I am at compete loss as to how so many people have given this a good review. The only thing dumber then the story line is the ending of this film; like the rest of the film it makes no sense; no one would do what this guy does. Since this film is bad on so many levels I can't outline them all here. Your going to have to decide if you want to waste nearly two hours of your life, on something this bad."

Henri-Georges Clouzot's stark, pessimistic adventure contains enough pure suspense to pull any viewer to the edge of a seat, but until 1992 the film had never been seen (at least in this country) in its uncut, original form. Before it was first released, scissor-happy censors trimmed nearly 45-minutes of footage (mostly from the early, introductory scenes) to help soften the strong anti-American subtext, but even in the truncated version the bias must have been obvious. American oil (and the need to keep it flowing) is still the monument under which every character is ultimately buried, a point made explicit when one driver is crushed beneath his truck in a pool of crude. The director's restored cut is even is incredibly downbeat (note the vultures hovering over every other scene), but the film still packs a thrilling, unforgettable punch."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Wages Of Fear is a damn near perfect suspense thriller. The story concerns four men, broke, desperate, and stranded in a small town somewhere in South America (Venezuela, I presume). They are offered a way out of their miserable existence when an oil well catches fire three hundred miles away and the oil company needs four men to drive the nitroglycerin to the site to blow it out. The trouble is that the three hundred miles they have to drive is some of the most rugged, hostile terrain imaginable.\n\nThe tension and suspense is palpable during the driving scenes, but what takes this movie to a whole other level is that it takes the time to familiarize the audience with these men. We feel like we know them, and sympathize with them before the journey starts. The whole cast is great and believable, and it wasn't long before I truly forgot I was watching actors in a fictional film. These men made it real, as did the brilliant direction of Henri-Georges Clouzot.\n\nClouzot's style is gritty and realistic, with cuts between the trucks and close-ups of their actions (hands on the shift lever, feet on the pedals, etc) serving to heighten the tension. The lack of a musical score also lends a sense of realism and helps to bring home the sense of loneliness and isolation felt by these men.\n\nHighly recommended."

They are free to walkabout but soon realise that the town is one big prison as any of the men lack money to get a ticket to fly out of here.\n\nSalvation comes in the form of an oil field fire several hundred miles away. The task is to drive two trucks packed with nitroglycerine explosives to put it out, but the roads are treacherous one nasty bump and the truck can go boom. Hopefully one of the trucks can make it through, the prize is $2000 each to any of the drivers make it to the oil field fire and deliver their cargo.\n\nCorsican Mario and the much older Jo drive the heaviest truck. Mario flirts with the waitress in the local bar. Jo is a new arrival on the run from Paris with a reputation as a gangster. However once they start their treacherous journey, Jo gets the shakes and is frightened. It is Mario who is determined to finish the journey.\n\nDirector Henri-Georges Clouzot made a classic film of men putting their lives at risk for money but it is also a character study as well. Mario is at first in awe of Jo as he arrives in the small town. Jo persuades Mario to get on this venture and he will show him the ropes. When the drive begins, Mario is initially frightened but gets the upper hand and starts to bully Jo around as age has finally caught up with him and Jo is scared.\n\nThe film starts off in a leisurely manner as we see these disparate group of men, bored, causing trouble at the local bar. The tension soon mounts as four of the men begin their dangerous journey."

And as far as existentialism goes, it's a lot more fun to watch this than to read one of Sartre's brain hemorrhagers. The plot is super-simple -- a bunch of pennyless adventurers are hired to drive two trucks loaded with nitroglycerine to a drilling site where it is desperately needed to blow out a fire. It's essentially like Smokey And The Bandit, only with nitrogylcerine instead of beer. Beat that, Burt Reynolds.\n\nThe characters come across as realistic and intriguing, though not necessarily as terribly affable. I particularly liked Peter von Eyck as Bimba the German. The only scene I didn't like was when they had to back up their lorries onto a bridge-like construction ending over an abyss, because I thought it was contrived and overly dramatic.\n\nI've heard from two persons who saw this back in the day when it came out, one said that they almost couldn't bear the tension, the other that it changed their perspective through its bleak existentialism. I'm just remarking this to give you an idea how this movie was originally received.\n\nFinally, they really did a good job of making the South of France look like South America!"

The people in the small village are literally in prison. We even see a shot of the shadows off a trellis superimposing prisoner's stripes on the people who pretty much wait for something to happen. When a job opportunity arises when an oil company needs men to drive truckloads of nitroglycerin to a fire site, they arise from their sloth and head into an encounter with hell. This is so much more than a simple adventure. We begin to be fascinated by each of the characters as well as the peripheral ones. We root for them and die with them. When one of them turns cowardly, we understand the kinds of forces that are working on him. When one of the trucks eventually blows up, it appears as a flash and little puff. How delicate are our lives. There are different kinds of escape and these people embrace their chance. The wages of fear are 2000 dollars, not much for a man's life, but creates adventure. The performances are outstanding as well as the pacing and first impressions don't mean much when people are all on the same plane."

        "review_detailed_main": "30 years ago while stationed in England I caught the last half hour of \"Wages of Fear\" on BBC. Although I did not know the name of the film, it made such a favorable impression that I kept looking for it once I got back to the world; but it was never shown on American television. When William Friedkin made \"Sorcerer\" I was able to connect the dots and put a title to my elusive film.\n\nIn many ways Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is a bridge between the Italian Neorealism of the early 1950's and the French New Wave of a few years later. Even more obvious is its link to early Hollywood Renaissance directors Arthur Penn, Sam Peckinpah, and Stanley Kubrick. Peckinpah pays homage to \"Wages of Fear\" with a similar introductory scene in \"The Wild Bunch\" and again in \"Straw Dogs\". Kubrick does it with \"The Blue Danube\" waltz in \"2001\", juxtaposing exterior shots of the moving space station with interior views of the stewardess serving a passenger (just as Clouzot cut between the truck cruising down the road and the party back in town). Penn was a little less obvious but the violent shifts between comedy and tragedy in \"Bonnie and Clyde\" can be traced back to a similar narrative technique in \"The Wages of Fear\".\n\nMost of the criticism about \"The Wages of Fear\" comes because Neorealism presents a more stylized reality than classic Hollywood narrative. The intent is to bring the ordinary features of the world into better focus by exaggeration. Expressionistically imitating reality while announcing that what is being shown is not real, the belief being that the more real the imitation the more fraudulent. Thus the use of narrative techniques that actually call attention to themselves. So the process of Jo (Charles Vanel) becoming a hero to Mario (Yves Montand) is shown through a montage of brief disjointed moments of connection. And Mario's journey from idolizing Jo to disillusionment and back to idolizing is much the same.\n\nJo, Mario, Bimba (Peter van Eyck), and Luigi (Folco Lulli) are desperate men stranded somewhere in South America (probably Venezuela). They need money to escape so when an American oil company offers $4,000 to each pair of drivers willing to transport a ton of nitroglycerin (300 kilometers over poor roads) to a burning wellhead, they sign on for the job. Death could happen at any moment and the reactions of each man along the journey is compared and contrasted with what the viewer learned about them back in the village during the first half of the film. There is a certain foreshadowing as it is pointed out at the start that this is the kind of intense task where even the survivors will be permanently scarred emotionally.\n\nThe four are not heroes, just a mixed group linked by a willingness to value themselves at only $2,000. The oil company (an American one) is able to operate in this remote region because there is plenty of manpower who share this mindset. The film is more anti- capitalist than anti-American and whatever political message it had in 1953 is more generic today.\n\nThe cinematographer, Armand Thirard, keeps things claustrophobic throughout; in the dead- end town and in the cab of each truck.\n\nClouzot sets up his most suspenseful sequence, where the trucks must back up on the unstable wooden platform in order to get around a hairpin bend, by having the first (smaller) truck narrowly succeed, heightening the tension as the bigger truck attempts the same maneuver.\n\nWhat establishes this as European art cinema is its willingness to break primary film conventions. Clouzot was free from the need for a happy ending and could let anything happen to his characters. Conventional narrative required that a character's narrow escape early in the film was because he had a purpose later in the story, but that is not the case with \"Wages of Fear\". You first realize the power this gives Clouzot when a stray rock rolls down a hillside toward a Jerry can filled with nitro. In this film such an ironic anticlimax is actually a real possibility.\n\nIf you liked the original \"Flight of the Phoenix\" you will enjoy this film. And if you are a Peckinpah fan it is a must watch.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

Here the buff can choose to view one of the more than 6,500 titles available. There is, however, one proviso; every title, be it silent or sound, black and white or color, documentary of feature is either set in or has a strong connection with Paris. Selection is up to the individual, theoretically it can be alphabetical if one had the time to scan 6,500 titles. The usual method is to key in the name of an actor, director, writer and/or a genre. When one keys in Yves Montand and qualifies further by adding 'fiction' there is a choice of around ten titles and these include Le Salaire de la puer, which by now everyone knows takes place in South America despite being shot in the South of France. When I brought this to the attention of a staffer it was explained to me that Mario - the character played by Montand - carries around a ticket for the Paris metro. Viewers of this classic tend to carry around for years afterward a mental phial of nitro, such is the impact it has on initial screening. It is impossible to praise too highly the taut script and direction, the just-right acting of slow-starter Montand (after a few brief appearances mostly as himself in pot-boilers he took a beating in his first starring role and concentrated on filling Domestic and International stages with his singing. Even after this triumph it was almost a further decade before he really got into his acting stride via Compartiment tuer. In their wisdom both video and DVD distributors often pair this with the same director's equally definitive 'Les Diaboliques featuring Mrs Montand, Simone Signoret (and again the director's other half, Vera Clouzot). This is an unbeatable parlay and should be snapped up by anyone with even a peripheral interest in what makes good movies. As for this. Magnifique! 10/10"

There's a scene where the characters have to get a rock out of the road in front of them that is so tense I was literally white-knuckled. This film will inevitably be compared to the remake by William Friedkin, Sorceror. That is an inferior film, if only because it has a very clunky sets of character introductions and relies too much on the physical mechanics of the journey and not the characters. The Wages of Fear is all about the characters and the situations that arise due to their greed and hubris. Perhaps the most chilling scene of all is a decision Yves Montand's character has to make while driving across an oily pond. It's scene like that one that make the film great. This is Clouzot's best film in my opinion, just edging out Diabolique. Find it and see it."

Luckily it was the original director's cut and not the edited American version. I went into this movie with extremely high expectations and I was not disappointed in the least. The performances were uniformly excellent. I was drawn in by Mario's unfailing tenacity as much as I was repulsed by his willingness to commit a reprehensible act in his drive to accomplish the mission (see the movie to see what I mean). I sympathized with Jo, who, although a whiner and coward, was the wisest of the bunch.\n\nThe cinematography is alternately beautiful and bleak, capturing the graveness of the situation wonderfully. The oil slick scene is amazing. The tension builds to almost agonizing levels, and then goes a bit further. I'm a Hitchcock fan, but I don't think Hitch ever directed anything that reaches the level of suspense of The Wages of Fear.\n\nPeople have said that they thought the introduction went on too long, but I'd have to disagree. The long introduction serves to firmly establish the characters and give weight to their actions. The full 148-minute version is the one to see if you enjoy strong character development, but the 131-minute version is available for those with less patience.\n\nAnd yes, there is not a happy ending. Some might say it was a letdown. I admit to feeling that way for a minute or two until I started replaying the movie in my mind (and this is a movie that stays with you, guaranteed). I came to appreciate the bleak ending, and in fact, relish it. I found it to be--and I believe that this was the director's intention-- just desserts."

        "review_detailed_main": "A While ago I watched 'Sorcerer', the 1977 remake of 'The Wages of Fear'. The first 40 minutes of that movie were confusing and boring and could easily have been skipped. 'The Wages of Fear', I fear, was no different. By skipping the first 40 minutes you won't miss a thing, because all the confusing mumbo jumbo during these 40 minutes contributes NOTHING to the events that follow. It's best to start watching around the 40-minute mark with the crisis on the oil fields. Believe me, you honestly won't miss anything.\n\nThe only way to extinguish the flames at the oil field, is with a ton of nitroglycerine, which has to be transported in jerrycans on two trucks. Four experienced truck drivers are selected for the job. The trucks have no safety gadgets or shock absorbers and the roads they must travel on are treacherous. Desperate for money, the drivers accept the job regardless of the high risks involved.\n\nOver the next 90 minutes (that's if you were to start at the 40-minute mark) we watch the drivers carefully transporting their dangerous cargo. It is a long and slow journey with many obstacles along the way. Unfortunately, I found the film just as slow paced as the speed at which the trucks were moving.\n\nNo doubt, some scenes must have been highly suspenseful and even frightening back in 1953, but not by today's standards. Don't get me wrong, there's no denying this is an incredibly well made picture - for its time. Adding to the danger is the fact CGI did not exist back then and everything had to be done practically. This fact alone deserves the high praise the film received.\n\nWhether a film is well made or not, I always rate it on the entertainment value (for me). Often well made films are not all that entertaining while cheap B-movies are. So, my final verdict on 'The Wages of Fear' is that is a well made film, and there were a few highly entertaining moments. As a whole, though, I found the film too slow. It would have been far more suspenseful with a shorter runtime, and significant editing, especially those boring first 40 minutes."

Heavy drivers immerse in danger by carrying nitroglycerin containers; their minds are at proof by challenges where Mother Nature elements defy the constant sorrow of man of feeling superior to the Wind, to the Mud, to the Mountain. Nature is the blossom where this characters build up in a trip everybody is invited, every character is formed on a awesome and sutile script, Yves Montand in a particular role, the characterization is terrific because they universalize prototypes: and remember we are in the 50's! What a directing, inhumane Henri George Clouzot, so many feelings cannot cope in such dreadfully threatening passages, so many words spoken with charisma and greatness. The night entraps every single shot in a cozy blanket, feel free to prepare to this movie: it is not a challenge. Think it as necessary. 50 years old and this grandfather of movies will teach you the meaning of adventure"

        "review_detailed_main": "Everyone knows that french have invented noir, but they haven't limited it with urbanistic policiers and crime stories. Henri-Georges Clouzot's films are a living proof of this fact. \"Salaire de la Peur\" is one of his 3 famous masterpieces (other two are \"Quai des Orf\u00e8vres\" and \"Les Diaboliques\") all of which had an enormous influence on world cinematography. One of Empire's editors Ian Nathan had put \"Salair de la Peur\" among top 10 greatest actions/adventures of all time. His top 100 list might be controversial, but this is something where I totally agree with him. Clouzot's film became a milestone in many genres, among which are thrillers, actions, adventures and dramas. But even these 4 genres are not enough to describe the depressing and thrilling atmosphere of \"Salair de la Peur\". If your synonym for adventure is Indiana Jones, then you'll be surprised by the dark philosophy of this film (even though I love Indy myself). Indeed, the best word to describe this movie is noir. Noir at it's best. 10 out of 10."

There are no monsters.\n\nJust FEAR. And fear that is tied to money. The Love of Money is the root of all evil, and it will also get you to try to get past your fear.\n\nWages of Fear is an incredible movie. See it from beginning to end. Don't get up for popcorn or sodas or the telephone. Don't take your eyes from the screen, either. When you think those guys are safe... they probably aren't."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Wages of Fear\" is a tense thriller from the French director, Clouzot, about desperate men willing to risk everything for a chance to escape their lousy existence.\n\nThe story involves a group of men stranded in a South American oil company town. None of them have steady work and none can afford to take a plane out of town, so they sit around and drink and argue with one another.\n\nThen one day, an oil well explodes up in the mountains, and the company needs volunteers to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerine up to the drill site so they can blow the fire out. The company's union drivers are too valuable to risk, so the foreman offers the job to the men stranded in town, knowing full well they're desperate enough to do anything.\n\nThe four men selected to drive are Mario (Yves Montand), Jo (Charles Vanel), Luigi, and Bimba. Each has different fears and motivations for making the journey, and the director develops each one's personality from the start of the film through the drive itself.\n\n\"Wages of Fear\" is a very tense film in the second half as the two trucks make their way over treacherous roads, encountering obstacles along the way that require the men's creativity in overcoming. Some rise to the occasion, others crumble under the pressure. A quick death awaits anyone who makes the slightest mistake. By the end of the film, the viewer is emotionally wrung dry.\n\nFrom the European period of stark cinematic drama, this thriller is one of the best."

        "review_detailed_main": "1st watched 3/9/2014 -- 7 out of 10(Dir:Henri-Georges Clouzot): Tense French film about an American Oil company's hiring of four gentlemen from a poor village in what I think was Central America to complete a monumental task of hauling explosives 100 miles on dirt roads to help the SOC(Southern Oil Company). The movie starts with the arrival of one mafia-like gentlemen named Jo into the small village looking for an opportunity to make money. After seeing another Frenchman named Maury, looking like he was doing pretty well for himself, he sticks around. The other two future drivers are locals who have learned that you have to work for the American company to survive , but one named Luigi decides to take this new job after contracting concrete in his lungs from his current position. The director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, sets the stage by introducing the characters and the area for at least 30 minutes before introducing the main plot line. The explosives that they are carrying in the trucks are very brittle and this is shown to the interviewees so that they understand the danger involved. These folks though, have nothing to lose --- and so they pursue the possibility of $2000 per person without a whole lot of reservation. The hazards that await are mostly natural ones like a giant boulder blocking the road, and the sickness of one of the drivers but definitely hard to deal with. The movie is not really about the trek, but rather how the characters handle their quest. Character's true identities are revealed as they battle the road and themselves. Because this is a foreign production there is an air on un-certainty about what is going to happen and for me creates some extra suspense. The performances are worthwhile and the direction is almost flawless with my only real issues being the quick ending and quick demise of one of the trucks. This is kind of an anti-Speed movie that is almost as thrilling as the before-mentioned American movie. At 2 and 1/2 hours long it never gets boring...an excellent movie overall and a brilliant piece of filmmaking by the French director."

It draws you in with compelling, three-dimensional characters, then places them in a situation that imperils both their lives and sanity. And it takes the audience along for the ride. Clouzet's direction is masterful and all of the performances are right on. The setup is fairly simple: four men with nothing to lose but their lives agree to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerine through some of the most desolate and dying backroads that the unnamed third world setting has to offer. Their obstacles each provide a tense scene that has you on the edge of your seat, giving seven or eight scenes more intense than any in your average thriller. From what I've read, this film was butchered upon initial US release due to its harsh portrayal of third world interests, so beware the chopped up version. A 10 out of 10 (Which I don't give out very often)"

Vera Clouzot crawling around, cleaning the dirty floor with her half-crazed mannerisms is surprisingly sexy. The sense of boredom, heat, dirt, desolation and despair is palpable and convincing.\n\nThe second half of the film is surprisingly formulaic and predictable. It starts off with some nerve-wracking Hitchcockian scenes they soon loose their suspense. I had a pretty good idea what was to become of the drivers and was pretty much unsurprised by turn of events.\n\nThe conclusion is unbelievable and bordering on stupid with it's anti-Hollywood ending.\n\nI think this movie would have been a lot more interesting if it stayed in the god-forsaken town and didn't attempt to venture out into the world of suspense. Still, a striking debut for a director, just a bit overrated."

Did we watch the same movie?\n\nThere are \"real\" classics out there, one's from the same period that dated well, showed the period and the issues of the day and dealt with them in a real and honest way...and then there these are \"arty\" classics that just go and over do the story, the dialogue and the characters to...well, I don't know why they do it but I can say that I don't get why they do \"it\". This must be an arty classics because I just didn't get \"it\" and I don't understand the people that have watched this in the last 40 years and pretended to get \"it\" as well. There is nothing real about this movie, the story is passable, okay, but there is no insight into the time or place of the movie, the dialogue is plain ridiculous, and the casting is terrible...(did anyone look at, and understand, who/what Linda's character was supposed to be in the first 5 minutes of the movie? She was badly cast and then given a terrible role to play on top of that). Vanel's transition from tough old street thug to corny coward was...well, it was hilarious actually (that was a source of a few laughs, truth be told). I think only O'Brien Luigi and Bimba are well played and we get saved the silly dialogue of the others with these characters. Mario was...such a shallow and repulsive character to me that I won't even go into how out-dated this kind of \"hero\" is in this day and age. Who should want to watch this movie? Those that want to see what being \"cool\" meant to a man in the 50's and how women (and a really beautiful one at that) where/should be treated by such macho men like Mario (this is a real women beater's showcase here). All in all a rubbish movie and if I could have those two and a half hours back I would surely ask."

Unfortunately I didn't watch this film alone so the room wasn't free of shouts of 'NOTHING'S HAPPENED! THIS IS BORING!' Even though this is an action film, and one of the best of the 1950s at that (which pits it alongside the terrific works of Japan in this decade), it should not be treated as something to watch half drunk of a Friday night. After this first hour you will know just about everything regarding the personalities of the four men who are going to be the ones selected for the dangerous task, which makes the journey's change from friendly contest to a desperate competition where the men will do anything to be the first to reach the oil field and receive the reward all the more obvious and affecting.\n\nA huge corporation exploiting the working class in this way undoubtedly leads to many people reading into this film quite a lot. But even with this aside, once the film enters its second hour it showcases some of the best action scenes ever filmed. The recklessness the men develop over these scenes ultimately lead to their downfall, especially that of Mario.\n\nOverall this is too essential to miss. Many people will be bored stiff by the first hour, which is ironic because they are depriving themselves of the second half's awesome action that they were probably craving in the first place.\n\nAlong with The Seven Samurai, this is the ultimate action film of the 1950s and one of the most tense films ever made."

Take nothing away from this though, it is a stupendous piece of filmmaking. The first hour is a wonderful evocation of a Central American town of much poverty and filled not only with the peasant locals but all and sundry from about the world drawn by the nearby oil wells and associated jobs but left stranded when most of those jobs dried up. There is action and movement in every frame and a tremendous tension is built up before the lorries begin to roll with their dangerous cargo. The individuals we have variously been introduced to are now sat beside each other in a race against time and desperate not to jostle their explosives. Tension, suspense and character exposition aplenty as this beautifully photographed and tightly directed film roars to an unexpected (?) conclusion."

        "review_detailed_main": "No, this is not an horrible movie and I did not disliked watching it but I absolute didn't seem to like it as much as most other people seem to do and in my opinion the movie is currently being way overrated.\n\nI'll give the movie that it was a bit of an unique one for its time. It actually has a pretty good premise, lots of action movies now days would be jealous off. However it doesn't really make this movie a fantastic or spectacular one to watch, though I'm taking it into account that this movie was from before the period that the action-genre got actually first fully developed. But by saying all this, you shouldn't think that this is an action packed movie with gun fights or anything but it's more a movie that takes an action type of approach with its style and story-telling, of its somewhat adventurous story, that gets brought very tense to the screen.\n\nI really had quite some problems with this movie. One is not even it's long running time of two and an half hours but more its set-up of its story and characters. Once you start thinking about it you should wonder of the first 30 minutes, or so, were truly needed for the movie or not. It's unnecessarily slow and it was mostly meant to introduce and set-up its character but they could had done this all a lot quicker really. And the characters aren't even that much good to begin with. Problem with them is that are some lying and cheating bums, who do everything for some money. I just could never fully like any of them, so therefore the movie already fell emotionally flat and became a distant one to watch.\n\nBut yes, it's definitely true that the movie becomes a much better one to watch in its second half, when finally good and interesting things start to happen. They came up with some pretty good moments for the movie, that often work out real tense. They are being build-up well and executed surprisingly good and also original.\n\nBut no matter how original the movie gets with some of its moments, the movie remains a very predictable one, or at least to me it was. I was not even surprised or taken away by its not-so-Hollywood-like ending. It got done a bit too obvious, in its build up toward it.\n\nNevertheless this movie still remains a great and also unique achievement, from director Henri-Georges Clouzot. It's a French movie, in which a whole lot of different languages gets spoken by its characters. Besides French we have Italian, Spanish, English and some German, just to name a few languages that get spoken throughout this movie. It's simply a well directed and also good looking movie, aside from its settings that don't really seem to suit the movie its premise.\n\nThe movie is supposedly set in an unnamed South-American country but the movie looks nothing like a South-American country at all. At first I even thought that the movie was being set in Marocco (also due to the many different languages being spoken in it) or some other northern African country. It's just one of those other little things that prevented me from truly getting in this movie and liking it as much as everybody else seems to do.\n\nIt's a good movie, especially for its time but there was nothing in this movie that was surprising or truly grabbing me.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Adapted from Georges Arnaud's famous novel (a novel that was also successfully adapted in the little seen but worth checking out 1977 William Friedkin feature Sorcerer), Henri-Georges Clouzot's esteemed and ageless thriller is a benchmark in cinematic tension building and one of the great films of the era in which it was released.\n\nWinning awards at the Cannes Film Festival and BAFTA awards upon release but only garnering true attention it deserved much later on as Western audience's partook in Clouzot's sweat inducing affair, The Wages of Fear has steadily etched itself into cinematic history as one of the most revered foreign films ever produced and easily one of the most taught and unrelenting experiences you could have as a filmgoer.\n\nStarting off relatively slowly but surely as we spend a significant chunk of time in a poor township deep in South America where joblessness and desperation goes hand in hand with the big American oil companies that have made themselves at home in the area, Fear lulls us into a false sense of security centred around day to day activities and dramas that gives way to one of the most white knuckle men on a mission movies we've ever seen as Yves Montand's charming Mario and a group of acquaintance's are tasked with transporting tonnes of nitroglycerine via truck across precarious back roads and uncontrolled wilds.\n\nDriven by the prospect of abundant riches should the job be completed successfully, Mario (and without a word of a lie, a fellow compatriot that is named Luigi) and his co-drivers face an uphill battle both figuratively and literally as the enormousness of their task at hand becomes ever more apparent and thanks to Clouzot's tout direction, Georges Auric's slick score and some wonderfully attuned editing, Fear is in a constant state of movement towards an explosive end game that is both unpredictable and memorable in equal measure.\n\nUnlike many films of the time in which it was released, it's hard pressed to find much wrong with such an ageless film outside of some slightly off early moments and some small instances of over the top acting, most elements of Clouzot's film would be unlikely to be delivered better in today's modern movie-making reality with Fear remaining a litmus test that other films cut from the same cloth must judge themselves against as this stunning thriller grips you like a vice and refuses to let go.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nWhat may appear to simply be men driving some trucks is in fact one of tensest films produced. An ageless classic full of drama, heartbreak and the best use of characters known as Mario and Luigi in a feature film, The Wages of Fear is an old-timer you would do will to truck (track) down.\n\n4 1/2 pools of oil out of 5."

Starting out in a poverty-stricken South American town, the goings on shows the dereliction of society in a way that avoids sensationalism. The characters are all distinctly set up as they are employed by the oil company for a suicidal and dangerous mission, their desperation exploited. What follows is the most anxiety inducing film I have ever seen. Every detail of the truck drivers' journey, obstacles and dangers are depicted with excruciating vividness, along with their attitudes toward the incredible risk - from terror to determination to bravado. Their ultimate fate shows both the strength of the human spirit in the face of challenge but also the inescapable destiny of those who are treated as expendable."

        "review_title": "Magnifique",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"I've got brains in my head.\" \"If only you had guts too.\" \"Yours'll be hanging from a tree.\"\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear is stunning on multiple levels: the incredible tension in the story, of course, but also the level of detail in the grime created in its location, the development of its characters, and the commentary on American imperialism and how big corporations exploit impoverished workers. This is one that worked in every way for me, and I was riveted for all 153 minutes.\n\nIt boggles my mind that this was filmed in the south of France, with a remote rugged area filling in so well for a nameless South American country, and the village having been built entirely for the film. The level of realism is very high, setting a gritty tone which amplifies what the film is saying about humanity. Cruelty and hubris abound. The cruelty of the past, reflected in the German character's scars from the war, the cruelty of the wealthy, reflected in the company treating workers like disposable assets, and the cruelty of the poor to each other, reflected in the ruthlessness of the main characters in both the town and on the mission.\n\nThe transformation in the relationship between the two Frenchmen is one of the many highlights of the film, even if it's tough to watch at times. The older man (Charles Vanel), a tough guy who likes humiliating others in town, gradually melts under pressure, while the younger man (Yves Montand) is increasingly callous over time (and my goodness, that oil spill scene!). \"Maybe you were a man in grandma's time! All you can do now is shoot from behind!\" he bellows. Meanwhile, there is real pathos in the Italian guy (Folco Lulli) dreaming of a house in Calabria but having a terminal lung disease from his work, and the German guy (Peter van Eyck) gradually informing us of his past, which included his father having been murdered by the Nazis, and himself assigned to slave labor for three years.\n\nFresh-faced V\u00e9ra Clouzot seemed a little out of place in this grimy town, but I was glad to see her, and the pathos of her character, dominated and used for sex by her boss (Dario Moreno), and mistreated by her boyfriend (Montand), reinforced the rest of the film. The meanness of the latter is a nice bit of foreshadowing of how ruthless he will be on his \"road trip\" later.\n\nAll of the psychological tension results from these men feeling like they have no other way of getting out of this dirty little town, one they regard as a prison, and being enticed to undertake a very high risk operation for a relatively small amount of money. The whole task set up because an American oil company has had a massive explosion, and gets them to go on a dangerous mission. \"Wherever there's oil, there's Americans,\" one character says. It's beyond aggravating to think that American censors at the time took offense to this, and the \"land of free speech\" had these sentiments cut out of the U. S. release at the time. Somehow it's fitting though.\n\nThis is one that I think would reward a rewatch simply for all of its fine visual moments, both in big scenes like the platform over a cliff collapsing, and in little ones, like a peasant struggling to pull a donkey down the street in the background of a shot. There are countless others. Just a great film from Clouzot, and what a pairing it would make with the film he would make two years later, the brilliant Diabolique."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"You're getting paid to be scared.\" Just one of the great lines in this great movie. I am constantly amazed at how suspenseful the movie is ... even with repeat viewings. So -- with my more recent viewings (of the excellent Criterion DVD) -- I began to consider some of the themes.\n\nWhat if the men were rich? Would they have not even considered taking the risk? If that is so, then why do very wealthy men and women (like Martha Stewart etc) still take risks engaging in insider trading, accounting scams, and tax evasion? Could it be that some people take risks because ... in addition to the rewards ... they are thrilled by the risks?\n\nAt one point, Luigi says to Bimba, something like, \"After tomorrow, we'll be rich ... if we are still alive. And if we are not, then it is all over anyway.\" So is this a story about courageous men who risk their lives for money? Or it is a story about men who are prepared to die ... and perhaps prefer to die ... if they cannot get what they want? And is that the attitude that can get us through each day ... and get us what we want? \"Do or die?\" Or it that the moral position that justifies injuring others to get what we want?\n\nWhat if it were me? Would I have taken the job? At what point would I have given up? Perhaps I would not be afraid of dying. But would I be ruthless...and would I be unwilling to quit when the obstacles appear to be insurmountable?\n\n\"You don't know what fear is. ... It's catchy like smallpox. And once you get it, it's for life.\"\n\nWhy is it that more men than women like this film? The leads are men who face danger. On the other hand, these ruthless and dnagerous men begin to crumble with fear ... not just the fear of dying, but the fear of failing. You'd think that women would appreciate a movie commenting on the foolishness and inconsequence of male fantasies."

We see a mixture of cultures that other filmmakers can only dream about -- White European, White American, Native American, Hispanic, African, and on and on.\n\nThe acting is flawless all along the cast. Particularly interesting is the interaction between characters within and across genders.\n\nWhile the story starts out slow, overall it is entertaining. And while melodrama is approached, it never is breached; reality is never really abandoned so a very difficult and fine line is successfully walked.\n\nHighly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "This outstanding film about a highly dangerous transport job establishes character in depth before the real suspense begins. Anti-American sentiment runs strong in the depiction of oil-company managers in a Venezuelan shanty town. They are thick-skinned vulgarians who, in the process of \"just doing their job,\" have desensitized themselves completely to the poverty and hunger around them. One foreman hires an old friend, who is French, along with another Frenchman, an Italian and a Dutch man to transport nitroglycerin in two trucks to a distant site. The slightest jolt will blow the trucks and their drivers to smithereens. The men selected for the job are desperate for work, being foreigners stranded in an economically depressed country and desperate to get out of the abyss of poverty they have fallen into.\n\nOnce the journey begins, the tension is unrelenting. The director masterfully plays on the viewer's nerves. I was often shrieking out loud, so complete was the illusion of suspense and fright. Unlike so many American action films, the destruction depicted is not contrived but is an inevitable consequence of the difficult work conditions and the generally depressing environment. Most viewers, I think, will expect some of the 4 men to die along the way, but the ending is full of psychological irony. This film also amounts to an insightful study of virility and courage in the face of death."

Perhaps so, but everything in this film about lost souls who will do anything, even put their lives in extreme danger, to make a buck in a God-forsaken part of Venezuela, points to that end.

But whatever, much of life is about pain, we know that if we are on here because we love a movie like \"The Wages of Fear.\" Have I reached 10 lines yet? No? Well...\n\nConsider this the light that will lead us home. I saw this movie again recently after first seeing it once about 10 years ago, in an art-house theater, the Castro I think, in San Francisco. What stuck through the years was of course the suspense, also because it's what the movie is famous for. What my recent viewing of it revealed was the richness of the characters and relationships in the story. The relationship between Mario (Yves Montand) and Jo (Charles Vanel) is the most deeply explored and turns into a clever and ironic mirror of Mario's relationship with Linda (Vera Clouzot), whom he mostly treats like garbage in the beginning of the movie, especially after his new friend Jo has arrived and the two of them become inseparable. Only later, when the two men start to go through hell together, does their relationship take a turn for the worse, and Mario assumes the same dominating, emotionally and physically abusive role he has in his relationship with Linda."

        "review_detailed_main": "How can a b/w film in French, by a director never mentioned in the same breath as Truffaut or Godard, Clement or Clair, beguile audiences for nearly half a century? Not through a big budget or special effects but through classical film-making.\n\nThe setting is nowhere. The characters are from a community of human dregs. Their journey is a chance at redemption.\n\nHow do you make a highly allegorical film and keep it taut, suspenseful and naturalistic? Great acting is part of it; John Ford once said the most interesting thing in the world is a human face, and Clouzot uses close-ups, particularly of Yves Montand, to great effect. He also keeps a tight rein on the pace, paying cinematographic attention to tiny details. This heightens the suspense while recalling Hemingway's early short stories, in which a man survives the nihilistic world around him by focusing on the details of work. Clouzot suggests tensions among the characters, then expands on them, and we watch them change under pressure - the pressure of the perilous task they face, and the pressure they exert on each other - not unlike his film Les Diaboliques. The power of this unique film lies in its frank study of humanity battling a hostile universe - but its appeal lies in its ability to keep the whole story balanced and rolling along in an exciting, naturalistic style. A film of tight editing that highlights its expansive vision: there aren't many like it."

The script takes its time with detailed exposition that fixates us with its genuine drive and predilection for its characters, misogynist, oppressive, brawny men with indistinctly sympathetic sides. Once the turning point of the story takes place, the suspense of every moment during the scenes where they are driving the trucks loaded with nitro is like your life flashing before your eyes. You cringe and wince for these guys and almost involuntarily vocalize your anguish.\n\nThe reason the film is so effective is because of Henri-Georges Clouzot's grand ability to be fixed, to anchor certain scenes with long closeups, continuous sounds of growling truck engines, and an intensely realized pace. The Wages of Fear is first-class suspense, sharing a window seat next to Hitchcock."

        "review_detailed_main": "Four men are stranded in, quite literally, a dead end town with no money to get out. All they do each day is kill time, drink and get gradually more disillusioned. Then their luck changes. Or does it? A major fire breaks out at a nearby oil drilling facility and the manager needs a brave/foolhardy gang to drive two truckloads of ultra-sensitive nitro-glycerin along some poorly maintained roads and across some treacherous terrain to the site so they can extinguish the fires. It's a pretty international convoy that sets off with their two travelling time bombs safe in the knowledge that the slightest vibration could blow them all to kingdom come. Of course, the sweltering heat and their fraying nerves all contribute to what now ensues - an almost perfectly paced drama that gradually raises the tension so that we almost share their perilous journey with them. \"Mario\" (Yves Montant) is a non-nonsense Corsican who pairs with,\"Jo\" (Charles Vanel) who is a bit of French thuggery. Luigi (Folco Lulli) just wants to get on with the job and he drives with the slightly enigmatic German \"Bimba\" (Peter van Eyck). There's not really another world for this film, despite it being filmed outdoors, in dense jungle. It's claustrophobic. Their world is reduced to two tiny cabs with danger around every corner, insects that would cheerily suck their blood and all for $2,000 each! The journey affects their characters too - the brash and confident \"Jo\" gradually succumbing to his fears whilst his partner steps up - and an inter-dependency of sorts develops that does rather surprise. Henri-George Clouzot creates a film here that really does have you caring for these men in the end - even if, at the start, you have little interest in or sympathy for them. He manages to convey to an audience the absolute sense of anguish and the sheer determination of these men as tragedy ensues and their priorities and perspectives take a jolt that would readily set off their cargo. I thought Vanel probably has the best character to portray here, but the increasingly effective dynamic with Montand works really well to create a must-see tale of survival."

        "review_detailed_main": "What can one possibly say except that this is a masterpiece? The first hour does a splendid job of establishing characters, their personalities, and the dynamics between them. With roughly ninety minutes left thereafter it may not seem like a lot, from the outside looking in, to tell the remainder of the story, but as it turns out those ninety minutes are nearly overwhelming. 'Le salaire de la peur,' or 'The wages of fear,' so ably builds tension and suspense with each passing moment that it's impossible not to be on edge. It's hard not to cringe with every slight divot in the road and bounce of the wheel, and when more substantial obstacles and problem-solving enters the equation, the picture becomes a masterwork of thrills that puts Alfred Hitchcock to shame. Factor in how the extreme danger and pervasive terror of the journey reveals more about the characters, and the result is simply a must-see classic, bar none.\n\nEvery last centimeter of the length is filled with tremendous, riveting detail, in every way. There's no sense in which this isn't altogether perfect. The filming locations are gorgeous, and the production design is beyond all but the grandest of comparisons in making this the astoundingly vivid experience that it is. The vehicles, props, costume design, and hair and makeup are exquisite in rounding out the visuals. The stunts and effects are superb, as captivating as any one might hope to see in major action flicks. And it cannot be overstated: the cast are exemplary, from one to the next all giving impeccable performances of terrific range, physicality, nuance, and unexpected emotional depth. Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli, and even Peter van Eyck, given less prominence, are all to be commended for so crucially embodying the strong feelings that heavily define the feature.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's direction is utterly marvelous, shrewdly orchestrating every shot and scene to capitalize on even the tiniest minutiae - focus on a mechanical part, or an expression - that will amplify and indeed maximize the ponderous apprehension that saturates each passing minute. Armand Thirard's cinematography, and the editing of Madeleine Gug, Etiennette Muse, and Henri Rust, are all specifically bent toward that same goal, heightening the fraught, harrowing energy until it surely couldn't go any higher. And while I can't speak to Georges Arnaud's novel, Clouzot and J\u00e9rome Geronimi's adapted screenplay is wonderfully smart and entrancing, giving us complicated characters, biting dialogue, and above all, spellbinding scene writing that keeps our attention raptly glued to the screen. The narrative is enriched with boundless, careful particulars to make the whole all that it could be, and the result is fantastic across the board.\n\nI well assumed I'd like this, and it was suggested to me by a trusted source, but still I'm blown away by just how brilliant 'Le salaire de la peur' is. Why, the 300-mile trek to the oil well is so immensely engrossing that one forgets how the exposition introduced a dire portrait of poverty and corporate abuse of workers, and other themes that would have been worth exploring all on their own. One struggles to further expound on the qualities of so great a movie without betraying plot points, but then, if my own experience is any indication, it doesn't matter any way. This is something that one needs to see for themselves to really appreciate the immediacy of every tiny facet, and for as good as it is, it's something that everyone needs to see at least once as far as I'm concerned. I don't know what more to say without repeating myself - 'Le salaire de la peur' is a magnificent, essential slice of cinema, an outstanding classic, and I can only give my highest, heartiest recommendation to one and all. Bravo!"

There's good suspense that comes from the various obstacles that the four guys encounter on their journey and there's interesting ways of going around or beating those obstacles . It's fascinating to see the many solutions and ideas that they come up with. This perilous journey, mixed with a good mix of characters and a real sense of danger make for a great movie that I really enjoyed watching. I know it's just guys driving trucks in the wild, but it was a brilliant movie and I'm glad I saw it."

        "review_detailed_main": "For his sixth feature director Henri-Georges Clouzot has taken Georges Arnaud's best selling thriller, has made a few changes in terms of character and incident, created a Latin American hellhole in the South of France, and given us what is arguably his masterpiece.\n\nThe production was dogged with difficulty and filming was suspended for several months because of torrential rain, the exhausting Mistral and illness not to mention the age-old problem of Finance. When at last released it proved a phenomenal success, established its director as a 'master of suspense', made an international star of Yves Montand whose previous appearances had not exactly set the screen alight and rejuvinated the career of Charles Vanel who benefited from Jean Gabin's declining the role of Jo. Gabin had no objection to playing crooks, mobsters and shady lawyers but drew the line at portraying cowardice.\n\nBefore the central action begins Clouzot has cleverly introduced an extended prologue which delineates the characters of Montand as Mario, Vanel as Jo, Folco Lulli as Luigi and the Bimba of Peter van Eyck. It is the dynamic between this quartet as well as the obstacles they face on their perilous journey that makes for such compelling viewing. Mention must be made of the wondrous Vera Clouzot as Linda whose role offers a perfect balance although the treatment of her character will no doubt infuriate the Feminists.\n\nThere are two features here that are an essential element in this director's oeuvre, namely a pessimistic commentary on the human condition and his emphasis on 'contrast' which is underlined here by Armand Thirard's masterly use of light and shadow. In Clouzot's own words, 'I have sought an editing based on constant shocks'. I think it safe to say he has succeeded.\n\nThe film's classic status has been further enhanced by William Friedkin's boring and utterly worthless Hollywood makeover."

Hunger is that one thing for which human can go onto risk his life without caring about sophisticated ways of fulfilling it. It can make you do anything, it increases the greed and then all left in human is nothing but a soulless money digger. The Wages Of Fear adduces stories of some men in French town who got no job to do but had to make a living. The company offers a high risk job on good wages to truck drivers and a few of them desirably accepts the tough task. All this journey of them driving to thier destination is thrilling and very natural but unfortunately it begins after a very slow and dull start. But once it begins, there is no slowing down to the following show and overall usability is served well if you can forgive the boring start. The entire narrative is very intensely formed and the formation of scenes is linearly correct. Besides, it wastes so much time to build the characters and pick up the main portion of the script. However, when it ends you don't feel disappointed despite some flaws. It could have been a much more greater film in early time but post 1950 cinema was moved way ahead. A major problem could be that this Italian-French drama didn't want to lose the essence and human factors and keep it close reality, in which it is definitely succeeded whereas theatrically it was slightly below the belt. Intense presence of Yves Montana and Charles Vanel is engaging amd noticeable. Henri-Georges Clouzot's direction is detailed, subtle and his solemn approch on the script is praiseworthy. Overall, this film manages to prove it's point of being socially important film and thats all matters the most. A very good attempt and certainly watchable film.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

I have to say that the existentialism of the first part of the movie, that portrays the lives of different characters exploited by an American oil company in a fictitious Central American town is the one that spoke loudest to me (it's easy to see why it was heavily censored in the US upon its release), but the tension of the main plot line in the second half is also very impressive and it's easy to see its influence on the cinema that came after it. Extra points are given for the guest appearances of Mario and Luigi."

The plot twists hit heavy and the ending is all but happy. This movie has several moral life lessons about friendship, greed and hybris. Although it's 2 hours and 20 minutes long it does not feel like that. The pacing is strong, maybe the beginning is a little bit slow.\n\nYou should watch this movie if you want to experience how movies were made in the 1950s or if you just want a movie without a happy ending. Neithertheless you get a piece of art definitely worth your time."

        "review_title": "Textbook taut tension fueled by human greed as much as nitroglycerin",
        "review_detailed_main": "In 1950, Director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who had acquired some international standing with his 1943 masterpiece, LE CORBEAU, visited Brazil and cranked out a couple of documentaries on that country. He also took the opportunity to marry the exceedingly beautiful Vera Clouzot, who would appear in LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR and, more famously, in LES DIABOLIQUES.\n\nClouzot experienced life in South America in loco. He learned of the difficulties of survival in that environment, the decimation of nature and exploitation of human beings by rampant and merciless capitalism. All those aspects bob up in LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR, but human nature provides the central propeller. We see human nature battling for money, killing and putting one's life at risk for what amounts to a pittance. Envy, greed emerge as the main motivators as Mario (Montand), M Jo (Vanel), Folco Lulli (Luigi) and Bimba (Van Eyck) battle inch by inch the vagaries of potholed roads that can instantly set off the nitro, atmospheric conditions, rotting wooden bridges, and all manner of natural obstacles as the shipment of nitroglycerin nerve-rackingly slowly moves across the 300 miles to an oil fire.\n\nPlus, of course, the deceit immanent in the human soul, which constantly seeks an opportunity to spring a trap on a fellow traveler, not to mention that if only one survives, he gets the whole $2,000 booty. In a Venezuela - a minicosmos for South America - brimming with atrocious poverty and backwardness, that amount seems a fortune to those men, and to any of the other jilted competitors, who would sell their souls to be able to go on that almost suicidal drive.\n\nYet, ironically, some kind of personal interest-driven loyalty also develops and connects these individuals, pushing them deeper and deeper into God-forsaken territory. I do not recall a single mention of religion. Yet the cocktail of French, English, Castillian and Italian languages offers a veritable Tower of Babel in a largely uncivilized, uncultured, and even illiterate setting. There is no spiritual authority, higher moral value here. The love that Linda (Vera Clouzot) feels for Mario, an almost telepathic connection, as the ending will show, is probably the closest connection between two persons in the film.\n\nAll told, excellent nitty gritty, taut script, tapping the complexity of human emotions and states of mind under such trying conditions. Exceptional direction by Clouzot, superlative performances from Montand, Vanel, Van Eyck, wonderful cinematography and film editing. Intelligent film with many meanings simmering beneath the surface of an action flick.\n\nAbsolute masterpiece of this very specific type of road journey. 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a great action-triller classic, the suspense really never slackens. It also has a strange, dark humoristic element which is fed mainly by the fact that all the main protagonists are far away from home and don't exactly know what they're doing.\n\nThe location somewhere in a tropical or subtropical land is a dead end place. Europeans from different nations, all males, strand there and would like to go away as quickly as they can. They are a curious bunch of crooks of different ages and social stratas, no sense of friendship exists between them. And then, there are the Americans (called amerlocques, in true slang fashion). They work the local oil fields and are presented (in the European's comments, that is) as a greedy breed apart who will move on as soon as the resources are exhausted. They even have their own cemetery, comments the main character, all prefabricated! There are many of these quirky lines throughout the movie. The cross language style works very well in this movie, hearing the original sound certainly adds to the pleasure.\n\nThe Europeans are hired by the Americans to transport highly explosive nitroglycerin to an uncontrollably burning oil well. They cannot resist doing this high risk job which might guarantee their return to Europe. One team consists of a German and an Italian. The second of two Frenchmen, and they, of course, are the main characters. Yves Montand and Charles Vanel make a great team. Especially Vanel is really brilliant. At first sight they are just the typical old gangster and young, admiring hood couple. But they both have a strange kind of goofiness which makes me suspect strongly that the director had Laurel and Hardy in mind \u0096 the physical frame of the two fits to a T, anyway.\n\nThe two greatest scenes: Montand and Vanel sitting in a little park (sort of) in the dead end town. In the background a sculpturally shaped black woman takes an open air shower (full nudity in 1953, no less!). The woman stoops and starts screaming. A large, hairy spider moves tentatively over a white towel. Montand gets up, steps over and crushes it with his white canvas slipper beaming like Stan Laurel, kind of \u0084ain't I the most daring guy around?\" Then there is the problem of crossing a large puddle of crude oil with the truck. Vanel walks in front, checking for obstacles. His legs get entangled in a large branch already under tension from the truck's wheels. Montand does not dare stop the truck, Vanel submerges in the puddle, gets run over and comes up totally black. It is horrific but in a perverse way also comical. The truck gets stuck in the puddle, Montand drags Vanel out, then he has to take a dive himself to fix a cable. He comes up black and black Vanel, lying deadly wounded against a tree, toasts to him with a thermos flask. It's as dark as humor can possibly get."

Mario is a Eurotrash clown, but muy macho, while Linda (Vera Clouzot), the \"half-savage\" adoring victim of Mario's apache, is impossible to portray in post-feminist film. Imagine a brunette Paris Hilton sans skank. If you've seen Sorcerer, Wages of Fear looks profoundly silly in places, especially the unsophisticated ending and brotherhood of laboring men ritual. Like Sorceror, the film features nude Yanamamo Indian ridicule of stupid white guys. One of my favorite movies, anthropologically speaking."

        "review_detailed_main": "SPOILER\n\nOverall this is a classic, no doubt! There are some moments where a bit more attention to logic and detail would have hoisted it so much higher around attention risk and explosives.\n\nWhy they are transporting Nitro long after Nobel had stabilised it to Dynamite is not clear. Seems it was made 'on site' after the Wells Fargo Office incident of 1866.\n\nA bit of Cirque Du Soleil wobbling on OHS nightmare planks whilst loading the goods by the 'workers' presages impending events.\n\nGenerally though it holds up reasonably well until the boulder in the road.\n\nIt takes much 'golly gosh darn why us?' before note they note they have explosives... (wow!) which would be the first choice of any road builder.\n\nLuigi hops up and 'drills a neat hole with a steel bar the size of a mans forearm in the time it takes Bimba who seems to know his stuff, to wobble precariously off the truck with a jerry can of Nitro, and set himself up for a Nitro Head Spliter by syphoning it orally.\n\nThe 'rope' suspending the hammer is clearly safety fuse but logical they had some with the Nitro but no detonators. Not 'rope'. Now this is lit and suddenly they remember, having backed up the trucks, the 'rock rain'. Too late. This is where Gerard Depardieu in Jean De Florette wears it. Salaud! But given the size of the flask and the position in the sometime porous rock it would be unlikely to project upwards. And miraculously the road is clear bar a black patch of burnt ah... imagination.\n\nNow we get to the Luigi and Bimba crater. No sing of the truck or the guys: given blast is going down and forwards in respect of the truck. No metal nothing. They have I think 42 cans each assume 5 gallon each. So about 800 litres. One lunch thermos full produces blast 1 (rock) whilst 42 cans produces blast B. Um. Blast B looks about right sadly given in 2016 we have many Explosives in Truck Bombs in recent history to compare to.\n\nPedantic? Perhaps but otherwise its brilliant. I recall 'Mario running down Jo' years ago as a kid. It stayed with me. OBriens voice in the office sounds like Daniel Plainview (There Will Be Blood 2007), and the sense of trapped listlessness in the town at the start echoes the despair in Heart of Darkness (Conrad) and recalls parts of The Passenger (Antonioni) and goes some way to explaining the behaviour of the characters. All filmed in France too.\n\nThe ending? A 'moral ending' with the wages of xyz in his pocket was 'correct' if rather illogical & smacked of 'how can we finish this?' Mario oblivious to basic risk having survived the trauma of the scenario and killing Jo, then literally waltzes off the road with his money.\n\nSalaud! Oh yeah, the English subs on my version didn't quite reflect some of the abuse hurled in French.\n\nI have worked around but not with explosives in mining and have been in a 'rock rain'. A little attention to detail would have made this great movie 'complete'"

        "review_detailed_main": "Hired by a corrupt American oil company to transport volatile chemicals across dangerous terrain, four men risk life and limb in pursuit of a rich payday. The job's much too risky for the refinery's usual, unionized employees, but these louts are just desperate enough to throw caution to the wind and wager everything on their own driving skills. They've had their fill of kicking around a dusty, barren, South American nowhere town, waiting for work to materialize, and the mere thought of a big score has them spending the money before they've left the garage.\n\nThe first act takes a while to find its footing, but once the rubber hits the road this is a master class in compounding suspense. Splitting time behind the wheel in two large, under-prepared equipment trucks, the men are soon at each other's throats, stressed by the trying conditions and ever-present threat of mortal disaster. They weren't exactly friendly before this endeavor, starting fights and waving weapons in a bar the night before, and the smothering anxiety only serves to fan those flames. Together, they're forced to wind around a steep, jagged mountain road, cross a field of divots at high speed and slide through a lake of spilled oil, doing their best to cooperate (and often failing at that) while remaining hyper-aware of their payload's touchy nature. The jerrycans of nitroglycerin that line their beds are so fickle, even a bad bounce could blow them all to kingdom come.\n\nYou just know that, eventually, something's going wrong. It's tough not to nibble a fingernail as the twin teams navigate one obstacle after another, balanced precariously on the metaphorical tightrope. When disaster finally strikes, the film doesn't knock our socks off. It focuses on the shockwave over the shock and awe, a whisper of rushing air that sweeps crumbled tobacco from a half-rolled cigarette and then departs, like spirits headed into the afterlife. It seemed destined that only one truck would finish this adventure - the oil company suspected as much - but the real question is, can the survivors still find a way to band together and overcome? And, if so, at what cost?"

They don't have enough money to pay for a ticket out of town. The town's main employment is Southern Oil Company. There's a fire in the oil fields and the company needs nitroglycerin explosives to put it out. Foreman Bill O'Brien hires Mario, Luigi, Bimba and Smerloff to drive the dangerous cargo to put out the fire. When Smerloff fails to show, Mr. Jo gets the job.\n\nThe first half is a bit slow as the movie spends time with the various characters meandering in this dusty town. The second half is one of the most thrilling drives around. It is a better thrill ride than most modern movies can achieve. The desperation and the sense of impending doom never leaves this trip."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has supposedly won the 1953 Grand Prize at Cannes. The plot is revolving around a group of men who are penniless at a place (supposedly some South American Country) and accept a dangerous job of transporting some explosive chemicals through the rugged country. I was not quite sure of the setting of the movie, whether they were trying to name the title on poverty under which the men were or the adventure comparing with the risk of losing their life. Either ways the movie is full of nice scenes of camaraderie. The outdoor sets for this movie is extensive, and the depiction of the 1950's South America isn't that easy. All the places give us a very nice and nostalgic view on how beautiful the place was. The European task force consisting Messrs Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel act important roles in the movie. The movie is about the conflicts of the actors needing money for different reason as for the emotions they go though in course of their journey to the land of no return. Really a master piece and even though many claim Sorcerer is a better movie than this (it is the 1971 remake of this movie) I personally feel this is a better movie. I rate this one 9/10"

Until the real journey begins we get to see a lot of character stuff. Things we may not see in modern day movies - maybe.\n\nHaving said that, the movie almost got me completely by surprise when a couple of minutes in we see a cleavage shot. Now I'm not prude, so I wasn't bothered by it. I was however surprised to see such a scene, that was borderline nudity. Then again the man whom that effort was aimed at, wasn't too excited about it. There are some who even attested the movie may have some homoerotic tendencies. I didn't really see that, I'd attest that to male bonding, but maybe it is there. It doesn't really do the movie any harm.\n\nHaving said that, there are quite some really good effects (one involving a leg, that really looked quite real). The movie might end on a note the viewer may expect, even if it almost seems unnecessary. Then again, it's the best way to end it - this really is great filmmaking and acting. Even if the slow pace may turn some viewers off"

        "review_title": "The Wages of Fear is Explosive Cinema!",
        "review_detailed_main": "One of the most deeply and disturbingly nihilistic films ever made, as well as one of the most heart-pounding thrillers on record, Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear is as much about the origin of manufactured fear as it is about the folly of courage that feeds on it. But as lofty and abstract as Clouzot's allegory may be, his execution is vibrantly physical and immediate. Turning the screws with a relentlessness that impresses even in this age of the ruthless, high-tech thriller, Clouzot strings together situations of vividly, almost sadistically imagined danger.\n\nSet in the sunbaked, impoverished, dusty, fictional banana republic of Las Piedras in Latin America that is under the thumb of an American oil company, 'The Wages of Fear' adopts a fable-like form. The town is bursting with desperate foreign derelicts, stranded there without money and who will do anything to earn the price of a ticket back to civilization. When the American oil company needs two truckloads of volatile nitroglycerine to put out a runaway fire at a remote oil-drilling site, a desperate foursome belonging to different points on the map is hired to man the two trucks for 300 miles through a treacherous terrain, at the end of which liberation lies. The wages of their fears will be salvation. The trucks are equipped with nothing more than ordinary spring suspensions. They are only given a 50-50 chance, but are offered good pay ($2,000 for one week of work). Now the excitement begins!\n\nWhen Clouzot's quartet decides to take up the job, the motive is greed and the results are as black a vision of human infidelity as any. The cliff-edge tension is nerve-wracking as they stumble upon one roadblock after another \u2013 a hairpin curve, a boulder on the road, passing through an obstructing pool of oil, riding for long stretches with explosives on roads that are bumpy and finally their own stress. Henri-Georges Clouzot successfully conveys both- situations that shiver with ice- cold suspense and the downbeat theme of fear and its various manifestations, with exceptional stewardship.\n\nThe Wages of Fear is a frantic, vicious, existentialist howl that not only manages to laugh; it goes grinning into the void. You can do nothing but sit there in sheer awe, waiting for the screen to explode!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The wages of fear\" is perhaps the most well known movie of Henry Georges Clouzot, but in my opinion it is not his best.\n\nThe middle of the film is brilliant but the opening and the ending are a little bit weaker.\n\nThe opening is a little too long and despite its length it fails to introduce the main characters in a proper way. In the United States the opening was controversial because of the way an American company treats its employees in a Third World country. If Clouzot wanted to make a point about economic imperialsm by big companies Mikhail Kalatozov did a much better job in the opening scenes of his \"Soy Cuba\" (1964).\n\nThere are a lot of films in which the happy ending feels somehow artificial. \"The wages of fear\" is one of the few films with an artificial \"unhappy ending\", this makes the ending however not less far fetched.\n\nLet's concentrate however on the brilliant middle part. Clouzot has been named the French Hitchcock and never more rightly so than in \"The wages of fear\". Hitchcock made a distinction between surprise (a bomb unexpectedly explodes) and suspense (there is a bomb ticking and the spectator knows it (the main character possibly not)). \"The wages of fear\" is suspense in its purest sense. Trucks that are in essence riding bombs crossing the bumpy roads of the jungle."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wages of Fear is a classic film that has unbelievable levels of suspense. Why is it suspenseful? Well, if you have a cargo of high explosives in the back of your truck that are unstable and may explode at any second if you hit a pothole or big bump, you will be driving at 8-10 miles an hour and be sweating every minute of the way. You might be making thousands of dollars, but you are also risking your life on a minute by minute basis. That is the basic premise of the film. Why would anyone do this? Desperate people who need money would; and there are plenty of those around. This film was so good that it was made many years later as Sorcerer, with a much bigger budget. Both films are great, so catch either one."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film starts off with a setting which is very reminiscent of the opening to Huston's 'Treasure of Sierra Madre' in the way that we meet a number of Europeans stuck in a South American town where literally nothing happens. They have no job prospects and they don't have the financial means required to leave the deadbeat town. Although the opening act of the film is a bit uneven,it still works to make the viewer well acquainted with the characters. Henri- Georges Clouzot manages to convey the utter disenchantment and poverty of the characters, which helps to underline why these men would feel desperate to find a way out of this town and will probably go to any lengths to materialise that. There is also a very clear anti-American capitalism statement being made in the opening act. The Southern Oil Company(SOC) who end up employing the men for the central mission is portrayed as this monstrously exploitative entity that doesn't care about people's lives as long as their materialistic oil needs are met. It is also interesting to note that the characters themselves remain pretty unlikable in the first part of the film. But when the come together in their mission and as we spend time with them on the road and fear for their lives, they become more and more engaging.\n\nAs soon as the 4 primary characters jump on the trucks and start the mission, the film completely changes. It becomes a fascinatingly exciting, edge of the seat thrill-fest as the characters encounter and overcome a series of obstacles. This was my first viewing of a Clouzot film, but I can clearly see why he was nicknamed the 'French Hitchcock'. Clouzot's tour de force direction in each of these obstacle sequences is very reminiscent of Hitchcock. He ratchets up the tension through a combination of various elements like meticulous use of silence and ambient noises, precise camera placement and absolutely pitch perfect editing. I think every single person watching this film will at at least some point or another find themselves on the edge of the seat during the film due to the sheer effectiveness of the white-knuckle-ride experience that ' The Wages of Fear' offers.\n\nA clear theme that is being explored in the film is the irony and the mysterious ways of the concept of fate and mortality. The manner in which all the characters meet their respective fates in the film are genuinely unpredictable, sudden and unquestionably ironic.\n\nIn conclusion, 'The Wages of Fear' is a must watch for everyone as it has something to offer for fans of a wide range of genres. Even though I think the opening act is comparatively a little uneven, however in an overall sense, the film is a knockout and has directorial mastery written all over it. Highly Recommended."

The story: after an oil well catches fire, four men are hired to drive trucks loaded with nitroglycerin to the oil well, where the explosives are needed to extinguish the flames.\n\nEvery time I watch this one I can feel the heat in many senses. Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli and Peter Van Eyck show some fine acting skills and are a match for a classic like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (starring Humphrey Bogart). The story is based on the novel Le Salaire de la peur by Georges Arnaud (published 1950). No doubt, this one is a classic piece of French cinematic wonders. Watch at least once in your life."

        "review_detailed_main": "A group of men including Mario, played by Yves Montand live in an isolated, run down desert village in South America, which is essentially supporting a local U. S. oil company outlet. To get out you need a flight and for that you need money and to get money you need a job. Mario and 3 others are offered $2,000 each if they will transfer nitro glycerine to an oil well that has caught fire. The slightest vibration or increase in heat will set it off - it is incredibly dangerous, but all the men desperately need the money and take on what will be a shattering existential crisis.\n\nEasily up there as a movie great with tension you could cut with a knife. There are a number of incidents which I won't give away that seem so intense you you can barely watch. These are handled brilliantly by Clouzot that they seem completely real and you can imagine the actors really going through it to get these great scenes.\n\nThe actors are universally excellent with Montand giving one of his finest performances although he is equalled, maybe even surpassed by Charles Vanel as his co driver. To see these 2 men's characters change so much throughout the film is extraordinary, particularly in comparison to the excellent opening scenes in the village where their characters behave so differently to that which they will dramatically become. A masterpiece\n\nPS - I didn't care much for the ending."
