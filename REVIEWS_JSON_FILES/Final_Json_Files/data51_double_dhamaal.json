        "review_detailed_main": "CAUTION: When you are about to watch this film please don't forget to take a headache tablet. Yes I am not kidding mate. Just one word describes the film in short- \"Torture\". Pathetic film with bad humor and a rubbish storyline. Too much of mimicry that doesn't connect with the audiences. On the contrary they get bugged watching when it gets repeated again and again. Utter nonsense story . On the plus side lies Satish Kaushik . You,ll definitely enjoy his presence in the film. The first half of the film does include a few scenes that are enjoyable.But post interval is fully on the negative side. Bringing gorillas in between makes matter more worse. Stupidity personified. Talking about the performances, Javed is good,Ritesh is silly,Ashish and Arshad are average. Sanjay Dutt- The biggest disappointment of the film. Another factor that doesn't click is the music of the film. I,ll go for 3 out of 10. Watch Dhammal 1 again instead of watching this one. I bet u,ll enjoy that rather than this silly film."

        "review_title": "There is nothing double in here but somebody please stop these unequal sequels. (Review By Bobby Sing)",
        "review_detailed_main": "After watching this comic sequel from Indra Kumar, the man who has excelled himself in drama and overdoing things, I had a Deja-Vu kind of the feeling since the experience was pretty much same to that of watching 'Bheja Fry 2' last week. In other words, here too, where the first part was hugely successful due to its copied status taking sequences directly from its various sources, the second part is not anywhere close to that, making an effort to be an original. But on the other hand, the film is not a complete loser and still manages to entertain you in bits and parts.\n\nTaking off from the concluding scenes of DHAMAAL, it revolves around a story in which all the characters try to fool each other with their own planned con-acts. Needless to say that it's a loud and absurd kind of comedy based on some weird but comic writing, made with a single aim to make you laugh. And I really don't mind watching these kinds of movies leaving my brains at home. But, only if they are capable enough to keep me engaged thoroughly with their entertaining inputs. Sadly that's where DOUBLE DHAMAAL falls short and further with a completely no show by Sanjay Dutt (the main magnetic pull in the movie), one walks out felling less served than promised in its promos.\n\nAt times the jokes and one liners work well even when they are ridiculously written with double meanings, full of foul language, even featuring Gorillas swinging to a Bollywood Song kissing each other. But the actors, deliver these dialogues in such a way that you don't mind laughing at them whole heartedly, particularly in the sequences featuring the four friends together on the screen. Post interval the pace keeps dropping at various places with some boring and unwanted songs except \"Jalebi Bai\" which both has a melody and visual value incorporated in it. But other than that it's a completely uninspiring musical score from Anand Raaj Anand, who has returned after a long gap. Visually the film is better than its first part DHAMAAL and Cinematography works fine both in local and foreign locations. The script keeps adding new twists and turns in the story-plot generating more spaces of laughter regularly. Still, somehow the continuous entertaining value is missing in the film and there seems to be an overdose of everything, which as a result leaves you less satisfied in the end. Moreover the film ends quite abruptly and the director looks like so over-confident of his product that he clearly leaves a message indicating towards its third part.\n\nIn few words, the best part of the film remains its four Jokers along with Satish Kaushik returning to his old form after a long time. Obviously the best of the four remain Arshad Warsi and Ritesh Deshmukh as per their star status. But this time Ritesh is better than everyone in the film coming up with a superb performance followed by Arshad Warsi with his impeccable timing. However, Arshad posing as a funny Sardar in the second half once again takes the community for a ride which should ideally be a matter of concern for the community leaders. Both Aashish & Javed Jaffery play their roles brilliantly but I felt Javed having a less impactful role than in DHAMAAL. Apart from these four Jokers the next surprise joker is Satish Kaushik who is a treat to watch as the Bhai speaking some hilarious dialogues in the first half, but at the same time Zakhir Hussain as the second Bhai gets wasted.\n\nThe biggest disappointment in the movie remains Sanjay Dutt who surprisingly doesn't have a completely comic role in the film as the con-man accompanied by the two ladies. And I really missed watching Sanjay participating in few comedy scenes with the four fools. Mallika Sherawat as Sanjay's lover is just perfect but Kangna looks like a misfit in her role as she tries too hard to bring in some laughs on her own.\n\nSumming up, I can surely say that there is nothing DOUBLE in here in this new DHAMAAL and few may find it even less enjoyable than its original one. Still it can be watched once for its performances by the five jokers (including Satish) but somebody please stop this mad trend of making sequels which don't really justify their own set standards in the past."

        "review_detailed_main": "Short review: this is the biggest pile of manure that I have ever seen, ranking right down there with some of the worst films in cinema history.\n\nLong review: pretty much the same as the short review, with way more words to convey how awful it is.\n\nFirst up, this was supposed to be a comedy, right? I only ask as it is anything but funny. Two odd hours long and seriously there is not a single laugh in the whole film. Perhaps they were aiming at a spoof-style of film but missed the mark completely? Quite where to start with the awfulness is hard to determine, it is that bad across the board.\n\nThe script is pretty atrocious, clich\u00e9d to within an inch of its life, lacking any sort of originality whatsoever. It didn't even manage to rip off any decent scenes from any other similar sorts of films in an effort to at least try and lift itself out of the mire.\n\nThis of course meant that the actors had little to work with but that hardly excuses the atrociousness of the performances given here. If this is the best script that Sanjay Dutt can get to work with, we can pretty much accept that his career has well and truly gone down the toilet big time. His performance was about D-grade at best and pretty much laughable. Seriously, he needs to retire if this is the best he can do. As for the rest? Oh my lord, they must have been desperate for a pay check. All the main cast were woeful, putting in appalling performances of the highest order. At times they descended to outright vomit-inducing degrees of ineptitude and offensiveness.\n\nOne can only presume that this was at the instruction of the director as surely no self-respecting actor would descend to the level of awfulness seen here. Indra Kumar does not have much of a filmography as a director after 21 years and on the evidence of this film it is obvious why - there is nothing on earth that would induce me to watch another film done by him. Yes, this one is that bad.\n\nOn the positive side of things, cinematography wasn't bad, editing was reasonable and the film looks great.\n\nA truly, truly awful film. Should be avoided at all costs unless you feel the need to be reduced to a state of depression. On the evidence here, depression is what Indian cinema is in if this sort of tripe can get made."

Talking of performances... the most disappointing was kangana ranaut...it was as if she was picked from some roadside and pushed to act...mallika shehrawat as usual had nothing to offer. sanjay dutt's acting was lame... even riteish deshmukh was a big disappointment. sp i would conclude that this movie is a perfect mixture of bad script worse direction and awful acting...so if u want to see how bad a film can be go for it ....else look out for something else"

There are some scenes that make you laugh . But most of the other comedy scenes are double meaning and are loud. There is no new treatment given to the movie.\n\nIndra Kumar was top of the directory during 80's and 90's with his hits like Beta , Dil , Ishq . expectations were high but it didn't worked out in his favor.\n\nAanand Raj Aanand has given good music.

Good dance numbers. ============\n\nMy Fav Pick are :\n\n1. Chak Kudiye by Mikka : Rap and a mixture of Bhangra. 2.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been a little disappointed in the past with sequels to comedies; that include Hangover 2 and Bheja Fry 2. They problem with some has been the utter similarity to earlier part or complete disparity. Double dhamaal has retained the continuity and still has a difference and fresh view, and that makes it better sequel.\n\nStory takes up from where the first movie ended. Some reviews say that first movie was better and this one is totally different and thus a drag on the franchise. I say that if it had been a similar story, like in Hangover 2, same reviewers would have then disregarded this movie as a total rip. The plot, although shallow, is the logical extension to the earlier started story. And no one promised that it was to be an intellect's movie. If you are OK with Singh is King(No similarity) then what is wrong with this plot. Everyone has done a good job at portraying the characters. One problem with the screenplay is Sanjay Dutt's absence in comedy scenes; or maybe thats the scriptwriter's issue. Sanjay Dutt has portrayed the ever winning con-man and has close to zero screen time in comedy scenes. Baman(Ashish) has done a great job at playing a sleazy, nymphomaniac girl. Movie does not have as much skin-show as one would expect thanks to Mallika. The item song \"Jalebi Bai\" is the only time that you get to see the Mallika as what people pay to come watch her for. Kangna has improved a bit after Tanu weds Manu though she has little to do. Her role is dispensable and she serves as just eye candy and in a couple of situations a center piece.\n\nAlthough the last quarter of the movie is a bit dragging, with oodles of wisecracks this sequel will give you a lot of funny moments."

First half had some scenes that make you laugh but second half is extremely horrible with no logic at all.\n\nPerformances - Sanjay Dutt disappoints. The 4 some are okay (well the imitating scenes are more irritating than funny). Mallika Sherawat and Kangana Ranaut are also bad. Kangana Ranaut is most irritating of all actors. Satish Kaushik is great in his small role and his scenes are best in movie. Rest all pass muster.\n\nMusic - Music is not up to mark at all.

        "review_detailed_main": "I really hoped this would tickle my funny bone, thanks to the critical and commercial success of the 1st film Dhamaal (2007) which truly deserved a sequel, however, this falls a bit short of even a decent sequel. Rather than double comedy it was barely more than half entertaining. Like most film sequels, Double Dhamaal (\"Dhamaal 2\") takes it's predecessor 2007 Bollywood comedy film Dhamaal's basic story frame/template and tries to expand on it and tries to make it bigger by adding new ideas for con-acts, new places like in Macau and Homg Kong, China (overseas) and new supporting characters. Although it is fast and brightly colored (more colorful as seen on the release poster and comedic) to impress and entertain the Dhamaal fans, it is too frantically silly to entertain the whole family. It is low on freshly squeezed comedic energy and also reliant on slapstick humour. Several of the comedy acts and jokes and lines are recycled from the first film. The film should also elaborate on how exactly the four friends found the disguise costumes and how they switch in and out. (Did they buy them from a clothing story with the money they had or dd they ambush someone in an alley and strip them of their clothes, kill the person and put on their clothing or did they shoplift?) Overall, Double Dhamaal isn't really Dhamaal 2. The plot seems to be thin at times and gets boring and tedious and confusing. It's Double Trouble. Arshad, Aashish, Ritesh and Javed are good as the four friends as well as Sanjay as Kabir. However, I felt that Kamini, Kiya and Mohisn Bhai's roles were unnecessary. But Bata Bhai rocks as a part time illegal don/gangster. The beginning of the film where it takes off right after Dhamaal ends as well as the Devil's Bar comedy scene is funny but that's not enough to save this movie. You're better off watching the 1st 2007 film. My review: 2.5/5. I just hope Total Dhamaal is way better."
