Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, bratty, and virginal girlfriend AMY. As he returns from work to... a random house... he finds his \"friends,\" the sexually confusing red-shorted KYLE and the truly revolting sluttish DAPHNE. They are soon joined by Daphne's boyfriend, the trigger-happy sex-crazed macho lunkhead NICK. And there's the title creatures, horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart's desire. Kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy, yucky woman in spandex. Nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria-- I mean nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne's already a disgusting slut, so she doesn't have a heart's desire. Along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song. The hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up. \"Citizen Kane\" cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of American cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "No matter how you look at this movie, it is just awful.\n\nIf you view it as a horror, then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets.\n\nIf you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame.\n\nIf it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a B**ch!\n\nIf you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero.\n\nAs you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining. As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie. This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre. Critters looked pretty good, so did the Ghoulies, heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these. The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable. The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes...this movie is just utterly stupid. I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum (which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21. Give me a break, I am 25 and I look younger than any of them."

They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell, one suspects. There's no real plot - just \"goblins - kill!\" and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience."

A loser named Kevin (Tom Bartlett) is trying to make his annoying and non-supportive girlfriend proud of him, so he takes a job as a security guard and unleashes a band of stupid-looking puppets called Hobgoblins, who kill people by giving them what they really want. The way this leads to people getting killed is very idiotic. The hobgoblins go on a rampage which results in one guy getting hurt a little and a car getting destroyed. The ending is also stupid and not worth bringing up.\n\nThe acting is the worst I have ever seen. None of the actors went anywhere after this movie, nor did any of them deserve to. The special effects, if you can really call them that, were unforgivable. The hobgoblins themselves are the most fake looking puppets I have ever seen.\n\nUnless in MST3K, this movie should be avoided at all costs. I am only praying that some day the government will burn every copy still around, or maybe use it as a weapon in the army someday."

Well, see that wall on the other side of your room? Run right at it, top speed, face first. See, THAT is cooler than this movie.\n\nYou dare to doubt?

Very simple, the movie is about a bunch of Munchies-like gremlins on the loose, exploiting people's desires for fame, fortune, prowess, and of course, sex in ways that end up with people getting killed. But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools), the writing is so forced (such as the oft-described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left... and this isn't the first time in the movie this happens), and the story is so... rarely given attention (hence the MST3K riff about a \"law in the future where films have to be made by FILMmakers), that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen.

After a lengthy but suspenseful tour through the corridors of a mysterious storage facility, a group of frightening creatures known as 'hobgoblins' are released from a wicked bank vault within the facility. These demonic beings posses the ability to take the lives of humans by making their innermost wishes come true, hover at human shoulder height at will, and drive golf carts. What follows is a twisted ride into the psyche, as a gang of hormone-laden teenagers witness the horror of the hobgoblins, and their own inner selves.\n\nWriter/Director/Director of Photography/Editor/Producer Rick Sloane allows the audience no pause from the terror of the sickening creatures, and the atmosphere and execution is overall spot on. Forgivably Freudian, the movie posits that when the primitive urges of the id infect the aspirations of the superego, what wishes we hope to fulfill will inevitably doom the self, but through the use of rationality and technology, even the most misguided soul can be retrieved from apparent demise.\n\nUnfortunately, the film is held back from inducing true insight in its audience due to some unfortunate use of prosthetic eyebrows on Mr. Culver. This distracting little mishap did cost the film one star in this review.\n\nIn the end, \"HOBGOBLINS\" left me with an optimistic view of humanity. For if we can successfully survive the onslaught of such abominations that attempt to let our darker selves consume us, what else is there that could truly destroy us? I found the title ultimately an impeccable choice, since as we all know: hobgoblins are more introspective than regular goblins.\n\n*********/10 stars."

The movie just makes no sense 1 person dies in a very cheesy way maybe two Nick's sergeant gets blown up but he could have been an illusion. The Hobgoblins can cause people to see things but other people can see someone else's illusion which is solid to other people to. This is easily one of the cheesiest movies i ever saw The beginning is weird the middle is Boring and unintentionally funny and the End has to be seen to be believed MCcreedy could have blown up the vault at any time so he's responsible for the whole movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't review this without mentioning MST3K, since even a tenth of the reviews and responses this film has received would not be here if Hobgoblins hadn't been featured in their 9th season. As of this writing, it's still available on DVD in Rhino's MST3K volume 8 boxed set. While there's no official consensus, I believe that this it the only true \"Maw of Hell\" caliber film they did for Sci-fi channel (see the Amazing Colossal Episode Guide). While most movies in that category tend to come from the the mid 60s (the oily period), this one from the 80s was far more excruciating for me since that was the decade of my childhood. Nearly every positive memory of 80s pop culture was unearthed, beaten with garden tools, urinated on, and then reburied in a humorous position. And I wasn't even one of the badly scarred viewers.\n\nSince there are already over 150 reviews of this film on this site, they probably don't need another synopsis of this movie. To explain just how bad this movie is, I need to tell a story of the second time I saw it with a group of people, in the spring of 2000. I'd already shown these three friends half of Rhino's then released tapes, including Manos, Eegah, and Red Zone Cuba, all Maw of Hell caliber. It was a Friday night, so we stopped after the first quarter to watch Space Ghost, and the second for Gundam Wing, so the wretchedness unfolded upon them slowly. With no show to pause for after the third quarter, I made to fast forward through the commercial, only to be halted by their cries, begging me to stop. The youngest among us was actually curled into a fetal position, shuddering. They implored me to just give them a few minutes to recover, to which I responded, \"Oh, well I know it's bad, but I guess I may be a little desensitized since...\" Now these people were close friends with whom I had shared much, like confessing attractions to various cartoon characters as 3:00 AM, and my most bizarre substitute for toilet paper I've ever resorted to story. So I had freaked them out routinely in the past, but when I finished that sentence with \"...I've already seen this 3 or 4 times.\", that was the only time in my life that I have looked into the faces of other human beings and seen genuine horror. If you were just going by their reactions, you'd have sworn I'd said something more along the lines of, \"Well, I know live puppies SEEM hard to chew at fist, but after my dog had her third litter...\" And this was the MSTed version. I shudder to think of the effects of the uncut version, especially for the MST crew themselves, who had to watch this 10 times in a week. I'm not sure the show completely recovered after this; a little of the love seemed to be gone.\n\nSo like I said: read other reviews for a synopsis. The point of mine was to warn all novices to watch as many other MST3K episodes as possible to soften the blow of this one. I've seen evidence of short-term mind-warping in viewers who made this their first MST, and long term trauma in those who actually watched the regular version. Follow these guidelines, and you'll find it a least as funny as it is painful."

It realizes it's garbage and makes no apologies--a bad movie that never tries to be anything more! The film is about an old movie studio that's no longer functioning. When young guys are given jobs here as security guards, they have a habit of dying--and the old guy working with them doesn't do a whole lot to stop this until our hero (i.e., a big wuss) saves the old guy and the oldster tells him about the hobgoblins that live there. These creatures grant people whatever wish they want but end up killing them in the process. A not particularly good deal if you ask me. When these things get loose and attack the neighborhood, it's time to destroy these malevolent pests.\n\nThe film is an obvious knock-off of GREMLINS, though with practically no budget and actors who are ALL worse than Zack Galligan!!! But the most hilariously bad part of the film are the hobgoblins which are nothing more than cheap puppets--not much more realistic than ones kids might get from Toys R Us! They obviously are not animated in any way and flail about like stuffed animals--really, really crappy ones.\n\nOverall, there's really not reason to watch this dumb film unless you are a masochist who likes bad films! Don't say I didn't warn you!"

Look out for non-existent direction. Look out for bad pacing. And to add further insult to injury, look out for horrendous acting. Hobgoblins has every single one of those.

The mystery, the suspense, the comedy. The Oscar worthy performances and sepecial effects. This film had it all. One referred to it as Titanic for the 80's and I couldn't agree more.\n\nSome Spoilers (Movie in a nutshell) Young man takes job as a security guard at Movie Studio (no doubt the Warner Bros. or Fox lot) and is warned by his elderly mentor/supervisor on the job to not open the vault. Unfortunately he is a hard learner. The Hobgoblins escape and wreck havok on the town (specifically the new young guards home which coincedentally is the first house they travel to - Oscar worthy screenplay, perfect execution) The chaos that ensues as the small ankle high creatures attack (somehow at face height - another mystery of the Hobgoblins that will leave you boggled), and the creatures ability to enter the mind (and not really kill you - pressumably to toy with you a bit then kill you eventually somehow - the writers do it again), the climax at Club Scum (where the Hobgobs run amok and somehow manage not to startle the all the club goers who continue to drink as if the hobgobs aren't there - another mind trick no doubt. Still trying to unravel that mystery)... I could go on and on. I'm overwhelmed with the sheer magnificene that is Hobgoblins. Please rent this film. From what I understand M. Night got his Surprise ending idea from this film. A must for up and coming filmmakers 10/10.\n\nP.S. - I heard the Director of this film (R. Sloane) passed on Titanic. Huh after this film he had the power to pass on anything. Hobgoblins was every Director wishes they could reach (I'm talking to you Spielberg, Scott, Cameron). Heck he never needed to make another film again."

They make people's fantasies come true, then kill them. Everything about this movie is just horrible. The characters are really dumb, and extremely clich\u00e9d. One particularly brainless scene consists of a girlfriend getting mad at her man because he lost at a garden tool battle to a man back from the army. Another very brainless scene has a man sitting in his car while his date tried to shove it down a cliff, and he just sits there like a moron. Any line or scene in the film that is meant to be funny, ends up getting less laughs than the \"scary\" scenes, which involve teens holding stuffed animals to their faces. You'll probably enjoy this as a bad comedy, but as a movie, this is really bad.\n\nMy rating: BOMB/****. 91 mins. Rated R for sex and violence."

It's so bad, that you find yourself wondering what you could have possibly done in a past life to deserve this kind of torture. Was I Hitler, or Stalin, or Martha Stewart? (I know she's not dead, but I needed her for the joke). It's so bad (How bad was it?), that to this day, it remains the one episode of MST3K that I can't get all the way through. Not even Mike and the bots can help this piece of skunk vomit. Actually, imagine if a skunk could vomit out of it's ass. And then Satan himself (or as I like to call him, Rick Sloane) hocked a big loogie on it. That's almost close to how bad this movie is.\n\nThe characters are unlikeable, zero-dimensional, and stupid beyond all human reason. The dialogue is actually, physically painful.

Walk them through a public area and ask people to rate how badly they want to punch the actor in the face (1-10 scale), its hard to take anyone seriously while you are thinking about how satisfying it would be to punch him in the face.\n\nThe plot isn't really worth mentioning outside of the fact that at one point the guys in the movie face off in a battle of masculinity by swinging rakes at each other. I was going to attempt something humorous about the rake fighting but I thought the fact that they were rake fighting is funny enough. No need to call the retarded kid stupid I guess.

One girl is a slut but has a puchability rating of 8.4 not to be confused with her hitability rating of a mere 4.2, sad.

So, um, what were they doing? Jumping up and down? You can't even get your clothes off that fast, can you? Maybe you liked the rake battle. Like the fight scene in \"They Live\", it just goes on forever, for no real reason. The difference is that \"They Live\" is a good movie. Although, I must say this was sort of funny for its incredible stupidity.\n\nThe puppets were okay, as far as puppets go. Not sure if they were supposed to be scary or not.

Oversexed 80's youngsters fit the picture perfectly and now when I think about it, they couldn't have been another way.\n\nI wouldn't rate this as a \"bad movie\", since it clearly was supposed to be this way.\n\nAdd another twenty years and this very well might be an art film."

And being a fan of creature features and horror movies in general, of course I gave \"Hobgoblins\" a chance, well knowing that I most likely wasn't in for something grand.\n\nAnd I should have taken heed to the low rating of \"Hobgoblins\" on IMDb and stayed well clear of the movie. Yes, this movie is every bit as to be expected given the synopsis and the rating it has received.\n\nThe story is about some aliens who are confined to a facility, where they are accidentally released from captivity as a new security guard opens a vault that is supposed to be off limits.\n\nThis is from the late 1980's, so of course expectations should be set accordingly. But even for a movie from this age then \"Hobgoblins\" was pathetic.\n\nThe acting in the movie was amateurish at best. I am not sure if it was because of the lack of having a proper script to work with, or if it was because they had opted to go with talents not really up for the task of acting.\n\nAnd the creatures, well let's just take a moment here to talk about them. While they did have some good conceptual ideas for their appearances, then the creatures just didn't work out so well on the screen, especially since it was so obviously clear that they were just puppets without movable parts. It was embarrassing to witness.\n\nBefore I forget, I should also mention the editing and cutting of \"Hobgoblins\". Wow, that was just abysmal to watch. This was probably some of the worst movie editing that I have ever seen.\n\nI didn't last through the entire movie here, because I just gave up on it before even reaching the half way point. And I have no interest in finishing the movie. And I just found out that there apparently is a sequel to this abysmal movie; but again, I have no interest in watching that, not after having seen enough of part one to see what it was.\n\nI can't find any reason for why anyone should take the time to sit down and watch \"Hobgoblins\", much less actually invest any money or time in doing so."

        "review_detailed_main": "Who knows what evil lurks in the mind of Rick Sloane? I don't, and I sure as hell don't care to find out anytime soon. This flick hardly even tries to hide the fact that it's a ripoff of Joe Dante's infinitely superior \"Gremlins\", and combined with the inane plot, cheesy dialogue, inexperienced actors, bad special effects, and lame music, it's no wonder that \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" sunk their claws into this one for Experiment 907.\n\nSo, these little puppets that have the ability to grant you your fondest wish and then kill you escape from their vault at a movie studio and wreak havoc on the populace (hey, maybe this is where \"Animaniacs\" came from...or maybe not). Their chosen victims are Kevin (a total puss who still knows how to fire a gun blindly into the air to scare off burglars), Amy (Kevin's ice cube of a girlfriend who remains unimpressed with everything he does), Daphne (a slut outlined in spandex who refuses to watch any movie without a XXX rating), Nick (the jerky military brat trained in garden tool warfare), and Kyle (the lovable pervert hopelessly addicted to phone sex). While Kevin's elderly boss goes on for hours about how important it is that the puppets be stopped, the little devils have already attacked Kevin's friends (accompanied by a lyric-less dance song that also goes on for hours). Then Kevin stops Kyle from being taken in by his fantasy moments before his car plummets off a cliff (unfortunately, neither of the two characters are in the car at the time) while Amy goes off to discover her inner skank at Club Scum. After a rousing performance of the punk rock hit \"Pig Sticker\", Amy takes the stage, only to have her big night decimated by Nick's delusional war fantasy involving comically weak hand grenades and people that turn their own tables over in order to save the explosions some work...and then some other stuff happens, but by this time I had wandered off in desperation for human contact.\n\nThis is one of those cases where you know the director made this movie for the sole purpose of putting in nude scenes. Of course, such scenes were excised for the MST3K version, leaving us with a story that the director couldn't care less about. I can sympathize with the emotionally scarred Tom Servo and Crow as they bolt for the theater exit over and over again during the opening credits. This movie gives Hal P. Warren's classic stinkburger \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" a run for its money as possibly the Worst Movie Ever Made."

While, this is certainly a poor effort on several levels, including lots of lame humour and a useless storyline, it equally isn't really nearly as bad as its reputation suggests. In amongst all the rubbish are moments to appreciate to at least some extent, such as a place called 'Club Scum', hand-puppet monsters, a pair of ludicrous red shorts, an explosive ending which begs the question 'what was the point exactly?' and, of course, the legendary rake fight. Essentially, this is one purely for bad film fans, everyone else should steer well clear."

But Hobglobins is so stunning in its awfulness that it belongs in its own category, far removed from all the other bad films you've seen. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, works in this movie.\n\nIt starts out as if it wants to be a cheapie horror flick, but soon changes its mind and decides to become an extremely bad teen comedy. Unfortunately, the \"horror\" sequences are not remotely scary or even interesting, and the \"comedy\" scenes are painfully bad. And the fact that there is not a single likeable character in this movie does not help matters much. Even the character who is apparently supposed to be the hero is annoying, which would have led me to root for the hobglobins if I could have deluded myself into pretending they were anything other than puppets. So all the people are badly written jerks, the monsters are obvious lifeless props . . . what's the point?\n\nIt amazes me to think that some people actually paid to see this upon its original release. I wonder what the target audience was supposed to be -- clueless teenage morons, like the characters in the film? I don't know, but if there are worse movies than Hobglobins somewhere, I don't want to know about them."

None of the characters are remotely likeable or funny; the only humor to be gotten is from the titular puppets: they'll inspire a hearty guffaw even without Mike Nelson and his robot pals; so the movie succeeds in this respect, at least, though the entertainment value the puppets provide is paltry, at best. Therefore, I recommend the MST3K cut of the film if you can manage to catch it at 9 or 10 am on Saturday morning."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having just watched Hobgoblins, I now have a new entry for my most hated movies. It's an unbelievably pathetic rip-off of Gremlins which combines the worst parts of a horny teenager movie and a dead teenager movie. It was made for no other reason than the (futile) hope of making a quick buck by director/producer Rick Sloan, who obviously never met a teenager or saw a movie before making this one.\n\nThe 'hero' of this picture is Kevin, the new assistant security guard at a near abandoned movie studio. He's joined in this worthless enterprise by his girlfriend Amy, a frigid nag, her friend Daphne, a vapor brained nympho, and Daphne's boyfriend Tony (at least I think that's his name) who belongs to an unspecified branch of the military and who or may not be related to the guys on Jersey Shore. Plus there's Kyle, who's only attributes are a vague resemblance to Carl Wilson and a tendency to call naughty 1-900 numbers at the least sensible times, and an elderly security guard who is absent for most of the movie.\n\nThe titular hobgoblins are small, toothy, extremely ugly aliens who make all your wildest dreams come true, right up until the point where they kill you. They're unleashed onto the world and unsuspecting audiences by Kevin, who accidentally releases them from the vault where they've been imprisoned for the last thirty years. It seems that the old security guard has dedicated the last three decades of his life to making sure they never escaped, but somehow neglected to put a lock or even a warning sign on the outside of the vault. This is only slightly more inexplicable than the fact that despite knowing more about the creatures than anyone else in this travesty, he stays back at the lot after giving some instructions on how to catch them.\n\nSo Kevin spends the rest of the movie chasing the ugly little buggers while they work their evil magic on him and his friends, granting their fantasies of being a war hero, being a stripper, actually meeting a woman, etc. Their pitiful capers take them to exotic locals such as Kevin's house, the inside of Tony's van, and the aptly named Club Scum, which looks oddly like a Rotary hall. The hobgoblins are eventually vanquished, although unfortunately without killing any of the people in this movie.\n\nAs you hopefully realize by this point, there's no acting of any kind in this movie. There are also no real sets, no real plot, and no real budget. The titular critters are cheap hand puppets that mostly appear at the edge of the screen or partly obscured by furniture, the better to hide the puppeteer's hand. In the few instances where they directly attack someone, it's painfully obvious that the actors are just rolling around with plush toys. The fight with the octopus in Bride of the Monster was more convincing than this. At least the puppet wrestling has more plot significance than an earlier fight with gardening implements between Kevin and Tony, which takes place for no discernible reason except nagging from their girlfriends.\n\nWhat's worse, Hobgoblins constantly tries to be sexy, but has no idea how. The characters talk about getting it on with such earnestness and regularity that we can be certain whoever wrote their lines has never been past first base. Fifth graders know more innuendos and euphemisms than these bozos. And when Kyle dials up the local phone madam, her spiel comes off not so much erotic as schizoid. She used few complete sentences, and kept changing the pitch and volume of her voice, but apparently her routine has something to do with a mass breakout at the zoo.\n\nNor does Club Scum offer anything remotely sexy. The lights are too dim to see anything clearly, most of the girls look like they crawled out of a gutter, and Amy's 'striptease' looks more like a spastic cheerleading routine, and shows amazingly little skin. It's telling that none of the items of clothing thrown into the sparse audience have any resemblance to the ones she was wearing. Halfway through her act, I began to wonder why a place called Club Scum would have no stripper pole, but dropped this line of inquiry to ponder why a bouncer would hurl someone into the club while yelling at them to get out.\n\nI could go on and on about how pitiful this movie is. I could spend page after page describing its utter stupidity and abysmal quality. I could fill an entire page ranting about the music alone. Bottom line, Hobgoblins is utterly worthless and there is no reason for anyone on earth to see it. A blank screen shown for the same amount of time would have been a vast improvement, and I would surely have gone mad had I not been watching the MST3K version. Even Joel, Tom, and Crow had a hard time with this one. Anyone foolish enough to watch Hobgoblins after reading this will deserve what they get. Zero stars."

This is my long list of bad pointers / scenes about 'Hobgoblins.' - The acting is absolutely dreadful. I have never seen a more depressed or unenthusiastic bunch of wannabees... - The script! God, who wrote this? A blind two year old kid? God, it was pure awful! For example in one scene, Daphne is standing outside, waiting for her boyfriend, when a hobgoblin creeps up to her left, growling heavily. She mistakes this furry little Hobgoblin for her best friend, Amy, remarking \"Amy, would you quit breathing all over me!\" This was the most laughably bad line, but the film contains millions more... come to think of it I can't think of one good line in this film at all. - The Hobgoblins were obviously little soft-toys, being controlled by some guy off-stage. Awful effects... - The quality of the sound and picture is goddamn awful! And the directing, *gak*, a monkey in a wheelchair could of directed this better... - Most of the scenes are dull and pointless - e.g. the long and tiresome garden-appliance fight in the back garden. When Rick Sloane, all the cast and crew-members directed / made / produced / whatever-ed this, WHAT WERE THEY ON? Crack? Didn't ANY of them come to their senses and think \"Hey, this film is a pile of crap!\" God... AVOID AVOID AVOID! I do recommend the MST3K version though - it's really funny watching the guys mock this rubbish! I have to say my favourite part of the film was .... the end credits... As the sticker states, at the beginning of the MST3K version of this movie, \"HOBGOBLINS: May cause blindness or death.\" Yes! It will make your eyes bleed! You have been warned..."

They just bang the rakes together until the military guy decides to take a hit on the boy. The girls then cheer on the arrogant military dude and after want to have sex with him. It's scenes like these that solidify the movies logic and well... it's utterly hilarious!\n\nThe creatures are very inspired by the Gremlins in not only their design but the concept of them running amuck. There were plenty of Gremlins rip offs in the eighties including the Critters, Ghoulies and Munchies. However, Hobgoblins has to take the prize for the most bizarre small creatures running amuck movie.\n\nIf you watch this knowing about the ludicrous nature of this movie, then you will be in for a treat!"

This was one of his first films, and the fact that he served as the director/writer/producer/editor/cinematographer/cameraman says a little something about it. This film shares its premise with the almost-as-bad \"Wishmaster\", in which you get to live out your fantasies, which is good, but then get killed by little rubber creatures, which is bad. These creatures, which are the \"hobgoblins\" that the title refers to, look like the rejects for a \"Critters\" film. The acting is laughable, the special effects are neither \"special\" nor really \"effects\", and the directing/writing/producing/editing/camerawork is second-rate.\n\nI would go into the film farther, but it does not deserve it. I will say this last thing, though: \"Hobgoblins\" is not available on video, and there's a very good reason for it."

Yet after I watched it I couldn't brought myself to give it a 1 because of its entertainment value. In fact, this is not a boring bad movie (such as MONSTER A GO GO, ZAAT or MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE) or an annoying bad movie (such as DISASTER MOVIE, CAT IN THE HAT or anything involving Lucas Cruickshank). This is among the movies ''so bad they are good'', so bad that you can also have a laugh or two for its inaniness.\n\nThe movie is as you can guess even from the poster a knock-off of GREMLINS. It begins in an abandoned movie studio, where one of the young watchmen helped by the old watchmen (who looks very similar to Buddy Ebsen) discovers about some monsters called Hobgoblins, that have the power of making wishes come true. But, there is only one BIG problem; when the wish finally comes true, the hobgoblins kill the ones that asked the wishes. So, it's up to the young watchmen, helped by the elder watchmen and his friends, to stop the monsters.\n\nWhile the acting is bad, the puppets are badly made and manipulated, it's a funny movie in its own way."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a horror movie that should not be watched un-MST 3000. And by horror, I mean the sheer terror of watching the whiny people trying to act.\n\nThis plot is simple, complicated and full of holes at the same time. Basically after the opening scene where a young security guard is killed, the old security guard hires a replacement, our hero : Kevin. They secure an abandoned film studio. The vault is the forbidden area. No one is suppose to go in there. Apparently, 30 years prior (this is all explained in a flashback by the old dude), these things (could be aliens, could be demons) appeared and slowly killed everyone in the studio. The old dude captures them and puts them in a vault. One night during the middle of a break-in, the \"Hobgoblins\" escape. Let me rephrase that. Our hero, Kevin, \"accidentally\" releases them. Boredom and stupidity ensue.\n\nThis movie is full of new and interesting pain-inducing methods. From the dialog, to the sets/locations (the inside of a warehouse, Reputation Road and Club Scum stick out in my mind), to the outfits, to the music, the fight choreography, innumerable scenes of cars parking or stopping and the special effects all scream out for a giant bowl of cyanide Kool-Aid. The first fight scene is a duel between Kevin and his \"friend\" returning from basic training, Nick. This involves a hoe and a rake (Battle of the Gardeners or something). Now think of the fight scene, in the original Star Trek series, where Kirk and Spock are locked in a duel to the death. It is nothing like that. If Shatner and Nimoy were drugged up on sleeping pills and bottles of alcohol maybe these two scenes might be similar. The fight choreography on Star Trek (being almost 20 years older than this movie) is far superior to anything this movie can muddle through. The nunchaku scene at the end (or as Crow likes to refer to it as flares tied with electrical tape) is the proverbial cherry arsenic on our anthrax cake.\n\nThe dialog does not help. It goes from worse to much worse. Classics lines such as: (Amy)-\"You would never show me a rated X movie. Would you Kevin?\"\n\nThe other characters are equally as inspired. Kevin's girlfriend, Amy, is a frigid, know-it-all. Nick is belligerent and a sex fiend. Nick's girl, Daphne, is also a sex fiend and wears different neon pants with different see through skirts. Kyle is the androgynous, useless 3rd and 5th wheel, accordingly. The old dude looks like he needs a change of adult diapers and some El Dope. Finally, there's the stars and name-sakes of the movie : the Hobgoblins. They appear to be hybrids of gremlins, ghoulies and critters. And by hybrids I mean cheap imitations. They literally look and act like dolls. The actors even have to pretend the \"stuffed dolls\" are trying to attack them. Their powers seem to consist of appearing out of nowhere and biting people, unless they're bored, in which case they telepathically project the desires of their victims. To what end ?? I don't know, since no one seems to be hurt by their brain illusions. Just like gremlins, hobgoblins also have rules attached to them. Actually its just one rule : they are attracted to light.\n\nUnder no circumstances are you to watch the non-MST 3000 version. Also try to contain your desire to watch this movie alone. This movie is not recommended for unsupervised viewing. Get a friend and some really,really good medicine."

(It's my understanding that in the line of duty the writers and performers on their late lamented TV show were required to watch each film at least half a dozen times.) \"Hobgoblins\" is yet another example of their collective sacrifices made in the name of comedy. They really earned their money on this one."

BIRDEMIC and JACK-O are good examples of this, they really tried, but luckily for us, failed miserably. HOBGOBLINS is just a bad rip off of GREMLINS meant as a cash grab, taking advantage of the bad movies cult. The trivia even confirms that the director personally contacted the MST3K crew so they showed one of his films, but eventually sent them this one.\n\nAvoid this crap unless it's in the MST3K format, because to be fair the episode was truly hilarious."

Don't watch this movie without a sick bag nearby, in fact don't watch this movie at all, except with the assistance with Mike and the guys. Do so at your peril, you have been warned."

        "review_detailed_main": "For every really great film that we see in cinemas, there are 100 really bad ones made at the same time. For every really great film made, there are 100 really bad films that are basically about the same thing. For example, Scrooged starring Bill Murray is about an evil business man who goes through a change of heart at Christmas time and becomes a loving caring man who loves Christmas. Santa With Muscles stars Hulk Hogan as an evil businessman who gets amnesia and thinks he is Santa Claus, becoming caring and loves Christmas. Movies with similar stories, but whereas Scrooged is a brilliant film, Santa with Muscles is not.\n\nHobgoblins seems to be, to me, a really bad Gremlins clone featuring lots of annoying kids and evil ugly furry little creatures, like the Gremlins. However whereas Gremlins was a brilliant and funny movie, Hobgoblins is not.\n\nIt does have its moments, like the first time we see the Hobgoblins, one of the funniest moments i have seen in film - truly dire example of film, but funny because of it. The acting is very low quality, and the characters are intensely annoying and badly written.\n\nThe film has a nice concept of the Hobgoblins being evil little creatures who use a form of telepathy to control people and allowing them to act out their deepest most carnal desires, or in some instances, forcing them to act out on carnal desires that normally would make them physically sick. The only way to stop the creatures is to kill them all before dawn. It has the potential to make a good film and it is an interesting idea but unfortunately it is just very badly executed, with little thought being given to the characters, the script, the direction, sets, make-up, locations, editing, sound, props, and really everything you could think of. The continuity in the film is really bad, in fact it makes Spiderman look continuous. Especially the very end. Watch it and prepare to see something that is laughingly bad and just utterly unbelievable at the end. The only reason to watch this film is because, like with most truly awful films, it is so bad it's funny.\n\nIt is just about possible to survive this film under normal circumstances, but i recommend watching this one with MST3K insulation as Mike, Tom and Crow make it a lot more bearable. (MST3K insulation is something that is familiar to people who have read my other reviews of bad films. Basically MST3K insulation means that Mike or Joel and Tom & Servo make the film bearable with their quips and riffs. They insulate you from the spirit-sucking soul-crushing badness of the film. MST3K insulation - never watch a bad film without it).\n\nGets one star for being so bad that it makes you laugh till you hurt. Just about crests 2 stars for a half interesting plot. The total lack of anything else stops it being 3 stars."

The special effects are awful and the creatures are painfully obvious puppets. Some of the scenarios in this are funny. The guy obsessed with phone sex had me cracking up.

        "review_detailed_main": "Thanks to everyone's favorite movie riffing show of the 90s, good old Mystery Science Theater 3000, movie lovers worldwide have been able to experience some of the worst dreck cinema has to offer. With artistic abominations such as \"Manos\": The Hands of Fate, \"Space Mutiny\", \"The Wild World of Batwoman\" or \"Robot Holocaust\", our understanding of bad movies has changed completely - next to these pitiful excuses for motion pictures, Ed Wood's \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" looks like sci-fi extravaganza, and \"Glen or Glenda\" like a serious contender for an academy award nomination.\n\nBut just when I thought that movies can't get any worse than, say, \"Manos\", MST3K unearths another cinematic catastrophe that lowers the bar even further - if that even sounds like a possible feat. In this particular case, \"Hobgoblins\" was the movie that surprised in a most displeasing manner...\n\nBut let me start with the, ahem, \"story\". Our protagonist is a teenager named Kevin, and life hasn't been too kind to him. Apart from being plagued by the most insensitive girlfriend imaginable, he has to make a living as a security guard on an abandoned movie lot, together with old McCreedy, who has been working on the lot for decades. One night, while walking through the halls of the studio, Kevin stumbles over a vault, and being the moron he is, he immediately opens the vault and thus releases...THE HOBGOBLINS! As McCreedy reveals, these small, green critters once arrived on the lot from outer space, but due to their unfortunate ability to kill people by making their fantasies come true, McCreedy imprisoned them within the vault (because, you know, killing and getting rid of the problem them would have made too much sense...). Now, it is up to Kevin to kill the creatures before they can do serious harm to his (utterly idiotic) friends or anyone else...\n\nFrom the moment you first see the Hobgoblins, you know that this flick is nothing more than a cheap rip-off of 80s hits like \"Gremlins\" or \"Critters\", and to be fair, this could have worked and provided us with mindless low-budget fun. But unfortunately, what we got instead turns out to be a disaster of epic proportions. First of all, what's with the design and look of the creatures? The makers of this film obviously didn't even attempt to make them look passable, since all we see painfully obvious hand-puppets that move in a terribly awkward manner and look absolutely pathetic. But trust me, they're not the biggest problem this movie has. Even worse is their peculiar ability. Honestly, it sounds like a decent concept on paper, but the fantasies the creatures make real are...well, unspeakable. Kyle, for example, a pitiful loser and friend of Kevin, is phone-sex addict, and thus the creatures lure him into a date with the supposed girl behind the voice. And to kill him, the illusion-girl (fittingly called Fantazia...) tries to push the car she and Kyle are in over a cliff...o-kay. As if that wasn't dumb enough already, we also witness Amy (Kevin's icy \"girlfriend\") fantasizing about becoming a stripper in \"Club Scum\" (no kidding) or sex-addict Daphne fantasizing about making sweet love to her army-friend Nick within his car...well, you can tell that the script-writers were not only inept, but quite naughty as well. Sure, it's just a sci-fi flick, so maybe I sound overly critical, but the story of this mess is just painful. It's full of logical errors and moronic characters acting dumb to advance the plot, and just wait till the end of the film...ugh.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the creature design already reveals how ineptly made this film is, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. Apparently, none of the folks involved had any knowledge about professional film-making. Pace, camera-work and storytelling are just chaotic, and the best example can be found during a scene in Club Scum: the characters are calmly sitting at a table and listening to a band performing. And this goes on for about 2 minutes. No kidding, we have the same camera angle for 2 straight minutes focusing on the stage, as if it was supposed to be a shameless advertisement for the band. No need to mention other action scenes such as the infamous garden-rake fight that is dumb in itself already and goes on for what seems like an eternity.\n\nAnd the actors? Don't get me started on them...throughout the entire movie, all you see are pure amateurs, stumbling awkwardly through this mess and delivering their lines in the worst way possible - just the icing on the cake in this film.\n\nHaving seen the likes of \"Robot Holocaust\" and now this, I highly doubt that there are worse movies the 80s have to offer. This movie more than deserves its place in the IMDb bottom 100, and I'd go as far as saying that it should remain there for years to come...I refuse to believe that movies could possibly get worse than this."

The only logical conclusion I could come to was that Rick Sloan intentionally made it like this. There is no possible way something this bad could have been made by accident. Sloan knew he wasn't rich enough to make a great movie, so instead he sets out to make something so bad that noone will ever forget it. Usually bad movies fade from memory fast because they're so uninteresting, but not this one. This one actually blew your mind with it's stupidity. If this movie was made to be bad, then Rick Sloan is a cinematic genius.\n\n."

And guess what ; my local video store had a mint, original , without the 'MST3k' dubbing, copy DUBBED in French.. Am I not lucky ??? I was bracing myself hard with my brother to see one of the most horrid movie there is....And let me tell you, I haven't laughed this hard since....oh..since a long long time...\n\nThis film is so ridiculous its scary and baffling to try and imagine how these people could actually have sat through a post production phase and actually decided to go to print.\n\nWhere can I start : well, let's start at the beginning. The first scene is the one where I laughed the most.. There's this old guy and a kid in a studio who are supposed to insure the security of the place, arguing over a telephone call which the kid didn't pick up but should have, and the scene goes on and on about this, AND THIS IS THE INTRO !! I mean what were these guys thinking !! WHO CARES ABOUT NO ONE PICKING UP THE PHONE !! Is this relevant in any way to the story ???? (which I won't bother explaining cause there isn't any)\n\nThe other scene where I had difficulty containing my laughter was the Rake fight scene. There's the hero who is called a dweeb by his girlfriend, and to prove his worth, tries to fight one of his so called pals in the front garden with rakes. And let me tell you, Darth Vader and Obi Wan are wussies compared to these two individuals. During at least 5 minutes, you can see the SAME ATTACK, WITH THE SAME DEFENSE MOVE, repeated and repeated while the girlfriends stand and watch 'in horror'..HAHAHA...\n\nThere are so many scenes I could talk about here, it would take all day. If you have the god given chance to rent this one, DO IT! It's the best worst movie I have ever seen."

Trying to cash in on Gremlins and/or Critters, this never really achieves that goal or any other comedy goal it set out.\n\nThen again, comedy is in the eye of the beholder, so some will find this quite funny. Especially if they have watched it back then and have a romantic memory of it. It tries to be funny and if you let yourself you can have fun with it. Especially considering all the actors who had to \"wrestle\" with puppets - holding them and shaking them side to side ... it's ridiculous. But maybe funny if you have the right state of mind ... still objectively speaking this isn't any good"

Like alien bedbugs.\n\nWith plenty of room for development the makers of this nonsense clearly went with their first draft as their is nothing else going on, jokes are thin, effects are poor (the hobgoblins look like cuddly toys on sticks and have as much nuance) and in the hands of a better filmmaker, more time or investing of talent could have be more entertaining.\n\nContinuing the Gremlins theme there's even a Rambo spoof, and I wonder how much of this Joe Dante saw before Gremlins 2 as the little critters magical powers are ripe for exploiting different film styles as each character explores their fantasies.\n\nSadly most of the fantasies here involve repressed sexuality and in many ways it's like a porno with no porn but at least it's fun watching people lose then rediscover their inhibitions without worrying about real life."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is at the point where the character 'Pixie' lollops across the floor of Club Scum. She's moving like demented totem-pole on legs, her stupid Marge Simpson hairdo standing up a clear six inches higher than her arms which are raised at right angles. She moves in a bizarre extended gait that tries (and fails) to register her horror at the appearance of the hobgoblins. The purported dive of a club across which she runs is actually some form of cafeteria, replete with plastic tables, a serving hatch instead of a bar and punctuated with advertisements for products such as 'beer' and 'sex' highlighted by tinsel.\n\n'Good day old chap. Can I have a beer and sex please?'\n\nIt is at this moment that mentally I pack my bags and give up on Hobgoblins.\n\nDon't think I'm stupid, deluded or both. I went into this with my eyes open having read each and every one of the reviews posted on IMDb. For some reason though, I thought I knew best. Okay, so you all thought it was soul-splittingly bad, but I like bad films. I'll like it. I even took the bold decision to watch the non-MST3K version, so sure was I that it's badness would translate as good.\n\nSadly, it isn't a question of simply bad or good.\n\nObviously this film isn't good. The directing is beyond inept, the acting non-existent and there is no pacing, no tension and no humour to speak of.\n\nTechnically however, I couldn't call this film bad either. For a film to be bad it has to try and fail but hobgoblins doesn't even try\u0085 anything. Any action, any opportunity for a set piece or anything which might further the plot simply comes and goes without event, solution or explanation. Take for example the scene in the house where the main characters first encounter the hobgoblins: They don't even try to pretend that they are actually being attacked, instead simply hold the puppets while delivering their lines dead pan.\n\nIt took me some time to work out how to classify this uniquely unenjoyable experience but in the end I came to the conclusion that it isn't actually a movie. It's just a series of random scenes on DVD. Like watching a DVD of some paint drying.\n\nOther reviewers have mentioned bad parts of this film which to me sounded like they might be quite fun. For example the rake fight, the odious slut (who actually isn't even that), the horrible big-arsed bloke who's addicted to sex lines and the crappy puppets but the truth of the matter is that Hobgoblins is so profoundly meaningless and without personality that these inept features fail to even raise a derisive smile.\n\nHobgoblins is a vacuum of an experience that I beg you to never, ever embark upon no matter what the temptation."

A old security guard has a new recruit to train, and takes him threw the normal routine and the new guard notices a area which should be permanently guarded or so the old security guard says. Well Some how..... Just trying to explain this super cheese fest of a movie is bad enough, so work with me here. A \u00bd of 10 review is too good for this movie. Many people will probably think this is a rip off of \"Gremlins\" or \"Critters\", But in order for it to be a rip off it needs a story, plot, and the creatures are just pain ridicules. about 90% of this movie the director probably just said screw it and just started filming random stuff. But I'm getting away from the story. \"HAHAHA\" I said Story...\" Hobgoblins & Story should never be used in the same sentence. Let me try to focus here. This so called secret totally secure area in which these 2 security guards must protect, Has a giant Safe and is being locked by a twist tie lock. Yes, I said twist tie the same thing that holds air out of your bread. Heck a 2 year old could sneak in this safe. But hiding in this safe are creatures so horrible and deadly, they have the power to warp people in a deadly fantasy illusion which eventually kill's the idiot victim, But what they mostly do is run away and drive in golf carts. \"Wait it gets better\" The director obviously couldn't figure out how to make these little creatures actually move/run/walk and film at the same time so how you know they get from here to there. All you hear is a scamper noise and the terrible actors in this $h1t fest look at there feet and go, wow did you see that! Yes Horrible and deadly is right to your eyes. These creatures spend all the time running and trying to cause mayhem to places you wouldn't give two $h1t's about. Then to end this super cheese fest which can be seen in the picture on the page, They have a mini pod space craft which magically appears out of thin air. I really have nothing good to say about this movie, except the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" group made fun of this horrible movie making it at least someone enjoyable to watch. But making fun of this movie is like pooping on poop, it should not be attempted.\n\nHOBGOBLINS (1988) Review: \u00bd/10"

No plot or story is needed. Obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves.

For instance, there were at least 30 parking shots. The technical: Sound is horrible, lighting is stomach-turning, acting and dialoge are excruciatingly clunky and awkward, and the big brawl in Club Scum is enough to make Ed Wood cringe. The sets are joke: a few people's houses, a bar, and an abandoned warehouse--all standard issue from stereotype catalogs.\n\nThe writers of this film worked their hearts out and really carried it through, though. Hahaha, just a little joke. There were no writers.\n\nThough it attempts to forage a trace of redemption is from its sense of humor about itself, it's hopeless. Don't try to be entertained by this film. If, like Servo, at the opening title you mistake it for the end credits, please, please, take no extraordinary measures to refrain from extricating yourself from whatever viewing area you may be occupying.\n\nThis film is simply one of the worst pieces of cinematic trash ever.

Robot. Without MST3K, public showings of this film would have to be considered a crime against humanity. However, thanks to the noble folks at Best Brains (who were forced to watch this \"film\" numerous times in a single week for preparation) we have the MST version of \"Hobgoblins:\" one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Thank you so much guys. If the show really does end this summer, there will be no end to my grief.\n\nIf someone reading this is thinking \"Oh, how bad could one film possibly be? He's just exaggerating because MST is supposed to show the worst films ever,\" you don't have to take my word for it. Go out and rent the \"straight\" (Crow-less) version, provided it is allowed to exist somewhere. If you can so much as keep your synapses functioning during it, you have a tolerance for awfulness I would fear more than envy. Just try it. I dare you. If the \"rake fight scene\" doesn't get you, the \"'piglicker' scene\" will. If you get through all that and are able to survive Amy's striptease without jokes, I never want to meet you.\n\nFor anyone else who has seen \"Hobgoblins\" and not read the cast and crew info, Rick Sloane has made TEN (10--count 'em!) movies since this one. The most recent one was 3 years ago -- he could conceivably be working on a new one right now! The degree to which this disturbs me cannot be expressed by mere words. Though someone on this page has already used Crow's comment from the show, I think it more than bears repeating: \"Can we agree that from now on, films have to make by FILMMAKERS?\"\n\nTo summarize: \"Hobgoblins\" is the worst movie ever. Anyone who has seen it will agree with me: the subject is now closed to any and all debate for the remainder of human history. I have nothing more to say."
