        "review_detailed_main": "We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.\n\nEverything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.\n\nFor as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.\n\nBale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.\n\nAs for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.\n\nThis isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."

He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. \"The Dark Knight\" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."

I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"

Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.\n\nThe movie could also have been called \"The Joker\", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And \"The Dark Knight\" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"

Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....\n\nThis may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy \"The Dark Knight\" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."

No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home.

        "review_detailed_main": "I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".\n\nThough my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.\n\nChristian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.\n\nCountering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?\n\nInitially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.\n\nBe it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.\n\nEveryone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.\n\nThe film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.\n\nDuring the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.\n\nThe cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.\n\nGreat directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.\n\nGreat explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.\n\nThis movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.\n\nI recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, \"Some men just want to watch the world burn.\" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."

In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic \"brain\". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."

In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."

        "review_detailed_main": "I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.\n\nAs far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.\n\nThe characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.\n\nOverall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.\n\nAs of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."

Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."

If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.\n\nThis is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.\n\nChristopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.\n\nThe acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.\n\nThere is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.\n\nNo spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"

        "review_detailed_main": "When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.\n\nTwo and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.\n\nNow for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.\n\nAnd that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.\n\nThe pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."

This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."

That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.\n\nA spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!\n\nThe story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?\n\nApart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.\n\nThe Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.\n\nHarvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.\n\nUnlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 \u00bd hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!\n\nWell, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.\n\nAs I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"

The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.\n\nReviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."

You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.\n\nThis is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.\n\nI will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).\n\nThere are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.\n\nI did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.\n\nChristian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.\n\nCountering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?\n\nInitially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.\n\nBe it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."

But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..\n\nIts been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..\n\nOther actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.\n\nThis movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."

The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.\n\nThe dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: \"I'm not wearing hockey pads!\" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.\n\nThe Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname \"the Dark Knight\" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.\n\nIt was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the\ufeff actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.\n\nThe film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.\n\nThe Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!\n\nThe Dark Knight score: A + . Studio: Warner Bros Pictures, Legendary Pictures, DC Comics Starring: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman Director/Producer/Scrennplay/Story: Christopher Nolan Screenplay: Jonathan Nolan Story: David S.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.\n\nThe only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much \"face time\" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.\n\nCertainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.\n\n*Runs*\n\nThe Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.\n\nStarting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?\n\nWe can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reason\u0097but so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.\n\nThe biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?\n\nDark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.\n\nBottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.\n\nGotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the \"yang\" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the \"yin\"; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them\u0085) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."

        "review_detailed_main": "Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: \"If you only see one movie this summer, this is it\". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.\n\nI had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.\n\nLooking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.\n\nSo after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.\n\nWho is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.\n\nMy inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.\n\nThe frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.\n\nAs such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."

I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.\n\nThe film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.\n\nThe plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.\n\nThe music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.\n\nAnd I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.\n\nOverall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"

The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole \"social experiment \" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.\n\nThe film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.\n\nNolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.\n\nThe cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.\n\nOverall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll. A true triumph in cinematic storytelling."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.\n\nThis is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.\n\nThis is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.\n\nTo be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.\n\nI went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.\n\nIt feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.\n\nThat's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.\n\nTo quote a certain character: Why so serious?"

        "review_detailed_main": "When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like \"the departed\", \" Inception \" and \"Saving Private Ryan\". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is \"Logan\" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.\n\nRating - 9.6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Quite simply \"Dark Knight\" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a \"proper\" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).\n\nBatman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't \"just\" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of \"dark\" and of perception of \"society.\" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.\n\nSecondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these \"abilities\" about him which are soooo unrealistic.\n\nSo, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.\n\nThe action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!\n\nI won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!\n\nEverything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.\n\nIt's cool It's original It's awesome\n\nI can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"

The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from \"Prison Break\", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper.

In the end, \"The Dark Knight\" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but \"sometimes the truth is not good enough\".

        "review_detailed_main": "Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from clich\u00e9, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good."

        "review_detailed_main": "And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like \"awesome\" and \"fantastic\" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.\n\nThe acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.\n\nI loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.\n\nI guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible."

        "review_detailed_main": "for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up"

        "review_detailed_main": "Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.\n\nA couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.\n\nI can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.\n\nThere are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.\n\nBUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype."

        "review_detailed_main": "I know it sounds a bit too clich\u00e9 when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.\n\nThe story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.\n\nLet's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.\n\nNext let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.\n\nThen we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.\n\nJim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.\n\nAnd finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.\n\nThe Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out."

It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience."

        "review_title": "\"Why so serious?\" I couldn't agree more",
        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start off by saying that I hated this film. However, I'm giving it a fair rating anyway. As an avid comic-book fan, I've had the pleasure of seeing almost all of the comic book adaptations that have seen the light of the day (so far). And almost all of the films have been at least a worthwhile trip. Ironically, the highest rated comic book adaptation of all time, the film I'm reviewing right now, is pretty damn far down on that list. Everything that Burton did right in \"Batman\", Nolan did wrong in \"TDK\". TDK takes itself way too serious. I think Nolan missed the point of \"comic\"-book. Comic, as in, amusement and entertainment. TDK is neither. It tries so hard to be a smart crime film, but to me it's just a bloody mess. The hero-villain confrontations simply falls flat, like a gum that lost it's flavor.\n\nThen there was the action sequences, which was entertaining enough to watch. But you know there's something wrong with the movie when you're only enthralled by the action sequences. The car chase sequence felt totally out of place, reminded me more of a trailer for a Fast and the Furious reboot. Then there was the cell phone gag, which felt totally out of place as well. \"Gotham City\" in TDK did nothing to me. There was nothing Gothic about it. Just an ordinary Hollywood city. Burton's portrayal of Gotham City in \"Batman\" was simply priceless. The atmosphere was just so good, the cinematography and editing were spot on. His Gothic approach to this kind of material is probably the best ever, the only film coming close is Sin City. Burton did it all on a $48 million budget. Nolan had a $185 million budget and he failed to accomplish this task. Sadly, he didn't learn anything from his mistakes in Batman Begins, but I guess that didn't stop people from funding him.\n\nEarly Batman films were so fun to watch, and the actors that portrayed the villains, such as Jim Carrey, Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones, had such a great time, and it showed. Let's discuss the actor portraying the Joker who people praised to the skies: Heath Ledger. I completely fail to see how his performance could have been better than Nicholson, let alone equally good. Some say they were in the same league. Some say that the late Ledger was better by far. But good 'ol Nicholson will always be the true Joker to me. His portrayal of the Joker is probably one of the most accurately portrayed comic-book villains translated to the big screen, ever (some plot lines regarding the Joker was changed but Burton kept the character pure and original). Every single movement he made reflected something of his character. Heath Ledger's Joker was just a mad dog, as stated so many times during the film. Nothing more. His motives are unknown. In the original film, we are fully aware of the Joker's motives, and through flashbacks, we learn how he became such a gruesome monster. He's so fun to watch, not to mention that he actually laughs. Heath Ledger never even smirks (wait, a Joker that doesn't even laugh?) He doesn't pull any rabbits out of his hat like Nicholson. He just blows things up. He's just a sadistic nihilist and not a complex, unpredictable villain formerly known as Jack Napier. I hated how Nolan changed this character completely, if it was at least half as accurate as the original Joker, it might had been more interesting.\n\nTwo-Face was an OK villain, but suffers from the same faults that the Joker had: he doesn't have any real motives! At least Tommy Lee Jones was fun to watch. We're never let into his head; at one point he is the good guy, and at the next he's the new villain. Why? The relationship between Rachel and Two-Face was laughable, the fact that he wanted to die for her was ridiculous. The fact that he wanted to blame everyone for Rachel's death, and use \"chance\" as an excuse for killing people was laughable. I wanted to know what happened in between. The characters in this film are simply not developed enough, which makes them boring and uninteresting. This problem wouldn't be as big if the movie didn't solely rely on (failed) tension and atmosphere. Without adding a pinch of entertainment, which is what a true comic book adaptation should include, the movie falls flat. And it doesn't have to be ha-ha entertainment, Sin City had both atmosphere and action, and succeeded at both; The Dark Knight had failed atmosphere and little action. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman all provide great screen presence, as always. And then there's Christian Bale, an otherwise excellent actor, who lost a lot of credibility to me after taking on the role of \"Batman\". What an awful choice. What a cringe-worthy performance. Keaton is without a doubt, the best Batman so far, while the rest are circus clowns compared to him.\n\nAs a final conclusion, I cannot recommend this film. Lacking elements that a real comic book adaptation should have, such as visual effects and accurately portrayed villains that are actually interesting to watch, the only redeeming values are some of the actors who did an OK job, and a few of the action scenes, notably the sequence at the beginning. Christopher Nolan is a great director, who still manages to show his skills in this film, but sadly, the benefits are for naught. The film succeeds a few times at creating, stylish, tension scenes, but those few tense scenes are far from enough from what this film could have (and should) have been. \"The Dark Knight\" was a huge disappointment to me, and should have been a huge improvement upon Batman Begins. I'm glad I didn't see this film with high expectations.\n\nMoose finds this film worthy of a 7."

        "review_detailed_main": "After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).\n\nThere's little use in writing a review of \"The Dark Knight\" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).\n\nI could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The \"Bat-Sonar\" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).\n\nConcerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Prestige\"). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fianc\u00e9 fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.\n\nThe hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his \"A\" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whatever else it may be, \"The Dark Knight,\" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his \"Batman Begins,\" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.\n\nThe praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.\n\nI was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.\n\nThe movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.\n\nSo...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since \"Citizen Kane.\"\n\nGrade: A"

I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?"

This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!"

I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.\n\nI was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.\n\nBut the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.\n\nNow the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.\n\nDirector/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted \"Dark Knight\". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight."

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.\n\nWhat Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.\n\nTake note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.\n\nThankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.\n\nThe Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.\n\nThe film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.\n\nFor those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes."

Everything, from the phenomenal performance of the gifted set of actors to the amazing stunts and action executed, was beautifully and concisely produced. Starting with the actors and their performance, I believe that Heath Ledger was the best Joker the Batman Universe has yet to see; his expressed nuances and habits that he evokes to portray the Joker are something to be marveled. In one of the most famous scenes of not just the movie but of cinematic history, Heath Ledger poses the question to a mob leader while holding him at knife point: Why so serious? Heath Ledger was one of the best casting jobs of the movie. Another good casting job of the movie is of Christian Bale's. He plays Bruce Wayne/ Batman in The Dark Knight and he brings the mystery and reclusiveness and charisma that he embodies as both personalities. However, while I sing praises of the movie thus far, I don't feel as though it deserves a 10 of 10 as a score. There is a little amount of movie material that can be considered worthy of such a score and The Dark Knight is no exception. At some points in the movie, the plot revolves more around the technology that has been developed and it would have been a better movie to explore and ascertain Bruce Wayne's/Batman's loyalty and moral character and how both characters find a growth of personal morality and justice."

As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldn't wait to see this movie.\n\nMan was i disappointed.\n\nDon't get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.\n\nCaine was very good, Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.\n\nBut i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.\n\nWithout giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didn't like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.\n\nThere were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it.\n\nAll in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, that's crazy.\n\nIt's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.\n\nHappy to share my feel about this movie,\n\nRealkane"

        "review_detailed_main": "What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth."

I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars."

Each character is different yet alike in so many ways and throughout the movie you to see why they become who they are. Christopher Nolan did a fantastic job directing this movie and this will be a movie that many generations to come will enjoy. Christian Bale is such a complex actor and you really see his character change so much from Batman Begins and you really see it in the ending scene of the movie. He in my opinion is one of the best actors in the business and i don't think anyone will ever come close. Throughout his movies you see all of the different roles he has taken and it is pretty amazing to see how talented he really is. Hope to see Christian Bale win more Academy Awards because he is very deserving of them. \u2661"

        "review_title": "Ledger saves pretentious, overwrought superhero movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.\n\nAs I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.\n\nLet's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.\n\nMoving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.\n\nAnd then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.\n\nThe movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.\n\nBut here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.\n\nSo for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Dark Knight\" is a masterpiece of modern cinema and arguably one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2008, it is the second installment in Nolan's Batman trilogy and a sequel to \"Batman Begins.\" Here's a review of this iconic film:\n\nStory and Script (5/5): \"The Dark Knight\" boasts a compelling and morally complex storyline. The film delves deep into the psychology of its characters, especially Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), the Joker (Heath Ledger), and Harvey Dent/Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart).

The film's action sequences are brilliantly choreographed, and Nolan's use of IMAX cameras adds a sense of grandeur to the visuals.\n\nPerformance (5/5): Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary. Ledger's performance is haunting, and he completely disappears into the character, earning him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Christian Bale's Batman is brooding and conflicted, while Aaron Eckhart delivers a standout performance as Harvey Dent. The entire ensemble cast, including Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Caine as Alfred, is exceptional.\n\nVisuals and Cinematography (5/5): Wally Pfister's cinematography is outstanding. The film's dark and moody aesthetic perfectly complements its tone, and the use of IMAX technology adds a cinematic grandeur to the action sequences.

The pounding, pulsating soundtrack enhances the tension and excitement of the film, and the Joker's theme is especially chilling.\n\nThemes and Philosophy (5/5): \"The Dark Knight\" explores complex themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism. It challenges the audience's perceptions of right and wrong and delves into the idea that sometimes the line between hero and villain is blurred.\n\nImpact (5/5): Beyond being a box office success, \"The Dark Knight\" had a profound impact on the superhero genre and filmmaking as a whole. It elevated the genre to new heights and set a benchmark for storytelling, character development, and realism in superhero films.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is a cinematic tour de force that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre. It's a dark and thought-provoking masterpiece with outstanding performances, impeccable direction, and a script that keeps you engaged from start to finish. It's a film that continues to be celebrated and analyzed by both fans and film scholars, and it remains a defining moment in the history of cinema."

However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame.\n\nI have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's \"finest performance\". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically.\n\nThis film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10. Having said that, this is nothing more than 'popcorn' film."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"According to what I believe, what doesn't kill a person makes him strange.\"\n\nNormally, I had no intention of watching this legend tonight. When I came across it on a TV channel, I got stuck on it. Then, when I realized how bad the dubbing was and that the movie would not be watched in this way, I turned on my 1080p format to watch the movie from the beginning without ads and in its original language.\n\nThis movie is at the beginning of very special movies for me. It is so for many people. Because in this film there is one of the most meaningful acting Deceptions among the approximately 800 films I have watched. And that's Heath Ledger. What makes it meaningful is that he died after the movie was made. He Decamped from us 6 months before the film was released. He has such a performance in this film that his Wildcard character goes into a completely different dimension. Such performances are very few. One of the biggest advantages of the film is itself. Even though I've only watched this movie, my favorites are also at the beginning.\n\nThis series has brought a completely new style and atmosphere to superhero movies. The biggest part of this is Christopher Nolan's. He is my favorite director. All his films travel on the border of legends. Except for the first one or two movies. They are not bad either, just below their own performance. The director has also assembled such a cast that it is a very difficult cast to get together again. Dec. A very wide cast, from old legends to new stars.\n\nAs a Lord Of The Rings fan, I'm saying this by putting aside the entire series. It tops the best movies I've seen. I've watched a lot of movies, but I've never seen a movie as full of every second and loaded with meaning every second as this movie. There is not the slightest superfluous scene in the film. A movie that you should keep your eyes open and watch every second. Let this movie come to cinemas again now, I'll wait at the door in the morning and go to the first session. If a movie can give both so much action and so many messages at the same time, that movie is already a legend."

The most well known antagonist in the Batman comics is undoubtedly the Joker, and Heath Ledger portrays the necessary insanity and sadism perfectly. Christian Bale as Batman leaves nothing more to be desired, and every shot of Gotham city fills you with the mystery and dread that you would expect from a city littered with crime. You can feel the sense that the city is not in a good state directly from the movie's beginning, and the Dark Knight of Gotham has to rise to the challenge. The entire plot line will pull you deeper into the movie. Every time that you think that a little scene is unimportant, there is sudden relevance to the bigger picture to Gotham. It is simply one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and I feel that DC did it right with The Dark Knight, not to say that earlier Batman movies failed to leave you wanting for more, as they all did for me."

The movie had tons of action scenes and a great storyline, it had the best Joker of all time. Ledger's approach to Joker wasn't the corny 1900s Joker, where he was making corny cartoon jokes. Ledger's joker was a psychological joker, that messed with people's minds and had them looking in every which direction. Bale was phenomenal, he was an incredible Bruce Wayne, was disappointed that the original Rachel dropped the movie though. It was an amazing experience to watch this movie. 10/10 would recommend anyone to watch this movie, if they would like to be entertained for 2.5 hours, it's worth it.\n\nRIP: Health Ledger, you were gone too soon."

        "review_detailed_main": "The world of superheroes has always been captivated by larger-than-life characters, but none have left as indelible a mark on pop culture as the iconic Dark Knight. Batman, a character beloved for his complex persona and thrilling adventures, has been brought to life in various mediums, but with the latest film, it's clear that the Caped Crusader has found a new home on the big screen. The 2023 Batman film, directed by visionary filmmaker David Fincher, is a visual masterpiece that brings this iconic character to life in ways that have never been seen before.\n\nFor someone like me, whose introduction to Batman came through animated series and comics, this film was a thrilling revelation. I was initially drawn to the character through the brilliant Batman: The Animated Series and various comic books. However, seeing Batman in a live-action setting, enhanced by state-of-the-art visual effects (VFX), was a game-changer. The film takes the character's appeal and magnifies it, creating a cinematic experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunning.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally impressive. Selina Kyle, portrayed by a charismatic actress, embodies the complex and enigmatic Catwoman. Her chemistry with Batman is palpable, and their dynamic adds depth to the story. The film also introduces a formidable antagonist in the form of the Riddler, played by an actor who brings a chilling and intellectual malevolence to the character. The way the Riddler's elaborate puzzles and clues are woven into the narrative keeps the audience engaged in a thrilling and suspenseful mystery. Whether you're a long-time Batman aficionado or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, this film is a must-see. Batman's legend has never shone brighter on the silver screen."

Nolan's direction and use of practical effects create a visually stunning and immersive world that feels tangible and lived-in.\n\nThe film's themes of chaos, morality, and the consequences of one's actions are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative.

A creepy Glasgow smile that keeps us up at night, spooking, haunting and endlessly projecting in our psyches for years and years, echoing from generation through generation. Everything holds up so well, in fact too well. The Dark Knight is a monolithic milestone of vigilante epicness, a hard-boiled crime noir masquerading as a PG-13 superhero movie, and a heroic ode for the ages.\n\nClap, Clap, Clap (in Joker's manner) for Nolan's ballistic nihilism, no holds barred mannerism and his spectacular vision has bequeathed us with multiple moral time-bombs, finely-tuned characterizations and dynamically explosive set-pieces: fake Batmans sequence, Harvey vs Rachel, 18-wheeler truck spinning and flipping upside down and Joker's brazenly blasting at the Batpod and so on. The villains have largely overpowered our hero in this one as darkness triumphantly cloaks up daylight, subverting the very foundation of comic-book genre, showing something we haven't seen before.\n\nSimilar to that magic pencil, The Dark Knight is relentless with its freakishly brutal power, casting an Abracadabra that's capable of knocking you out, mind-blown and ice cold on the floor. Dark and somber but equally rich in aesthetics, rainy Gotham City is as beautiful as it is immersive. So bleak there's almost no hope left and tensions are boisterously fueled by atmospheric dangers looming near, mercilessly raising the stakes up to 10000 degrees Celsius blazing fire. With many maze-like twists possessing such unpredictable nature similar to its crazy antagonist(s), this showdown is twistedly deranged, exciting and tragic in equal measures.\n\nA film, so monumental, its impact cannot be understated.

        "review_title": "Bold without ever being especially great, and which progressively gets less-interesting; the film is a wild concoction of ideas that just about treads water.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: \"you're not The Devil, you're practise\" he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.\n\nThat old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.\n\nIn addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's \"white knight\", suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's \"dark\" but is just different in technique and characteristics.\n\nJoker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.\n\nWhere the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down."

        "review_detailed_main": "Title: \"A Cinematic Triumph: 'The Dark Knight' Reimagines Batman Like Never Before\"\n\nChristopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" stands as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Released in 2008, this film marked a pivotal moment in the superhero genre, forever changing the way audiences perceive not only Batman but also the entire genre itself. With a mesmerizing blend of storytelling, unforgettable performances, and groundbreaking visuals, \"The Dark Knight\" remains an iconic achievement.\n\nAt its core, \"The Dark Knight\" is a crime drama wrapped in the guise of a superhero movie. Unlike its predecessors, this installment presents Batman as a complex vigilante facing moral dilemmas rather than a mere caped crusader fighting crime. Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and delivers a mesmerizing performance. His portrayal is a perfect blend of brooding intensity and vulnerability, allowing the audience to empathize with the inner turmoil of the character.\n\nHowever, the true standout performance in \"The Dark Knight\" is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Ledger's take on the iconic Batman villain is nothing short of extraordinary. His Joker is an agent of chaos, a sadistic and unpredictable force who challenges Batman both physically and philosophically. Ledger's commitment to the role is palpable, and he disappears into the character, leaving the audience in awe of his magnetic and chilling performance. It's no exaggeration to say that Ledger's Joker is one of the most iconic and memorable villains in cinematic history.\n\nThe supporting cast also shines in their respective roles. Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon is the moral compass of Gotham City, and Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is a charismatic district attorney whose transformation into Two-Face is both tragic and compelling. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine bring depth and wisdom to their characters, providing the emotional grounding needed amidst the chaos.\n\nNolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a dark and gritty Gotham City that feels both hauntingly realistic and heightened in its cinematic grandeur. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and shot, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding intensity of Batman's world. Nolan's use of practical effects and minimal CGI adds a tangible weight to the film's action, making every punch and explosion feel real.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of \"The Dark Knight\" is its exploration of complex moral themes. The film delves into questions of justice, morality, and the nature of heroism. Batman's ethical code is put to the test as he faces the Joker's nihilistic philosophy. The film challenges the audience to consider the cost of heroism and the blurred line between hero and villain.\n\nIn addition to its thematic depth, \"The Dark Knight\" is a masterclass in storytelling. The script, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a taut and intelligent narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene building upon the last, leading to a breathtaking climax that will leave you breathless.\n\nHans Zimmer's score is another element that elevates \"The Dark Knight\" to a cinematic tour de force. The hauntingly beautiful music underscores the emotional beats of the film, heightening the tension and drama. Zimmer's use of recurring motifs, such as the Joker's theme, adds a layer of psychological depth to the characters.\n\nIt's worth noting that \"The Dark Knight\" is not a typical superhero film. It transcends the genre by delivering a mature and thought-provoking narrative that appeals to a broad audience. While it contains thrilling action sequences and epic battles, it also explores the human side of its characters, making it a character-driven drama that just happens to involve superheroes.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is a cinematic triumph that redefined the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance as the Joker, and the film's exploration of complex moral themes all contribute to its status as a modern classic. It's a film that continues to resonate with audiences and stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in cinema. Whether you're a fan of Batman or simply a lover of great filmmaking, \"The Dark Knight\" is a must-see that will leave you pondering its themes long after the credits roll."

At its core is Heath Ledger's haunting portrayal of the Joker, a character study that delves into the darkest corners of human psyche. Ledger's performance is a revelation, crafting a Joker that is simultaneously terrifying and captivating.\n\nChristian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne is equally compelling, showcasing the internal struggle of a hero burdened by his sense of duty and the blurred line between justice and vengeance. The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman, deliver exceptional performances, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.\n\nNolan's direction is nothing short of genius, transforming Gotham City into a character itself-a gritty, sprawling urban landscape plagued by crime and corruption. The film's action sequences are meticulously choreographed, and the practical effects create a visceral sense of realism rarely seen in superhero films.\n\nWhat sets \"The Dark Knight\" apart is its exploration of moral ambiguity and the choices that define us. The film raises profound questions about society, justice, and the nature of good and evil, challenging the audience's perceptions long after the credits roll. Hans Zimmer's score is the soul of the movie, underscoring the tension and emotion with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Its exceptional performances, intricate storytelling, and thought-provoking themes elevate it to the realm of timeless classics. A film that lingers in the mind and demands multiple viewings, \"The Dark Knight\" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and remains an essential watch for anyone seeking profound cinematic experiences."

There are many flaws in it as a movie as well.like shawshank and godfather i saw it many times but couldnt appreciate it that much.its the 3rd best movie of all time. I mean really? Joker no doubt is absolutely brilliant and fairly deserved an oscar but what about the rest ? He alone carries this movie along and others look petty and naive characters before him. Symbolically there is a continuous fight between good and evil in this movie but its an old theme now.."

Secondly there was way too much material to be packed into the three hours alloted. If anyone knows anything about the back story of Harvey Dent/Two Face they are just left feeling empty and the character itself unjustified. I understand Nolan was trying to do something different with the Joker, but why disrespect Two Face? Also, there was really no Batman/Bruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film. Overall a good action film, but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection. Hopefully Nolan brings back Two Face in the next film and gives him a face."

The casting is flawless, quite well selected in entire trilogy. Christian Bale show his chameleon skills going from Bruce to Batman as fast and certain as you can flip a coin. Tha usually romantic Aaron Eckheart, is also broken in two, and instead of switching from edges, he merge'em resulting in the only Harvey Two Face, in the cinema that could be taken seriously. Heath Leadger acting is one of the most amazing things you could see in your entire life. It makes you wonder: Jack Nicholson who? This is the kind of movie that plays on my screen every once in a while."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Batman\" isn't a comic book anymore. Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. That's because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This film, and to a lesser degree \"Iron Man,\" redefine the possibilities of the \"comic-book movie.\"\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He's a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.\n\nThe key performance in the movie is by the late Heath Ledger, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since Peter Finch? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic \"The Man Who Laughs\" (1928). His clown's makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (Christian Bale), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.\n\nBecause these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. \"The Dark Knight\" slips around those defenses and engages us.\n\nYes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail.\n\nThe plot involves nothing more or less than the Joker's attempts to humiliate the forces for good and expose Batman' secret identity, showing him to be a poser and a fraud. He includes Gordon and Dent on his target list, and contrives cruel tricks to play with the fact that Bruce Wayne once loved, and Harvey Dent now loves, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). The tricks are more cruel than he realizes, because the Joker doesn't know Batman's identity. Heath Ledger has a good deal of dialogue in the movie, and a lot of it isn't the usual jabs and jests we're familiar with: It's psychologically more complex, outlining the dilemmas he has constructed, and explaining his reasons for them. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who first worked together on \"Memento\") has more depth and poetry than we might have expected."

Like most super-hero movies nowadays, it's one gigantic battleship of a movie, weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time. How many sub-plots do we need? How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff.\n\nBut the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah. Did I give a damn about any of the characters? Did I really care what was going to happen next? Nope. Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is \"County\"?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch.\n\nThe one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together.\n\nSo, all in all, I wish I'd spent the time some other way."

        "review_detailed_main": "The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch \"The Godfather\". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.\n\nThat said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.\n\nWhich brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from \"Goodfellas\" or Luca Brasi from \"The Godfather\". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.\n\n3/10"

But lets face it, of all the good actors in the movie, Heath Ledger blows everyone away with his role of the joker. Not just for this movie, but this may be one of the best acting roles in history. The performance of his life. ( no pun intended ). Its a shame he died, there were more great performances in him, sadly we will never see. It would be a reasonable supposition to believe that ledger's performance may have been so extreme and brilliant due to psychological issues he was experiencing at the time which ultimately took his life. A candle burning too bright and will be missed."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding."

        "review_title": "Masterpiece of Modern Cinema",
        "review_detailed_main": "In the realm of superhero movies, there exists a pinnacle of excellence that stands head and shoulders above the rest: Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Released in 2008, this film not only redefined the genre but also transcended it, delivering a gripping narrative, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes that continue to resonate with audiences worldwide. As an ardent fan of The Dark Knight, I am thrilled to share my enthusiastic review of this cinematic masterpiece.\n\nFrom the moment the opening scene unfolds, The Dark Knight captivates viewers with its atmospheric cinematography and haunting score. Nolan's Gotham City is a gritty and realistic backdrop, evoking a sense of urban decay and moral ambiguity. This serves as the perfect setting for the complex character dynamics that drive the story forward.\n\nAt the heart of The Dark Knight lies the conflict between the iconic hero Batman, portrayed with unparalleled gravitas by Christian Bale, and his enigmatic adversary, the Joker, brought to life in a chillingly mesmerizing performance by Heath Ledger. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary, as he embodies the chaotic nature of the character with an intensity and unpredictability that is both captivating and unnerving. Every scene featuring the Joker crackles with tension, as he challenges Batman's moral code and pushes him to his limits.\n\nBut The Dark Knight is not merely a showdown between hero and villain; it is a deep exploration of the nature of heroism, justice, and the human psyche. The film delves into complex themes such as morality, sacrifice, and the blurred line between good and evil. Batman, burdened by the weight of his crusade against crime, must confront the darker aspects of his own identity as he battles against the Joker's nihilistic worldview.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of The Dark Knight is its examination of the concept of chaos versus order. The Joker represents pure chaos, an agent of anarchy who seeks to disrupt the established order and expose the hypocrisy of society. In contrast, Batman embodies the ideal of order and justice, striving to uphold a sense of morality and stability in the face of chaos. The dynamic between these two opposing forces drives much of the film's narrative tension, culminating in a series of gripping confrontations that challenge both characters on a fundamental level.\n\nBeyond its thematic depth, The Dark Knight also excels in its technical craftsmanship. Nolan's direction is masterful, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and suspense. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and adrenaline-fueled, showcasing Batman's prowess as a formidable crimefighter. The film's visual effects are seamlessly integrated, immersing viewers in the dark and brooding atmosphere of Gotham City.\n\nFurthermore, The Dark Knight boasts a stellar supporting cast, including standout performances from Aaron Eckhart as the idealistic district attorney Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as the steadfast Commissioner Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as the wise and resourceful Lucius Fox. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their respective roles, adding layers of complexity to the film's ensemble cast.\n\nAs a fan of The Dark Knight, I am continually impressed by its enduring legacy and cultural impact. More than a decade after its release, the film remains a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. Its themes of heroism, sacrifice, and the struggle for justice are as relevant today as they were upon its initial release.\n\nIn conclusion, The Dark Knight stands as a shining example of cinematic excellence, a film that transcends the confines of its genre to deliver a powerful and thought-provoking experience. From its gripping storyline to its unforgettable performances, Christopher Nolan's masterpiece is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of the superhero mythos. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, The Dark Knight is essential viewing for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking."

The ferry bit went on far too long (probably so they could give ledger more screen time), The batbike/pod thing looked really slow and spent most of its time spinning its wheels and looked like more of an excuse to release a cool toy tie in! and i could go on but you probably all agree but are too blinded by hype and the fact that ledgers dead to see that this is a pretty average film. Why was the scarecrow not arrested at the start of the film? How come the clear reference at the end of batman begins regarding the jokers existence is completely forgotten about in the next movie. I could go on but i'm sure you'll all realise when the hypes died down. In summery, too long, wasted characters, a bit of mis casting and what the f**k was with batmans ultra gruff voice! i nearly choked on my popcorn first time i heard him!

That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.\n\nOn the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.\n\nAnd sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.\n\nTo remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it should've borrowed)."

Released in 2008, this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances. At its core, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's posthumous Academy Award-winning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist, making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchy.\n\nChristian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, brings a brooding intensity that complements the film's exploration of duality and morality. Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself. The cinematography, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, adds layers of tension and depth to the narrative.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" transcends the typical superhero narrative, evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism. The film's social commentary on the thin line between order and chaos resonates throughout, challenging audiences intellectually and emotionally. As the capstone of Nolan's Batman trilogy, \"The Dark Knight\" sets a high standard with its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and cinematic brilliance.\n\nThis film isn't just a comic book adaptation; it's a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Its impact on the superhero genre is undeniable, and its legacy continues to influence filmmakers, setting a standard that few have matched. \"The Dark Knight\" remains a beacon of excellence, reminding us that a superhero film can be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern filmmaking."

Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.\n\nIt's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.\n\nChristian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.\n\nThe action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.\n\nI recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, \"Batman Begins\" (2005), and the not-so-good \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012).\n\nFinal score: 9/10."

Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.\n\nIt has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.\n\nThe other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.\n\nThis movie made me tired."

But sadly he was unable to receive it himself.\n\nBut I think it would be better if there was more scence of him in the movie.\n\nAnd of course we don't have to forget about Christopher Nolan direction, which makes this movie on the best cinematic creations."

(Although, I still can't say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldn't see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!! Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super hero's outfit, however for what they used here, I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween. Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldn't even move properly in it,(heck, he couldn't even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light. How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every 5 seconds, scary? try Retarded (No offense) Imitating raw home made camera footage, once invented by Blair Witch Project, in a News-break part was when I almost smashed my TV. (Again, where the money went in this film???????????????????????)\n\nI'll tell You where. Paying all the critics for a few favorable words. Shame, on You Hollywood.\n\nSure, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were Over-The-Top, But-Man, did I love their use of colors and mood, it was a visual treat.\n\nDark Knight: was it a bad movie?, No, it wasn't.\n\nDisappointment? You betcha'a!\n\nLong Live Jack Nicholson."

I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.\n\nAnd I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.\n\nI also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised.

        "review_title": "A Cinematic Masterpiece - 9.4 out of 10",
        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight,\" released in 2008, is more than just a superhero film; it's a profound exploration of chaos, morality, and heroism, wrapped in a gripping, action-packed narrative. This film redefined the genre, setting a high bar for subsequent superhero movies and cementing its place as a cinematic classic.\n\nAt the heart of \"The Dark Knight\" is a complex narrative that delves into the dichotomy of good and evil, embodied by Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). The storyline picks up from where \"Batman Begins\" left off, with Gotham City experiencing a relative calm thanks to Batman's vigilantism. However, this peace is shattered by the emergence of the Joker, a criminal mastermind whose anarchic philosophy and unpredictable nature push Batman to his ethical and physical limits.\n\nHeath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic. His performance is chillingly brilliant, bringing an unsettling yet captivating energy to the screen. Ledger's Joker is not just a villain; he is chaos personified, with no discernible motive other than to create havoc. His eerie laughter, erratic behavior, and philosophical musings about the nature of mankind elevate the character beyond a mere comic book antagonist to a symbol of anarchy. Ledger's untimely death shortly after filming added a poignant layer to his performance, which was rightfully awarded a posthumous Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nChristian Bale's Batman is equally compelling, presenting a hero burdened by the weight of his dual identity. Bale masterfully portrays the conflict within Bruce Wayne as he grapples with his sense of duty to Gotham and his personal desire for a normal life. This internal struggle is intensified by his relationships with his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine), his confidante Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and his love interest, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).\n\nNolan's direction is meticulous, blending high-octane action sequences with deep, philosophical inquiries. The film's opening bank heist scene is a masterclass in tension and sets the tone for the ensuing chaos. The intricate plot, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is layered with themes of sacrifice, justice, and the moral ambiguities of vigilantism. The narrative's complexity is matched by Wally Pfister's cinematography, which captures the gritty realism of Gotham City, and Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which heightens the film's intense atmosphere.\n\nOne of the film's central themes is the ethical and psychological battle between Batman and the Joker. The Joker's taunting assertion that Batman's moral code is a weakness is a recurring motif, challenging the very foundation of Batman's crusade. This philosophical duel reaches its zenith in the iconic interrogation scene, where the Joker goads Batman with unsettling truths about the nature of order and chaos.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" also explores the impact of heroism and vigilantism on society. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham's \"White Knight,\" represents hope and lawful justice, but his tragic descent into Two-Face illustrates the corrupting influence of Gotham's darkness. Dent's transformation serves as a stark reminder of the thin line between heroism and villainy, a line that Batman himself must constantly navigate.\n\nTechnically, the film is a marvel. The practical effects, including the unforgettable truck flip and the jaw-dropping hospital explosion, are executed with precision, eschewing CGI in favor of real-world stunts that lend authenticity to the spectacle. Lee Smith's editing ensures a brisk pace, seamlessly weaving multiple storylines without losing narrative coherence.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it is a profound meditation on the nature of good and evil, the fragility of order, and the sacrifices required for true heroism. Its influence on the genre is undeniable, pushing the boundaries of what a comic book movie can achieve both artistically and thematically. Over a decade later, it remains a benchmark for filmmakers and a testament to the enduring power of well-crafted cinema."

Heath ledger unfortunately killed himself after the role. Don't get me wrong, the dark knight is a great, excellent movie but it shouldn't be the top 3 of the world, even nearly the top 10.

Characters all work amazingly well, story is structured fantstiscally and I often tend to rewatch on repeat. If it was on youtube I am sure my viewings would take it into the high millions. Would watch over and over, it is a film to rav about. The story works so well, so fresh and gripping. I think it deserves more recognistion and loads more awards. Please re-release in cinema. It would be amazing to experience it again and have that moment."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sorry guys, but this doesn't belong in the top 250's by any account. Its fight scenes, car chases, its effects, and its storyline were all mostly average. Momentum wasn't built up over the film at all, and worse, they dragged out scenes longer then they should have.\n\nIn fact, this movie was in the top 250 list BEFORE it made it to cinema. Why? Because there are a few people who are overly enthusiastic about batman who used Heath's death as a marketing tool, over-hyped the movie and voted it upwards despite never having seen it. Just because a movie is based on a comic shouldn't mean it should be voted any differently (would anyone have liked this movie if Batman's costume was swapped). Yes, heath was good because he played something out of his general character, similar to how Jim Carrey did in Spotless mind. But...\n\n9 and 10's should be reserved for movies which are completely innovative. I felt like I saw this movie 20x already, and nothing kept me hanging on to find out what happened next. People who voted this 10/10 possibly need to experience movies such as the shining, Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, Fight Club or even Wall-E. These are movies which provide the watcher with a different experience then what they are accustomed too, and they are left wondering what will happen next."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" stands as a towering achievement in the realm of superhero cinema, transcending genre conventions to deliver a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the nature of chaos. With its complex characters, thrilling action sequences, and profound themes, this film captivates audiences from beginning to end, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.\n\nAt the heart of \"The Dark Knight\" is Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker, one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. Ledger's portrayal is nothing short of legendary, capturing the anarchic spirit of the character with a chilling intensity and magnetic charisma. His Joker is a force of nature, a chaotic agent who seeks to upend the established order and expose the hypocrisy and corruption that lurk beneath the surface of society.\n\nOpposite Ledger's Joker stands Christian Bale's Batman, a brooding and conflicted figure grappling with his own inner demons and the moral complexities of his crusade against crime. Bale brings a quiet intensity to the role, imbuing Batman with a sense of gravitas and depth that grounds the film amidst its larger-than-life spectacle.\n\nBut \"The Dark Knight\" is more than just a battle between hero and villain; it's a nuanced exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, order and chaos. Nolan deftly weaves together multiple narrative threads, from the escalating conflict between Batman and the Joker to the ethical dilemmas faced by Gotham's law enforcement and political elite. The result is a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally thrilling, challenging audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and justice in a world plagued by corruption and violence.\n\nOf course, \"The Dark Knight\" is also a technical marvel, with breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer that heightens the film's sense of tension and unease. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the towering skyscrapers of Gotham City to the shadowy alleyways where the Dark Knight prowls.\n\nIn the end, \"The Dark Knight\" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a timeless work of art. Whether you're a fan of comic books or not, this is a film that demands to be seen and appreciated for its bold storytelling, impeccable craftsmanship, and profound thematic depth."

I want joker to creep me TF out and fear his wrath. OH well. Good movie, totally worth watching. I think Bale is a good Batman but I really like Keaton. I wonder what a new Tim Burton remake would look like with all of the CGI available now that was not around when he made the first Batman with Keaton. I say we petition that. Get Burton on another, really dark one. But please, please, please. No Ben Afleck!\n\nHappy Watching!"

I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"

Heath Ledger(joker) was awesome! his acting was really remarkable.For me he was the best villain in the whole batman series. Christian Bale(batman) is always good so no comments for him! BATMAN is one of the most famous characters in DC comics so people have high expectations from this movie.But i assure you this movie will never disappoint you. Joker is a villain with no super powers, no advance gadgets but his intelligence is his greatest power.This movie shows the real potential of joker & what he can do or how he creates fear in the mind of the people of whole Gotham city with only his intelligence & craziness .\n\nThe only thing is that this movie is a little bore in the start. other wise this movie is very good & i would really love to watch it again & again!!"

I liked the psychological deepness that is showed in different stages inside the story.

        "review_detailed_main": "It surprises me that 12 years has passed since this film was released, and no other film of the super-hero genre have surpassed this one in terms of quality. Not one of the MCU, neither of the DCEU. Of course, we had great super-heroes films, but the Dark Knight have something else. I think it's the philosophical part. Not trying to be 'deep' or play the smart one, it's just the part that captivated me the most. The idea of Batman being the 'ugly hero', the monologue of Gordon in the ending of the film is outstanding and one of the reason I love Batman. Joker, that is heavily based on the version of the graphic novel Killing Joke of Alan Moore. The agent of chaos and anarchy that have a twisted vision of the world. The 'madness is like gravity' phrase have the same concept of this quote of The Killing Joke \"All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.\" Of course there's more than that, I loved Harvey Dent, Joker's 'social experiment' moment is just so powerful. The concept of a hero defeating the villain not with punchs and kicks, but proving that his view of world and ideology are both wrong, is just fantastic and I knew Christopher Nolan wouldn't gave us less than that.\n\nAbout the rest, that makes this film even more interesting. Of course Nolan's directing, he's not that good at action sequences, but nothing you can't ignore. The amazing soundtrack of Hans Zimmer, his music brings the build-up necessary to increase the tension and adds more emotions to the film's most memorable moments. There's much more things that makes this film so great, but the charm is without doubt Heath Ledger's acting, a groundbreaking perfomance, he steals every scene he's in, he's charismatic, even portraying a sociopath, his laugh, the mannerisms, everything about his character is great. One of the few comic book films that are a masterpiece, but if they all were this good, gems like this film wouldn't as relevant as it is."

When Batman is going to save Rachel, he could've saved both by sending teams out each way to each location, but he didn't. Why?\n\n2. Harvey Dent blames Batman for the death of Rachel. Why?

A bit of Hamlet is in this Batman.

It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The only way the joker can see himself as credible is if he does things his way, without hesitation. The Batman is his nemesis & does everything he can to stop him. The bat mobile is the perfect example of why the cutting edge tech in this movie is still viable to this day and the future ahead. I see myself in the Joker and I also see myself in the Batman. Much training was necessary for the Batman to fully evolve into the walking bat-suited mastermind himself. The Joker will always be remembered as the villain & Batman will always be there to save the night."

Blah, blah, blah on all the performances, they were brilliant! Heath Ledger is a truly psychotic Joker! As one of his final performances, he will be remembered as a villain who thrived on kaos and mayhem. Maggie Gyllenhall, Christain Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Erkhart all gave such Oomph to their roles. Technically, the movie was fantastic. With all the explosions you expect and the body count wasn't too high. May be a little too much for children under 13 to grasp. Go see it. Go on! Buy your tickets now!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight is based upon the Batman characters created by Bob Kane and is a follow up to 2005's Batman Begins. I remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that I stated that I didn't even know if I would end up going to see The Dark Knight. After giving Batman Begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why I wouldn't want to see a sequel to a film I enjoyed so much. Well, when I saw Batman Begins in the theatres I thought it had a lot of style, action and kept me compelled and entertained and I found it a really good time at the movies. Hence the perfect review I gave it three years ago. Then, I saw it again on DVD and I did not like it at all. The thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things I enjoyed about it on my first viewing, instead on my second viewing I found parts of it boring and I started to have a few problems with the acting performances. I still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film, but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year I really couldn't have cared less if I saw The Dark Knight at all. Then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and I kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and I even heard of one critic who couldn't recommend the film because of how dark it was. This intrigued me because I have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that I would really like it ended up in me seeing it. And to my surprise I thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and I would most certainly call it a masterpiece. The acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late Heath Ledger who played the role of the Joker. I have seen Heath Ledger in other films such as Brokeback Mountain, or I'm Not There and to play this role he isn't more or less playing himself, but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the Joker says, does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. All of this is perfected by Heath Ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and I would compare his performance as the Joker to last year's best performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Day Lewis won an Oscar this year, so I see no reason why Heath Ledger couldn't get nominated, or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. His performance was one of the best parts of the film. What was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting, direction and cinematography was it's story. Instead of being filled by non stop explosions, high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects, this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including Batman himself. The character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldn't help, but be interested. The story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and I liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which I found all the more interesting and I liked how this film did not use formulas, or clich\u00e9s and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. The Dark Knight really hit me and made an impression on me. Even days after leaving the theatre I 'am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. This is what I call a powerful, thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this. The Dark Knight is a brilliant achievement and I will go as far to say that it is the best superhero film I have ever seen simply because it is not like other superhero movies and this is also the best mainstream film of the year so far and I hope it is not shunned come Oscar time."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I read the enthusiastic reviews in Italy and I saw this movie ranked 1st in the IMDb's Top 250, I thought: \"It's strange, the other Batman (Begins) was not so brilliant, what's happening with this sequel? Is it really this masterpiece? Is it really in the same league with movies like 'Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse now'?\". No, it's not in the same league. Not at all. When I saw it, my delusion was strong. It's a good blockbuster action movie, but nothing more. Let's see.\n\nThe following comments contain spoilers. Be careful.\n\nThe script is not so original. There are tons of action sequences, but\u0085 what can I say? I've seen it all. I've seen the robbery made by violent people, fighting against the guards and killing each others (in all pulp tradition, since \"Reservoir Dogs\"). I've seen the ransom in China by plane (\"Spy Games\"). I've seen those action sequences with cars and armored vehicles in all American movies. (And this Batmobile is really awkward). I've seen the killer who kills by chance (\"No Country for Old Men\"). I've seen the super-mega-sadistic-mad-chaotic-evil-serial-killer in action who creates dilemmas and plays with his victims (in \"Seven\" and in the \"Saw\" saga). I've seen it all: \"The Dark Knight\" is nothing new. And it's very predictable: you really can predict any sequence before seeing it. There are a lot of absurdities. The heroes could kill The Joleker dozens of times, but they never do it. Why? Are they retarded? The \"two ships dilemma\" (I don't want to reveal more about that scene) is not realistic at all. There are only a couple of surprises, but the 2/3 of the movie doesn't create any suspense. What about the actors? The only two heroes of acting in this movie are Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Heath Ledger, with his Joker, bears quite the entire movie. All the other characters became secondary. Aaron Eckhart is really powerful and he confirms his talent shown in \"Thank You for Smoking\". What about the others? Christian Bale is one of the most talented actors of his generation, but in this movie he keeps only one expression all the time, with or without mask. His Batman has no personality. Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most interesting (and underrated) independent actresses of the New Hollywood, since \"The Secretary\". But in this movie she can act only in few sequences and she has no chance to show her real talent. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane are giants, but in this movie they barely appear. Finally: I've never seen so many waste of talent! The good side of the coin in Christopher Nolan's work is: his philosophy. It's really positive and constructive and all his movie is coherent about it. It's just like the positive answer to \"No Country for Old Men\" and to modern nihilism: in the Cohen's movie, Evil is the absence of values and it's unstoppable. In \"The Dark Knight\", Evil is again the absence of values, but it's a minority, not the rule. So, we can fight Evil and defeat it, with or without super-heroes. But all those themes could be and should be explored better. \"The Dark Knight\" explores nothing."

        "review_title": "Why so serious, right?",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Dark Knight\" is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolan's latest wonder concerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor \"Batman Begins\". It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolan's Batman is what it is because it isn't just about the adrenaline.\n\nIt's still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening sequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place; organized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally villains don't call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to talk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer with or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman.\n\nThis last statement maybe more understood once you've watched the film, but there's one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations with Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce doesn't understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will tell the superhero: \"You complete me\". That phrase reminded me of the great movie \"Unbreakable\" is.\n\nBut, actually, what is a hero and what is a villain? In Nolan's brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual collaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the ever exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowley's spectacular production design.\n\n\"It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you\", a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal told Bruce in \"Batman Begins\". Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart).\n\nLet's not forget that Batman is more human than any of the other superheroes of the comic books. In this film, he's never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting; without knowing if he's the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him fall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little fight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of \"The Dark Knight's\" treats to the viewer.\n\nAnother major treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when he says the town \"deserves a better kind of criminal\"-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-) that equals Batman in human qualities. I don't mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people will find inspiring things in his weirdness), I'm simply referring to the fact that he doesn't fly through the air or owns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose.\n\nHeath Ledger steals the film (and will get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces this human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in \"Batman Begins\". Without overacting, Ledger creates an individual that we can call a freak, because it's the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He has all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger tells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name, nor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount of grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. It's Heath Ledger's great acting what generates all this.\n\nThe rest of the ensemble, as in \"Batman Begins\", is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and makes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in which the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie that's profound in the best sense of the word\u0085A word we don't use so much for comic book movies.\n\nAnyway\u0085Batman may not know if he's the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but \"The Dark Knight\" is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer deserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like me, celebrates with a big smile\u0085Why so serious?"

A cinematic masterpiece, the films 2 and a half hours are both too short, yet so immersing it seems like days. Not one frame of wasted celluloid was included. The cinematography was unbelievable with sweeping cityscapes and intense, explosive action sequences. The acting was also unbelievable; Between Heath Ledger's tour de force (which is definitely deserving of the Oscar buzz), Aaron Eckhart's tragic Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Gary Oldman's ever brilliant presence as Lt. James Gordan, and Christian Bale's intense and driven Batman/Bruce Wayne, everyone involved is absolutely stellar. However, what truly makes this film the cinematic event that it is, is the story. Truly epic in it's scope but always aware that personal tragedy is what drives it. This is a rare cinematic masterpiece in a time where summer movies have come to mean mindless fluff, this transcends the typical superhero movie to achieve something truly spectacular. Seeing this film was an experience that I will not soon forget and I truly hope others derive the same pleasure from seeing it that I did."

Heath was brilliant but Nicholsons Batman was also great. I couldn't see myself watching this again. Once was enough! And the Batmobile was down right bizarre.

We get to see multidimensional people with purpose, even if the purpose to to kill and maim. We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride. A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself. Also, people do some pretty stupid things, considering what a threat this guy is.

One that actually shows a story as it was meant to be shown, and one of the most darkest, cruelest, and violent action-packed films ever created. With great dialogues in between the equally great scenes, taking the film to another level of greatness.\n\nThe special effects were all done in a simple, non shabby way, the soundtracks were simply harmonizing with the picture, and the Gotham we knew is now gone, this is a darker and more corrupt place than in any of the previous films.\n\nMoving on to the acting. Starting off with the Dark Knight. Bale's performance was outstanding, no-one else has ever been as superb a Batman as he is. Him being split between righteousness and insanity, between what is right and what is wrong. An entirely different Batman, and Bruce Wayne, surpassing any of his other predecessors. Whilst those were more flat, two sided characters, the Bruce Wayne we face in The Dark Knight, is a totally different story.\n\nTwo key people in the film were also Det. Lt. James Gordon, who was played by Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. They both gave a good, very believable performance. Same would go to the two characters in the supporting roles, Alfred and Luscious fox, being cast by Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman. Whilst these all gave a good quality from themselves, I was not at all impressed by Maggie Gyllenhaal who played Rachel Daws.\n\nWhether these characters were played well or not, people just could not concentrate on them too much, and that is only because of the fact that Heath Ledger, as the Joker, simply dominated every scene he was in, he was the highlight of the whole film. This is no ordinary Joker we were used to, Ledger portrayed the Joker as someone with hate running through his veins, someone that killed for pleasure and someone who had felt a great loss in his past. A darker, sicker, and more evil Joker than any of the other ones in the previous films. Insane, corrupt and terrifying, with a laugh of a psychotic maniac. A perfect villain for the Dark Knight, one that truly completed, and challenged him through the whole story. Hats down for Heath Ledger.\n\nNow, not to give all the compliments for the fantastic job to the actors. I also have to compliment the Nolan brothers for an obviously marvellous screenplay and great directing. Not to forget for a large stack of brilliant dialogues. They make films immortal, in a way that they are never forgotten. It makes the difference between a quality film and a masterpiece. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, amazing performances by the actors, with special mention on Ledger as the Joker. Bone-chilling scenes combined with action and drama, in Gotham that looks flawless, a huge city covered with darkness and insanity. The Dark Knight is a must see film."

We're sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a green-haired clown. How much drama/realism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment?\n\nSadly, not this much.

And their consequences.\n\nThe core of the movie is Bruce Wayne - originally having intended to serve as a hero for a time - desperately clinging to the hope of Rachel Dawes, and her promise of waiting for him, in the last chapter. But her heart is elsewhere. On the flip-side; everything is troubled by the inner-workings of a clown-apparent madman without a purpose.\n\nChristian Bale is exceptional here; playing the role of both Batman and Bruce Wayne differently (one of the only actors to ever realize that in the role) and both are played with equal confliction and brooding, building on the same promise shown in \"Batman Begins.\" Aaron Eckhardt, on the flip-side of the coin (pun intended), is the obviously-inspired presentation of Harvey Dent like Elliot Ness in \"The Untouchables.\" He is doomed to misery and scarring, of course, from the first reel and - strangely - every scene with him in it carries that pre-established foreboding. Perhaps intentionally. And Maggie Gyllenhaal does well in a role that was poorly-written last time and difficult to really care about. In the end, he comes through and enhances a role that comes off bland on paper. The rest of the cast is exceptional as well. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Eric Roberts all shine spectacularly in this ensemble cast.\n\nBut the true star of the show is Heath Ledger. From the first reel of the film in which he leads a scene that starts the show with a bang, to the end credits; the actor and the man who was Heath Ledger is nowhere to be found. He disappears into the role with an intensity that you would not expect in - what is ultimately - a superhero movie. I have seen the film three times now and each time I notice something else in the performance. For instance, every line that he utters has a strange comical side of it. Whether its threatening someone's life, giving a rendition of his \"violent history\" or simply antagonizing Batman; every line is strangely funny and unnerving at the same time. Its also note-worthy that in performing a rendition of the iconic Joker far and away from his comic book origins; he ironically nails the best depiction of the Joker to date. Yes, surpassing even the likes of Mark Hammil.\n\nI found it interesting how they interweaved the Joker into the plot. Without spoiling anything; the Joker exists outside of the entire structure of the film and, truthfully, could have been easily removed and still maintain a tangible film. It almost reminded me of the intentional-writing on \"The Sixth Sense\" where (again, without spoiling anything) Bruce Willis' character exists in the movie with that same \"interchangeable\" involvement. This increases the entire scope of the Joker because, as a self-proclaimed \"agent of anarchy\"; he even exists within the reel of film as the embodiment of chaos.\n\nChristopher Nolan comes through yet again. One of the things I was hoping walking in was that the movie would be more urban than \"Begins\", which was more wrapped up with mythology than action and deeing the Batman in action. This time, we start off running with Batman finishing some business from the last movie. He keeps the film on the brink Another interesting thing I noticed about the film is that EVERY character is developed by the end of it. At first glance, all of the characters, second-billing and less, comes off extremely cardboard cut-out and one-dimensional. Surprisingly, throughout the course of the film, each and every one of them have their little story arcs that flesh out their characters.\n\nPerhaps this is why the movie has an epic feeling that surpasses the vast hype surrounding it. Having seen it three times in the theater, and \"other places\" (*waves at the Internet police*) I find myself hard-pressed to find a legitimate gripe about the movie. I have been sitting here this entire time trying to find one - and I can't. It is a taut, hard-boiled crime-thriller and mystery that happens to have a superhero at the thick of it; which is exactly how a Batman movie should work. Most of the film is even strangely realistic, in an unsettling way.\n\nProbably the finest movie of the year and a legitimate masterpiece.\n\n****/****"

        "review_detailed_main": "A new villain is in town and he's a homicidal clown known as The Joker. Batman must do everything in his power to stop him, while Harvey Dent takes the lime light as the new face of good.\n\nNot since The Matrix Reloaded have I been hyped to see a film. Where Reloaded failed to deliver on that hype, The Dark Knight soars with bright colours. Is it everything that a Batman fan wants it to be? Yes. Is it everything a film lover wants it to be? Yes. The Dark Knight takes you on a ride through action, suspense, humour and drama. It rests in a genre that makes you suspend a little reality. This is the comic book world, where there are green monsters, flying men in tights and teenagers swinging around in New York. Very bright, very over the top and very fun. The Dark Knight turns all of this on it's head and delivers a raw, realistic and genre defining film. Along with Iron Man, The Dark Knight sets a new standard for comic book adaptations.\n\nWithout a doubt, every review the one will read will praise the chaotic energy that Heath Ledger gives in the role of The Joker. Can a role really live up to such hype? Yes, and this is it. Heath Ledger goes where many people do not. He becomes the character, he becomes the Joker. Nicholson played the part well, but Ledger embodies it. Every little quirk, from the flicker in the eyes, raising the eyebrows or using his tongue to wet his lips, draws you into the character. It's safe to say the Ledger does indeed steal the show from everyone and the film knows this too. It's a shame we will never see where Ledger career would have gone, because this role is juicy and Ledger nails it.\n\nThat's not to say that everyone else isn't good either. Bale brings more tragedy into the heart of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Even with the world around him crumbling down, he still stands for good. Michael Cain reaches more depths with simple looks in his eyes. Both Alfred and Fox have moral dilemmas in this film, both play them well. Oldman has more screen time here then he did in Begins and he takes the character of Gordon to new heights. We know him as a good cop that doesn't conform to the corruption, but here his range explodes into more emotional decision making. Aaron Eckhart has the most troubling task here. He must play two completely different roles, within the same character, and we have to believe the transformation. His anger and hate mixes well with his confusion in what to do after his 'accident'. Finally Gyllenhaal, replaces Holmes. The character finally has some more range, but Gyllenhaal doesn't get enough screen time to bring it to us. Again, it's sad to say but this is the weakest link. It may just simply be the character.\n\nEverything about this film hits the nail on the head. The acting is top notch, no longer are roles in comic book films cheesy or one dimensional. These character are psychotic, dangerous, funny, defenseless and everything more you can ask for. Back when these characters could never be taken seriously, now are awing us with their presence. The script is fabulous. Every line of dialogue spoken by The Joker is chilling, now times that by ten because Ledger somehow gives the lines more chills. The action sequences are entertaining. We have car chases, fight scenes, race against the clock bits and anything else The Joker can come up with. With ever scheme he tops himself in the absurdity and craziness. More action then it's predecessor, more drama, more villainous and more dark. This isn't your Adam West Batman. This is Nolan's Batman.\n\nNolan has recreated what once was lost. When nipples and bad ice puns were where these characters were, now are set back in the right motion. Nolan has given us, not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie. You don't need high theatrics to create a great comic book film, you need substance. The Dark Knight has boatloads of this. I found myself wanting more of the Joker, I was so enthralled by the character and the performance. I found myself in awe of where the film goes, in terms of plot and character development. I applaud Nolan for not making a happy go lucky film, but for given The Dark Knight his true colours. He's a tormented soul, the events in this film push him to the limit, to his breaking point.\n\nThere are some minor setbacks though. I wasn't too thrilled with the bits in Hong Kong. Trims here and there could have saved the running time, which clocks in at 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes. As well as too many scene where the camera decides to spin around the characters a couple times, it gets a tad annoying.\n\nThe Dark Knight will break barriers. Comic book films will be more serious, more character and plot driven then CGI laden. Heath Ledger will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a sick and twisted clown. People will want to see what happens in this world and the people in it. The Dark Knight does create a new world, a world of fear and excitement. Where in some cases you kind of secretly want to root for the bad guy. This is a world I applaud, this is a film that I applaud. This is a perfect example of what a film should be."

But is it the best ? Not even close. In its own category, it dominates most of the movies though, probably as good as Ironman and better than the first movie. Like most of the people, I am satisfied with the film but there are a few criticisms that I can make, about the fighting sequences, jokers screen time, and the process of the movie.\n\nFirst I wonder, why this film isn't called \"Joker\"? Not only that Heath overshadows everyone with his performance, he also has incredible screen time as well, it is as if we are watching Joker as the main character, everything revolves around him. Maybe It was because there were too many characters in the movie, with separate goals and purposes, which also effected the process of the movie in my opinion. The story sometimes advanced too slow and sometimes too fast(but too fast in general) not allowing you to digest the theme fully.\n\nOne other thing is the fighting sequences, the careography was not well made, most of the time it was too blunt, too dark and because of that, hard to perceive. Maybe it was the directors intention, but it kinda disturbed me, not being able to understand what was going on.\n\nTo sum up it, the movie was just like I expected, but obviously below its hype, with a few deficiencies, a good movie in overall but definitely not a master piece."

        "review_detailed_main": "No words can quite aptly describe the dark, sinuous genius of Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\". A sequel to the 2005 \"Batman Begins\", the film defies the industry clich\u00e9 of being a shameless exploitation of a franchise.\n\nMuch has already been said about Heath Ledger's electric performance as the demented Joker and little else can really be said. It's a performance that displays every psychological tic with sadistic glee and Ledger, virtually unrecognisable behind both the makeup and the mannerisms, imbues his character with terrifying insanity.\n\nOf course, Ledger is just one of the many gems in a fine cast. Christian Bale is predictably good in the titular role but he's overshadowed by some other key players. Maggie Gyllenhaal is good as are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman but it's Aaron Eckhart who gives a truly amazing performance as Harvey Dent, Gotham's idealistic DA and the city's moral centre. Eckhart's innocuous golden boy looks belie his dramatic finesse and he conveys the duality of Harvey's character and ideals with great deft.\n\nThe high calibre of the cast is reason enough to go see the movie but it's the screenplay, written by the Nolan Brothers, that allows \"The Dark Knight\" to become more than just an adequate sequel. For all the cartoonish connotations of its comic book origins, the movie is a rich and fascinating study into the machinations of justice and humanity. In a genre of such formulaic conventions where \"doomed romance\" and \"final showdown\" are automatically entrenched in the storyline to inspire the same old message and emotions, it's hard to find some new ground. \"The Dark Knight\" succeeds, however, in toying with these very conventions and while the message that it sends is as subtle as an anvil crashing on your head, it's surprisingly powerful.\n\nSay what you will about the hype and about the free publicity that Ledger's death has earned this film but to credit it's commercial or critical success so cynically would do both the actor and this film an injustice. At the end of the day, \"The Dark Knight\" is brilliant entertainment with some phenomenal performances.\n\nIt's no definitive masterpiece but it's damn close."

        "review_title": "A Super Hero for Adults and Kids Alike",
        "review_detailed_main": "Finally, a super-hero film for adults. Avoiding the cartoon-style exploits of such super-heroes as Superman and Spiderman, director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a sophisticated, but hugely entertaining, take on the equally impressive Batman. \"The Dark Knight\" is witty, intelligent, and fast paced. The action scenes and effects are spectacular, but do not dominate or overwhelm the film. Nolan does not linger over gratuitous explosions and lengthy chases. When a scene has communicated its purpose, he wisely moves on. Despite the film's 2\u00bd hour running time, the movie seems tight and has little excess.\n\nAlthough Batman has no Robin, he is surrounded by a fine group of villains and supporters. Michael Caine underplays the quasi-butler, but delivers some amusing lines, and Morgan Freeman is solid and reassuring as another of Bruce Wayne's employees. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman ably hold up the public servant side of the equation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine as Rachel Dawes, although few demands were made on her talents. In the central role, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne/Batman. His icy-perfect face and pumped-up body are physically all that a Batman should be. Yet beneath the glossy exterior, he manages to breathe life into the crusading vigilante. Then, of course, there is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger's performance steals every scene that he is in. Behind a crude childish makeup, he is at once demented, evil, funny, and over-the-top entertaining. However, even when he is delivering a humorous line, the villainous edge remains. When Ledger flicks his tongue, plays with his hands, or rolls his eyes, he captures the audience and holds them with his magic.\n\nFuture super-hero films undoubtedly will be measured against \"The Dark Knight.\" From Batman's stylish costume, his motorcycle, and the Batmobile to the dark, glistening cinematography, the stylish art direction, and the state-of-the-art special effects, the film rarely falters. With a sterling cast and a gifted director, \"The Dark Knight\" sets a new standard for summer action flicks. At last, a comic-book super-hero film that will not only grab the key pre-teen male audience, but also bring in discerning adults who may never have read a comic book or attended a movie in the summer. Way to go, Batman."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow. How else could I describe this movie? I was wondering how this could possibly better than Batman Begins, but the truth is it was a different type of a movie. Yet it still held those morals of righteousness, faith, ethics, responsibility and so on, it was just presented in a different way.\n\nThe acting was amazing overall. Maybe not every individual performance was first rate but as a whole the cast was among the best ever. Christian Bale, who is undoubtedly the best Batman ever and probably the best superhero ever, like in Batman Begins, provides a deep and thought provoking performance. One with authenticity, validity, purity and most of all originality. His performance is subtle yet compelling, it is not by what we as a culture would like to think of as heroic but in my thinking that is exactly what it is. Unlike every other superhero he does not have superpowers. He is an intellectual who needs to rely on his and his friends' intelligence in order to do what he does. He is not an actual \"superhero\" he is a man. A man with the audacity to do what is always right even when no one else would do so. Bale throughout is able to display the turbulent lifestyle he lives in and how at times he \"The Batman\" himself has to question his own morality.\n\nThe best performance of the movie though was not Bale's its Heath Ledger's. Like Bale he brings originality to a comic book character. It seems though that in every comic book movie the villains are never quite as unusual or scary as they should be. Ledger in this movie is able to pull off what repeatedly other actors have failed to do as comic book villains, give you that bone chilling feeling. Entirely throughout he brings intensity beyond intensity. His performance is so capturing and disturbing that he makes you laugh out of sheer horror, something that you rarely feel while watching a movie. The most frightening part about the way he portrays his character is not his freakishness, it's that his performance is not the least bit cartoonish, it is in fact very real. His performance is just beyond words.\n\nAaron Eckhart was quite a surprise to me. We basically saw the rise and fall of his character Harvey Dent. The way he transformed from an incorruptible district attorney to a vengeful bloodthirsty maniac was simply perfect. Gary Oldman I was not surprised by though. I have always thought of him as a talented actor and unlike Batman Begins he is able to give a more serious portrayal of James Gordon and did as well as I expected and more. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a godsend compared to Katie Holmes. She seemed more fitting in the role of a lawyer and was able to pull off many scenes Holmes probably could not. Michael Caine is perfect for the role of Alfred. Alfred is more than a butler of Batman he is a friend, a father figure and righteous man. Who better than for Michael Caine with his great voice to portray such a character? Another actor with an even better voice is Morgan Freeman. He may not have had a large amount of screen time but he was certainly never a forgotten figure at any point in this movie.\n\nThe writing was very good. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are among the best writers currently and once again show off their talent. What is so interesting in the way that the script was written was that it did not aim to make anyone the star of the show. This script brought the best or should I say the most intriguing traits out of every character and actor. Everyone in this film had their moment to shine which was very satisfying to see. Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all deservingly so are allowed to not just be in this movie but a part of it. Not once have I thought \"oh I wish I could have seen more of this character and less of that one\". The writing was the glue to this movie and should be given more credit.\n\nI am now much more comfortable with saying that Christopher Nolan is currently the best director. He in the past has done great movies such as Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins and The Prestige. This movie was a perfectly crafted and is probably one of the best made movies ever. He is able to do something that most directors, including the great ones, cannot do. He can keep you well engaged into a movie and still provide some sort of a deep meaning at the same time. At no point in this movie did I ever wonder what time it was or how much longer is left. That something I could say I have never done. What other director in the past has brought out depth from a superhero? The answer is no other has. He maintains an authentic feeling that you would get from watching The Godfather and still excite you like your watching Die Hard. His direction in this movie is more than special it is a monumental achievement in film.\n\nNow what do I mean by a sign of hope? It not only has its hopeful and inspiring message saying that we have the power. It says that society doesn't have to determine who we are. That is not even it though. Over the years now summer blockbusters have become mostly shallow and superficial. This maybe one of the biggest blockbusters ever but it has something that the others did not have: true, deep meaning. Hopefully this movie can be an example to the rest of Hollywood. Maybe just maybe Hollywood can do something that it has not done for years; incorporating thought provoking, deep philosophical themes consistently back into their summer blockbuster commercial movies."

Aaron Arkhat (or however you spell his name) also gave a strong performance as Hearvy Dent, and the other cast was pretty solid.\n\nThe script is just great... this is truly one of the best films if not the best that portrait the battle between good and evil, between what right and wrong, and about making the right choices.\n\nNow, retrospectively, i am really disappointed with the trailers for this movie, they composed different sentences to give it a more intense feeling and gave a lot of the action in the movie... sure they were great, but also gives you high expectations for this movie... and i hate coming to a movie with high expectations, so a little let down in that aspect. and yes 2 hours and a half did feel a bit long.\n\nThat been said, TDK is a fantastic movie (sure it has some flaws, but what movie doesn't) its well written, directed and acted, action packed and even epic in a way only time will make it.\n\nOverall this is a MUST SEE movie for anyone that has a little sympathy for movies.\n\n9.7/10"

He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenever he is on screen. The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be remembered for years to come.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story between good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective motives.\n\nBatman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the sacrifices he makes for the city he believes in.

Growing up, there had only been one movie that had enveloped almost every possible area of media before its release; \"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace\". Rightfully so, because Star Wars was and still is the highest grossing trilogy in U.S. history. Until recently, that had been the most \"hyped\" film I have been alive to see open in the theaters. That was of course until \"The Dark Knight\".\n\nI remember my friends buying tickets 2 weeks in advance for the IMAX screening of \"I Am Legend\" in December, just so we could get the 6 minute sneak of \"The Dark Knight\". When the sneak of \"The Dark Knight\" was over, it was met with uproarious applause. Right then I knew this film was going to be special. And then came the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. But instead of deterring those to see the movie, the buzz surrounding his take on \"The Joker\" began to spread like the plague. And as the time approached for the film's release, words and phrases like \"Masterpiece\", \"Oscar-Worthy\", and \"Best of its genre\" began showing up in various media outlets. The controversy of Ledger's death, matched with this buzz of his performance, matched with the media dubbing this film \"Not to be missed\" made this the most anticipated film release in my lifetime. Much more so than any of the 3 Star Wars prequels.\n\nIn closing, for those of you who haven't seen the film... In fact for those of you who haven't seen any Batman films... This film certainly lived up to its hype. Chris Nolan pushed the envelope for what is considered a \"comic book movie\", because unlike 99.9% of comic book films, when watching \"The Dark Knight\", everything in the movie is most certainly possible in the real world (perhaps even the bat-pod). So the movie plays off as more of a Crime-Action/Drama than it does a stereotypical Comic book flick. At the rate this film is going, it will at the least become the second highest-grossing film in U.S. history, and at the most, it will soar over Titanic."

Why does everyone think this is the most amazing superhero movie of all time? the movie dragged on for far too long and really wasn't as entertaining as movies like Spider-Man 2, Iron Man, or even the Tim Burton Batman films. In my mind, this movie doesn't hold a candle to those movies. the general plot was boring and way too serious, Bale's acting was horrible (He was much better in Batman Begins), and there was way too much dialogue. On the other hand, Ledger was amazing as the Joker, and the overall acting from the rest of the cast was good (With the exception of Bale and Aaron Eckhart. they were pretty bad in this one.) The action was great, although, at some points in the movie, I felt like I've seen it all before. over all, the movie was good, and I would've even considered it a classic at one point. but the overall hype of this movie seems to extinguish that notion from my mind. as I said before, it's a good movie, but not as amazing as people put it out to be."

I can step back and objectively say it was a \"good\" movie on some levels, the performances, over-the-top entertainment, etc. But the bottom line is I hated it. Loud, obnoxious, pointless, and soulless. Who are these awful people? Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker, and it was impressive. He's fascinating to watch. But what is the point of his character? At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role, Heath's joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value. I don't get the point. Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining, are we that desperate?\n\nI was disappointed in Christian Bale too. He is one of the best actors working today, but this time he was kind of flat. I thought he was better in Batman Begins. This entire movie is just so over-the-top: explosions (wow an explosion, that's new), the cool looking but ridiculous motor-cycle, the millionth chase scene, repulsive characters like Two-Face, and on and on. We've seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers, and this loud, obnoxious trash is the result. We really are getting desperate.\n\nI usually agree with IMDb more or less, the ratings are usually reliable. But right now this is #5, come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie? I'm not hating it on purpose because of the hype, I liked Iron Man and that got hyped, I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped. But this nightmare of a movie needs a backlash."

The movie's complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple story.\n\nI like the way Bruce Wayne was portrayed, a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat. This is just a good way to hide his true identity, by being what people expect him to be. Like the Art of War, when you are strong you pretend that you are weak. A true player of the system so he can continue with his work.\n\nThe Joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting. When you begin to see the character and not the actor, you begin to understand that Heath did a great job on the Joker. I remember the Joker not Heath.\n\nThe movie's theme and music became my last-song-syndrome, great score by Hans Zimmer.

I know I am going to get a huge negative response for this comment due to the fact that everyone loves this movie so much but I personally don't think it is a flawless movie like everyone makes it out to be. It is good the acting is good the special effects are good,but the hype for this movie didn't reach a crazy level till Heath Ledger passed then right before release everyone started throwing a fit over this movie.

        "review_title": "Let's be honest - They should just call this movie \"The Joker\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "Let's get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath Ledger's Joker makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero's Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this Joker actually feels dangerous. Every moment he's on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this iconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and probably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. It's really quite a shame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again.\n\nDoes the rest of the movie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... It's got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good script for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly:\n\nIf they have to recast Rachel Dawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bale's gruff \"Batman\" voice still sounds a little over-the-top and almost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due to the involvement of \"Two-Face.\" This film didn't need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the audience wish they'd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. I've never cared for the character, and I suppose it's good they didn't wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didn't do anything for me. Aside from those aspects, however, it's difficult to find much to criticize in this movie.\n\nI struggled greatly with the rating for this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But Ledger's Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating. Forget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was just afforded the opportunity to watch the newest batman installment The Dark Knight but not only did i get to lay my eyes upon a Nolan gift to the world, I saw it at 12.00pm and school was back in session.\n\nSo without the constant ramblings of minors or the reverberating sounds of popcorn crunching I was allowed to fully appreciate what had been put to the screen.\n\nTo say i was elated with the finished result is an enormous understatement but it is also something that does not come on like a flood. Some scenes once begun can seem like a simply and brainless action flick as \"spiderman\" is asked to chose someone's fate but the conclusion of each scene leaves you stunned as if you have just come to the twist in fight club and no one has spoiled the ending.\n\nIt does not take much thought to see that this is a good film, but soon after the movie whilst you are sipping on your Mocha or catching the train home as I did, that you realise this is a great film. Morals are questioned and lines are crossed and these are all beautifully created by the Nolan brothers.\n\nThey may not have the odd brilliance of the Coens or the VFX beauty of the Wachowski's but this brother duo are the new force to be reckoned with in theatre. The title says crime film and I stand by that notion because what the Nolan's put to screen is not a comic-book PG blockbuster. Within minutes you feel like you are watching another crime thriller even though the protagonist is dressed in a black Kevlar suit and the antagonist dolled up like a two-dollar hooker.\n\nThe action/story is fast-paced and the editing very edgy throughout fight scenes keeping that sense that we are all just blind as bats as he moves amongst us.\n\nAnd now onto the performances, Without doubt one of Ledger best characters and I know that the former statement is already echoing like a poor clich\u00e9 but it can be justified. It was not so much as what he said in the movie that evoked my 'endearment' but what he left to his body. His jerky movements and twitches as he almost seems uncomfortable in the trappings of his human body and then when he does open his mouth it amplifies everything that his body tells you. It is so easy to forget that this is in fact Heath Ledger, the man who sang to Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You, he simply is not himself and you can feel just how much he put into his performance because you truly believe that this man is mad.\n\nIt goes unsaid that Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain both dominate in their particular roles especially in the case of Cain as he is given some wonderful dialog, which he delivers with perfect tone absolutely stealing the scene from anyone he is accompanying.\n\nBale again shows the world what a real batman should be; torn, misguided, hopeful and terrifying but the one role that truly stood out in the film was that of Gary Oldman. Long gone is the sympathetic innocence we saw of his character in Batman Begins, as he gives rise to a powerful Gordon and a character that really belongs in Nolan's envisioning of Gotham. As i watched each scene with Oldman I thought that i was watching the likes of Keitel or Spacey, he took every opportunity to prove himself as a great actor and in each scene he intimidates the audience with his power.\n\nThe main factor behind the re-birth of the Batman franchise is believability, Gone are the glo-paint and mo-hawks as the Nolan's give a haunting image of a world, our world, riddled with corruption in it's darkest hours before the dawn.\n\nWithout hesitation i give this movie 10 stars as it is beautifully shot, encouragingly directed, impressively written and memorably performed. This sets a new standard for the comic-book movie, I wonder who can step up to the plate?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a batman fan. Not a fanboy mind you, I have read the comics, seen the other films, and like batman story well enough, but unlike a few of my friends, I haven't been following the release for this movie like a bloodhound. But thanks to above mentioned friends, I have been passively looking forward to it. So we booked our tickets, got to one of the first showings in the world (I live in Australia) and got ready to see a movie that could not possibly live up to the hype that has engulfed the world. I was so wrong, so, so wrong.\n\nThis film stands so far above its predecessor it is on another planet. Nolans script is, like most of his movies, a complex and involving one. Unlike his some of his other films, the acting, story, cinematography etc all belong on the same pedestal. Never before have I felt the palm sweaty excitement of a gripping film take hold of me for a complete running time (and keep in mind this is 2 and half hours). The lack of CGI is one of the films biggest assets. The action feels gritty and real, involving you more than the graphics heavy iron man or Hulk ever did.\n\nId heard talk of Ledger being nominated for a posthumous Oscar but had thought it a silly move, why give awards to someone who cannot accept it? But his performance is mind blowing, creating one of the best villains ever to grace the screen. I don't know if an Oscar is the right way to do it, but his performance needs to be acknowledged for the masterpiece it is. Id heard a critic call this the \"empire strikes back\" of superhero films, and it really is the perfect comparison. This film proves that some \"superhero\" movies don't belong in a little niche, to be weighed against each other, not the \"serious\" films, but can instead be acclaimed as deep, involving and above all exciting works of film-making."

        "review_detailed_main": "Actually, first of all, I can't compare Batman Begins with the Dark Knight. They have different plot. Begins shows the introduction of Batman, the origin of Batman. The Dark Knight has a more darker plus interesting plot. It is commendable. Plus bigger action pieces, the movie goes in deep with humans' feelings. It is quite good and I understand it receives a lot of positive reviews. Christopher Nolan did a good job in everything in the movie, making the story deep and dark but engrossing.\n\nThe story: The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and wants to kill Batman at first. With his trick plans, nobody even Batman can find him or predict his next move. Batman must stop the Joker from further destruction of Gotham. From there, humans' emotions slowly rise. There are some big action pieces, plot that you want to know and electronic music. I am somewhat disappointed with Two-face aka Harvey Dent, considered the white knight. I wished that Two-face will be given a bigger role. Other from that, it is hard to see any faults with the movie. Acting is good, Heath ledger makes a good joker.\n\nOverall: It is good to watch this in cinema. The runtime although long seems to pass quickly. You won't be disappointed. The first scene features bank robbing to hype the audience. It, not only shows you that it has the big action, shows the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movie."

I found myself laughing out loud, not because the movie was particularly funny, but because Heath Ledger NAILED his performance in every scene.\n\nThe Joker's character nuances were hard to miss and easy to love. After his first and second appearances in the movie I found myself just waiting for the next scene with The Joker. I've seen the movie twice now and can't wait to see it again just to see Ledger's acting.\n\nIt's not that the other characters didn't do their part, because they did. As always Christian Bale delivered a performance that is hard to rival. Aaron Eckhart, I feel, has thrown himself into a realm where those who see this movie will be hard-pressed to forget him. I've always liked Eckhart, and now when I talk about him others will know who I'm talking about.\n\nThe only complaint I had is that the movie felt compact. Yes, it was long; no, it wasn't rushed. I just felt like there was so much more story to be had. It's like when you're reading a really good book and you see the number of pages narrowing and you just don't want it to end.\n\nMy thanks and congratulations to everyone who made this movie. TDK deserves its spot near the top of the greatest movies ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "My wife and myself, parents of three little kids, rarely get to go to the cinema. Two weeks ago, during our holidays, we got my parent to babysit the little monsters, so that we can finally get out again. Taking a peek into the papers (actually *real* papers, I had no internet access :-) ) revealed, that \"The Dark Knight\" was the only watchable movie playing in the small nearby town.\n\nSomewhat reluctantly, we decided to give it a try. What the hell, we thought, we are on holidays anyway, why not check a kids movie (sorry to all fans of previous Batman movies, but that's just what I think of them).\n\nBOY, were we surprised! After the movie, it took us a few minutes before we both burst out \"this is one of the best movies I ever saw!\" I won't go into any details, for the multitude of excellent comments on this board already presents this movie as it is: a MASTERPIECE! Especially the performance of the late Heath Ledger (Joker) was unbelievable (posthumous Oscar, anyone?) I actually felt quite nervous and actually even a bit scared during some Joker scenes - something I didn't experience that often in a movie theater! And yet, we both felt, that quite a few lines of his could have been from us... :-)\n\nIt's a must, please go watch it either in a real movie theater, or in a DAMN good home theater. While the special effects in this movie are just what they *should* be (a mere vehicle to transport the message), the atmosphere of the movie just won't come over if you watch it on a 19\" monitor with your 5.1 headset on... :-) I'd gladly pay again to see it one more time!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching the various Batman incarnations over the years, from the Adam West era, through the Superfriends, Tim Burton and Friends, and the very excellent Bruce Timm Batman: The Animated Series of the 1990s, we are faced with various versions of the Joker.\n\nThe Animated Series Joker was voiced by Mark Hamill, and is considered by many fans to be the best Joker up to now. He certainly is creepy, and in the film spin-offs he does actually murder people explicitly on occasion, but though he is good it's hard to imagine him existing outside of the art deco alternate universe of Bruce Timm. He's just not unpredictable enough. He has steady henchmen who trust him enough to turn their backs on him.\n\nJack Nicholson's Joker was well-received at the time, but he too suffered from a believability gap, in addition to being over the top and, while crazy, not quite creepy.\n\nEnter the Dark Knight's Heath Ledger: the freak make-up, the crazy, but disturbingly lucid philosophy, the complete lack of empathy for other people, and the scary practice of killing people for fun and without warning, his fondness for knives. I can actually imagine running into a character like this in a city somewhere. Certainly, not quite as complete, the real-life version wouldn't have the smarts to pull off so many grand schemes along with all the pure evil traits (you hope), but there are a small number of people out there who share some of the Joker's characteristics, and that's what makes Ledger's character so creepy, so scary.\n\nEvery scene he is in, accompanied by music that would feel at home in any Hitchcock or horror film, is filled with a sense of tension and dread. What horror will he next bring upon the people standing before him? Who's next? Without a doubt the best Joker ever, Ledger's performance did not feel at all like a comic book superhero movie bad guy. I was thinking more like Hannibal Lechtur. Intelligent, lucid, menacing, and, I'm convinced, not really insane, but horribly sane, with a tendency to view life as pointless and thus amusing.\n\nOh, yeah, the rest of the movie? That was good, too. Eckhart's Harvey Dent was also very satisfying, with no campiness to bring it down. His trajectory from ace prosecutor to criminal Two-Face is very well-done. Bale, Caine, Oldman, Freeman, and Gyllenhall are all well-cast. The action is better than Batman Begins, with the fistfight scenes in particular being easier on the eyes, with less spastic camera motion. The writing and direction is more along the lines of a crime drama or an action film than a comic book adaptation, and the story starts off with action and keeps you going for the whole 2.5 hours.\n\nVery dark, violent, and very well-done film all around."

And I thought that Batman Begins was difficult to top! Heath Ledger gave the performance of his life. You really have to give credit to the man; he did came a long way from A Knight's Tale and 10 Things. His Joker was discomfiting, psychotic and confirms my suspicions about clowns! With his passing, it up the spooky scale a few notches. He held his own against the big wigs - well, I think he even surpassed a few of them. He has the best one-liners too! His lines spoke of chaos, death or the lack thereof. Art imitating life or vice versa. One wonders if he took his character a tad too far.\n\nTo sum it all up, The Dark Knight has twists at every turn, exciting batmobile chases, cool new gadgets (and suit!), stellar performances, tight plots and witty script. This made for a very good summer movie.\n\nGo watch it or you'll be the last not to. And parting in the Joker's (now famous) line - \"Why so serious?\""

Avid film watchers will gush.\n\nChristopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'--well, frankly it tickled the bottom of my cockles. I'm very rarely tickled in that magically hidden place of pleasure (save for many random moments from my fianc\u00e9). After watching this film, I can't sum up my feelings for it in one review. I must see it again, and again. I wanted to see it right after I got done watching it, but all showings were sold out at the theater I was at.\n\nThis movie will kick you in the teeth, figuratively speaking. If in an IMAX theater though, it will at least rattle your teeth as it is booming in those theaters.\n\nThe acting is superb throughout. The directing, the lighting, the action, the set pieces, the script and plot are great as well. Ledger may be getting his just rewards for his portrayal of the Joker, but I feel the other actors are getting short-shrifted in their praise. They all do very well. Even the swat team members who really have no names in the movie.\n\nAs for critics and their assertions about the movie? Too dark, too grim and depressing? No, not at all. In fact, it surprised me how far it didn't go in that direction. The graphic novels are a lot more depressing from time to time. A work of art? A masterpiece? Oscar worthy material? Yes. Yes to all three questions. More importantly though, this film is masterfully made work of love. Love for the source material. Love for film, and most importantly love for the human being.\n\nWe can be soulless creatures every now and then. We can. When the chips are down, however, we show who we really are. Not schemers, not killers. We're human. We do what we have to in order for us to survive. When the chips are down, we will band together."

Hype has built up this movie, coupled with the over-played fact that Heath Ledger overdosed on medication. While Heath Ledger made the character interesting, his acting does not compare with TRULY emotionally impacting roles. Compare his acting with Jack Nicholson in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". While Heath Ledger's portrayal was effective, the SCRIPT and the director made the movie truly effective. Also, this movie did not possess the intelligence of other Christopher Nolan movies. In my opinion, the best part of Christopher Nolan's movies has always been his manipulation of time. This is the first of his movies that did not make use of this. Movies like Memento and the Prestige made use of time to create a sophisticated twists and turns. These movies did not reach the rating given \"The Dark Knight\" due partly because their sophistication caused them to lose widespread popularity, and also because they were not hyped as large summer blockbusters. The widespread popularity of this movie, as well as undeserved hype, will eventually calm, and this movie will be pushed out of the top fifty."

        "review_detailed_main": "First things first.\n\nThis film is not a comic book movie. It is not an action movie. To reduce it to these archetypes would be completely unfair.\n\nTo fairly represent this movie it must be seen for what it is - It is a dramatic suspense film that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the surprisingly long running time (surprising in that it goes by so fast, and also that the studio allowed Christoper Nolan to cut it this long) Batman Begins was seen by most to be a triumph in the comic adaptation genre. However, it did remain a comic adaptation in many ways.\n\nThe Dark Knight goes beyond that. This film blows suspense up to a city-wide level, and raises the stakes to a breathtaking level. It recalls the suspenseful nature of films by the likes of David Fincher, Ridley Scott, and even the master, Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nIt's crafted in such a way that each action seems both inevitable and unbelievable, and so even for fans of the comic book who believe they know where it is going, it is an astounding achievement.\n\nThe film looks spectacular, thanks to Nolan's regular cinematographer Wally Pfister. Gotham city looks brighter, yet more ominous during the day, and danker and more dangerous at night.\n\nThe performances are as spectacular as many had expected and/or hoped. Bale returns in fine form as the titular character, and can't be faulted too much. Eckhart debuts as District Attorney Harvey Dent, and the storyline effectively revolves around him and his war on organised crime in Gotham. There are fine supporting performances from the returning Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, as well as the newcomers Eric Roberts, Nestor Carbonell and Maggie Gyllenhaal (who thankfully takes over from Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes).\n\nHowever, if the action centres on Harvey Dent, then the action IS Heath Ledger's performance as the maniacal Joker. In one of the finest film performances of the last decade, Ledger puts in what will end up being an unforgettable final (complete) performance that will have almost everyone buzzing about a potential posthumous Academy Award.\n\nI cannot reiterate enough - Not only is this film excellent, and highly enjoyable to watch, but it is of such a fine quality that it should really transcend the typical box created for films that are deemed to not contain the correct \"subject matter\". Much in the way Rocky transcended the typical \"sports movie\", so this transcends the typical \"comic book movie\" - It is much more than that, and should legitimately be considered come Oscar season. If this movie cannot earn some consideration by the Academy, they might as well come out and call them the Academy Awards for slow-paced, moody dramas, because this is the best film I have seen in a long time, and that's including the crop that were nominated for best picture last year.\n\nIn short, go see this movie. If you, or your friends, or anyone you know has been excited about this movie to come out, then just know that everything that they were excited for is justified.\n\nGo see it - You'll enjoy it, because it's terrific. There's not much more to say."

Heath Ledger's much hyped performance lived up to all expectations, being both chilling, yet horrifyingly captivating. Where I live in Australia was lucky enough to be one of the first showings in the world, and I feel that many of the patrons in our cinema were there solely to see our lost son in his final performance, and it is a great lasting memory for us to be left with. The only minor qualm that I may have with this film is that the final cut is more about Heath Ledger than it is about the film's star. Christian Bale had noticeably less screen time than Ledger, why this is, I am not sure. The performance of the cast is, as you would expect from the stunning ensemble cast is remarkable. Old hands Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman bring the prestige and grace to the screen, while the new kids on the block (Gyllenhaal, Bale, and the outstanding Aaron Eckhart) truly knock it out of the park.\n\nIf you miss out on this film, you truly are missing out, it is a modern classic.

A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under 2 hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurting.\n\nIt's a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great, but still, some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters. The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex, he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real characters.\n\nThe story was very hard for me to follow. I don't appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie. I am still not sure why Mr. \"Two Face\" went sour and frankly I didn't care that he did.\n\nThere is a very heavy thematic effort here; much of film is trying to clearly define good vs. evil and the shifting ambiguity of that, to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated. I applaud this kind of effort in an action film, but here the authors take just too long to get there. I was itching to get out of my seat and had to force myself to sit through to the very end, and that's not good for any movie."

We have an almost three hour movie that really feels longer and doesn't know where to go and when to stop.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about Heath Ledger's performance. The hype is absolutely justified. He lights up the screen with his performance and the film is delightful when he is on the screen. Part of the problem is that no other characters are equally as interesting and that includes Christian Bale as Batman. There is not all that much charisma in Christian Bale's characterization as Bruce Wayne and none of the other characters grab the screen the way Heath Ledger does, so the movie doesn't really give Heath Ledger much to play off of most of the time. Eric Roberts, almost unrecognizable probably due to the work that has been done on his face, has some acting moments in a minor role that cause a stir. I always liked him and wish I saw more of him.\n\nMeanwhile, the film has so many twists and turns that do nothing more than confuse, I felt more like I was in a maze that I couldn't get out of rather than on a roller coaster ride. Just when I thought there might be a resolution to the film, yet another plot twist, a new discovery would occur. I found myself looking at my watch after about an hour and a half or so, and the movie was only half over! The first part of the film, that is to say, the first hour, was more character setup and that was far more interesting. The first part of the film relied more on dialogue and there was quite a bit of evident wit. But when the plot points started getting laid on thick and heavy, I got restless and continued to get more so. At film's end, I ended up thinking \"So what?\". I was glad to have seen Heath Ledger's performance, but not much more than that. I felt, other than for Ledger, the film wasted my time (and money)."

        "review_title": "Why So Serious?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Why is \"The Dark Knight\" so serious? For many good reasons. Christopher Nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplistic comic book story like \"Batman\" and turn it into a complex psychological movie with plethora of character study. He has directed Christian Bale into the most serious Batman character of all. He sure did direct the late Heath Ledger into performing as the best Joker of them all, and Ledger did not work to upstage Bale or the other actors in any way. Ledger should definitely win a posthumous Oscar for his scary performance of a clown who possesses deep wounds.\n\nIf Christopher Nolan was old enough, he should have done Batman movies instead of Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher put together. Tim Burton's mood was dark as well, but as I'm looking at it now, Michael Keaton was a more sloppy Batman, Kim Basinger was a mousy Vicky Vale, and Jack Nicholson overdid his Joker performance. In \"Batman Returns,\" also directed by Burton and starring Keaton, the commercialism continues, adding Michelle Pfeiffer as a more idiotic Catwoman than the Catwomen on the 1960s TV series and Danny DeVito, who still was a wounded Penguin, but not enough that we feel sorry for him. Then in the mid 1990s, Keaton didn't want to play Batman anymore, feeling he was upstaged by all the villains. Looking for more actors often typecast as villains, director Schumacher got Tommy Lee Jones to parody his villain persona as Harvey \"Two-Face\" Dent. Also, there was still that rubberface persona in Jim Carrey as the Riddler as well. 1997's \"Batman and Robin\" was a total washout. So Nolan came to rescue this moribund franchise and made his own franchise moody with dark colors, mature, less focus on the action and more on the story and detailed development of each character without exploiting them. In 2005, \"Batman Begins\" was just the beginning, but \"The Dark Knight\" is the real story. It would be sin that Christopher Nolan does not get nominated for an Oscar, just as well as Heath Ledger, for best director.\n\nChristian Bale is, and many people would agree with me, the best Batman of them all. With his rich performance, we do know him better than Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney put together. We know Bruce Wayne's haunted past and demons, and why he becomes his alter ego Batman to fight crime in Gotham City. Unlike Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger is a much more complicated joker. He doesn't torture people just for pure torture. He doesn't laugh maliciously between every single sentence. He grew up with such an abusive upbringing that he wants to exploit Batman as a fraud for Gotham City, even bringing in Batman clones with the typical Caped Crusader outfit on the crime scenes just to tell Bruce Wayne \"Will the real Batman stand up?\"\n\nAll the other actors give excellent, detailed performances. Maggie Gyllenhal gives a stronger performance than Katie Holmes (Mrs. Tom Cruise) as Bruce Wayne's love interest Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes, but is smitten with D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in the end. Gary Oldman, in one of his few good-guy roles, does a fine turn as the mustachioed Commissioner Gordon, more serious than the one we've seen on TV. Veteran thespians Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are always a treat to watch as the faithful butler Alfred and the gadget inventor Lucius Fox. These two men get better with age each time they make movies. And Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey \"Two-Face\" Dent not as a torturous villain like Tommy Lee Jones did before, but as a victim wounded by the Joker's torture in a gas chamber out to seek revenge with his coin as his calling card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on his intended targets.\n\nThe summer of 2008 had a lot of movies. I've seen \"Mamma Mia\" as a light feel-good musical comedy riddled with off-key singing, notably by Pierce Brosnan. I've seen \"Wall-E,\" which I thought was Pixar's blander efforts. Remy the rat from last year upstaged this robot on all costs. But \"The Dark Knight\" is the best movie of the summer. When it comes to comic book stories, as I said before, directors Burton and Schumacher got all caught up in themselves with too much action and seemed to forget their audiences. Nolan never does."

Then I watched it again and liked it a bit better. Now I think it's good, or could even be very good.\n\nI'm finally starting to understand Heath Ledger's Joker performance. I now think it's great. I think the point is that it is such a facade it leaves you wondering what is behind that facade, and then you realise there's nothing there. That is what makes the performance so terrifying. The Joker IS the mask. Who is wearing it?\n\nA criticism I have now heard from a few people about this movie - a movie nobody dared to criticise for years - is that there should have been only one villain. Joker was enough. I now feel inclined to agree. Harvey Dent is a great character, but Two-Face feels unnecessary. His descent into bad guy mode, after being a true hero, also feels unwarranted. Such a massive turnaround probably needed a whole movie to explain. Instead Two-Face gets Joker's leftovers.\n\nI also feel the movie was too long. I often lost interest toward the end."

It wasn't amazing, it wasn't even great. Just like Ian Curtis his death did him the world of good. I'm not saying he wasn't a capable actor; I'm simply saying he wasn't anything special.\n\nHave we reached an age where licking your lips and snuffling is regarded as 'a performance that should earn him every award known to man'?\n\nHe is only regarded as being so super good because he's dead - simple as that.\n\nWatch Tim Burton's Batman, it's a better film."

It is truly a masterpiece.\n\nMe and my friend decided to go to see this film in the cinema as we wanted to see Heath Ledger in this final film. I am so glad I went to see this movie. I'll admit that I wasn't sure whether to go and this film at first as I'm not really a big fan of Batman and have never seen any of the other movies to do with Batman.\n\nI am glad I took the chance to go and see The Dark Knight because it was such a treat.\n\nThe Joker was my favourite character (and not because Heath Ledger portrayed him). I found myself feeling sorry for the Joker and then not liking him and there has only been one other movie that has made me feel that way (The Godfather).\n\nChristian Bale was great as Batman and in my opinion they could not have cast anyone better for the part. Heath Ledger really did go out with a bang as he astounded me with his acting. The Dark Knight was truly his best role that he has played, well at least that's what I think.\n\nMy list of favourite movies always changes but I know that this one will stay at the top for years to come.\n\nHope my review helped."

For me, it already was one of the greatest movies ever made in 2008, but now I'm confident when I say that this one of the very few movies out there that I can call a \"Masterpiece\". Once you rewatch it, and actually think about the message that it sends about society, villains, and how certain sacrifices must be made for the greater good, even if we don't agree with them. This is no good v bad guy movie,it's so much more than that. Most will probably agree with me that Nolan is the greatest director of the 21st century. His works like Inception, The Prestige, and Interstellar will be remembered for many years, but The Dark Knight is on a whole other level, and will forever be one of the greatest movies ever made."

Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain.\n\nIn conclusion: 10/10."

It's marvelous how Nolan succeeded to present in one movie Batman that is so realistic and that we can connect to it and really be pulled into movie and that he preserves all craziness of Joker that is demanded from his character. Batman movie can be done in various ways and one reason is because Batman and his greatest enemy have no superpowers and I see that as a good thing because then you have more space and need to present these characters not as someone who can really exist but as someone who put you more into movie and unreal world of comic book at the same time. He put this two things together in something that almost everyone would watch and like, but without losing true representation of Dark knight."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Batman Begins\" is certainly a great movie. It had its weaknesses, such as the lack of a strong villain and a finale that left me a bit disappointed. Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the character was certainly the darkest and most down to earth that we'd seen up until that point. Its sequel film manages to do something truly spectacular and blow that movie out of the water.\n\nThe dichotomy between the Joker (Heath Ledger) and Batman (Christian Bale) is what makes this film a modern classic. The Joker acts as a force of pure malicious evil. And Batman acts as a force of pure incorruptible good. In all honesty though, the Joker is the main character of this film. It is he who drives the plot forward. And saying that Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest villain performances of all time shouldn't be taken lightly, especially when other Academy Award winning actors have also done tremendous things with the character. Ledger's Joker is a completely different beast, a truly vicious and terrifying psychopath. He absolutely elevates this already stupendous crime drama to a higher level.\n\nOften downplayed by other reviewers, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) also plays a crucial role. The pureness of both Batman and the Joker in their respective sides is contrasted by a man who is completely neutral and leaves every decision to chance. Although every performance in this movie is naturally overshadowed by Ledger's, Eckhart does a great job as well. As do Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman. A truly stellar cast.\n\nThe cinematography and action sequences are great. Amazing visuals that you expect out of a Nolan film.\n\nNot much else to say about this classic. It deserves all of the adulation and recognition that it receives. It is in a completely different league above all other superhero films in that it places us in a dark, gritty, and macabre world, where the heroes are truly heroic and the villains are truly villainous."

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman: The Dark Knight improves on everything from Begins and I mean everything, this film has next to no flaws. It's Christopher Nolan at his finest, creating a film that everyone can like, superhero fan or not. The brilliant storytelling is there, so is the breathtaking cinematography and of course the superb direction from Nolan. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of Batman or superhero films in general for this movie, it's after all considered to be one of the best films of its decade and one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. The film received eight nominations at the Oscars, winning the award for Best Sound Editing and Best Supporting Actor for Ledger's performance as the Joker. In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", becoming the second superhero film after 1978's Superman to earn the honor.\n\nWhen the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice.\n\nChristian Bale portrays Bruce Wayne and Batman, doing both the physical part as Batman and the dramatic part of Bruce Wayne, giving each his all and ultimately giving us one of the best live action portrayals of the Dark Knight. There is so many things Bale does right and I love his take on the iconic Caped Crusader, but there are people who have some criticism towards him and that's completely fine. Though he wasn't perfect in Batman Begins, Bale have truly grown into the role and with his method acting he doesn't let the audience or himself down, Bale's take on the character is perfect for Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy. Heath Ledger plays The Joker and he took Method Acting to the extreme, earning himself many awards along with an oscar. The great and memorable performances doesn't stop with Bale and Ledger, they're joined by talented actors like: Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Along with a supporting cast. They capture the comic book versions of the characters and successfully brings quality and fantastic performance to the film, many are extremely memorable like Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart, they're simply award worthy. Michael Caine deserves a lot of praise for his role as Alfred, his portrayal is my favorite of all live action portrayals.\n\n\"You Either Die A Hero Or Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain.\" that's a quote anyone will recognize, the writing is spectacular. From the characters, to dialogue, to world building. The screenplay are simply impressive and fantastic in so many ways. The screenplay is written by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan, but the story was co-written by David S. Goyer. I just can't praise the writers enough. There's various of themes in the film, most are mature and I'll just say it now, it's a dark movie but done perfectly. Some themes are: The Triumph of Evil Over Good, Justice versus Corruption, The Thin Line Between Anarchy and Order and The Terrible Logic of Human Nature. Honestly, the film could easily be looked at as a black and white story with Batman being the good and Joker the bad, but Christopher Nolan takes the story in a grey area that makes you question things, especially those themes I just wrote down, and he succeeds perfectly.\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight is full of beautifully crafted and just terrific set pieces, done by how they kept everything grounded with practical effects instead of relying on CGI. Some sequences that just show how great looking film it is, for an example the Bank Heist which was shot entirely in IMAX and it looks fantastic from start to finish with its musical score and incredible direction and cinematography, other sequences worth mentioning are the action sequence when Nolan literally flipped a truck over. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stop there, but there's so many brilliant and memorable action sequences in this film, what Nolan succeeded in doing is to keep the tension and suspension going and the tempo never slows down. Wally Pfister and Christopher Nolan is to thank for the stunning set pieces, the cinematographer and director. Wally Pfister actually got nominated for an Oscar for his work in this film, an award he was worthy of winning. With The Dark Knight Trilogy, things were to be as grounded and realistic as possible which I thank Christopher Nolan for. It shows in the visual effects, the sets and especially the sound editing. Overall an incredible experience from start to finish with every scene thought out 100%, with foreshadowing and symbolism. The Dark Knight does it extremely well.\n\nExperiencing this trilogy for the first time in 4K, starting with Batman Begins and now The Dark Knight. I just have to say it's brilliant and the right way to watch the film. The HDR is perfect and truly captures the cinematic picture Nolan wanted for these releases, making it the closest to a theatrical viewing. The soundtrack is superb, the music and everything are truly phenomenal. Hans Zimmer worked with James Newton Howard in creating the unique and powerful musical score, a truly mesmerizing one. It's still a mind blowing experience to watch after all these times, and a film I'll continue to rewatch. If not for the beautiful cinematography and direction, it's the acting and characterization, but also its action sequences and top notch visual effects. There's so much to enjoy in this film, from the heroes to its villains and everything in between, The Dark Knight is what The Return of the King is to Lord of the Rings, a masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "I sat down with this movie after knowing that most people loved and seemed to venerate it. But I have a lot of perspective. I was reading Batman comics back in 1957, and I have seen all of the greatest movies ever made. This just isn't one of them. I did not care about anyone. The action was remorseless and unnecessary, one could even say gratuitous. I even turned it off by the 2-hour mark because it got so maudlin and disjointed. I did read something about people voting this into fifth position of the greatest 250 movies ever made, and clearly this shows the weight of current voters who have little experience with good movies. Why, they should be asked, does Citizen Kane, a 1941 movie always rank as the best movie ever? Because it had story, wonderful acting, human nature, and on and on, all things missing from Dark Knight.\n\nMovies today are thrown together with lots of action, preposterous stories, and computer effects. Characters survive falls and bangs that would put anyone, including a linebacker for the NFL, in hospital for a week or more. As with another reviewer, I am now finding it hard to remember to much about this movie, but I can remember every scene in a great movie, like The Maltese Falcon, etc."

Released in 2008, it stands as one of the most iconic and influential superhero movies to date. Here's a review of this remarkable film.\n\nChristopher Nolan's direction is impeccable. He crafts a dark and gritty atmosphere that befits Gotham's grim world. The film's cinematography, with its sweeping shots of the city, captures the essence of a modern noir thriller. The action sequences are intense, and the practical effects add a visceral quality to the film.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" is not just a superhero movie; it's a deep exploration of complex themes. It raises questions about morality, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices made for the greater good. The film challenges viewers to ponder the fine line between hero and antihero."

Heath ledgers role in this movie is excellent. He played the joker perfectly. The movie ends very well. It's a lengthy movie but it doesn't seem very long because it keeps you interested. I believe this movie should be ranked higher in the top 250 honestly. At least number 2. This movie doesn't overload you on any one element. There's a perfect amount of action, drama, suspense, and some comical aspects in there too. Nolan did an excellent job on this movie and the whole trilogy actually. This isn't one of those movies where you can predict the ending or how things will play out, this is the joker. The joker being in this one just throws you all over the place without making it confusing, surprising would be a good word for it. There is so many plot twists. All in all. Watch this movie if you haven't already. It's awesome!!!"

Pure action, spectacle, special effects, narration, practically a perfect film, a milestone to be left for future memory. No Batman will ever be the same again and no Batman will ever be like this.

At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.\n\nBut it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking \"but that wouldn't happen\".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.\n\nThe story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....\n\nI soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.\n\nHard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.\n\nNow for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website.\n\nWould I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum."

Though it does have some strong movie elements such as good special effects, high drama and a haunting music score, this film is too dark even for Batman. The plot drags, action and violence are overkill and some of the cast performances were weak.\n\nAs a fan of the comics, I was hoping that this trilogy would follow the comic continuity more than the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher series. But, it wasn't meant to be.\n\nWe have a story about Batman trying to rid the city of the remaining mobs, but ended up facing a new villain, the Joker. Later on in the story, crime-fighting Harvey Dent flips a nerve and turn into Two-Face. While pretty good acting, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was too manic and sadistic. I didn't care for the make-up and costume as well. Aaron Eckhart's performance of Harvey Dent/Two-Face drove me off the wall - bland as Harvey Dent and much too angry as Two-Face.\n\nI know Director Nolan wanted to avoid camp at all cost after what we've went through with Schumacher's films, but the story is too serious and dark. I would highly recommend \"Batman Begins\" or \"The Dark Knight Rises\" over this. While also dark, those two films had much better character development, compelling plots and a better balance of humor.\n\nGrade D+"

The film was fantastic along with the film techniques shown (especially the interrogation scene). The film itself is an is an extraordinary experience. It will keep you glued to your seat as you take in what Nolan had to offer it's audience. All the actors especially Heath Ledger as the Joker are an unforgettable. I am pretty sure the rest that going to view the film or have already seen it will agree. Although not a masterpiece, it belongs to be with the best films in history. I'd be shocked if Heath is not nominated for an Oscar, or any other film related Oscars such as Sound or Cimenitography, this film is a well notable film to be considered an Epic"

        "review_title": "A Cinematic Triumph: \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) Soars to Unprecedented Heights",
        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a superhero film; it's a cinematic spectacle that redefines the genre, setting an unparalleled standard for storytelling, character development, and technical brilliance. Released in 2008, this second installment of Nolan's Batman trilogy is a brooding, intense masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of comic book adaptations.\n\nAt the core of \"The Dark Knight\" is the late Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, a performance that stands as one of the most mesmerizing in cinematic history. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, an embodiment of anarchy that leaves an indelible mark on Gotham City. His nuanced and chilling performance posthumously earned him an Academy Award, a testament to his dedication and the depth he brought to the character.\n\nChristian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, delivers a compelling performance, grappling not only with the physical challenges of crime-fighting but also with the moral complexities of being a symbol for justice. The film introduces Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gotham's charismatic district attorney, whose tragic transformation into Two-Face adds a layer of moral ambiguity that elevates the narrative.\n\nNolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a Gotham that is gritty, realistic, and morally complex. The film's practical effects, breathtaking cinematography by Wally Pfister, and Hans Zimmer's haunting score contribute to the immersive experience. The use of IMAX cameras for key sequences, including the legendary chase scene, sets \"The Dark Knight\" apart as a technical marvel.\n\nThe screenplay, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a labyrinth of moral dilemmas and psychological depth. It explores themes of chaos, morality, and the thin line between hero and villain. The Joker's philosophy challenges Batman's very existence, pushing the Caped Crusader to confront the darkness within himself.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" is not just a superhero film; it's a crime drama, a character study, and a gripping exploration of the human psyche. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Nolan's commitment to practical effects and a gripping narrative sets a benchmark that subsequent superhero films aspire to reach.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking. It transcends the superhero genre, leaving an enduring impact on both cinema and popular culture. Ledger's Joker is not just a villain; he's an enigma, a force of chaos that mirrors the complexities of the human condition. \"The Dark Knight\" is a cinematic gem that continues to resonate, proving that even in the realm of caped crusaders, artistry and depth can coexist."

        "review_title": "Who ever said becoming was better than become?",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's an unwritten rule that in superhero movies, the sequels rarely to never live up to the standards of the original--how many of us were spellbound by THE MATRIX only to be jilted by its disastrous sequels? THE DARK KNIGHT squashes any presumptions that nothing could ever surpass the original, whose wholesome darkness, originality and excitement made it possible for comic book adaptations/blockbusters to become more than the sum of its genre. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself in every way possible.\n\nBATMAN BEGINS was about Bruce Wayne's roots and his journey to becoming Batman. Very interestingly, the emotional arc of THE DARK KNIGHT is not on Batman (though Christian Bale is still solid as both charming Bruce and his darker alter ego), but rather on Harvey Dent's (an excellent Aaron Eckhart) crusade against corruption and how own eventual dark journey that, by either chance or choice, will shape him into a hero or a villain. The love story between Dent and Rachel Dawes, who cannot wait for Bruce anymore, is also what supplies THE DARK KNIGHT with its human heart, and what makes the film's dark turns all the more poignant and suspenseful.\n\nEverything about THE DARK KNIGHT is edgier, from the music (the screeching buildup is at times unbearable) to the violence (the Joker's disappearing pencil trick will shock you). A great deal of this is indebted to Heath Ledger. If Ledger hadn't died tragically young last January, the sold-out midnight/3 am/6 am showings probably wouldn't have been as momentous, but the kudos for his performance still would've been higher than the skies. To say that his performance is majestic isn't enough--it transcends Brando and Cagney and de Niro and Malcolm McDowell's astonishing performance as Alex de Large. A film critic for Entertainment Weekly once wrote about Christian Bale in RESCUE DAWN that \"I've never seen the actor look more at home with his own taut charisma.\" That praise has to be passed on to Ledger, who seems so comfortable with his madness it's truly terrifying; When I was in the crowded theater I thought, \"this must've been what it was like back in 1955, when REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE came out, just after James Dean died.\" Ledger will become a cult figure, there is no doubt. This will be his biggest hit, it is inevitable. But once you surrender yourself to his exquisite madness, you're able to forget the fact that Ledger is gone and that the ghost on-screen is the last of what will remain.\n\nThe only quibble I have about THE DARK KNIGHT is the recasting of the Rachel Dawes character. Katie Holmes got a lot of unfair publicity during BATMAN BEGINS because of the media firestorm around her relationship with Tom Cruise. She even got a Razzie nomination. She is not this generation's answer to Bette Davis, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is actually the better actress of the two. But having already set up this character who is very crucial to Bruce's life, it's awkward to have another actress cast in that role. It's like trying to imagine anyone else but Ingrid Bergman falling in love with Humphrey Bogart during the Paris flashbacks of CASABLANCA. However, the role, already small and somewhat insubstantial, is a more diminished in this film than its predecessor, and it's only a minor annoyance to a practically perfect movie.\n\nThis is the film we've all been waiting for, and it's the film we deserve. I hope you all take in the unforgettably exciting atmosphere of the crowded theater, and remember the greatness of Heath Ledger that is lost, but with this film, it'll never be forgotten."

Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolan's dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome. Time to make \"Batman Ends.\""

This is not an ordinary movie which is made from computer graphics footage but believe me the stunts are for real and performed under strict guidance and a lot of practice and a lot of hard work . Talking about the story , you could sense minute details of human emotions and it feels so refreshing that you would definitely be not forgetting at all .It seems pretty rare for some blockbuster movie to offer that thing. 10 on 10 from me!! worth more than 100 time watch!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This Joker will put a smile on your face!\n\nBatman History: Gone are the days when Adam West's campy Batman T.V series used to be the only source of \"Bat Entertainment\" for the audience. The Batman movies of the 90s did not do justice to the great comic book icon. They all made the caped crusader appear as a happy-go-lucky masked vigilante who saved the day at the end with his \"Bat Gadgets\". Where was the character development? A real plot? (Oh please, not the penguin-stole-candy-from-a-baby plot). The superficial storyline and lack of commitment catalysed the fiasco of the Batman franchise. All in all, much to the dismay of fans, a costly costume party was all that we ever saw!\n\nA Knight was born: 'Batman Begins\" at last delved into the dark and troubled past of Bruce Wayne. A man trying to find his identity, conquer his worst fears and overcome the grief of the unjust murder of his parents. A man who becomes invincible as a symbol. The magic of this movie lies in the fact that although it is not real, it makes you want to believe that it is!\n\nThe Dark Knight: The success of Batman Begins opened the flood gates of great expectations and surreal anticipation for perhaps one of the most awaited movie sequels, let alone a Batman sequel. With expectations and speculations running wild, the overzealous promotion and media hype knew no bounds. The Dark Knight was put under microscope long before its scheduled release. The tragic loss of Heath Hedger, especially after whispers of his alleged over-the-top performance, added fuel to the fire. With fans and critics eagerly waiting to sing praise or eviscerate the movie alike, Dark Knight made a smashing entry! The question is, did this movie deliver? Did it live up to the unrealistic expectations of the fans? No. It surpassed it! This movie is not just for fans of Batman, but for all those who love to see a masterpiece. It certainly stretched the limitations of a typical comic book movie. The Joker is not just the avergae psychotic villain who blows things up and deliver jabs and witty retorts. No no no no no! He is more than that. A lot more than that. His every word has a deep psychological connotation to it. He poses moral dilemmas that play with the boundaries of normal ethical conduct and human psyche. Simply put, he puts people under the microscope and test their reaction under extreme situations. And he does it with flair! That's the beauty of it. He creates ingenious situations and traps that tricks everybody into believing something, while something else is happening. Bruce Wayne is pushed to such extremes that he thinks that his days as the caped crusader are coming to an end... As Rachel puts it, \"Bruce don't make me your only hope for a normal life\". We also find that The Joker and Batman have a lot in common. Joker pretty much sums up the entire comic book history between him and Batman as \"You and I are destined to do this forever\"... Although they are portrayed as freaks with troubed childhood, it all comes down to the choices that people make at testing times. Harvey and Bruce are both influenced by The Joker's brilliant yet fiendish schemes and the outcome is colossal... You've gotta see it for yourself! This so much more than an action movie. A psychological thriller? Perhaps. The way Joker manipulates human nature is simply \"mind blowing\". Believe me, he is more than what you expect him to be in every single moment of the movie. His influence on Harvey Dent is even more intriguing than it is on the rest. And the fact that special effects are less prominent compared to character development and storyline goes to show that drama and theatrics impacts people on a personal level that all the CGI in the world cannot conjure up. It simply makes you care for the character rather than being a mute spectator of a violent showdown. This movie revolves around deep forgotten fears, traumas, hope, faith and courage. This is poetry in movie making!\n\nRating: 10/10 No questions asked!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me preface this comment by saying I'm not a huge fan of comic books or comic book movies by default, but I do enjoy the genre if it's done well. I really enjoyed Batman Begins, and the Frank Miller take on Batman in the Dark Knight Returns. As much as I liked them however, they felt like a \"comic-book\". Not to deride the genre, but if you read a lot of comic books you probably know what I mean when I say this. There's a certain level of cheese and immaturity associated with any character that straps on tights and an animal-themed costume to battle crime.\n\nHowever, the question that kept going through my mind when watching the Dark Knight was \"Is this really a comic-book movie?\" And I think that's no accident. Chris Nolan is certainly a master of his art and every choice that was made in this movie seemed to spring out of this idea. The sepia tone is out, replaced with a more ultra-realist look: when it's night, it's dark and when it's day it's light. The characters are somewhat over-the-top but ultimately believable: the word superhero and supervillain is never used in the movie, and even their comic-book names seem to be rarely (if ever) uttered. And the action is cool, but hardly over-the-top. The only thing that's really \"comic-book\" about the movie is Batman's costume, which is made about as practical as possible while still staying true to the character. It's all tied together with a rock-solid script that asks tough, thought-provoking questions, yet never gives way to a dull moment (in fact, it was so intense I think it gave me heart palpitations).\n\nCertainly a risky move to pull in a film that's appealing to an audience that is generally looked down upon by the mass media. But I think Nolan (and his brother) give their audience much more credit than the typical movie maker and it pays off--well, it did for me.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is this movie is good. It's so good you may, like me, find yourself questioning your definition of \"comic-book\" movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to see this movie with fairly high hopes that it was going to be a pearler. All the trailers looked good, the press were raving about Heath's portrayal of the Joker, and most of all it was a Batman movie. A character i had grown up with watching on TV. While this movie, like the previous title Batman Begins takes a big leap away from what everyone except the Batman comic book lovers have seen. It lands solidly on a firm ground made up of fans who are going to find this movie an absolute joy.\n\nChristian Bale is back as the Batman and he works just as hard as he did in the last movie to bring that character to life. He plays Bruce Wayne down to a tea and his aggressiveness and ability to fight Shine through the big black suit. His voice, while some call it too strained and annoying as Batman I find fitted the role well. This is not the Batman we are used to seeing. But I hope to see a lot more of it.\n\nHeath's acting in this movie is unlike anything i have ever seen before. Both he and Director Christopher Nolan have done an amazing job with the character. Never has a character made me feel afraid, horrified, confused then had me laughing in hysterics all in the space of 10 seconds. At times he truly is a horrifying figure to watch, then he switches to to a lunatic you cant help but laugh at. They have managed to truly capture what the Joker really is in this movie. A dangerously insane human being.\n\nAaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/2 face. His performance was also excellent. You could sense the frustration within Harvey's character in his fight to clean Gotham City of the mob families and the Joker. Yet there was such a change in character once the transition from one to the other took place. And he did it superbly. I look forward to seeing this character develop.\n\nOther notable performances were Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Eric Roberts as Salvatore Maroni and a small role by William Fichtner as the bank manager (But I'm just a fan of whatever he does :) ) Overall the film is a monster coming in at a runtime of 2 hours 32 minutes. But in no way do you feel it. The movie manages to stay fresh and vibrant throughout. The action comes at you fast and intense and there is plenty of it. All in all this film will surpass any hype you have seen or heard about it. Its worthy of any awards it or its actors are nominated for."

Relentlessly dark, brooding, tangled, mythic, disturbing, none of that alternating, and then some. Long, too. It is neither uplifting nor a place to park the kids.\n\nI devoured my share of comic books when much younger, and felt obliged but not compelled to sample their motion picture adaptations. In particular, no fan of the Batman series am I. Tim Burton aimed for weird and hit the target. Joel Schumacher aimed for Ken Russell and missed oh so wide. Christopher Nolan and company got the keys to the franchise and did something certifiably different. Hat's off for that.\n\nIn sum...\n\nAbout a half-hour too long, and that final half-hour was action-packed befuddlement capped by not one but two unnecessary speeches that were effectively blotted out by that packed action.\n\nHeath Ledger's performance will echo in your mind for some time to come. It had to have echoed in his own. Grant the man rest.\n\nSo will, or should, the performances of everyone else, most notably Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman for their respectively surprising turns of character.\n\nWith age Eric Roberts looks like Willem Dafoe, and Nestor Carbonell looks unnervingly like Peter Mark Richman.\n\nI believe we're close to breaking the sound barrier of digital FX, where you don't appreciate them 'til they're hurled at you and can't appreciate them when you do.\n\nI've heard my share of edited gunshots and explosions for the year and quite possibly the next two or three. But at least the violence wasn't stylized. If I wanted that I'd rent A Clockwork Orange.\n\nWhat awards this film will win will be well and truly earned. All the same I can't guess where the franchise will go next. I sincerely hope it's left where it is, with the goal of applying the same considerable attention and resources to finding, learning, articulating and displaying something novel. The participants in this film are surely capable of all of that..."
