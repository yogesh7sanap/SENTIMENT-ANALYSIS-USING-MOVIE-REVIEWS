There is also a bunch of frat guys led from the neighboring college.\n\nI love the friendship between the guys. Losing Rob Schneider actually improves the relationships. I love the wives especially Salma Hayek. I even love the kids. However this movie is flooded with stupidity. Sometimes the stupidity can be funny, but most of it is just really really really stupid. I can understand the haters. I agree with a lot of the criticisms. I just like everybody's happy relationships just enough to barely recommend this movie."

        "review_title": "A lumbering, distasteful comedy that has a lower impression of you than you have of it",
        "review_detailed_main": "There I sat, in stone-cold silence, not completely watching, but observing Grown Ups 2, one of the most desperate comedies of the year. Smiling maybe twice, groaning several times, rolling my eyes several more, and eventually closing them for a few seconds trying to imagine what a movie like this could've been if the quality of the talent matched the quality of the three screenwriters behind this project.\n\nThe first Grown Ups film wasn't great - or even good - by any means, but had the vibe of a cheery, stupid ABC Family movie. The strongest complaint I had about the original film carries over to this one immensely which is that given the immense amount of talent in this film, from the three title characters alone, this should be a much better, much funnier movie. Adam Sandler can be funny when he is given timing and a decent character, Kevin James can always be sweet, simple, and relatable, Chris Rock is one of the funniest comedians working today, and David Spade almost always knocks one out of the park in Rules of Engagement. It's dumbfounding to note that Taylor Lautner has the biggest laughs in the film, and after watching this, I have faith that after the redundant Twilight franchise he'll find work in some solid buddy comedies. However, the first inkling that Grown Ups 2 is terrible is by the sole fact that Rob Schneider himself decided other matters were worth is time than making a film that was almost guaranteed to be a hit.\n\nThe entire event is a plot less picture (not the good kind) that provides its audience with a pathetic array of scenes that seem more like throwaway skits from Saturday Night Live. It's a massively redundant, laundry-list of senseless setups with unfunny payoffs that usually involve something along the lines of bathroom humor, objectification, homophobia, and obnoxious behavior. In other words, it's another Sandler movie. It takes place entirely on the last day of school and revolves around the gang of Lenny (Adam Sandler), Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock), and Marcus (David Spade) returns, this time welcoming a more quiet, suburban lifestyle contrary to that of Lenny's in Hollywood, and the ridiculous series of sitcom antics that unfold overtime.\n\nThe plot stops there. What follows is, as stated, a series of cheaply-staged, poorly-performed, witless gags that do nothing but make one check the time. Among the barrage of questions I had while watching this film, one of which was, \"who is the target audience here?\" My mind resorted immediately to tweens and adolescents, who spend too much time giggling at bathroom humor as is. But then, as the film progressed, it began to redirect its senses to a more sentimental side, which only shows the immense tonal strain the film has which is \"create cinematic anarchy for forty minutes before showing that this is a story about being true to ones roots and taking care of the family.\" The sentimentalism is then mixed with a strangely out of place eighties party that concludes the picture, which will definitely not be appreciated to the fullest extent by the previously mentioned tweens and adolescences, as many of the jokes and period references will fly straight over their head.\n\nThe problem with the film is that it seems so effortless and so poorly conducted. At least with various Sandler films like Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and even the unexpectedly raunchy That's My Boy, I could sense that it was made for somebody, be it adolescents or a bit older of a crowd and stuck with that persona. Grown Ups 2 is a film made with no agenda, no personality, and no spirit. It even resorts to the tireless Sandler clich\u00e9 of having all the male characters being a cornucopia of stupidity and the female characters being nothing but eye-candy for the men. There are certain things I expect Sandler to be over now, what with approaching fifty in a few years.\n\nYou have a choice as a moviegoer this weekend and the several other weekends Grown Ups 2 is going to play. You can either a see a film that possesses gags as commonplace and predictable as a Fruity Pebbles commercial or use this time as an opportunity to seek out nearby independent features in theaters, at your local video store, or even on Netflix. Say you refute that suggestion and want to see Grown Ups 2 as a pleasant, feel-good movie. I know plenty of independent movies that are pleasant, feel good movies (Frances Ha is one of them and is still playing in many theaters nationwide). Wouldn't you at least want to give money to people who don't believe that you're sitting in the audience because you possess the attention-span of a newborn? Starring: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello, Nick Swardson, Shaquille O'Neal, Peter Dante, and Allen Covert. Directed by: Dennis Dugan."

Cameos where fine and were laughable, jokes were also fine, ( Shaq joke always works), I wish Steve Buscemi had more time on screen though.\n\nSo I know this is not a thriller with sophisticated plot and mind bending twists and you know what is coming next ( even to next word or so ), but as simple comedy this just worked for me.\n\nI am giving it 7 out of 10 and again I know maybe it is to high rating for such film, but it worked for me and that is what matters."

I contemplated leaving after the first 15 minutes! I forced myself to stay just to see if this mess would get any better. It didn't. The jokes concern nude men, homosexual men, brainless women, sex, bodily functions (over and over again!), and more of the same, repeatedly. No story, no acting, no thought, no point. I was the first one out of the theater and never looked back.\n\nWhat a total waste of time."

From start to finish funny moment after funny moment with the kids coming into their own especially the baby Chris Rock. This movie is set a few years after the first and all the characters have excuse the pun 'Grown Up'. Some great additions to this cast were Steve Austin and Shaq O' Neill. A really enjoyable movie going experience. I think there will be a fair few that didn't like the movie because it was stupid in parts but guess what people it is a comedy there suppose to be silly and stupid. 7/10"

Do not watch this waste of time. I remember watching Kevin James on the king of queens and that is a really funny show, I really don't know why he is also constantly in movies that aren't funny. I guess its a way to make a quick buck in the industry, stick to real comedies, like This Is The End.

        "review_detailed_main": "The good part of watching Adam Sandler's films are that they are hilarious, funny and entertaining. The bad part is that some of his films goes over the top and becomes nonsense. Grown up 2 belongs to both category.\n\nLenny moves back to hometown surrounded by childhood buddies Eric , Kurt and Marcus. However, he faces the challenge from old bullies along with new bullies in form of college kids.\n\nThe hit-pair of Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler is back with no plot, senseless yet entertaining flick which will keep you at bay. There is no such thing as direction , screenplay or subtleness. The movie has few comic scenes in which you will laugh your way out but is strictly OK. The editing is loose. Art direction is nice. Cinematography is average. Background score is decent. It is Adam Sandler , Kevin James and Chris Rock all the way. They make sure the film is watchable at least once.\n\nOverall, do not expect much from the film and you will thoroughly enjoy it at least for once. Decent 2.5/5"

Honestly this movie has a bunch of 30-40 year old acting like a bunch of children, the humor is just really dry and awful and quite frankly makes the actors look stupid and to top it all off...WHAT A STUPID STORY LINE!!!.\n\nPoor directing, great actors and actresses that humiliated themselves in this movie, bad story line. Grown Ups 1 was decent but this was just a waste of time. Not worth watching in theaters and not worth buying, hell maybe its not even worth renting and god its probably not even worth pirating it!\n\nDon't waste and Hour and a Half of your life watching this garbage. Adam Sandler love you mate but honestly what happened."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really liked the first GROWN UPS since it was funny, with good performances by a cast that surely looked like it had a lot of fun and with clean humour. However I was afraid to see the sequel as here on IMDB it has lots of negative reviews with abysmal scores of 1s and 2s. When I saw it I proved myself wrong as, yes it wasn't great like the predecessor but still funny in its own way.\n\n3 years after the events of the first film Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler) has moved with his family in the hometown of Stanton in Connecticut. One morning he finds a deer inside his home and after finally letting it out, we gradually see his friends' lives with their families. When they meet, they'll leave their kids in summer camps and make the group again. What follows is just a series of shenanigans (and some very hilarious too) and some jokes that instead fell flat.\n\nWhile it certainly wasn't great as GROWN UPS, I laughed a lot in a few moments, the most memorable when David Spade goes across the entire town riding inside a tire and destroying some things here and there. The cast is great just like in the first one and it's even fuller of famous faces (including even Jon Lovitz and Shaquille O'Neal who simply have lots of fun) and with lots of great songs of the 80s during the party at the end.\n\nWhile it may not appeal to everyone, if you are in the right mindset you might like it just like it happened to me."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was on school camp when this movie was in cinemas and when the teacher announced that we would be going to the movies, I got excited because Gravity was in cinemas at the same time, but i'll get to that later. I was praying that we wouldn't see this atrocity, but what do you know. We did. The only redeeming quality about it was that me and my friend picked it apart and had a lot of fun doing so. Other than that, where do I begin? From the beginning seems like a good place...\n\nI will analyze the first scene to give you an idea of how idiotic this movie is. Adam Sandler wakes up to find a deer in his room. He does an Adam Sandler scream as the deer gets on its hind legs and urinates in his mouth. Then the deer runs out into the kitchen and Sandlers' family attempt to catch it in one of the worst scenes in cinema his-tor-y. To begin with, the scene makes no coherent sense what so ever. The deer is constructed of CGI technology so bad, it makes the special effects in Godzilla (1998) look like Avatar. The scene may have been comical if the deer was convincing enough. If they couldn't make a good looking CGI animal then they should have scraped the idea completely.\n\nDennis Dugan thinks people are stupid. A lot of people under 14 I know loved this film, as the humor appeals to them in many ways. but what I don't understand is how they can love a film as stupid as this, and hate a movie like Gravity. Firstly, I think it has a lot to do with maturity, as Gravity deals with themes not approached at face value, that children will not understand. Secondly, Grown Ups 2 is playing it safe. Dennis Dugan knows what people expect, and plays upon the statistics to make the money he needs. But what he does not seem to realize is that people only go to his movies at the cinema because they want quick, mindless entertainment. His movies do not have replay value. Films such as Gravity do, as they have many themes and messages to ponder long after the film is finished. It urges people to watch it again and purchase it to own in their homes, and watch at will. Gravity is not made using conventional or normal methods of film making, which a lot people do not like or appreciate the first time they see it. But after a few years many films that are different become classics and inspire new and innovative ways for films to be made.\n\nI will not go into detail of the silliness of what is laughably called the \"plot\" of this film, for I know many people will not want it spoiled. But I must urge people to avoid this film, even if they enjoyed the original Grown Ups. I must also suggest that people begin to expand their acceptance of films different to most."

Expect it to win the raspberry awards this year! The humour was infantile. The storyline lacked any form of credibility . I guess these just took the money - disappointing especially as I rate Steve Buscemi who has been undone excellent films and productions."

There are unpleasant characters, there are nice ones and there are extreme ones. Without detracting from the stars, the one who looks best in the film is Taylor Lautner who offers a fantastic character allowing his idiotic bully to be absolutely great. Of the rest there are good and bad moments. It is a film that is not extraordinary but can be seen more than once."

So no, Grown Ups 2 isn't by any stretch a great movie comedy but it's still pretty entertaining and despite some risqu\u00e9 humor, there's still some touching lessons about how important family is that shouldn't be too embarrassing to anyone taking their kids to this. So on that note, this is worth a look if you like this sort of thing. By the way, as with before with the predecessor, I'm once again going to review some other movies or TV specials with previous \"SNL\" cast members in the next several days in chronological order.

Honestly when I originally heard that Rob Schneider was unable to be in this because of another commitment I thought \"what the hell else does he have going on\" but he is the lucky one, because this is the kind of movie that could (and should) kill careers. While I am sure the Sandler fans will spend their hard earned money on this monstrosity I hope that the powers that be take a good hard look at this and learn what is wrong with Hollywood. I cannot explain enough how much this movie sucked. Some cheap laughs, sure, but overall a complete and utter failure. A shame really because Rock, James and even Spade did their best - but overall this felt like Sandler being Sandler all over again and those guys just stuck due to contractual obligations."

But no, with Grown Ups 2, it was just craft laziness - stick someone in front of the camera, make them say something to another character, make a fart joke, on to the next bit. Story lines start, then stop in virtually the same scene.\n\nIt goes on like that for 90 minutes."

His life continues with his best friends closer than ever before and the occurrence of plenty of unexpected events.\n\nSince I had already watched the first movie I knew what I was about to watch and what to expect from its sequel, and I was fully satisfied by it. It contained plenty of hilarious scenes that made me laugh and I found very interesting the fact that the sequel of \"Grown Ups\" was equally good with the first one. For one more time the interpretations of Adam Sandler who played as Lenny Feder, David Spade who played as Marcus Higgins, Chris Rock who played as Kurt McKenzie and Kevin James who played as Eric Lamonsoff were very good and they made the difference. To sum up, I have to say that \"Grown Ups 2\" is a nice comedy movie and I recommend you to watch it but first watch the first movie if you have not already."

        "review_detailed_main": "I seem to be one of the few people who actually enjoyed the first Grown Ups film. It seems to be one of those films that is universally hated by both the critics and the IMDb community. Likewise, many people generally despise this sequel and I can only assume that people didn't like it because it's very thin in terms of plot and because it's pretty crude.\n\nOK, the first issue I do agree with; this film didn't really have a plot or a story and yes it probably was just made to cash in on the success of the first film. Whether you liked the first film or not, it did have a clearly structured plot and yes it was funnier than this sequel. Does that make this sequel a bad film? Absolutely not...\n\nI've always felt that comedies can get away with having thin plots as long as there is one crucial ingredient; humour. Yes this film is crude, but so was the first one. At the end of the day, if you hated the first film and thought it was crude then why would you watch the sequel? It's a dumb film, yes it's not particularly imaginative and yes it is the sort of film you'll forget about 5 minutes after watching it, but during those 90 minutes I was laughing so much that I almost didn't care that there was no story.\n\nI think that in order to enjoy this sequel, I think you will not only need to have enjoyed the first film, but I also think that you need to be able to relate to the characters. In some ways, both films have some focus on our 40 somethings trying to recapture their lost youth. I myself am not quite as old as our rather childish foursome, but I am at an age where I'm no longer a teenager and can sort of understand the fact that some adults don't like being Grown Ups. I suspect that this will be something that teenagers won't be able to identify with quite as well as they will be 'currently' living their youth.\n\nHad this film been completely full of vulgarity and had ALL the gags been vulgar then I probably would have rated it lower, but there are plenty of non vulgar gags in this film that many people may have missed. I understand that the vulgarity won't be for everyone, but at the end of the day I don't mind vulgar jokes as long as they're funny and many of the jokes do work in Grown Ups 2.\n\nIn some ways, I can understand why people were disappointed with this sequel. It doesn't have much of a story and it is quite a lazy sequel - it's disappointing that they've had 3 years to come up with a sequel that has no story. That being said, it is almost as funny as the first film so as long as you just go with the flow and take it for what it is then it is a very funny follow up. I would have given this film a 7 out of 10, but I've knocked it down to a 6 because of its rather thin plot."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first 'Grown Ups' film was a rather mediocre at best film, gave it a maybe generous 4/10. It had a few decent things, that sadly were outweighed by the many moments that were lazy and unfunny.\n\nIts sequel however is simply ghastly, personally am honestly struggling to find anything good about it. Not many sequels are as good as the original, although there are exceptions like 'Godfather Part 2', 'Aliens', 'Empire Strikes Back' and 'Terminator 2' that come very close to being even better (actually 'Empire Strikes Back' is the best of the entire 'Star Wars' saga). But 'Grown Ups 2' which looks like no effort was put into it is down there with the worst sequels in existence (not as bad as 'Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2', 'Home Alone 4' and 'Neverending Story 3', but close).\n\nCredit is due, as far as Adam Sandler films go it is not as bad as 'Jack and Jill', one of those cases where almost anything is better than it. It is however down there with Sandler's all-time worst. For the record not everything that Sandler has done is bad, some of his 90s and early 2000s comedies are good, the 'Hotel Transylvania' films while with their issues were surprisingly good and he proved with 'Punch Drunk Love' and 'Reign Over Me' that he is capable of giving a good performance with great material which those two films have, but he has done too many misfires. Some have questioned, why watch it in the first place if you didn't like the first film and don't always like Sandler(an attitude that actually really annoys me)? The answer is easy. Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock and David Spade have proved when they have strong material that they can be good, funny and likable actors.\n\nAnyway, talking about 'Grown Ups 2' as a film, the film looks cheap with direct-to-video production values. Scenery's alright and some of the costumes are nice in the party scene, but wasted by flat garish photography, lack of continuity and less than smooth editing. The music is at best forgettable, very generic and not very dynamic with what's going on. Dennis Dugan's direction is not very noticeable, fails to make the story cohesive and seems to rush through everything.\n\nThat 'Grown Ups 2' is not funny, completely laughter-free in fact, is a huge part of the problem. The dialogue is childish, embarrassingly juvenile and crass while the gags and set pieces are incredibly tasteless and lumbering, most of the film saw this reviewer cringing through the childish slapstick and excessive bathroom humour. You know there's something wrong when the most memorable cameo is Taylor Lautner, and despite being the one actor to be enjoying himself the scene is one of the biggest examples of bad taste.\n\nLack of story is also a major problem, almost non-existent in fact and just an excuse to string along incoherently the film's gags and the four leads to indulge in their antics with ill-at ease chemistry. The only real glimpse of one is with David Spade, and the film doesn't really delve into it properly. The first 'Grown Ups' story was not much special, but there was more of a resemblance of one. The characters are both annoying and bland, the men are too immature to be taken seriously or care for and the female leads are eye candy and little else. Acting doesn't help either.\n\nSandler gives one of his laziest, phoned-in and irritating performances, James is at his most embarrassingly juvenile and annoying, Rock looks embarrassed and ill at ease and Spade is very little better. Apart from Lautner, none of the supporting characters or cameos shine, disadvantaged by worthless material.\n\nOverall, a complete mess of a film and one of Sandler's worst of a hit-and-miss career. Also one of the worst films personally seen all year (along with 'Norm of the North' all year in fact, know it's a 2013 release but didn't see it until this year). 1/10 Bethany Cox"

I enjoyed every second of it, oh come on if you need cgi then go to fast 6 and if you need a moving story the buy a ticket for some romantic flick but with Adam Sandler on board and all the funny actors in here it is totally worthless to focus on a story, it is enjoyable the way it is and I can 100% assure you that you will laugh hard, really hard.\n\nIf you are looking for a movie that delivers infinite laughs and has a great cast then grown ups 2 is the way to go.

It seriously felt like they let a fifth grader write any joke they wanted and then put it in the script. I really hope that Adam Sandler actually tries in his next film and makes one that is worth my time like Happy Gilmore. Sadly, I expect to see more movies like Jack and Jill and Grown Ups in the upcoming future."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must admit; the first Grown Ups movie did provide some humour and I overall enjoyed it, but when I saw the trailer of Grown Ups 2 I was greatly disappointed. I already knew that film did not look good enough to watch and I already planned not to watch it, but today my sister convinced my family (and me) to give it a try. I agreed because she did have positive things to say about it so I was ALMOST convinced that the movie wouldn't be as bad as it seemed, but was quickly reassured that I was right about it in the first place.\n\nI missed a bit of the first part because I was making tea, though I still heard what was going on in the movie. From what I heard, I was confused as to what the storyline in the movie was, but as I took a seat in front of the television I slowly realized that the plot was nonexistent. So how about the jokes you ask? Well, there were not many laughs in the family room. My father nodded in shame through the duration of the film and I my jaw dropped many times as I was surprised at the stupidity and nonsense happening. Lots of gross humour, as well as racist, sexist, and nonsensical humour. How about the acting and characters? I must admit I appreciated that characters/actors from the previous film were reintroduced, but the acting.... eh. Nothing special in all honesty. Some characters were straight up annoying (the character Kiki and David Spade's son in the film), while others were unneeded (the dance teacher).\n\nLuckily, the horror that is this movie did not last too long. My dad left the room because he could not bear the film anymore and so we decided to complain to our service provider that we were unsatisfied with the movie. Thankfully, we are going to get a refund, but we will never get the time that we spent back again.\n\nTo conclude: I gave this film a 2 out of 10. I would have given it 1 star, but I was generous and gave 2 stars because the first movie was not so bad. I would not recommend that you try this film unless you have seen the trailer and actually thought it seemed enjoyable. This movie has no plot, mediocre acting, and lame jokes. Thank god we were granted a refund."

The first movie was funny and did have a legitimate plot running through it and with this cast it made it hilarious and I really enjoyed it. I was looking forward to watching this but was a little leery. My worst suspicions came true. This is in no way terrible and it is worth watching but while the first one seemed like a movie this one was more...lets all hang out together and make a movie. There were some funny parts but it was more or less a series of SNL skits strung together. One scene had very little to do with the next one.

Everything was predictable, cheesy and and totally unrealistic.

        "review_detailed_main": "When Grown Ups 2 came out, it was instantly reviled just like Adam Sandler's other films. But like his most other films, I thought this film was actually pretty funny, though a little on the juvenile side. Admittedly, the first film had more of a plot and was just a tiny fraction better, but I couldn't deny the charm of this film and plus this film had a horde of excellent cameos. The film also shows that movies are subjective and despite everyone having their own taste, I found this film to be worth watching.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like it that we really had no plot to work with. All I knew is that after Lenny and the gang moved back to their hometown, they just want to have a good time. Or so as the movie says.\n\nThis film is filled with respectable, charming actors. Adam Sandler was his usual corny self as Lenny and Salma Hayek does a great job as his sexy wife. Then we have the likes of David Spade, Kevin James, and Chris Rock back in their respective roles. I also liked Steve Buscemi's role as the crazy driving instructor.\n\nOverall, I liked this movie and found it to be pretty funny and sweet. I laughed a lot so that is all what matters. Though some of the humor is juvenile, it's not all that bad. I mean you would have to think a urinating deer is funny, but I did. I may get a lot of hate, But I'm not afraid to admit I like this movie. Not as good as the 2010 original, but good enough. I rate this film 8/10."

After the abominations \"Jack and Jill\" and \"That's My Boy\" Sandler almost redeemed himself with the OK \"Hotel Transylvania\", but now any good that was done there has been wiped away with this tripe. I think the main flaw in this movie is that it tries too hard to be funny, forced fun is not funny it's like being tickled by a bully for a long time, you may laugh a bit at the time but it leaves humiliated, and that's what this film is like. Also the whole movie is lazy especially the script and the plot. You know what's going to happen and hope for a twist but there is none, it's hollow. Not recommended. 1 star. (I'd give negative if I could)."

        "review_detailed_main": "I asked myself a couple of questions around 15 minutes into Grown Ups 2, Denis Duigan's Adam Sandler starring opus on life, love and the importance of family. The first question I asked myself internally was \"Why am I watching Grown Ups 2?\" the second question and much more harder to answer was \"Why am I finding this movie funny?\". It's a truly scary question that one can ask themselves when what they are admitting to is willingly laughing at a film that has been universally panned by anyone over the age of 10 and a film that on face value is nothing more an excuse for a bunch of Happy Madison alumni's getting together and getting paid to be immature. How wrong they all were.\n\nGrown Ups 2 is a touching and life affirming tale that shows us all that we need not care about working our daily jobs, just take the day off and wonder around town with your best friends and talk about high school and the good old days of partying and womanising and consequently running into Shaq. It's a realistic and brave decision by Duigan to not back away from the message and tell a tale that despite not knowing it we all needed to hear. Much can be taken away from what our hero's led by Sandler as rich family man Lenny Feder experience in their journey from overcoming past traumas by jumping naked of a cliff, fighting back urges experienced from watching attractive school dance teachers or getting your car washed at a College hand wash.\n\nThe cast are all back after their ground-breaking and industry changing work on the first film and all acquit themselves well to the material, with Sandler in particular stretching himself with his return as the rich family man, James as the mummy's boy fat man, Spade as a womanising jobless trailer trash lost cause and Rock as a loud mouth Black man who cracks hilarious jokes that are not 10 years too late. A supporting cast featuring future Oscar nominee Taylor Lautner and a not slumming it in the slightest Steve Buscemi also add great depth and heart to a script which asks the hard questions and goes for the non- signposted joke at any available chance.\n\nNow dear readers as I asked myself the hard questions upon watching this film I now ask one of you \u2013 \"Did you believe any of what you just read?\". If you answered yes then shame on you, for what Grown Ups 2 is is a film that does not in any way shape or form try and be better than it should be. Jokes and effort are always aimed at the lowest common denominator and for all seriousness no one from actors through to director cares for they know they will be making money and undoubtedly enjoying their time doing it. I truthfully did find myself against all the good in the world enjoying moments in the film upon the opening 30 minutes but all goodness was quickly drained with a movie story that has to be one of the lamest ever committed to celluloid. If you're looking to turn off your brain, your heart and all sense for the greater good Grown Ups 2 is first up on that given night but in the end is another sad and sorry step in the career of all involved and proof that Lautner could do worse than his turn as Jacob Black. Oh the humanity!\n\n1 and a half \"burp snarts\" out of 5\n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out -\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

This film does one thing right, lots of cameos, and consistent editing.\n\nTo be clear, there is no plot to speak of. There is no character development that endears any one character to you for anything but the most base reasons. This is an immoral film, that makes no attempts to conceal that. This is however also some of the most painful cinema to watch as it blurs the lines between washed up comedians who have run out of material, and the washed up middle-aged men they portray.\n\nIt's painfully obvious that the material is either blatantly lifted from other projects, or just piles of the least successful humour being inexplicably rehashed again on screen. The genuine laughs in this film are in very short supply, so if you brave the rest of the film's nonsense, there are a couple of gems in there to lift your spirits, and the occaissonal cameo to make it interesting."

From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is probably the worst of the SNL-cast sequels, with nothing to laugh at, yet heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last. Spade is a unique presence in American cinema and hopefully will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces more often in the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is quite that Adam Sandler comedies have gone down the hill recently. Not to say that all Adam Sandler films are bad, some of actually pretty decent despite what critics say. I enjoyed Grown Ups in 2010, it was very funny and entertaining to watch. Grown ups 2, however, was a bit mediocre compared to the 2010 original. While it had its laughs, everything else was pretty dumb. This film was filled with fart jokes, poop jokes, and corny sex jokes that are supposed to be funny, but only end up being absurd.\n\nWith Rob Schneider absent from this installment, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, and David Spade return as friends with new problems to deal with. The group comes in conflict against college frat kids, Lenny (Adam Sandler) reunites with a bully from high school, and Marcus (David Spade) discovers he is a father of a troublemaker teenage son (played by Alexander Ludwig). The funniest part about this film was not the four main actors, but instead the supporting cast. Taylor Lautner plays the leader of a fraternity that clashes against Sandler, Rock, James, and Spade. He managed to throw some funny dialogue in his scenes. Sandler, Rock, James, and Spade never had any funny lines to say. I was very disappointed by this. The only dialogue these actors give is ridiculous scatological humor that had me rolling my eyes. Then there is Alexander Ludwig, who some might know as Cato in The Hunger Games, playing David Spade's estranged son who acts as a rebel and has the appearance of a punk biker. I found Ludwig to be ill-suited for his character, he was never funny and didn't seem to serve a purpose as David Spade's son. This film is just amateurish when it comes to humor, it has very little laughs and fails to level up with its predecessor.\n\nTo be honest, I didn't find this film to be as bad as critics say but it was certainly wasn't anywhere near as good as the first film."

A sequel of a bad movie is invariably bad, no matter the number of stars in it, or its marketing budget. Grown Ups 2 is a real case study of the above fact. While the first movie was nothing to write home about, it still had its moments of stupid fun- a reunion of a bunch of midlife crisis facing middle aged men. This one though is just a canvas of incredibly unconnected scenes, involving Adam Sandler and his cohorts, indulging in jokes that only includes farts, crap, vomit, drool, racial slurs, and of course the staple of this breed of films- breasts. And all this under the guise of family values, parenthood and a coming of age comedy.\n\nConnect these- a peeing deer, a blood feud with a group of teenagers, a biting-dancing baby, a frat party. Tough, eh? Because there is no plot to speak of. But speaking of cohorts, Sandler has thrown the kitchen sink here- every Tom, Dick and Harry who usually appear in Happy Madison films feature here, and then some more. In addition to the original cast of Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Maya Rudolph, Salma Hayek, Maria Bello are joined this time by a surprisingly hilarious Taylor Lautner, Steve Austin, Shaquille O'Neal, Milo Ventimiglia, and rest of the Sandler family among others. In fact it is star power that kept this Titanic afloat.\n\nThat this movie made USD 240 million dollars, more than the hundred times better Pacific Rim released on the same day- is an incredible travesty of a statistic, and a testament to the stupidity of today's audience. A couple of laughs here, and a couple of laughs there, but mostly witless, unfunny, perverted and gross, it is an incredibly boorish watch for any audience.\n\n3/10 for star-power only!"

So in short, what I liked about this movie was the more family friendly jokes, some of the women's more sexual appeal (sue me, I'm a man), and a surprisingly funny role for Taylor Lautner. Other than that, this is one of the weakest Sandler movies ever, and I'm trying to stand by him, I really am, but at this point it seems like he's just not putting in the effort and simply doesn't care anymore.

The \"plot\" is Lenny (Sandler) moving his family back to his childhood neighbourhood to be with his childhood friends, following the first film, and it never seemed to move from there (maybe it took a hour to get going?). All the pretext about their previous lives - his Hollywood career, his wife's fashion career, and the aggravations they cause, etc - seems to have vanished, and instead it's just toilet humour all round. It'm sure the actors had fun doing it; they seemed to laugh more than I was."

Don't think to much about it just take it for what it is, a good movie to watch a Saturday evening with some friends :)"

I could write paragraphs upon paragraphs of problems this movie has, but it all boils down to this:\n\nIt seems as if the entire script was composed within one hour. The whole movie is essentially a 101 minute stream of embarrassing, annoying, perverted, disgusting, and offensive \"jokes\" that occur at a rapid-fire rate. There may be one out of every twenty jokes that are even worthy of a chuckle. One could easily be convinced that the script was written by children and perverted teenagers. The movie's attempts at humor alternated between fart-jokes and sexually perverted jokes. I literally struggled to laugh, and practically bolted out of the theater as the end-credits started rolling.\n\nPlease, do not waste your time or money on this movie. It is a disgrace on every level, even for an Adam Sandler movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow. So it has come to this Grown Ups 2. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but just to make things clear I don't hate Adam Sandler. Not all of his movies are this horrific, but because of the crimes that this puts to film, it makes a very strong case of reasons to dislike Adam Sandler.\n\nWell, I can't say that I was surprised by how bad it was, as after watching the trailer, my expectations were pretty much rock bottom. You know that when a movie starts with a deer peeing into multiple people's faces, it isn't going to be the comedy of the year. But, this movie isn't even trying, I think I genuinely laughed (not out of pity) about twice in the movie and the laughs were attributed to Taylor Lautner (this is not a good thing).\n\nI advise anyone who is even considering watching this movie to avoid it like the plague, and if you find anyone on this earth, heck even anyone in this universe who likes it to punch them in the face. There are countless gags in the movie but anyone over the age of 12 will not find them funny, this is basically a film with endless potty jokes and it really is only for the simple minded.\n\nWhen I was in the cinema it felt like Grown Ups 2 was playing for a year, I would check my watch every 10 minutes or so to see when this hellish film would end, but alas it continued to drone on and on and on\u0085 So if you find yourself in the cinema watching Grown Ups 2, don't say I didn't warn you. Walk out of the cinema and watch any film and I'm almost certain it will be funnier than this steaming hot mess.\n\nBut you know what? I wouldn't be surprised if that within the next 3 years there will be a Grown Ups 3, and that movie will be even more distasteful than the last, with poop and fart jokes every 30 seconds. But if anyone is wise enough to not give Adam Sandler and his friends any of your well-deserved cash or time then maybe we will avoid this atrocity for the next half decade if we have any luck\u0085\n\nVerdict: If you can even call this distasteful comedy a comedy then I don't think you have seen one. By the end of it you'll realise that the only people who are laughing are Adam Sandler and his friends as they rake in the big bucks, for what is undoubtedly the worst movie of the year."

        "review_title": "A compendium of man-boy humour, this is a movie that's all about hanging with Adam Sandler and his company of Happy Madison pals",
        "review_detailed_main": "If you're going into 'Grown Ups 2' looking for plot or character, then don't even bother. Adam Sandler's first ever sequel is no more than an excuse for him to get together with his Happy Madison pals for some male bonding time, to which he has also graciously invited some easily recognisable faces like Taylor Lautner (yes, we mean Jacob from the 'Twilight' movies), Shaquille O' Neal (remember that NBA star?) and even Steve Austin. How much you enjoy their get-together really depends on how much you enjoy Sandler and Co's brand of humour.\n\nAnyone who's a fan of Sandler will recognise his regular big-screen pals, many of whom like himself were 'Saturday Night Live' alumni - including Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Nick Swardson, as well as Steve Buscemi, Jon Lovitz, Tim Meadows and Colin Quinn in smaller parts. There is unmistakable chemistry among them honed from years of goofing off each other, so there's really no point chiding them for indulging in man-boy humour; instead, all you should be prepared to do is to laugh along with them - and occasionally at them.\n\nThe script by Sandler and another two of his regulars - Fred Wolf and Tim Herlihy - provides the loosest structure for him to knock around with his pals. Set entirely in the course of the last day of school before summer break, it reunites Sandler's former hotshot Hollywood agent Lenny with his trio of childhood friends - Eric (James), Kurt (Rock) and Marcus (Spade) as they plan a 1980s-styled party at his house; the only noticeable absence from the first movie being Rob, no thanks to Sandler regular Rob Schneider sitting out this adventure.\n\nEach character gets his own individual storyline - Sandler objects to his wife's (Salma Hayek) wish to have a fourth kid in the family; Eric secretly hides out at his mother's place because his wife (Maria Bello) isn't affectionate enough; Kurt is feeling excited about his \"get out of jail free\" pass after remembering his twentieth wedding anniversary when the missus (Maya Rudolph) hasn't; and Marcus has just met his son who happens to be a tattooed teenage delinquent. All that, plus their children's complications of the heart, are however just filler among the string of episodic gags and infantile humour which follow.\n\nKeeping with the spirit of the first movie, bodily discharge is still very much in vogue; there is urination (the opening scene has a deer peeing on Sandler's face), simulated defecation and 'burpsnarts' (a one- two-three combo of a burp, sneeze and fart). Ditto for leering - first with Lovitz's janitor impersonating an aerobics instructor and getting the women to jiggle their breasts and spank their butts; then moving on to a hot ballet teacher at school; and then to a car wash by young nubile cheerleaders.\n\nYes, this is that kind of movie, exactly the type Swardson's high-on- drugs bus driver can fit snugly in by stripping to his knickers, sleeping on a bed in Kmart and pooping in their toilet bowls on display. It is also that movie which Lautner's crew of frat boys form a childish rivalry with Sandler and his pals, resulting in an impromptu insult contest, naked dives off a 35-foot cliff, and culminating in a showdown at the very party on Sandler's home lawn where the very same deer that appears at the beginning returns for a ball-breaking finish.\n\nNot all the jokes work, not all the humour will resonate (in particular, those that aren't physical in nature), and the pace does slack from time to time - despite Sandler's go-to director Dennis Dugan's best efforts. But this is a movie that hinges on a bunch of grown-ups who refuse to grow up, that very circumstance mirrored by the kind of humour Sandler and his company indulge in and invite their audience to revel in. Call it slack and lazy if you like, but if you're not into watching Sandler slack and laze and relax with his pals, then 'Grown Ups 2' ain't for you."

As the minutes went by I grasped onto the fading hope that it was going to get better but before I knew it an hour and a half had been and gone.\n\nIt is without question one of the worst films I have ever seen. Yet it is successful; is it me? Have i .....grown up? Am i humourless? Now to investigate further i watched \"This is the End\" a couple of weeks ago and it was excellent; i laughed through the majority of the film; it was superb. I love Airplane, Naked Gun, Dumb and Dumber, Anchorman amongst many others; and they are smothered in silly comedy. So what is wrong then.....\n\nBehind all of those films are creative geniuses; people who come up with scenarios and situations that others can't. Does Sandler have that same asset? No, he doesn't; he uses jokes that a 5 year old could make, he relies on toilet humour and outlandish, ridiculous events; he doesn't have a innovative bone in his body anymore. A personal vendetta against Sandler? I loved Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Waterboy, Wedding Singer, Bulletproof and despite harsh feedback i liked Funny People. Those films are long gone and now we're stuck with Jack and Jill, That's My Boy, Grown Ups and of course it's rotten sequel. He has been accused of being lazy and comparing his past work to now i can see why. And what better way to revive your past glories than by surrounding yourself with fellow has beens. Chris Rock hasn't been relevant since..... well since... i can't remember. Kevin James tries to bring life to the film, but due to the dire dialogue he has, he sinks with the rest of them. And David Spade continues to dig deeper into irrelevance. The 1/10 is for the efforts of Nick Swarsdon who has blatant potential to be a comedy star of the future, unless of course he continues to be Sandler's human cannonball.\n\nDue to the money this film has brought in it is clear that i am a minority, but that i can't understand. It just isn't funny; Admittedly morbid, but i think i would have more chance of laughing at a funeral than at this. Would take a violent case of toothache for 90 minutes than watch this again.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are easily amused by farts and chocolate ice cream symbolising excrement for example, then this may well be the movie for you.\n\n1/10"

Yes, they're rude and low-brow, but for the most part at least a little funny and provide at least a few nuggets of wisdom. Not the case here. Lazy, dumb, and totally morally bereft.\n\nThis movie was racist, sexist, and ageist. It was also EXTREMELY misogynistic. And it wasn't even funny (except a few slapstick moments of farting and people getting hurt in really stupid ways)!\n\nI think what bothered me even more is that they kept the cursing out of it so it could be tagged as PG. I happened to go during kids' school holidays and the theater was packed with kids from 5 to 16. The slapstick jokes kept them laughing while exposing them to the disgusting array of discrimination.\n\nNeedless to say, I walked out of the theater. I was actually so angry I nearly tried to get my money back. Since we all know how that would have gone I have decided to slam it in social media instead and take a long shower to wash off the slime of having even been exposed to it. Save your money and your soul."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yeah, this film is worse than the first one. I thought that, maybe, I was thinking of this one, that this one was the funnier one. But no. Before (re)watching the first one, I was thinking about the first one, except it wasn't the level of funny that I seemed to think it was years ago. And this one was worse.\n\nI didn't necessarily find the first film that funny this time around, but it's shining a lot brighter now that I've (re)watched this one. I was very tempted to give this one a five. A six will do, though; what I gave the first one. I don't think this was a bad film. It wasn't that funny, that's all.\n\nAnd one thing that sticks out a lot to me is the soundtrack. In the first film, the soundtrack was pretty good. But there barely seemed to be a soundtrack in this film. What's up with that? I mean, it wouldn't have \"saved\" this film. Not even close. But it would've helped. Sure, it was there. Maybe the first film's soundtrack was more impactful for me because I knew some of the songs. These films are easygoing and lighthearted, and the soundtrack in the first film complemented that.\n\nLack of funniness aside, I thought the likely underappreciated highlight of this film was Taylor Lautner. His charisma is practically palpable. Yeah, you could argue that his character was pretty similar to Jacob Black, personality-wise and performance-wise. I can somewhat understand that sentiment. But I didn't see that as a problem. Taylor's charisma and energy, not to mention his pure athletic ability, are all a sight to behold, and it's super unfortunate that his acting career has been so still. But if he had a significant say in that, as opposed to not being offered roles, that's fine. As long as he's living a good life, right?\n\nThere were also a few familiar faces, other than Taylor Lautner. For one: Shaquille O'Neal. He was an entertaining addition to the film. And like Steve Austin, which was a surprise. I 100% forgot about him being in this film. I'd say his character was my second favorite part of this film. And it was cool seeing David Henrie as one of the Frat Boys. He was the actor who played Ted Mosby's (future) son, Luke, in How I Met Your Mother. Yet another familiar face was Halston Sage. I only know her from Prodigal Son. But familiar faces are familiar faces, and it's cool seeing them.\n\nBesides all that, I don't have any \"other thoughts.\" Well, I do: that CGI deer could've been better. But this was a comedy film, so it's understandable.\n\nOther than that, I thought this film was worse than the first one. The first one was more enjoyable, had a more memorable/good soundtrack, and thanks to the (more) lackluster nature of this film, the first one seems even better now. And it had more energy. This film wasn't a bad one but rather one among many in a single pond: and there are loads of ponds. That analogy probably doesn't make sense, but I don't care."

These actors were just making fools out of their characters in a way over a no go movie. The thing with Taylor Launtner and the this is our club thing was absolutely pointless. The whole plot was disappointing, waist of time and just sad it wasn't really a great movie. It was scattered all over the place the guys act pointless to the movie and the only person who I thought was alright was Kevin James but that thing with his mother was like what! I don't get it this really doesn't add up to be a movie just the usual men doing whatever the heck they feel like doing. The party scene was pointless and the costumes with Nick Swardson was just funny to see him in a movie like this I thought he was better in Just Go With it. This writer just intended this to be no plot, no humor but immatureness you could say and an excuse to just to whatever the guys want on their reunitement.It could've been written 100% better and actually contain a nice plot! go see another movie for your sake!"

If the movie dint get you off on more than a few occasions then probably your sense of humor has been damaged..\n\nIt's a comedy after all so there will be many attempts at humor, it helps to see the lighter side of things. The punches did have substance and there will always be a few that don't go down so well, but there are 2 ways to take it in; one is to go on with the spirit and the other is to crib about each scene making the experience even worse for oneself..\n\nThe plot itself was light, it could have had a little more but one can try to appreciate the way in which the pieces were put together. This is not inception, what plot are the people looking for? The basic idea is that you had a bunch of teenagers who got older and how they lead their family lives, it is not a new concept but that should not be the focus.. understand what you are watching the movie for..\n\nWhen you have such a powerful cast it is not easy to balance titans with justice at each moment of the film.. this is perhaps where the audience is expecting too much.. not taking the main lead also means everyone has to consolidate on certain aspects of their regular individual acts as it may otherwise be too much in the equation to balance.. that being said i think they had better energy synchronization this time around.\n\nThe negatives.. I would give this a 6\\7 mainly because of a)Some avoidable clich\u00e9 moments b)The plot wasn't great but it wasn't bad either\n\nA rating below 3 is a review done by the mentally defeated.. let alone challenged."

I know there was a scene with a deer going crazy, a hot Swedish teacher who is married to Steve Austin, a 1980s theme party and a big fight scene at the end and Taylor Lautner turns up as a jock who teases Sandler and co.\n\nThe film is basically extended sketches with some trademark Sandler touches and use of 1980s music. Sandler knows who his audience is but the product is looking tired and his younger audience are moving on whilst those in the same age bracket as Sandler also getting restless."

The movie is enjoyable and I laughed trough it all, if you are wondering if the movie is worth it I will tell everybody the same thing: If you liked the first you will like this.\n\nDoes the movie have a plot? No. And you know what? There's no need for it, it works great without one. This is what a comedy should be sometimes. Or would you prefer the classic (and annoying) plot where guy meets girl, they hate one another, they start getting along, they break up always because of something the guy did, he does something pseudo-amazing and they live together ever after (or until a sequel where everything repeats itself)... Oh and you laugh around 2-3 times the 90 min..\n\nWell this works because this is just 4 friends remembering what they did while growing up, and attempting to redo it, while trashing each other and others in harmless fun.\n\nIt's a good movie and it doesn't deserve such bad reviews.\n\nNow a word to the critics: GROW UP!! This is not a pseudo comedy for pseudo intellectuals to pretend to appreciate, honestly have you ever heard something called mindless fun? Just enjoying something without pretending everything needs to be an internal reflection on the human condition! I mean I also like the great works of art, like Inception and Cloud Atlas (two of the best master pieces ever made in the movie industry) but sometimes you also need to relax, and forget the seriousness and the fact that life is also a celebration in itself! And one more thing if you never did nothing like what happens in this movie or the first when you were a kid or now days, then you have never lived and your lives are as dull as the reviews you post! Thank you for your time reading this!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The fact that they could find enough cheaper by the dozen recycled plot material to make two of these movies is honestly sad and eye opening. People (being PAYED for their \"contribution to society\") literally sat in chairs for HOURS writing fart joke after fart joke for a small child forced to recite the monstrosity that is the humour of these movies, and people pay money, money that they WORKED for, to go see these movies. And I'll bet SOMEONE OUT THERE thought it was the funniest thing that has ever graced their sad, dead eyes. I think that before every \"grown ups\" movie there should be a disclaimer saying that if you spent a penny of your own money on a ticket to see this on-screen terror then you are a worthless human being who should go outside and heavily reevaluate your deflated balloon of a life. Maybe afterwards they can have a group therapy session to ease the life- long guilt of spending hard earned cash to see this movie.\n\nAlso on a side note about the Jewish golden boy that is Adam Sandler; You can't base an entire career on Jew jokes. Do you hear of any famous Jewish comedians? No, you don't. And do you know why? You cannot profit on being Jewish. You can profit on being black or Hispanic because they actually have material based on racial stereotypes/race specific rituals that is relatable, and if not relatable, mildly humorous. The only jokes that Jews can make are \"ha ha I'm Jewish\", and maybe someone will have a pity laugh for you because you're just not funny at all. Start writing material that isn't laced with \"happy Hanukkah\" and maybe you can reclaim your roles in shitty chick flicks that only air at 5 in the morning. You are comedy scum.\n\nI spent more time out of my life writing this \"review\" than the writers did thinking of the plot of this movie. What is the plot? Adults? What kind of plot is that? Are you legitimately cashing in on the \"comedy gold\" that is old age? This isn't Keeping Up Appearances, we don't need, or want, your sitcom- esque \"I'm old, ow my back, I'm always cranky\" jokes. Did you genuinely think this would make people laugh, or are you the one laughing while you roll around in the supposed $42.5 million that this cinematic masterpiece raked in?\n\nBut you know what, all of that aside, I would crank out this eye sore if I had endless amounts of money and all the time in the world to smear my filth on the face of movie making. As my blaze of glory. Even then, I would be back at square one. Because I'm willing to bet that you shelled out more money from your greasy little pockets to get this plague into theaters than you actually made by people viewing it.\n\nI hope you go home every night feeling like you just witnessed the Holocaust, and I hope your wife doesn't let you touch her anymore.\n\nThis movie is garbage."

I've always been a fan of Kevin James as well as David Spade, and neither of them let me down. Yes, some of the jokes are kind of ridiculous, but if you appreciate it for what it is, it's pretty funny. I like the kinds of movies that usually take place over one night or one day, like a lot of Sandler's films do, and that's exactly what you get with this one.\n\nI didn't much care for the first Grown Ups, but this one did elicit some pretty loud laughs.\n\nIf you're expecting witty dialogue and subtle comedy, this isn't for you.

I heard many laughs during the movie even when it went really south. And I'm talking about \"grown ups\" laughing not kids. Sometimes you have to be silly I guess. One of the factors that are sort of redeeming is not the father-son sub-story (though you could argue it adds a little character), it's Taylor Lautner. But even he is having moments where you want to choke the screenwriter. Obvious (and unfunny) Twilight jokes aside he does have some of the finer moments in the movie."

It's not always good to have too many known names in the movie, as the short screen time usually leaves their characters undeveloped. None of the \"big stars\" did a bad job, mostly the inexperienced ones given too big of a role were under performing. There were a bunch of dumb jokes, some forced repetitive jokes that became annoying, but there were enough good jokes and a few nicely written family importance lectures to make it enjoyable. Sure it's not better or equal to the first one, hardly any sequel is though. Still the first movie was great and skipping this one because of bad reviews is not the way to go. Always best to see the movie and judge it yourself. I myself give it 6/10. My wife and I enjoyed it and agreed that it was well worth the money. Witty remarks and decent amount of good jokes make most of the people laugh, sure you need a sense of humor for that;) If you don't you'll probably rate this movie below 5, then you are better skipping this one all together."

Because it's not, in fact it is very, very difficult, more difficult truth be told than any other type of film-making, and this here is one of the laziest, slackest, most bone idle pieces of crap to come from the bowels of Hollywood since Transformers 2, actually this is lazier than even that toilet blocker. Adam Sandler probably burnt only 3 calories making the entire film as he spouts the garbage he and his two (that's right, it was written by 3 people) moronic writing buddies crayoned into the script. The tyre scene is ripped strait from a 1990's Beavis and Butt-head episode, the editing is beyond terrible as cuts between each awful segment to the next like a rubbish failed TV clip show, and it gets really boring at times, I zoned out almost constantly. There are one or two mildly funny parts, but I'd get better laughs from about one minute of a Simpsons episode than I'd get from this movies entire length. Lastly this turd of a film made $200 million at the box office proving cinema goers get exactly the movies they deserve."

The only amusing thing was the car wash scene with the hot chicks and guys wearing short shorts. But even that was too much.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Watch at your own risk, but best to avoid."

The jokes were ridiculous and it just seemed like an hour and a half of watching actors make a total fool of themselves. In some ways, it's much better than the first one, which I totally hated, but this movie had a few more stars in it which made it slightly watchable. As the movie came out at the holiday season, it made quite a lot of money which means that we might get a 3rd one of these hard to watch movies. If you watch it with the family, then it might be fun, but as a single person, I struggled to stay awake through the whole film. I wasn't totally disappointed because I knew what to expect from this franchise, but it's still hard to watch actors like Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, go downhill. Rubbish!\n\nRound-Up: Adam Sandler seems to be stuck on making movies like these nowadays, which is why I have totally gone off of watching his movies, but the problem is that they make so much money so we are always go to see these type of films coming out of Hollywood. Chris Rock has also gone way down in my estimation and his voice just becomes really annoying after a while. Kevin James makes some average movies so he is allowed to make some that are totally crap every now and again. Salem Hayek was the hardest to watch make her fool out of herself because she looks so great. Anyway, the storyline is so unrealistic and the characters are uninteresting, but it's one for the family.\n\nBudget: $80million (On What?) Worldwide Gross: $247million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who were fans of the first movie in this franchise, but this isn't that much better. 2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Grown Ups 2 continues with the story of four childhood friends who are now grown up, Lenny Feder(Adam Sandler), Eric Lamonsoff(Kevin James), Kurt McKenzie(Chris Rock) & Marcus Higgins(David Spade). Lenny moves back to his hometown with his wife, Roxanne Chase-Feder(Salma Hayek) & kids, Greg(Jake Goldberg), Keithie(Cameron Boyce) & Becky Feder(Alexys Nycole Sanchez) to be closer to his friends. He soon realizes that, the pool where him & his friends used to swim when they were kids has been taken over by a couple of douche-y frat boys led by Andy(Taylor Lautner). Lenny, Eric, Kurt & Marcus decide to fight for their pool.\n\nWhat I've said above, is pretty much the film's plot. So, take the plot & add a lot of suggestive humor & potty humor & that's Grown Ups 2 in a nutshell. This movie is hilarious. I was laughing almost all the time. However, the potty humor really gets sickening after a certain point. Especially the 'burpsnarting'. The suggestive humor is the highlight of the film. It will leave you in splits. Adam Sandler is great as Lenny Feder. Kevin James is impressive as Eric Lamonsoff. Chris Rock is spectacular as Kurt McKenzie. David Spade is mind blowing as Marcus Higgins. Salma Hayek is outstanding as Roxanne Chase-Feder. Maya Rudolph is brilliant as Deanne McKenzie. Maria Bello is effective as Sally Lamonsoff. The kids are effective too. Shaquille O'Neal is hysterical as Officer Fluzoo. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as the Squats Fitness Janitor. Oliver Hudson is charming as gay fitness trainer, Kyle. Nick Swardson, Steve Buscemi, Colin Quinn & Peter Dante are brilliant as Nick, Wiley, Dickie Bailey & Officer Dante respectively. A special mention should be made for Taylor Lautner who is hilarious in his cameo as Frat Boy Andy. Grown Ups 2 is not a must watch however, if you have nothing to do & want a fun way to spend your time then, Grown Ups 2 is just the right movie for you."

There were some enjoyable moments for the male viewer-ship and maybe a few moments where you really could laugh out loud.\n\nAll in all, it is one of the better efforts of Mr. Sandler in the last years who reached his personal bottom with \"Jack and Jill\", which was so cringe-worthy that I didn't manage to finish it.\n\nThe same man acted in \"Reign over me\" and \"punch drunk love\", which are two truly great movies in my humble opinion.\n\nBut I digress, back to the movie at hand.\n\nIf you want a light movie that you do not have to pay attention to and want to get a few laughs and boobs out of... well, this is the one for you!"

However in Grown Ups 2 we see a fairly different film with a different thinner plot. People may say all of these movies are equally bad, but that's not so. The original Grown Ups which is considered Sandler's most successful film since the 1990's, was a borderline thorough family picture that gave generous screen time to Chris Rock and Kevin James and other folks who can get laughs. And it had a vaguely engaging plot about middle-aged family men taking account of their lives 20 years after high school.\n\nThe film showed a little discipline, a little heart. Now into Grown Ups 2, not so much. It's a plot less free-for-all about Sandler and his high school buddies throwing an 1980's theme party, and it's a string of slap-stick gags that gives each of the star's friends a pratfall and paycheck. There were many different characters which come in at various parts that are there to simply deliver laughs and move on. Grown Ups is far more predictable and does not deliver the laughs warranted of the hype and success."

Grown Ups 2, with funny appearances by Tim Meadows, Collin Quinn, Cheri Oteri, Andy Samberg, Will Forte and Bobby Monihan might be the best example."

There's also a random character introduced in this movie with no background whatsoever from the school. The first movie was so good, and this one just wasn't.

Frankly though, this steaming pile of crap is nothing short of what one can expect when Sandler is allowed to write anything (think Jack & Jill). Not only has the quality of his script-writing officially crossed over into the zone of non-existence, but his acting is equally as bad too.\n\nI've read reviews/comments posted that those who hate this movie obviously do not get what Happy Madison is all about. WRONG! I hated every minute of this movie (especially those with closeups of Sandler's poor acting) but I loved their past works such as Grandma's Boy and Deuce Bigalow. THOSE movies are fun and mindless entertainment that were actually hilarious as hell (and still are)! Grown Ups 2 on the other hand, isn't for those who are seeking mindless entertainment; it's for those who'd like to effectively find a way to destroy brain cells and commit self-torture.\n\nI wish I could write a more technical review of this movie but all I can do is just fling dirt & feces at it because this movie, quite frankly, is a flimsy house of cards; all it takes is a gust of wind to bring it crashing down. Reviewers (myself included) are not exaggerating when they claim that the movie progressively gets worse because it really does. Halfway through the movie, I left to take a shower without bothering to even pause it, then came back 20 minutes later wondering how on earth it was possible for the movie to have gotten twice as awful during my absence.

I could describe it this way: It was like they had taken a number of skits that all bombed horribly on Saturday Night Live and combined them together into what could laughingly be called the screenplay. Unfortunately, that's about the only laugh one will get from this movie. What a waste of 101 minutes!\n\nOn the positive side, I feel that this movie did help me cultivate endurance. I think I could probably sit through almost anything now."

What kind of retarded producer has Kevin James and Chris Rock and still ends up with a horrible hopefully career-ruining film ? DING DING DING That's Denis Dugan. What is the movie about ? I don't know, and that's after I've watched it. All it was, or appeared to be was a series of failed desperate attempts to make something funny but there was definitely no humor in this movie. Maybe the director was laughing, but it wasn't funny. I don't why they made this movie, seriously! Kevin James and Chris Rock are both natural comedians and I think their natural talent is to a large extent compressed and limited during this movie. They can both be big stars in their own right but their is going to have to be a strong comeback from both of them or they will fade away into the list of actors who were known, and then forgotten."

Unlike the first movie, the sequel is set in one day rather than over the summer like in Grown Ups one. The film reminds me of Cheaper by the Dozen 2, in the fact that they are a large group of family/friends enjoying the summer. It is an all round happy and funny film that I would recommend it to anyone, young or old! It's nice that the whole cast live in one area too."

The movie had a bad story, filled with unfunny jokes and was nothing but a waste of time.They really haven't put any type of effort into this. It just looks very cheaply made. So if anyone thinks is worth the time, let me spare it for you, this is not a great movie, this is not even good. It's bad, it's no way similar to the first movie and you should not waste your time and money on one of the worst sequels ever. This probably the worst comedy of the modern era.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well the title of my review for Grown Ups 2 says it all. This film was basically pointless. While there is some humor in the film overall this doesn't make you laugh as much as the first film did. The story seems nonexistent with Sandler and company just push along a boat of nothing for ninety five minutes or so.\n\nThe acting in films such as these usually aren't anything to brag about and Grown Ups 2 does nothing to change that mold. However most of the actors are real life friends and they do have a chemistry that does add something to the film. But really overall there is no reason to see this movie just for its acting.\n\nAs I mentioned above I enjoyed the first movie. The jokes happened more often and were so much more funny than in this film. This was the first sequel for Adam Sander and it should probably be his last. The story runs along hoping to find something similar to the first film but nothing ever happens and when the film ends you are truly asking yourself was there even a story here? Or were those guys just running around for ninety five minutes trying to be funny. And sadly even the jokes aren't that funny this time around. The farting jokes and the urine jokes control this film as expected but outside of those the laugh factor is almost not there at all.\n\nSo overall this film is basically not worth watching. The first film Grown Ups made you laugh a lot more and actually had a story that kept you interested to a point. This film was a mess almost from the start and never picks up. Outside of some laughs here and there there is no point to watch this. So please stay away from this film."

Adam Sandler is less than stupid, along with his usual cast of former Happy Gilmour misfits tagging along to join in on the simple, low budget comedy this movie will surely be known as for the rest of its existence. Chris Rock is at his worst. David Spade is non-existent. Thank goodness Rob Schneider stayed away or I probably would have committed a crime after my eyeballs were so insulted.

Sadly, I don't think there was. It reeked of doing a group of people who have an affection for each other grabbing hold of a script and using it to hang out with each other on the set. For God's sake... it's not often that you see a movie that's missing Rob Schneider and think it may be worse than the one he WAS in. But Grown Ups 2 manages to make me wonder if it would've been just a little more enjoyable if Schneider made an appearance. The answer of course is no - he makes nothing better, but the fact I even entertained the thought should give a clear indication just how poor this film is.\n\nWhilst the first Grown Ups had a little heart, this was a complete waste of time and, more importantly, money - do not waste either of yours on this.

What a mistake. Adam Sandler needs to go on hiatus from doing movies. The humor is juvenile if that makes any sense. It's like a 48 year old guy stuck at 13. The actors are recycled from older Sandler flicks. Nothing wrong with that if only their characters bring something to the table but they don't. The only bright spot is Salma Hayek. Let's face it, she's beautiful. This movie falls flat and is boring. Giving it at 3 out of 10 is being generous. My guess is that anymore of his movies will just follow suit. To his credit I thought Hotel Transylvania was cute."

And the whole movie takes place in one day. Ya one day. Its not funny. Its boring. Its stupid. It has no plot. And people actually payed to watch it. I am so sad that this was actually released to the public and families sat and watched this at the theater. Don't buy this garbage."

Same actors may have played but the characters were nothing similar to the ones in Grown Ups the first. It looked like the whole movie was shot in 1 day, including the scenario. This was the only Adam Sandler movie that let me down. I don't know what happened but it seems like he got some bad advice from a bad friend. Some people say that it was fun, this is not the kind of fun you expect from a movie. Some parts could be fun if it was on a sitcom, full of laughing effects. Still, Adam Sandler is the man...

There is no real storyline accept the overused running gags sandler is famed for. Adam Sandler's face is on the poster and so therefore he has decided he must be portrayed as a successful ladies man punching way above his weight. Just like Jack and Jill, Just go with it and so on. The film is awful from start to finish and one can't help but think what on earth was going through their minds writing this script. The casting is terrible, how Salma Hayek ever became a successful actress is a question only the gods can answer. The film drags on and on spewing out stupid one liners and childish gags, each one will leave you wanting to rip your ears off. However there is one moment from the movie which manages to bring back happiness to your now 101 minute less life, and that is the end credits. Do everything in your power to avoid this movie."

Grown Ups 2 has forced me to re- evaluate my standards of awful.\n\nI came here to try to understand. I read the positive reviews in an attempt to understand why someone would like this. The juvenile humour, the paper-thin characterisation, the painfully awkward editing, how could anyone enjoy this and not feel annoyed for having been sold it.\n\nThe whole point of my podcast is to be an antithesis to all the people who watch Nolan movies and high concept thrillers and complain about minor details that apparently \"ruined\" the movie. It was an attempt to re-frame film criticism in a positive way. This film was our toughest challenge. Tomorrow I need to get on Mic and figure out why it's a good thing that this movie did so well at the box office and why so many people loved it.

No matter if you liked, loved, or hated the first one, I think you should go see the sequel. I guarantee everybody in the theater will erupt in laughter multiple times."

Yet here we are again with deer's peeing over people, men getting their genitalia attacked (even one scene where a woman gets kicked in the groin) ,, and women being placed in parts of the film for pure sexual gratification.\n\nIt really sets a new all time low for comedies. This isn't quite as bad as \"The Heat\" but it almost is, which is a shockingly bad place to be.\n\nIt's about time Hollywood grew up and tried using their heads instead of relying on unfunny offensive gags."

        "review_detailed_main": "I did not get to watch the first \"Grown Ups\" in 2010, but I knew it was a successful comedy at the box office back then. The trailer for \"Grown Ups 2\" I saw was funny so I guess the whole movie would be as well. That is not exactly what happened.\n\n\"Grown Ups 2\" has Lenny (Adam Sandler) coming back to live in the old suburban community where he grew up. So in that way, he gets to spend more time with his old buddies in a way Adam Sandler famously does -- stupidly.\n\nThere is no plot to talk about. We follow Lenny and his gang, namely Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock) and Marcus (David Spade) in their raunchy and rowdy shenanigans at the K-Mart, at their old swimming hole now claimed by bratty frat boys, and finally at a wild 1980s themed party in Lenny's house. We meet their respective wives and kids, as well as various strange schoolmates (the drunk bus driver, the bald guy, the cross-eyed guy, the maniac cop), along the way. Everything felt so random, lazily put-together episodes.\n\nThe kind of humor is also so random, anything goes. There was animal humor about a stag that entered their house. There was a lot of body function humor, including one about a burp-sneeze-fart combination. There was also a lot of green humor, ranging from boob jokes to gay jokes. Unfortunately, there was more misses than hits. The laughs were few and far between. I even feel the best funny parts were already in the trailer!\n\nI must say that Shaquille O'Neal was actually hilarious in his guest role as a gentle giant cop. He did not come off as annoying compared to the other odd people in town. Taylor Lautner looked a lot thinner this time (compared to his Twilight days), especially surrounded by those bulkier frat boys. Was he really the one doing all those backflips and flying kicks, or were those special effects (yeah, right)? He too was funny, perhaps unintentionally, with all his hyper-macho posturing.\n\nThe most disappointing element in this film is Adam Sandler himself. He was so laid back here, he actually looked lazy on screen. I do not know what happened to this guy. Many of his movies were so hilarious and had a delightful charm about them, like \"Billy Madison\", \"Happy Gilmore\", \"Wedding Singer\", \"50 First Dates\". I even liked \"Don't Mess With the Zohan,\" offensive as that may be. But in this one, he is not even trying to do anything, and it obviously shows. A lot of his jokes were falling flat, compared to the others in the cast.\n\nI did enjoy the music, costumes and references at the climactic 80s party, but that ended in a poorly choreographed free-for -all brawl scene. I enjoyed seeing sweet Ms. Georgia Engel on the big screen as Eric's mom. I recall her from her appearances on \"The Love Boat\"! So, in short, there are good and funny parts. Everyone will find a little something to enjoy, but they maybe not be enough for your money's worth. 4/10."

I felt like the only one there that didn't seem to find the jokes even the slightest bit funny. It just seemed to be a script filled with joke after joke that eventually became irritating rather than funny. There wasn't even an actually story line - nothing significant happened. Maybe one or two (at most) jokes might make you smile however its probably more cringe worthy than funny.\n\nI am normally a fan of Adam Sandler films (e.g. 50 first dates and happy Gilmore) but i thought his acting became annoying at times with his repeated shouting and tone of voice.\n\nThe only way i can describe this film is as a complete disappointment. Unless you are desperate to waste an hour of time then i would strongly suggest steering clear of this film!"

This movie is no exception. The first movie was a dumb waste of time not worth seeing but Grown Ups 2 was a total insult. It's so dumb and completely empty of any good jokes or laughs that we were literally feeling insulted and embarrassed, like we were stupid for letting ourselves get tricked into watching it.

There were less than 15 people in the theater so \"word of mouth\" must be getting around. The movie was more like a \"stand-up\" comedian's act, i.e., silly one liners dominated the first 30 minutes and you could tell Adam Sandler's fingerprints were all over a terribly weak script. As bad as the script was, it can't compare to the \"grade school\" level of acting by the children in the movie. OMG, they were so bad I was actually embarrassed for them. There are so many terrific child actors that one has to wonder if they were children of the actors, producer or directors. In summation: This movie is absolutely terrible and you will be wasting your money and senses if you see it."

None of these questions and so many more will be answered throughout the course of watching Grown Ups 2.

Maybe just because it was mindlessly entertaining enough for my young brain to enjoy, or maybe it was the fact that I was watching this far before I was probably supposed to- but looking back on it now all I can say is that I am incredibly ashamed to ever enjoy this piece of vile trash. There isn't much to say about this film in terms of actual quality, or filmmaking in general. Its actually mindnumbing to watch at times and the script is so blatantly stupid and half thought out that the 9 year old me probably could have written a better story. All the acting is godawful, and the film is just FULL of cameos for literally no reason- including but not limited to: Steve Austin, Shaq, Taylor Lautner, Andy Samberg, Will Forte, Jon Lovitz- and so many more. I don't even know what the plot of this film was to be honest, some mumbled ideas that eventually lead to a party at Sandler's characters out- with a bunch of tired gags thrown in again and again. Not to mention the gross, sexist, and just blatantly homophobic and transphobic humor thrown in throughout- and just so many things that have not aged well. There is also a part in this film that's basically one giant ad for Kmart, and if that doesn't turn you away from this one I honestly don't't know what will. It can be entertaining at times, it maybe got one chuckle out of me (probably out of the blatant stupidity on screen), but Grown Ups 2 is a shameful act of filmmaking that can only be described as pure half-brained mania. Never reaching a single cohesive thought in a much too long runtime.\n\nMy Rating: 2.1/10."

His co-actors are fine, especially Chris Rock. Women in here are cleavage flashing puppets who is nothing to talk about. The characters seem like they wanna renew their teenage days (just like in the Indian comedy \"2 Harihar Nagar\") which goes disastrously awry. The humor is absolutely laughable, with wits, dialogs & sarcasm hugely involved. Non- verbal drama was ridiculous. Lots of misogyny involved and when they are from considerate chauvinists, just heck! And the appearances Taylor Lautner & Shaquille O'Neal were nightmarish.\n\nAs it approaches the end, the only humor which was supporting the film, crashes to a shambles & the viewers are left paralyzed in the brain. Sequel to movies like Grown Ups don't need much art, let only potential, but the makers & writers here disappoint. 4.4/10 for the jokes, dialogs & Steve Austin.

        "review_detailed_main": "I try to give every movie a chance, because even things regarded as \"the worst ever made\" can sometimes have redeeming qualities that others failed to recognize. I'm even an Adam Sandler and Kevin James apologist and try to give them the benefit of the doubt because I've laughed at many of their movies that critics despised. In fact, I'll go out on a big limb and admit that I didn't despise the first Grown Ups movie. Therefore, it's a sign of the level of failure in Grown Ups 2 that even I will declare that this is easily one of the worst movies ever made. If there's one thing I can compliment in this movie it would be that they don't keep you waiting to discover it is terrible. It took less than 5 minutes to have a pee joke, a poop joke, and a masturbation joke. Literally, the first minute of this film involves a CGI deer urinating all over Adam Sandler. I'd like to say it gets better from there, but at a certain point this movie made me so mad that I envied the deer because I wanted to piss on Adam Sandler.\n\nIt's vital to point out that there is no story in Grown Ups 2. I kept looking for one, and after the fourth or fifth hour, I realized this movie was going nowhere. I know, you're out there thinking \"but the runtime of this movie only says 101 minutes,\" but I swear this film is so inhumanly awful that it somehow folds space and time to make less than two hours feel like more than two days. My dedication to finishing films was tested to its fullest extent as I paused multiple times for bathroom breaks that I probably didn't need, and even turned off the movie about halfway through and finished the rest on the following day. Anyways, in place of a plot, the film is like a series of failed sketch ideas loosely based around being a father. It's as if someone was sweeping up the floor after the writer's finished the script for the first Grown Ups movie, and decided to save all the rejected ideas for a sequel. These were the ones that were so bad they weren't even considered for the first lame movie, and now they decide to recycle them to amalgamate another script.\n\nIf it wasn't bad enough that Grown Ups 2 is plot-free and a comedy that isn't funny, it's also wildly offensive. Minorities are mistreated in the film and relegated to broad stereotypical roles. There are a number of jokes at the expense of homosexuals and the transgendered. And the entire film objectifies women from beginning to end. I love how other movies get called out for being insensitive by not casting people of the correct race, and yet something like this can skate by despite the fact that it belittles anyone who isn't an adult white male. The saddest part of writing this review of the film is that I'm looking at the cast list on IMDb at the same time, and it reminds me the amount of talent wasted. There are some truly great actors that appear and none of them gets even a moment to be great. There was not even one joke in Grown Ups 2 that made me chuckle, in fact I was getting progressively more annoyed as they tried and failed. The entire thing is so shoddily made that it feels like it shouldn't even qualify as a movie.\n\nIn order to truly express the disastrous quality of Grown Ups 2, I feel like breaking down a scene might help. About halfway through the movie, Adam Sandler takes his son (played by Cameron Boyce) out onto the football field while the team is practicing. Now his son is not part of the football team, and there has been no discussion of him wanting to be on the football team, or Adam Sandler wanting him to be on the football team. Yet here he is trying to convince his son to practice kicking field goals. While they do this, a random girl (who has appeared once or twice at most in the film) is on the sideline making an idiot out of herself as a cheerleader just for Cameron Boyce. The kid starts making some field goals and we see the football players pausing their drills in order to watch. So now Adam Sandler decides to rush him and try to create a real-game scenario with a defender in his son's face. As he charges, something in the grass trips him, he falls on Boyce and breaks his leg. That's the joke.\n\nI have no idea why this scene exists in the film, and that's why it baffled me so much. It was not setup beforehand, it is referenced only once shortly after when Sandler has to explain to his wife. There is somewhat inspirational or triumphant music played through most of the scene, but this isn't something Boyce was working towards, and kicking field goals does nothing to resolve his character's biggest struggle (which was a bully.) So, then logic would dictate that this scene was included for comedic value. Yet I only count 4 pathetic attempts at comedy: 1) The crazy girl cheering like a fool as if Boyce were in a game and Sandler saying she might have been bit by a spider to make her act that way, 2) Sandler breaks his son's leg, 3) Sandler instantly says \"Don't tell your mother,\" and 4) The football coaches that started watching give up and say \"Oh well, that kid's dead.\" I know I'm spending more time thinking about a scene than they did, but it's this kind of pointlessness that makes Grown Ups 2 so infuriating.\n\nNo one involved in making Grown Ups 2 was an amateur. These writers had worked before, this director has lots of experience, and the cast is loaded with veterans. So, there's really no excuse for making a film that is so incompetent, unless it's simply a broad decision by everyone on set to not care. It seems that no one said \"That's really not that funny.\" No one said \"Let me work on that scene so we can make it better.\" No one even took the time to ask \"Why is this scene happening?\" It's almost like they went in actively trying to make something unfunny and incoherent, and if that is the case, they were extremely successful. There are many films I have hated in my lifetime, but usually I can see tiny hints at why someone else might like them. Grown Ups 2 is an anomaly, though. Not only can I not see why anyone would like it, I think I'd worry about anyone who told me they did. When people joke about a movie they don't like being played on repeat in Hell, I tend to scoff at their hyperbole, but now that I've seen Grown Ups 2...I understand what they mean."

It flowed, it had a story, there were some amusing lines. This just feels rushed, as though all the cast had better things to do but they gave up a weekend in order to film the project. I genuinely feel for Salma Hayek having her name associated with this. I'd be surprised if she looks back on this with any pride."

Anyone who is a fan of SNL stars, of Adam Sandler, or just great comedies in general, will love this movie. The jokes are hilarious and very creative, even if they are a little immature. And, even more important than that, is it is definitely a feel-good movie! I left the movie with a smile on my face, and so did many others in the theater, everyone from teens to seniors. Don't go into this movie with a negative attitude; go in positively, ready to laugh and smile, and you will love it! Don't listen to the uptight critics. They never appreciate Adam Sandler's genius & talent, yet millions of people do. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes to laugh and have a great time in the theater, and this is the perfect movie to bring a couple of friends to! Even if you don't love it the way I did, you are guaranteed to smile at the end. Grown Ups 2 is definitely an under-appreciated work of art. :)"

Like, within \"dumb movie\" good it wasn't good. There really was no storyline, so nothing quite made sense and it was choppy so you never quite got to know the characters even though you wanted to. Within silly movies, there are only a handful that I really did not like and this is one of them. I'm bummed!\n\nI don't REGRET seeing it, but if you are like me and it's between this and another \"dumb movie\", see the other movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "'GROWN UPS 2': Two Stars (Out of Five)\n\nAdam Sandler reteams with his buddies Chris Rock, David Spade, Kevin James, Nick Swardson, Steve Buscemi, Tim Meadows, Jon Lovitz, Colin Quinn and many others for this sequel to the 2010 hit buddy comedy film. Rob Schneider is notably missing (due to scheduling conflicts), and it's not even explained why his character is never there, but the movie makes no sense anyway. It has no story whatsoever and is instead just a series of strung together dick and fart jokes (like every Adam Sandler movie). Dennis Dugan once again directed the film (he directs almost all of Sandler's recent crappy movies) and Sandler once again co-wrote the movie, with Fred Wolf and Tim Herlihy. Salma Hayek, Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph also reprise their roles as wives of three of the four main characters. The film is more of the same of Sandler and friends' usual antics. If you enjoyed the first movie you'll probably like this one (but maybe just a little less).\n\nThe film takes place three years after the first one when Lenny Feder (Sandler) has moved back home to Connecticut with his wife Roxanne (Hayek) and three children (after successfully living in Hollywood for many years). His friend Kurt (Rock) is celebrating his 20th anniversary with his wife Deanne (Rudolph) but she forgot about it. His other friend Eric (James) is disagreeing with his wife Sally (Bello) about how to raise their children and his friend Marcus (Spade) just found out he has a 17-year-old son (Alexander Ludwig), who wants to kill him. The friends also have to deal with a group of angry frat boys (led by Taylor Lautner).\n\nIt's become the new popular thing (recently) to totally bag on Adam Sandler and his movies. They still make a ton of money and audiences of a lower IQ still enjoy them but for the most part he's a joke (and not in a good way). I'd say his movies are almost as unpopular as the 'TWILIGHT' franchise, so it should come as no surprise that Lautner has now appeared in one. I used to think Sandler was a talented comedian and a decent actor (and still do) but he definitely doesn't put any effort into trying to make adults laugh anymore. He still makes a lot of money (and so do his friends) so you can't diss him too hard (this film cost $80 million to make, mostly for the actors' salaries probably). It looks like everyone is still having a good time making the movies and they seem to like their own jokes (a lot). I'd say 'GROWN UPS 2' isn't nearly as bad as something like 'JACK AND JILL' or 'I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY' but it's not as good as even the original 'GROWN UPS' and it's definitely not anywhere close to as clever as Sandler's early films (like 'HAPPY GILMORE' and 'BILLY MADISON'). It's like a bad sitcom; it has a few good jokes and a lot of energy but for the most part it's an insult to anyone who watches it.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrdaYYFcs0U"

Is this what the whole movie will be like? Really tired, ridiculous, basic low-IQ jokes that were already unfunny in the 90's?\"\n\nYou know those terrible overdone cliches where people are screaming over-the-top at \"outrageous slapstick scenarios\" and it's supposed to be comedy - this movie still does that, alot.\n\nIt really is as bad as everyone in the reviews says and I can't believe those movies are financially successful, I guess there's no hope for humankind.\n\nThe really sad part is after skipping half of the movie it got kind of good near the end - I actually laughed a few times and enjoyed some jokes. I think the main problem is they should've removed all the garbage jokes that the viewer is bombarded with in the beginning. Just stop with those lame gags. I see your budget is massive and you can do all sorts of effects, you can probably afford better writers also.\n\nIf you want to watch a formulated, soulless rehash of every tired movie cliche ever - this is your movie. It has it all - \"awkward teenagers\" chasing girls, generic fat bullies, wives drooling over a fitness instructor, beta male husbands being cringey, highschool parties, wild animals charging at a man's privates, kicks in the balls, etc. You've seen it all done better but this time -- the budget is really high and they have celebs which sadly changes nothing."

It pains me to think that people were paid millions of dollars each to write, produce, direct, star in, and distribute this travesty (and that it made enough money to assume more is on the way). After watching this movie (I got it from the library, so thank heaven I didn't waste any money on it), I would have no trouble believing that all these functions were performed by 12 year olds. Did intelligent people actually watch the final cut and think it was a good movie? (and why are these people making millions of dollars?) Unfortunately, many of the movie's stars are celebrities that I have enjoyed in other projects. All through this movie, I was so embarrassed for them, but I guess a paycheck is a paycheck (and this movie will soon be forgotten). Its seems more and more celebrities are willing to put their names on inferior projects like this just to stay in the spotlight.\n\nIf there is any justice in this industry, this turkey will be the beginning of the end to Adam Sandler phoning it in for millions."

The movie doesn't hold up to the first. Shaq man deliver funny moments, the bus driver sleeping in the Kmart bed was hilarious and the fight scene at the end was funny but not as great as Anchorman. The script doesn't provide any creative comedic displays and sometimes feels lazy and always targets humour around human faeces and belittling either women or different races. Doesn't stoke up to the first flick and the weird first scene with the deer in the house was sign of this. Overall 5/10"

Some people might like the toilet humor, (I thought it was gross) but I actually liked the \"Whaaaaaaaaat?\" parts. The college kids parts sort of make me cringe at things they said and did. The story was great, though with it all taking place in one day. The cop situation was very unrealistic, pointing their loaded guns at people for no reason, not stopping rioting/mass fighting, and they would definitely get fired if it was in real life.\n\nOverall it was pretty funny with a 50% chance of laughing. I definitely wouldn't rate it a one-star like some people are doing. I would rate it a 5, but it's a 7 for the story. Just wait until it's on Redbox/Netflix. 7/10."

Grown Ups 2 is the follow up to the box office successful 2010 Grown Ups. So why shouldn't there be a sequel? Well, there should not have been a sequel. This movie is bad. I'm generally not too hard on movies, especially ones that attempt to be stupid on purpose. The problem, with this movie is that it thinks it is more important and funny than it actually is. This makes sense because this is how Adam Sandler and all of his friends think of themselves. Anyway, the movie takes place in Sandler's hometown after moving his family from LA. That's really it. Nothing else important happens. The rest is filled with terrible jokes and the most annoying frat guys ever led by Taylor Lautner. There was only one remotely funny scene that came from Steve Busscemi during a driving test, In the hour and a half run time, there is one joke that you will laugh at, if that... I'll be honest here, I did not mind the first Grown Ups. It incorporated an element of nostalgia and was kind of fun to watch, not a good movie, but still fun to watch. Growns Ups 2 had no nostalgia and was actually quite boring. The only reason it gets a 4 is because you will be able to see it once without hating yourself,but you will never have the desire to see it again, or think about it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I haven't read any of the reviews so I have no idea how Grown Ups 2 (Adam Sandler's first sequel) is doing.\n\nThere does seem to be a lot more hating on Sandler's films of late, and I agree that some of his recent movies aren't as good as his earlier ones on the whole, with some exceptions (I loved 50 First Dates, Click, Chuck & Larry). I also agree that this movie didn't have much of a plot - it was just kind of random things happening over a couple of days in a group of friends' hometown.\n\nBut, honestly, if you find this movie cringey, stupid or immature why do you ever bother seeing Sandler films? That's what he's always been about and I don't think the essentials of his films have changed at all. There's Sandler's quirky-yet-still-average-Joe character with a super- hot girl. There's loads of goof ball comedy (think farts, poo, boobs, fighting). And of course there's the many random weirdo characters with their funny lines and totally unrealistic behaviour (a parade of familiar Sandler faces: Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi, Peter Dante, Jonathan Loughran, Nick Swardson and many more - the 'Ladies' Night' man from Little Nicky even makes an appearance!!). Also loved the fight scene and appearances of Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nIt's fun, it's weird, it's random, it's quirky and slapstick and it's Sandler at his best. If you don't like this type of comedy then go and see a more intelligent film with high-brow, 'middle class' humour. Sandler rocks"

        "review_detailed_main": "The original \"Grown Ups\" was a surprisingly deft and endearing comedy that at least managed to squeeze a modicum of quality out of its formulaic tale of four childlike buddies having trouble adjusting to the obligations and responsibilities that come with middle age. The movie somehow managed to balance the requisite gross-out gags with some genuinely thoughtful and sophisticated humor about the compromises that come with growing up. The sequel, imaginatively named \"Grown Ups 2,\" is something else again, a movie that's every bit as epicene, juvenile and dumbed-down as one would have expected the original to be. Suffice it to say that any movie that starts off with a deer urinating on an unsuspecting suburban family has set a pretty low bar for itself. And \"Grown Ups 2\" lives down to those expectations just about every step of the way.\n\nThe original had at least a semblance of a plot on which to hang its jokes, namely the men's coming together for a memorial service for their junior high school basketball coach who had recently died. Here the script is nothing more than a loosely strung-together series of misadventures as the \"boys\" roam around town getting into all sorts of mischief, some unlooked-for and some a product of their own making.\n\nAs with any movie that employs three comedy writers - Adam Sandler, Tim Herlihy and Fred Wolf - to hash out the screenplay, there will inevitably be a few genuinely funny moments scattered throughout the film, but they are not enough to counter the barrage of urine, poop and vomit jokes that receive a much higher percentage of the screen time.\n\nThe movie wastes a quality cast that includes Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Selma Hayek, Maya Rudolph, Steve Buscemi, Georgia Engel and Taylor Lautner.\n\nThey - and we - deserve better."

The core group of friends have good comedic chemistry (aside from Nick Swardson...blek), the kids are funny, and you even get to see Shaq as a dancing crossing guard. It pokes fun at fraternities, Taylor Lautner actually made me laugh, and it is unrealistic enough to let people know that those involved with the film are fully aware of the stupidity of it all and somehow that makes it better haha. That all being said, though, there were definitely parts that were stupid and/or too gross for my liking. I went to see this to take a break from stressful life and just mindlessly laugh at a few jokes, and was completely uninterested in any of the potty humor.

        "review_detailed_main": "The wives are hot, the kids are sweet, and the men are as goofy as ever. Grown Ups 2, directed by Dennis Dugan, is nothing more than a good laugh. Although I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider act like the complete opposite of \"grown ups\" in the first film, one was definitely enough. I'd be lying if I said the film isn't funny, but it hardly qualifies as a movie. I wouldn't refer to it as acting either; it's simply Sandler spending time with his friends.\n\nFirst off, Schneider doesn't make a second appearance. Unfortunately, not even he could save this film. Grown Ups 2 begins with a deer that appears in Lenny and Roxanne's bedroom (played by Adam Sandler and Salma Hayek). The deer then proceeds to pee all over them and their bed... If that doesn't say this movie is going nowhere, I don't know what does. This movie is unrealistic, childish, and pointless. If you've grown up in any way since the first flick, the second is not worth your time.\n\nThe first film had a clear storyline; the families were headed to the infamous lake house, in hopes of reliving old memories with friends and creating new memories with their kids. However, this film is all over the place. Lenny's wife wants another baby, Kurt and his wife are \"celebrating\" their anniversary, Eric chooses to spend time with his mom over his wife, and Higgins tries to have a relationship with his son. Meanwhile, the kids are actually growing up, going on a first date and taking a driver's test. It seems the kids are the only ones who have matured since the first film.\n\nIt's the last day of school for kids. And since the bus driver is not fit for the job, Lenny drives the school bus, and then picks up Kurt (played by Chris Rock) and Eric, (played by Kevin James) as well as their kids. On the bus ride to school, a bully makes fun of Kurt's daughter along with Lenny's son, so the adults, being the mature individuals that they are, call the bully a \"beanbag with arms and legs\" with a \"Mariah Carey hairdo.\" Once the kids are dropped off, they continue to ride around in the bus and go to Kmart. Ironically enough, Marcus, typically referred to by his last name Higgins, (played by David Spade) is already there. It only makes sense that four grown men would hang out at a Kmart in the middle of the day, right?\n\nGrown Ups 2 is a bunch of adult actors and actresses acting like teenagers. When it comes to the script, half of what is said during the film was probably said on the spot. While this is great, because as an actor that is hard to do, most of the dialogue ended up being just bad jokes told unsuccessfully. So if you're in the mood to see Taylor Lautner, a frat boy, refer to the men as the \"Flabby Bunch\" or Shaquille O'Neal, as a cop, peeing in a pool, this is the movie for you. It ends with a somewhat cute ending, but seeing that would require sitting through the other 90 minutes of the film. Lenny has got it right, \"We're irrelevant, we're losers, we're old.\""

The jokes can be hit-or-miss, with some moments eliciting genuine laughter while others fall flat.\n\nThe cast members all deliver their signature comedic styles, but their performances feel somewhat uninspired compared to their previous work. The addition of new characters and subplots adds to the chaotic energy of the film but does little to enhance the overall story.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, \"Grown Ups 2\" still has its moments of comedic gold and serves as a lighthearted escape for fans of the ensemble cast.

Let's just say they would act more or less like a kid would.\n\nThe movie really has no plot to speak of. Instead, the movie is just a bunch of set pieces, some of them funny, some of not. The humor in this movie is an acquired taste: some will find it funny and some will find it racist, misogynistic and homophobic.\n\nI liked the scenes with Shaquille O' Neal as the cop and Taylor Lautner as Frat Boy Andy. Their scenes were amusing and well staged. Also in one scene, David Spade goes rolling in a tire down a rather bumpy terrain, that made me laugh hard. But one wishes that Adam Sandler's comedy were more inspired and in the lieu of set pieces, create some more character driven comedy. The characters in Grown Ups 2 are barley sketched out and different events just get thrown at them.\n\nBut compared to some of the comedies released this year like Movie 43, Scary Movie 5 and Identity Thief.

Usually Adam Sandler's films are funny but they have some sort of message, or heart to give it depth.

Much of the comedy came from the antics of the frat boys - (uncredited) Taylor Lautner and also a Schwarzenegger, as well as Shaquille O'Neal as the funny cop. Also Beefcake Kitty had some great parts.\n\nThe SFX were pretty poor, as was the sound quality, and the entire film had a sort of poor-man quality about it like no-one was trying really hard and doing shoddy work.

And the kids and the grownups have a run-in with some college boys over the use of a secluded lake. And there's a scene involving a funny car-wash!\n\n'Grown Ups 2' has a massive star-cast. Along with those already mentioned here, there's Twilight's Taylor Lautner playing one of the frat boys, the tall basketball star Shaquille O'Neal playing a cop and there is wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin who has been cast as a former school bully with a sizzling girlfriend (April Rose) who doubles up as a ballet teacher to one of Lenny Feder's kids.\n\nThe movie tries hard to be funny. Take that incident involving a heavily drugged bus driver using the bed and toilet on display at a K-mart. Another one involves Lamensoff's lame gag that combines a burp, sneeze and a fart. A scene of a deer pissing on Sandler is extremely lame brand of humor. When you know that the film has Adam Sandler in it, you know the sort of humor that the film would have.\n\nNonetheless, 'Grown Ups 2' also has its funny moments too. Some of its original but adult humor involves the faux exercise routine for the film's women. Also, the fact that Salma Hayek can pull of a glamorous role in her late forties is noteworthy! And the scene showing the attack by the Frat Boys led by Lautner, one tends to ask 'Hey, why isn't he turning into a werewolf?'\n\nVerdict: Movies like 'Grown Ups 2' are those that are lazily made; imagine a movie without even a real plot. As such, it won't make it worthwhile to visit to visit the big screen and pay big bucks. It has its share of fart jokes, but guess what, watching this film isn't altogether regrettable either. You could as well enjoy this on a lazy weekend when there seems nothing better to do."

While the first movie had an actual plot, solid development, and endless laughs, the sequel was really just a stupid attempt at a cash in from the first film's greatness. The kids were too prominent in the film and all are horrible actors so that hurt the film quite a bit. The plot was pretty stupid. The main four lacked the same chemistry they had in the first one. Honestly, the only reason this movie was even watchable, and barely, was because of the cameos. Nick Swardson provided almost all of the humor, and guys like Peter Dante, Shaquille O'Neal, Steve Buscemi, and so many more were great as well. There were some smoking hot women in the film too, so that didn't hurt, but honestly, I was very disappointed in this film."

There isn't much to say about this movie but that it is much more funnier than the first one mainly because it was more inappropriate and for teenage to adult audiences. Overall this was not that good of a movie and i would not waste 9 or 10 dollars seeing it n theater. If you want to watch I would wait until its either on TV, netflix, etc. I wouldn't really waste your time with this because there are better movies you could be seeing. But if there really isn't anything else on or in theater than I would give it a shot. Plus this movie is not for kids this should be from like 12 and up or they just won't get some of the jokes."

I saw this one once and it was alright. Then I saw it with a friend and liked it better. Now, it's just okay.\n\nI counted 32 pee, poo, and other sick jokes. The credits start at 94 minutes, so a character makes a scatological or gross joke every 2.9 minutes on average. I do not hate this movie, but I do not care for it either.\n\nWhen a whole gag is a man fixing a chocolate ice cream and it looks like he's crapping all over the machine, or a cough/sneeze/burp at once-like 3 times, and other sick jokes, I can't say I enjoyed it, and I know I am being WAY too kind to it, but I ALSO know that it sucks.\n\n94*3=282 minutes of my life I have spent on this. I apologize for spending 4 hours and 42 minutes of my life on this. To be fair, I have spent well over 1,050 minutes-over a day, on Stand By Me.\n\nBut yes, it's stupid, and What The Flick! on YouTube opened my eyes that this sucks. Oh, and by the way, I laughed twice at most.\n\nI like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore and a few other Sandler movies. But this, Sandler's first sequel, sucks. It just medicorely sucks. I am being easy on the rating. Not so much for why."

It feels like a Disney channel original and is all over the place unlike the first movie in which all the characters are together. The cop characters were out of place. Another thing I don't like is the weird fixation on married people being super into other people? It was in the first movie too but it was not nearly as bad as this one. I liked the concept of the movie but poor execution. Overall disappointing because I believe the original to be very good."

A bunch of comedy actors p**s about during the summer break is probably the best way of putting it.\n\nTbh, I'm not a fan of modern US comedy, and this does little to change my opinion. Basic, low intelligence humour with next to no plot, no character development and seemingly random scenes and events tied together. The characters aren't particularly likable, and bar a couple of funny scenes was extremely forgettable. Kids would probably find it funny, but its not really suitable for them. Not my cup of tea I'm afraid..."

The characters you like them maybe because of there past movies, its just a joyful film of old friends and there family now living back in there home town.\n\nCharacters- Well we have the main characters Lenny, Eric, Kurt and Marcus. All funny people. Yet none of them make you laugh, there really isn't any funny moments in the film from either of them, there are some moments where you make a little smirk but nothing more. The only character development is Lenny. All the children have grown up none of them really have a big role or none of them are really funny. The wife's well i guess the only reason is that they are hot. Nothing special or funny comes from them. There rivals from the first bring nothing to it.\n\nStory- There is no story to this film, but this film is intended not to have one but just to see how they fit back in Lenny's home town. No plot or anything.\n\nOverall this movie was a movie that i did somewhat enjoy, it gave me a happy family feeling inside. Its not really funny at all or interesting. If you have seen the first then you can watch this. Its a nice movie but nothing special."

I haven't enjoyed a lot of Adam Sandler's other movies, but overall I've liked this franchise.\n\nYou might like a movie, you might not. When I go to a movie I'm looking for a fun distraction - some entertainment. Yeah, I've seen a few movies I didn't like, but most have been on the better side of OK...a bunch have been great. To each his own, but in reading some of the reviews I have to ask - why do people go to the movies? Is it to simply write reviews? Is it with the task of analyzing each bit? Is it with the expectation that it's going to be bad?\n\nMaybe, maybe not. I just know for me, it's about trying to enjoy myself.

It keeps you laughing from beginning to end that is what you want in a movie. Most comedies only have like one or two funny scenes but critics say it is the best? Psh please a comedy is suppose to keep you laughing. I loved the first Grown Ups and def loved this one. I never trust critics cause they always give good movies bad review and bad movies good reviews.\n\nJust because Adam Sandler is in this movie and produced it people think it is bad. I love Adam Sandler now yes some of his movies has been awful. Examples Jack and Jill, That's My Boy and Just Go With It. But the Grown Ups movies are just funny.\n\nFor me a good comedy is something to keeps you laughing from beginning to end not just have one or two funny moments. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a good comedy lover. Also a piece of advice never believe critics until you see the movie for yourself."

Well i can say that the bashing probably comes from the usual Adam Sandler's hater because i totally liked the movie.\n\nFirst thing to understand, where the first one was a bit more possible and realistic, this one is a joke fest one after the other. Suspend your disbelief to the max. I watch it with a bunch of beers, i was in a good moob and from the first scene to the last i was laughing my ass off all the time.\n\nI won't lie, the jokes are simple, easy, cheesy too, but hell it work for me, i was really having a good time and i didn't laugh like that since a while. Some people mention there is no plot. Well its true the plot is very thin and its more or less Sandler and his friends just having a good time in weird impossibles situation, but what can i say, it just work...\n\nI personally really like Sandler, since i was a kid i watched his movie, from the funny Happy Gilmore to the funny yet emotional \"Click\" , i think he can sometimes just make a joke fest and make us laugh, and other times really make you think a bit.\n\nI really recommend Grown Ups 2."

Just some random happenings over a 2-3 day period, its more like your tele serial. But this time I was prepared, I just kept my brains aside, took scene by scene and it was humorous and not just for me, the entire cinema was having a ball.\n\nThe story kind of picks up from the first part, the guys are having their children who are in the adolescent age, there is no lessons to be learned, no message, just some good one liners. There are characters who doesn't even need to be there, sub plots of no value, but everything will make you laugh. Don't now what to write, but it is a typical Adam Sandler movie. I didn't have any expectations at all, so probably like it. I would have given it a 6, but 4.7 is way too low, so giving it a 9 just to average out"

Seemed they selected a wide variety of songs from the mid 70s through to the early 80s, so there's a song in there for everyone from that era I think.\n\nThis silly movie even had a great story. It reminds us at how lost we've become. It was really odd how on the spot it was. The part about the little boy who picked up the rock but didn't seem to know what to do with it struck me as sad for today's kids.\n\nIt made me long for childhood. It made me happy to remember, it makes me want to call some old friends, and it makes me wonder how we all survived in such a once care-free world so vastly different from the world we built for our own children."

But there wrong Grown ups was a profitable movie and it was funny. Also I was a little disappointed that Rob Schneider was not in this movie but thats OK because in my mind Shaquille o'Neal replaced him.

The children really move the plot along nicely. But like I said, you will be rewarded the further along you get in this film. For someone who is very critical of movies, I must say Sandler plays yet another character we can all love. The writers put a lot of thought into the dialog and it shows.

All together, a very funny and I do mean laugh out loud kind of funny , movie give it a chance you may really like it. I recommend you try it free on YouTube you will only get 3/4 screen but you can see how the non stop laughs develop and carry you through.

If you didn't then don't even start on the trailer.\n\nI get it if it's not your type of humor, and people will respect that, but then you also have to respect that there are some who love this, don't go and mash this movie into the ground, telling people it's a waste of their money, because you don't know that. It's a personal opinion which is unmutual to other viewers.\n\nSo shortly said, Do you like Adam Sander? You'll like the film Don't? You'll hate the film.\n\nDon't go in and expect the best comedy of the year, go in and expect to have fun.\n\nIt worked perfectly fine for me, I laughed throughout the entire movie, we even were lucky that there was the classic contagious laugh guy in the cinema which made it even more fun.

Though it was packed to the brim with cheesy and simple laughs, as most of Adam Sandler's recent and even some old movies are, it was a nice family movie, and a great sequel to the first. What you have to remember going into watching this movie, is that it is not some Oscar nominated dramatic tragedy where all the characters slowly die off, it is a nice, lighthearted film, and should be reviewed as that. As usual, Adam Sandler was perfect, Kevin James was funny, Chris Rock was hilarious and David Spade was pathetic, in an entertaining sort of way. The child actors and actresses were brilliant, and all the minor characters were as equally funny as the main ones. But to me, the funniest thing in the movie was Shaq, who made me laugh dozens of times. Overall, this movie is well deserved of more then six stars, and as having laughed the way I did, I think eight is a suitable number. To put it simply, if you loved 'Grown Ups', then you'll love 'Grown Ups 2'."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching Grown ups 2 was just like watching very funny is sketches that have nothing to do with each other. If the movie had a plot, I would have loved it because besides that it has a great cast and great humor. Finding a movie to compare grown ups 2 is hard since almost all movies have plots . In addition, the movie does not have any conflict by any means, Grown ups 2 made me think that Dennis Dugan (the director) had a lot of money and jokes he wanted to share with people so he said ''let's make a grown ups movie''. Honestly, no person should rush to watch grown ups 2 at the theaters , he/she should wait for it to be released on DVD . Grown ups 2 is not recommended for people who want to watch a movie with a smart plot, but for people who want to laugh no matter what. All in all, Grown ups 2 is nonsense funny movie that has been made for the sake of making money."

I wouldn't recommend you go and see this movie.\n\nBut, if you are like me and you enjoy a bit of silly, potty, childish humour that all the other serious people in this world don't even try to understand then I urge you to go and see this movie.\n\nI laughed from start to finish, in fact NO I HOWLED from start to finish. I found this film to be amazingly funny and it is one of the best comedies I have seen in years. I haven't laughed this much in a long time.\n\nI appreciate a crappy plot with some stupid humour every once in a while. Life is too dull and serious and full of bills and responsibilities so every now and again I like to go and see a really goofy comedy with some immature jokes that only the best of us understand and can enjoy.\n\nAmazing.\n\nI loved it and I am still laughing now."

The good thing about these films is the enjoyment the kids get from them and they too will watch them over and over again.\n\nI suppose for me, these films strike a chord if you have retained your childhood best friends into adult life. There's nothing better than reminiscing and attempting to re-live some of those funny moments.\n\nThis is the first review I've written and I'm really astonished at the poor rating, this is worth an easy 6.5 / 7.\n\nThoroughly recommended watching and you must watch the first before this one. Really hope Adam Sandler will stretch to a third installment."

I still didn't find the first one funny and switched off after half an hour. I then decided to watch ten minutes of GU2 to see what it was like. Wow, I was in hysterics in the opening scene with the wild animal in Sandler's house. I stuck with it after that, and while there is almost no plot whatsoever there are some epic laugh out loud gags in this film. I can see why some people hate it because for long spells it feels like a bunch of unconnected scenes. However the final showdown / party is fantastic fun and makes a lot of earlier scenes make sense. On the whole this film made me laugh enough times to put me in a really good mood and for that I can forgive the lack of structure."

As i said, subjective, would recommend giving it a shot, i liked it a lot. As for negatives they have some pretty exagerated stuff that feel unreal or its weird in some kind of way, but that doesnt stop me from ejoying it, its mostly consistent, thats what really matters, open minded and liking comedy, its your kind of movie."

I laughed my ass off HOME ALONE! I don't like all the actors in the movie, but none of them were annoying. Where have Eddie Murphy or Jim Carrey went? Where are they? Can't find better comedy nowadays than this movie. It combines farting/burping, racial, and quirking jokes, everything that is really funny in for anybody.\n\nConclusion: LMAO!"

I thought it met the laugh test for a fun movie and would recommend it to grown up couples that want to go out and laugh on a movie night out.A good mixture of older and young actors to even attract the younger generation \"twenty to thirty something\". I would even watch this with my teenager. All in all I had a blast in this movie.\n\nCan't believe that I didn't see the first one. Will be renting or buying it this weekend."

Don#t bother if Adam Sandler annoys you, this movie is not for you.\n\nSo here's the deal; if you enjoy the old Adam Sandler movies, like the Waterboy, Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, this is the 2013 equivalent. Go check it out, you won't regret it."
