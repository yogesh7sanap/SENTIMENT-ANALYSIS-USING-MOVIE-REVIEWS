        "review_detailed_main": "A Silent Voice is an emotional and beautiful movie that almost anyone can relate to in some shape or form.\n\nThe story is both heart wrenching and heartwarming, as it tackles many issues such as bullying, social anxiety, depression, and suicide. Many of the characters deal with some or all of these issues. The issues the characters deal with in the past ultimately lead them into becoming what they are in the present movie.\n\nThere are many characters in a Silent Voice with some shining more than others. Shoya is a great main protagonist who (unlike most movies) is battling something much bigger in his life, his past self. The other main character Shoko is outstanding. You can really genuinely feel all her emotions just through her facial animations alone. Other notable characters I enjoyed were Shoya's best friend Tomohiro (who brought a nice comedic presence to the film) and Shoko's little sister Yuzuru. My only problem with a Silent Voice is with a couple of side characters who show up once and a while, but don't really contribute as much to the film - this is only a small nitpick though.\n\nThe majority of the music in a Silent Voice is played only by piano making the film take a more somber tone. This makes a lot of scenes feel more peaceful and calm contradicting what many of the characters feel deep down inside. The song titled \"Lit\" is a beautiful piano piece that I believe would make anyone emotional, when listening to it. So I enjoyed a lot of music in a Silent Voice with a couple of songs that really stood out.\n\nThe animation in this movie is absolutely gorgeous. There's a firework scene that is beautiful, it definitely is the animation highlight in this film...it's breathtaking.\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love this film. Everything feels so genuine and the characters feel so real. It really feels like there was a lot of love and care put into this movie and it definitely shows. This movie made me cry and I can almost assure you that it will do the same to you. Final rating 9.510"

        "review_detailed_main": "A Silent Voice (or \"The Shape of a Voice\") is a great addition to the \"slice of life\" anime of modern times. At times life affirming in its quieter moments, at other times shocking in its depiction of Japanese teen life.\n\nEgged on by his school mates, Shoya bullies the newly arrived Shoko, who happens to be deaf. Perceived to be receiving special treatment, and being different (a crime in Japanese society), Shoko is fair game for any number of cruelties. Until it goes too far.\n\nThis movie then takes a different approach. Instead of showing the bullied person's return to strength, it shows the traumatised bully (and his cohorts) as he seeks to recover from the horror he put Shoko through. You may balk at the thought, but the paths of Shoya and Shoko are explored in their later high school lives, both being treated sympathetically.\n\nThe animation is beautiful, the script manages to avoid typical Japanese cliche, and the story takes some shocking turns without relying on trite misery or emotional manipulation. If you miss Ghibli, give this a watch. You'll be happy to know the spirit of great Japanese animation lives on."

I found myself rooting for Shoko and eventually Shoya as well. I think this movie should be a requirement for children in school, as it shows the consequences of bullying and that there is redemption even for a bully.\n\nObviously, the writing in this is great, as well as the animation.\n\nMy only qualm with this movie was some confusion over the flashbacks. The way some scenes were cut together made it hard to decipher exactly what was happening or what had happened. This is a Japanese film so maybe this confusion has something to do with it being translated for English audiences? Either way, this confusion didn't hinder the movie too much and it was still very enjoyable to watch.\n\nI would recommend this movie a hundred times over!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Following the success of \"Your name\" we now have the next successful anime that is currently sweeping the charts of Japanese and Asian box offices. \"A silent voice\" captures various mature and serious topics, packed into a wonderfully animated 2 hour feature. It deals with topics such as: social anxiety, fitting in, bullying, suicide, all such that wouldn't be expected in a teenage romance/drama anime that we were led to believe. No, a silence voice tries to capture a much broader idea with a reasonable amount success.\n\nThough the film has been heavily marketed to feature the female protagonist, a deaf girl she really isn't the centerpiece of this film, this film really takes a much more in depth look at our male protagonist, a bully. This is quite a refreshing view from the lens of someone on the other side of most modern day films and takes an unconventional look from a very interesting angle, while sidelining the romance as a brief sub-plot. This film at its core is about trying to fit in and the notion of being isolated but it was also highlighted that it was very important for one to get over their own guilt and to quite literally put in this film \"face the world again\".\n\nThis film does best at capturing this atmosphere, the sense of mistrust and uncertainty towards others, the use of literal crosses on the characters that our protagonist encounters to represent his own lack of self confidence and fear of social interactions was a very good stylistic choice in my opinion.\n\nThis film is however flawed mostly in the development of character, many of the secondary characters and even in some cases the main characters are quite poorly developed, many secondary characters come out of nowhere and their motives are very much unknown to the audiences and sometimes plain irrational, I understand that it was a very important thing that within this group of friends each character represents their own flaws however because of this lack of development these characters grow to be rather irritating and distracting, detracting from the overall narrative at various times. These character flaws can be understood due to the fact that this is an adaptation of a manga series and it should noted that it attempts to cram in way too much information resulting in such complications."

        "review_detailed_main": "Have always been a big fan of anime, particularly Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki without restricting myself to just them (some of my favourites are actually without either involved).\n\nAny film dealing with bullying and its consequences deserves to be applauded for the effort. Bullying, often stemming from something that should be a non-issue but turns out to be an easy target for bullies (for examples if your parents disallow you to play a popular video game for obvious reasons, if you have a posh accent, if you listen to and perform classical music, if you have a physical or social disability, false rumours spread about you, if you were a hard-worker rather than somebody who messed about and disrespected substitute teachers) is something that is very much relevant still and has damaging effects, it is an issue that needs to be addressed and acted upon much more than it is. This is coming from somebody who suffered merciless bullying myself in school, for all the above reasons apart from the first (in my case my school did nothing about it too), and nearly a decade on it has damaged my confidence/self-esteem, made me feel worthless and made my already bad anxiety worse despite getting a degree in music and singing regularly.\n\nSo as one can probably tell, 'A Silent Voice' really resonated with me on an emotional level. At the same time, it also really made me think and see that there is much more to the issue, the bully, the witnesses and the victim than one would tend to perceive. 'A Silent Voice' also turned out to be a very good film in its own right. It isn't flawless, some of the supporting characters are under-explored and in a few cases inconsistently and one-dimensionally written and some of the story jumps around and doesn't always feel complete.\n\nDespite being over two hours, didn't think it was too long considering the number of characters and their stories. If anything, perhaps 'A Silent Voice' would have been even better as a series which would have solved the problems.\n\nOn the other hand, 'A Silent Voice' has an awful amount to recommend. Great isn't a strong enough word to describe the animation. Rich in meticulous background and character detail, atmospheric and ethereal in colour schemes and alive to nuances in its use of settings and character gestures and expressions, it becomes a character of its own and there are some memorable images throughout like towards the end. The music has whimsy, haunting beauty and understatement, while not overbearing the drama and letting it speak when needed. The song is catchy.\n\nThe writing is thought-provoking and contemplative, doing it in a way that will make bullying victims and those who bullied alike identify with what is said. A lot of it is remarkably insightful, and even when the film was really resonating with me it taught me a lot about an issue that isn't as black and white as perceived. The story has its issues but has a strong emotional core, with the truly powerful and touching ending leaving me shell-shocked.\n\nNot often does one find themselves rooting for a bully as well as the victim, 'A Silent Voice' is one of those rarities. The voice acting is dynamic.\n\nIn summary, not perfect but very well done. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

They never explain why she took photos of dead things. They never elaborated on her actions and words.\n\nEach one of Shouya's friends has their own backstory, however it's all thrown out the window and all we get are characters with random actions.\n\nThe entire story would be better if made into a short series. A movie is simply too short to explain everything.\n\nPlease just read the manga and don't watch the movie, you'd get a lot more out of it."

Koe no katachi or A silent voice is honestly one of my favorite anime alongside Spirited Away from the animation alone is brilliant, when I first saw the trailer I feel in love and knew it was going to be up there as one of my favorite but actually seeing, the story is well done, follows the Manga well, the Manga characters are explored a lot more in depth then the movie but the movie is like 2 hours 10 minutes long it would be difficult to add 7 volumes worth of content into that time frame but Kyoto Animations did the manga justice, I would recommend the Manga author/artist Oima Yoshitoki its a brilliant Manga I would beyond recommend the anime its doesn't matter what one you read/watch first the movie covers the main bulk of the manga. In my opinion one of the best movies, it has sensitive subject matters but deals with them with respect and such a beautiful message when you watch the films I would also recommend looking more into reviews and other views on it and theory's they really make you...Smile :)\n\nStory. 10/10 As I said before sensitive subjects, well executed though.\n\nAnimation. 10/10 Its Kyoto Animations...I will leave it at that.\n\nMusic. 10/10 Yeah brilliant the opening was unexpected but not unwelcome, the tone change that happens after the opening was brilliant and the music throughout was fantastic.\n\nCharacters. 10/10 (As I said manga goes in more depth but the movie goes into the characters quite well you feel like you understand motives etc.) Also I bow to the voice actress of Nishimiya Sh\u014dko (Saori Hayami)just beautiful.\n\nEnjoyment. 10/10 I'll be honest I cried, like four times but that is just me I get emotional with my anime but still didn't stop me loving this anime in fact I love it even more. listen I just cant get enough of this anime just. WELL DONE!"

        "review_detailed_main": "A Silent Voice is an anime drama film directed by Naoko Yamada (K-On!). Based on the manga of the same name by Yoshitoki Oima, it is a touching and affecting story of one's struggle for redemption.\n\nWhile he was in elementary school, Shoya Ishida, in an effort to fit in with his fellow peers, teased and bullied a deaf girl in class named Shoko Nishimiya. However, this backfires on Shoya and he ends up being shunned by the other students as Shoko ultimately ends up transferring elsewhere. Now in high school, Shoya has felt constant remorse for his actions and attempts make things right with both Shoko and the classmates who ostracised him.\n\nPoignant and beautifully animated, A Silent Voice is not only a well made anime film, but also an interesting commentary on the state of one's mental health and well-being. This film will likely strike a chord with anybody suffering from depression and/or anxiety who wish they could find a way to fix their past mistakes. Also, despite its serious tone, director Naoko Yamada still manages to insert some humorous and quirky comic relief at appropriate times, much in the vein of what was seen in K-On!, her previous work. The Japanese voice acting is solid, however it is Saori Hayami as the voice of Shoko Nishimiya who stands out the most. Her performance as a deaf girl was highly convincing and never seemed exaggerated or too comical. I have not yet seen the English dub but I plan to do so in the not-to-distant future.\n\nI rate it 8.5/10"

Shoko has always been a character I've been able to somewhat relate to and look up to in a way. When the anime movie was first announced, I wasn't so keen on the idea. I didn't think they'd be able to fully create the same effect that the manga has, the same beautiful scenes and facial expressions that really capture the full heart of this story.\n\nI'm so glad I decided to watch it and at least try it out and see how it was.\n\nWhat Naoko Yamada did with the Koe no Katachi franchise is nothing short of amazing. You can feel just how much love went into this film, how much care was put into the frames. I don't think I caught any mistakes or goofs or any sight of any lazy drawing or animations.\n\nThis is an utterly touching story on depression, writing your wrongs, friendship and a strong message that no matter what, you aren't alone. With tense scenes, beautiful heart-felt scenes that make you tear up and sniff, this is the utmost best that could have been created for the Koe no Katachi franchise. This film brings together all the handcrafted details that make this story as special as it is. Every second is crafted from nothing but pure love and attention to detail to create such an accurate and detailed story that leaves the viewer out of breath, in tears and with a fully warmed heart. As someone with impaired hearing, I could not have asked for better representation in Shoko and as someone with depression, I couldn't have asked for better representation than Ishida.\n\nIf you haven't watched this yet, I highly recommend it."

Turns out the morals of the story are handled reasonably sensitively and in a non-condescending way. There are other problems though.\n\nIt started quite well, showing the background to the issue between Shoko and Shoya, building an engagement with the characters and a degree of intrigue around how Shoya would resolve the issue. However, from a point the plot just drifts. By this time there's already a large degree of resolution to proceedings and it's as if the writer and director were just padding the script.\n\nSome of the sub-plots they use to kill time are a bit silly and some of the characters introduced a bit irritating.

While there are one or two emotional moments the film fizzles out, rather than ends on a high note.\n\nA pity, as this had heaps of potential, was very well-meant and started very well."

        "review_detailed_main": "This anime film from Kyoto Animation is centred on Ishida Shouya. As the film opens he is a high school student contemplating suicide; he stops at the last moment and we learn how he came to this point. When he was in elementary school a deaf girl named Shoko Nishimiya joins his class; she is bullied by several of her new classmates; Ishida being the worst. Eventually he goes too far; the class is asked about the bullying and they put all the blame on Ishida. Soon afterwards Shoko transfers. The years pass and Ishida has become isolated from his class. He learns sign language and finds Shoko so he can apologise and try to make amends. It won't be easy though; there are those who believe he is just doing it to make himself feel better and Shoko has her own feelings of guilt.\n\nIf you come into this expecting the laughs that most school based anime provide you will be in for a shock; there may be plenty joyous moments and some laughs but there are a lot of down beat elements. This includes a very real depiction of the bullying of Shoko; Ishida's treatment of her is cruel but we see others pushing him on, laughing at what he does or just failing to say anything... and the fact that the others fail to see what they did wrong after Ishida is called out and eventually sees that he was wrong. As the story develops it is impossible not to sympathise with Ishida; his early behaviour may have been despicable but his attempts to make amends are genuine and he has improved more as a person than others involved. The characters are all very believable, even the twist involving Shoko's new 'boyfriend' is believable and rather fun. The animation is of a high quality with good character designs and impressive backgrounds. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film to anybody who enjoys an issue based drama... just be prepared to shed a few tears; of both sadness and joy.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles."

The voice actors do a great job and at over two hours it's great value for money. It might also be worth mentioning at the screening I went to the cinema was about half full, which is a good turn out for a sub-titled animated feature.\n\nUnfortunately it's not a film that I particularly want to watch again and there a number of reasons for that. While I'm aware that it's based on a manga, it feels too long and I'm sorry to say depressing. Most of the characters are people that you wouldn't want to spend much time with and there is maybe only one scene that could be called funny. Also just because it's long doesn't mean that all the conflicts are going to be resolved.\n\nDon't get me wrong if you're an anime fan you're probably going to like this, but I can't see it appealing to a wider audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yeah, this is a \"pretty\" movie. The animation is nice, the character designs are pretty solid, and the voice actors are all good in their own right. The problem with this movie isn't technical, because from a Visual aspect it's all very good. The issue is in it's main story, scratch that, it's with the main characters.\n\nThe central plot device here is following the main character, Shoya, who ruthlessly bullied a deaf girl in elementary school until she was forced to switch schools. There are other characters too, a lot of other (to the movie's credit, believably written) characters who also partake in this cruelty, in what is a very well done portrayal of the escalation of torment for kids. The issue is what comes after, in which suddenly Shoya is supposed to be this sympathetic character. That's the chief problem, this movie tries to make you feel badly for someone who has no right to be pitied. It's about him trying to make amends, like that will undo everything and make the world all pretty again. Other characters are there too, and overall they all fall into this central theme, and problem, in that the film seems to assume that just because you feel \"Bad\" about something, that makes it okay.\n\nThese characters go around acting like feeling bad because they were cruel justifies it, that just because they're \"sorry\" they're suddenly absolved of sin. The film milks this dry and keeps trying to kick you in the gut, but it fails because there's no way this mentality can be sympathized with. Feeling sorry for yourself because you were a bully doesn't render your actions void, it doesn't make everything better, and the damage they've caused never goes away. As much as the film wants you to think that everyone is secretly good, it never gives me reason to believe as such. They haven't learned anything, they're just as selfish and mean as they used to be, they just learned how to make it SEEM different. One of the characters hates Shoko (The deaf girl), slaps her repeatedly, tells her that she hates her TO HER FACE, blames her for her problems, and then suddenly at the end we're supposed to think she's good just because she feels bad later.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a visually engaging film, but it's skewed perspective of \"redemption\" drags it down and makes it impossible to empathize with anything it presents."

Unlike Your Name where I found some parts to be overly cheesy or slow paced. A Silent Voice offers up nice character development and introduces a whole array of interesting side characters to the plot.\n\nI do really like the idea of having a deaf friend. I've often thought about what that would be like and the whole learning sign language and writing on a book to communicate. It offers a-not often seen- perspective of that life. I found it quite invigorating and motivating to step up my own life."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's nothing more cruel and twisted than a bully destroying the life of an innocent, just because of how different they are to everyone else. Having, well had, a deaf family member allowed this tragic high school drama to shroud me in a wave of familiarity. Not necessarily due to the absence of a human sense and how to deal with it, but the actions of bullying that I myself may have delivered to others at a naively young age.\n\nYamada and Kyoto Animation have produced one of the finest modern anime features in the last decade, enough to make me realise my erroneous judgements and how they have affected my so-called friends at the time. After nearly committing suicide, Shoya reflects back to his elementary school days where he bullied a young Shoko for her deafness. Having realised his insensitive approach, he attempts to make amends by befriending her and apologising.\n\nThis review may get personal, apologies in advance. Watching bullying makes me physically wretch. No one should be afflicted with that much pain and solidarity for being themselves. I've realised that for so long, believe me, as I myself was a bully. I even contacted my \"friend\" a few years ago to apologise profusely. But quite rightly, I received no response. Just an indication that it had been \"read\". In this story, Shoya represents me. So to witness the first act, whilst shedding a few tears almost instantly, was a hard-hitting yet tantalisingly emotional experience. The verbal, physical and downright inhumane abuse that Shoko received was enough to make me look away.\n\nOverwhelmed with tainted reminiscence, Yoshida does not shy away from the original manga's poignant message. Transforming a grotesque bully into the sympathetic protagonist was always going to be tough. The audience has to feel his weakened mentality and earnest personality into wanting to right the wrongs he caused. Yoshida wrote every single character with a colossal amount of humanity. Never did it feel artificial, his longing for redemption. Never did it exhume desperation, the suicidal tendencies for the sake of melodrama. Never did it feel forced, the tangible romance blossoming between Shoya and Shoko. Beautifully written, gorgeously realised and touchingly human. The medium of anime rarely exceeds this level of writing. The sheer realism embedded within the animation made me weep tears atleast four times. Heck, I'm getting emotional just writing about the film! God damn!\n\nKyoto Animation have really outdone themselves in terms of capitalising on the source material's drawing style. Simply put, the animation was stunning. Faultless. From the majestic urban backdrop amidst a fireworks show, metaphorically symbolising the explosive fluctuating nature of mental instability, to the wonderfully drawn character models that expressively exhume a variety of emotions. Yamada intricately orchestrated the animation to create a frenetic narrative structure, complete with time shifts and illusory visions, alluding to the haphazard thinking during times of solitude. Arguably too frantic at the best of times, especially with abrupt scene transitions, but overall very well edited by Shigemura who utilises ripples to explore the vibrational impact of character actions.\n\nThe outstanding cinematography that creatively harnessed human body parts to reveal feelings, most notably legs, was memorable to say the least. Absolutely stunning. Intuitive details, for example implanting crosses on the faces of school peers that Shoya is outcasted by, further explored this idea of solitude. And rest assured, Yoshida never ventured into unnecessary melodrama. At no point did I feel forced to like Shoya, just because he wanted to walk down the path of redemption. It was all natural progression. The romance that carefully grows between Shoya and Shoko was exceptionally-well executed. The conclusion could've been cut tighter after the coma, however the film primarily revolved around Shoya as a character-changing venture, it was only fair the ending focused on him too. Oh, and the English dub wasn't irritating! Initially I had qualms with the deafened voice of Shoko, and aside from the crying, it was handled with earnest care.\n\nThe same can be said for the entirety of this anime feature. No matter if the story is relatable to the viewer or not, it is irrefutably beautiful. You will laugh. You will smile. And yes, you will cry. It's a journey that expressively explored every emotion available, and I can safely say it's a near-masterpiece."

But today I came upon this film \"Koe No Katachi\"(Aka A Silent Voice) and after watching this, I felt for an eternity that this is best film, I have ever seen in my life. Really this catalyst creation is a masterpiece in its terms and condition. It chooses a 60's song as OP which clearly brought out the jerk characteristics of the hero when he was a child and a solitary ending with soothing sound of reality which prevails the polished soul of the hero when he was successful in his way to redemption. The most important is that the story is not only focus in a point, but it is rather made a great impact through out our society and gave many celestial message about the bad effects of bulling, social anxiety e.t.c.\n\nAt last I have to say it is a much worthy film that mankind should give it a run in their lifetime. This is a motivation being itself.\n\nThough I listened this news that it is not as attractive as the manga but i have to say, this film is enough to beat all categories. You have to agree that it is quite impossible to pen a 7 volume manga into a 2 hours film. So don't provide negativity, just fell it and be positive, It is only for your benefit.\n\nAll the above is just my personal opinion, so don't carried away by it.

Seeing the girl that he bullied in his formative years again changes everything.\n\nThis anime has a strong character development, we see a loner learning to live again and even make some friends. Don't get fooled by the cutesy looks, the anime has deep and dark undertones which are very prevalent in today's society.\n\nOverall a great anime which shows it is never too late to forgive yourself."

The movie has a deep and touching message. Despite the animation not being amazingly colourful or full of shadings, the music and the visual sequences allow for the spectator to connect with the characters. Because of this, I highly recommend paying attention to every detail and analogy. Without spoiling much, I'd like to point out that its characters are incredibly realistic. It's not the typical movie with a Deux ex Machina or a life-changing event which makes all of the characters suddenly realise their mistakes or become more mature from one scene to the other, so that at the end everyone is happy. It is actually closer to what real life is. This movie is definitely a must watch , not only for anime fans, but for everyone."

Here, we witness Shoya succumb to the culture of rejection he himself sets into motion, through his appalling misdeeds, conveyed with haunting precision. Despite its distasteful premise however, Shoya's path to redemption is where the film captivates, as his lasting battle with his personal demons & his attempts to remedy a collective failure, are portrayed with the perfect balance of arresting authenticity & unsettling creativity. I say these, as director Naoka Yamada crafts a unique storytelling medium, as he weaves through his story mostly from the perspective of the oppressor turned oppressed. Here, Naoka uses a variety of effective symbolisms that thoroughly expounds Shoya's perceptions & personal torment. With these, audiences connect with Shoya with ease, granting deeper appreciation & understanding for his resilience under immense guilt, the shadows of his past, & desire for forgiveness. Of course, these are presented under a backdrop of beautiful, hyper real environments, worthy of inspiring hope despite the film's heavy handed scenes.\n\nOverall, A Silent Voice is a one of a kind anime, that deserves a watch. It is beautiful and conveys important messages & commentaries on youth. It can be however, a difficult viewing, as it absolutely embraces its themes of sadness & regret, even elevating these through sound & storyline accessories. 7/10."

Various scenes went around in my head and the messages of the movie were made clear in my mind.\n\nIs this the greatest movie ever made? No. Is it one of my personal favorite movies of all time? Without a doubt, the answer is yes.\n\nFrom a story point of view, Koe no Katachi is a very unique movie. To my knowledge, there has never been an animated movie based around a Deaf character in any shape or form, and if there were, the deafness is usually used as a comedic tool. This movie takes the concept of a deaf girl and uses it as an aid for emotion. This is a redemption story, about a man who tries to redeem himself not for anyone else in particular, but instead for himself and the girl, as he realizes that what he did all those years ago was wrong and he needs to put them right\n\nAs this is an Anime movie, Art is very important to get right. This movie has an believably beautiful, yet simplistic art style. For me, it fits somewhere between the shade and detail heavy (yet somewhow still simplistic) Kimi No Na Wa and the simple shade light style of Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo. It's very pleasing to the eyes and heavily relies on a lot of light shades of colour, which contrasts very nicely with any shading it might use\n\nSoundwise, the movie uses a lot of pleasing piano melodies that accentuate the raw emotional parts of certain scenes and really draws you in. The use of the Who's 'My Generation' at the start isn't something that I expected in this kind of film (usually it's a J-Rock or J-Pop song), but it fits with the part it's used in. The neding some also has beautiful lyrics that sum up the messages in the movie\n\nThe characters in this film all have defining traits that make them stand out. The main character's redemption completely changes his character, to the point where he changes for the better, while still containing elements of his personality of his younger self. The deaf girl is a beautiful character who only wants people to understand what she's been through and to always show a smile and always look on the bright side. She is without a doubt my favorite character in the movie, as her determination to put things right even if they aren't her fault really spoke to me and I really wanted her to be happy. Plus I thought she was just really adorable and by the end I just really wanted to reach out and give her a big hug and let her know everything is OK. i won't talk about the other characters as it would spoil key points, but they are all vital to the development of the 2 main characters and all have defining traits.\n\nThis was one of the most enjoyable movies that I had ever seen. The amount of thought that went into writing every word was evident. Every second of this movie was top quality and I couldn't pick a single flaw at any point in the film. There were just so many messages in the film, but I think that main one was basically; No matter what you've done in your past, if you've ever bullied anyone or picked on anyone, if you've done harm to others, it is never too late to redeem yourselves. Even if it's just for yourself so you aren't haunted by your past, or if you want to put things right with someone who deserves all the best or didn't deserve hate in the past. The important thing to remember is if you really try, you can create good deeds from bad memories.\n\nGetting into Anime really has been on of the best things I've ever done. The quality of the stories, the emotional values and the effect it has you is like nothing I've ever witnessed before."

        "review_detailed_main": "Started with manga book #1 but after the first few pages got the impression it was going to be too much of just another young adult school love drama. So decided to go ahead with the movie: if I liked it, then I would read the series. Boy, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. To start with the only negative comment I have: this is by far and beyond the movie which includes the most apologies I have ever seen in any movie. Some times it's not really clear whether the characters have any reason to apologize, they just feel terrible about something that happened, they can't or couldn't have changed it, they clearly wish it had not happened, or some times they even are the victims... In any case, they apologize, and apologize, and apologize... Almost all of them apologize at some point or another throughout the movie. And these are not casual apologies, some are very formal and intense, Japanese style, long and expressive ones. And done with the negatives. I'm giving this movie 9/10 because even though the apologizing can feel suffocating at times, it's there because of rather serious circumstances which do pile up and call upon so many sorrys. Quite a nasty class of bullying is on the table. Also plain old meanness, unfairness, miscommunication, depression, isolation, low self esteem, fear, anxiety, love, loss, etc. etc. I found this light-looking young adult movie deeply heart wrenching and poignant. I'm not exactly a cry-baby, and second half of this movie I was pretty much in tears most of the time. From childhood till adulthood I grew up with a neighbor who was deaf-mute, that might be part of it. Also not sure if they used an actual deaf-mute actress for the German version but to me it sounded completely realistic and plausible the way a deaf-mute sounds like. Every time that character apologizes for anything, just to hear the way she pronounces \"Tut mir leid\" (sorry) is quite the heartbreaking experience for me, even if German is not my native language whatsoever. This movie was also imho quite original, visually speaking. Simply beautiful. After going through the unexpected emotional rollercoaster of watching it for the first time, only then I read about it and found out that both the movie and manga series have received several awards. In conclusion, and needless to say, very very highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the next best anime in the recent time after 'Your Name'. Not that you know this director very well, not at the international level. But with a film like this, she's going to be. This is another teen romance. Well, romance is not exactly a word that matches with what this film is about narrative, but there's no other way to describe its theme. It was like before romance, that mean before committing to a relationship and after you had started to like someone while fixing the mistakes made in the past.\n\nIt's a high school tale. Before that, it opened with a brief flashback of the elementary school events, where Shoya Ishida bullied a new admission Shoko Nishimiya for her hearing impairment. Soon after that, she'd transferred to another school. Now, a few years later, they meet again in the high school, where Ishida tried to fix what he had done wrong a while ago for her. So a relationship develops, despite people around them does not understand their commitment. At some point, it will be tested, which might lead to uncover their true feeling to one another.\n\nThis is surely aimed at the teen audience. Especially, the romance and sentimental parts are intended for the youngsters, but anyone would enjoy it. So, I felt them, but not like I'm still young. Otherwise, I would have said it is a masterpiece. That's only from the story perspective. The sketches and animations were not bad. The film characters were awesome. Each one was very unique and different people pick different characters as their favourite. I liked Yuzuru as I always like tomboyish type roles. But obviously Ishida and Shoko make this film.\n\n\u275dPlease don't make such a serious face. And, let me say... I am sorry.\u275e\n\nSmooth animation. Technically comparable with any big names (anime titles). That also means the director is now in the league of the best anime-maker. She's young and I hope she keeps doing more films. As I said many times before, that after Hayao Miyazaki retired from making films, we need more people like this filmmaker to fill that empty space. The film won many awards for its great achievement, as well as box office success in the domestic market. Expecting the rest of the world and anime fans to receive it at the same extent.\n\nIt was originally based on the manga of the same name, and a television series was made before this feature anime. As I collect film quotes, the best ones, I was disappointed on that context. There were many emotionally and romantically appealing lines, but not on the moral perception. That does not mean the film lacks the social consciousness. In fact, the film highlights the bullying and its severe consequences. That alone is enough, this is a must see for the school kids.\n\nSurely kids, teens and some youngsters would love it, but as far as the adults, this is not an ideal thematic, yet you can't ignore its artistry and the intention of the film. Sometimes it might help you to like it in the second viewing. Because this is one of those kind. My issue was understanding the Japanese sign language. Besides, the subtitle for that was not much helpful, as it was exactly translated as what the hearing impaired character babbled which is an alternate spelling for every word and sentence.\n\nI had lots of fun watching it, as well as other moods like romantic, touching, annoyance, but overall it leans towards the good side. Just over two hours, it never looked too slow or hurried in the story or the character developments. Could be the best to pick as a date flick or get together with your school friends, particularly opposite sex friends. My final saying is, it is not to be missed for many reasons I've mentioned in this review and the other one is it being an anime, a quality one.\n\n7/10"

The voices of both Saori Hayami as Shoko Nishimiya and Miyu Irino as Sh\u00f4ya Ishida fitted very well to the characters and their work was also great.

These events are all transformative to our sense of self, and we become different people because of it. The characters reflect this real life phenomena in a believable way. I could relate with what they were going through easily because of how well they portrayed them.\n\nThe story is heavy with a lot to unpack. And that's unfortunately a shortcoming - they throw these once-in-a-lifetime emotions at you so quickly that there isn't adequate time to distill them or let the characters explore it. I still felt the weight of their emotional experience, but it was a bit hollow, and could have been improved as a series with double the runtime. Conversely, the story could have been improved if they removed most of the secondary characters except Yuzuru and Nagatsuka and focus on those main 4. They were the most compelling and deserved to be fleshed out more.\n\nAnother shortcoming - which may be caused by English translation of the Japanese audio - was that a lot felt missing from the scenes. Either the translation was severely lacking in accuracy and added context, or A Silent Voice too heavily relies on the viewer to just understand what the flashbacks and symbolism and dialogue mean."

The first part of the movie dives into how the two main characters grew to know each other at first and it's hard to watch at times. Even though these two characters are drastically different at the surface level, I was able to find myself relating to both, and by the end of the first act I felt somewhat sympathetic toward Ishida even though he did horrific things. This first act really carried it's weight and didn't shy away from the life long consequences that bullying has on everyone involved. This was an amazing movie, and I can recommend it to anyone. I will briefly mention how beautiful the animation is throughout the film because it would be an injustice not too. The entire movie is animated phenomenally, and even shifts styles depending on the perspective of certain characters which isn't seen often in the industry."

Tell you why, most of the animated films i saw from IMDb Top Rated 250 films list have gone with Overrated Verdict. This is specifically for foreign language Films, rest i loved Hollywood Classics and adore it more than motion pictures. A Silent Voice is about a notorious boy who bullies a Deaf girl in School days. Years later, he feels bad for her and sets off on a path for redemption. This is a simple case of repentance and somewhere things like Friendship, Love, Philosophy of Life went half-cooked. The love story is left incomplete without any concrete ending, same goes to the philosophy of life and friendship motto. Rest, it completes the course of redemption and reaches the destination on that path. I am bit disappointed and reluctant looking at High Rating for this film on IMDb. This is good, definitely good but nothing great or something classy in Animated genre. However, it came in 2010's decade when Animated films had already moved way ahead technically, theoretically, practically and fundamentally. A Silent Voice is nothing unique, innovative or creative and anyways it is nothing big in writing itself then why the hell people made it look Giant? I am not in the league, sorry. A Silent Voice comes with little overlong runtime of 130 minutes when mostly such stories can be and have been wrapped up within 90 minutes more effectively. Naoko Yamada used nothing artistic or creatively amazing to tell this story of common characters hence simplicity works but nothing remains in memory. I would like to recommend other Hollywood animated Classics rather than this One time Good flick or on other side may be you should watch it and let me know if i missed something.\n\nRATING - 6/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

But what I was presented with truly floored me.\n\nKoe no katachi (A Silent Voice) is one of the most poignant character dramas I've seen not only in animation, but in film as a whole.\n\nI'm not someone who rates movies lightly, so a 10 from me means a movie had to really do something outstanding. So if you haven't already, watch this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "A Silent Voice is a movie about a young boy, who in his early school days starts to bully a deaf girl because of her disability, going so far as to cause her physical harm. Unintentionally, but still. This ends up haunting him, and some years later he looks her up, wanting to make amends and to relieve at least some of the guilt eating him.\n\nThis is a fresh take on this issue. We've seen a million stories about those that are bullied. How they can overcome their experiences, how they can move past them, how they can even make their bullies understand the error of their ways. But in this film it's the bully who realizes on his own that he was wrong and wants to get better. Sure, it's not purely selfless because his friends end up abandoning him, not wanting to associate with a known bully, but we don't live in a vacuum and our motives are very rarely pure black or white.\n\nThe characters are also interesting, quirky and identifiable. You end up caring for most of them, and what I really enjoyed was how none of them was perfect. They all had their flaws, major and minor, and even the more unpleasant characters you could see meeting in real life.\n\nUnfortunately the movie suffers from a very lazy pacing. It's over two hours long, when most of these anime films are something around hour and a half. And that length would have suited this film much better. There are a lot of scenes that are eerily similar with one another. A lot of the conversations and issues end up repeating themselves and by the end I was feeling real fatigue with the film.\n\nStill, it's definitely a film I could see myself recommending. For the fresh take on the subject matter, if nothing else. Personally I had problems with its length, but I can also see how someone could get so lost in these characters and their problems that they would not care at all."

I even cried a couple of times thru it & that's rare 4 me 2 cry during movies. The only other movies I've ever recalled crying at were E.T., The Green Mile & Dances with Wolves.\n\nBut this movie is next level, trust! It tackles issues that aren't common in the animation world, let alone anime world, including disabilities (in the case o' this film, primarily deafness & troubling eye contact), suicidal thoughts, social anxiety & bullying. All these subjects R done in a masterful way & given I myself have sum disabilities, it was really hard-hitting 2 me. This was a film that made me feel better about who I am & that I shouldn't let any negative aspects of myself get in the way of my own self-being. I myself create & write a lot of characters wit disabilities, so this movie pretty much gave me more motivation 2 work wit them.\n\nSo, pretty much - gorgeous animation, great characters, a story wit a huge emotional impact & subject matters that IMO really need 2 B looked at more in animation & anime.\n\nIf U haven't watched it, I suggest U go & do that right now, as it is truly something special.\n\nIn other words, it's a 10/10 modern masterpiece"

        "review_title": "\"A silent voice\" is pleasantly...loud",
        "review_detailed_main": "Until I had the pleasure to watch \"A Silent Voice: the movie\" I was under the misapprehension that the anime-style and quality established by the great master Hayao Miyazaki, was long gone. It was with great relief that I realized how mistaken I was.\n\n\"A Silent Voice\" is one of the rare movies that can be rightfully called \"human\"; there is nothing forced in terms of the plot, nothing dramatic or supernatural with regard to presentation that could possibly mislead the viewer or mischievously attempt to cover any flaws. The movie itself is only a pure, transparent, crystal clear pond. That does not, nevertheless, mean that the waters aren't troubled.\n\nThe movie focuses on the relationship between Shoko Nishimiya, a deaf girl, and Shoya Ishida, the boy that bullies her in 6th grade to the point of her having to transfer to another school. As a result of his actions, Shoya gets to have a taste of his own medicine, as he gradually becomes a pariah and he is scorned by the rest of his classmates. This abrupt change of reality transforms Shoya himself and gives him the opportunity to change for the better, while facing self-loathing, suicidal thoughts and numbness and discomfort when it comes to socializing.\n\nIn contrast to many other commercial movies, the character who at the beginning is presented as the bully, does not remain bounded to this facet of his personality but instead, he is treated as a troubled human being with complicated feelings and a true capability of change. Shoko Nishimiya, respectively, is not facing difficulties only due to being in some way handicapped, but also because of her low self-esteem and naivete that make her susceptible to self-harm and vulnerability. Nonetheless, despite their conflicting emotions and inner turmoil, Shoko and Shoya manage to navigate their tumultuous reality together, with the aid of some very interesting secondary characters such as charmingly possessive Nagatsuka and emotionally impaired Ueno.\n\nI would recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to watch a film that offers a unique kind of rewarding escapism. There is no action, no extravagant setting, no ingenious plot-twist, no breath-taking scenery. But underneath this silent urban fa\u00e7ade of flawed characters lies an experience that undeniably deserves to be heard."

        "review_title": "Remarkable",
        "review_detailed_main": "So let me be completely transparent here. I went into this film without any idea what it was about, other than the synopsis that above. I didn't watch any trailers or head to Wikipedia. And to be honest, I'm so happy I didn't, because this film truly shocked me.\n\nSo without spoiling the film, let me explain a bit about it. It starts with a group of kids in sixth grade. They're quickly introduced to a new student named Nishiyama Shoko, who just so happens to be deaf. Since she can't communicate normally (and since the students don't use sign language), she asks that they communicate with her via a notepad she owns. Surely enough, the students take it upon themselves to give Nishiyama a tough time. The main one who partakes in the bullying of Nishiyama is our protagonist, Ishida Shoya. Day in and day out, Ishida picks on Nishiyama and his other classmates back him up and do it too. Of course one day Ishida goes too far with his bullying, and it leads to him having a tough time in his older years, and ultimately trying to change his ways and make amends for everything he did as a kid, while still having to deal with the day-to-day things that most teens deal with.\n\n\n\nThis film was directed by Naoko Yamada and I have to say she did a spectacular job touching on not only bullying, but social anxiety, depression, and suicide in this film. These are all issues things that teenagers struggle with daily, and to have them presented so accurately in a Japanese animation was a sight to see.\n\nThere are a lot of supporting characters that we meet when Ishida is a sixth grader that we meet again once when the film has a time skip that takes us to his high school years. Each of these characters has their own internal struggle that has followed them from childhood to adolescence. However, the main focus is on Ishida and Nishiyama's relationship. When the two of them meet as kids, it's something of a one-sided battle, with Ishida constantly bullying Nishiyama, and Nishiyama just brushing it off and still playing nice. However after all of the ordeals that he puts her through, when they finally run into each other years later, Nishiyama is is still nice to him and eventually, they become very, very close.\n\n\n\nIt's truly difficult to give this film a fair review because there's so much to be discussed but I prefer to allow the readers to enjoy it with as little spoilers as possible. It was a bit longer than most anime films - standing at a strong 2h 10m- but in that time, I was able to connect with a group of people in an age group close to my own, dealing with personal demons that they refuse to admit exist for a solid majority of the film. Like I said in the title, this is a coming-of-age story, and each of our characters matures at different times through a different situation. I found myself tearing up during some scenes because this film wasn't afraid to get emotional. There's a specific scene that involved Nishiyama and Ishida that completely took me by surprise to me and I was truly at the edge of my seat all the way through it.\n\nAt the same time though, It could be said that some of the scenes where characters spoke to each other were a bit cheesy, and over the top at times. Another thing that I struggled with was keeping up with the first act of the film at times. It seemed like the scenes were kind of scattered all over the place initially, but after a while, you get used to it and realize that the film is just giving you a quick look at these people as children.\n\n\n\nIn the end, A Silent Voice is a remarkable film, and I highly recommend that any of you who watch it share it with all of your friends, because this is one that you don't want to miss. It's the type of film that has you put yourself in the characters' shoes and look at things from their perspective. The subject matter was very important to today's world because bullying happens more and more nowadays, and a film like this can show you just how much bullying can mess with someone's psyche for years and years to come. Although the ending wasn't exactly how I was hoping the film concluded, it still left me with a feeling of satisfaction, and I was happy to see things pan out that way. I'm definitely going to watch this one again, and I'll be copping the Blu-ray."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a fan of animation all my life. It was only natural to move from after school cartoons to more sophisticated anime as I got older. Although, to be honest, not all anime is sophisticated. A lot of it - and a lot of the stuff I choose to watch - is flat out silly. This, however, is not the case for A Silent Voice.\n\nTo the contrary, A Silent Voice is a much different, more serious sort of anime. Which brings me to some content warning: this movie deals with bullying as well as suicidal ideation. Although it is handled well, it can still be upsetting at times.\n\nShoko Nishimiya is the new girl in school and while she looks as normal as everyone else, she has one major difference - she's deaf. Unfortunately, this sets her up for bullying by her classmates, leaving her feeling ostracized and alone. Despite this, Shoko never stops trying to make friends and to be a part of the group. Things escalate and Shoko is eventually transferred to another school in hopes of giving her a better experience. Sadly, this is all too common in our schools these days. Kids can be the cruelest of people at times. Brutal honesty at its harshest.\n\nFast forward to high school. Shoya Ishida, formerly one of Shoko's biggest tormentors, finds himself on the other side of the fence. After helping another loner being harassed by a bully, Shoya decides to search out Shoko in an attempt to redeem his past self.\n\nHe has a long road ahead of him because he was quite awful to Shoko in elementary school. However, years of being a social outcast have changed him. Shoya's no longer able to look others in the eye and has no one he can call a friend. Reuniting with Shoko changes everything for both himself and for Shoko and her family. Slowly, they begin to build a lasting friendship that they never had the chance to start in elementary school.\n\nBeautifully animated, A Silent Voice is mesmerizing both visually and emotionally. I often found myself laughing one moment at one of Tomohiro Nagatsuka's antics and sobbing the next. Every time a red x fell from someone's face, I felt my heart skip with joy for Shoya. Dark, and yet full of hope, this is a movie for families to watch together, or for friends to share with one another. It's all too true to reality which only makes it more of a must-see movie. I saw so much of my own high school days in these characters, making me connect even more to them all in one way or another. Parent or not, teen or not, I think most of us will be able to relate to the story of A Silent Voice."

This movie is one of a few (3-5) movies that make me envy those people from Man In Black, after watching it, the first thing I wanted to do is to use that device that erases your memory and watch it again.\n\nI find it truly amazing, that while other stories crafting worlds, religions, dimensions and even languages in order to enhance the emotional experience and provide new sensations. This movie describe something very real, something that for sure happened more than once (to a certain degree) in the real world.

It shows us how to treat people, how to communicate, how to express ourselves in our own way. It shows us the importance and magic of friendships, how someone who is so terrible can be redeemed, and that life is usually more significant than what we make of it. A Silent Voice explores many different parts of life in an inspirational and heartbreaking way and gets the audience to cheer for someone who at first seems irredeemable."

        "review_detailed_main": "In my opinion, this is one of, if not the most beautiful and pleasing films I have ever watched. This movie is truly a modern masterpiece; a work of art. From the complexity of the gripping story-line, to the astonishing aesthetic, beautiful art style and overall vibe given off by the movie, to the insane twists and turns, it has it all. The use of music in this movie simply adds to the beauty, the range from uplifting songs to songs that add to the dramatic and emotion bringing scenes add so much to the film as a whole. The foreshadowing of the movie is simply astonishing once you watch it multiple times over. The depth of the character's and the means they take upon themselves to find not only each other, but themselves on a deeper level really makes you see a different view on not only your own life, but what others may be experiencing as well. There seemed to be no unnecessary scenes in the movie and every minute of the film was fully engaging. Throughout this movie, I laughed, I cried, I rethought my entire view on various social experiences in my life and I thought of many of the \"what ifs\" that could take place both in the film and my own life. I truly believe this film is a masterpiece and a near perfect movie as a whole, it teaches and demonstrates many life lessons such as the meaning of happiness, resolve, finding your inner self through another, and much more and draws out emotions that not many things can do. For anybody who wants a film that is truly unforgettable, this is the movie for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't even know how many times I tried to write a complex review about this movie. Every time when I sit down to do it, I can't put my thoughts into words. Hopefully I will be successful this time.\n\nKoe no Katachi is a movie about a lot of subject. Here is the story in a nutshell: In the elementary school, Ishida lives his life as he wants to. He is the class clown basically, who does everything to conserve his own world. One day, a new student shows up: a deaf girl, called Nishimiya. She messes up the class life, because she obviously need support from her classmates, which becomes a burden after a short period of time. Ishida, who sees the girl as someone, who upsets the boy's life, start to bully her. Nishimiya's life becomes so horrible, that she has to change school. Clearly, Ishida is the main reason for this, so he gets back what he did to her; his friends start to bully him and everyone is avoiding him. We jump in the time: now Ishida is a high-schooler. He doesn't have any friends and he still carries the weight of what he did to his classmate. He even considers suicide, but life gives him another chance, to be forgiven and finally accept himself.\n\nAs we can see, the story is well-written and complex enough. Now talk about the characters: Ishida is obviously a dislikeable character at the beginning, but as he grows up, he realises what he did and tries everything to make amends. Nishimiya, the victim of the bullying, is the type of girl who is so lovely that makes your heart melt every time you see her. Of course, these are just character templates, but as the movie goes further, we gain insight of their daily lives, feelings and most importantly, their pain. The pain, which was left over from the past. Koe no Katachi's success would be nothing, if the remarkable story didn't have such great characters, like Ishida and Nishimiya. The side characters, naturally, are not as well-written as the main ones, but we still gain a little insight of their ambitions and their feelings too; this is mostly true for the relatives and classmates of the two main characters.\n\nThe art style is unique and beautiful, as we expected from Kyoto Animation. However, I really want to pull out the sounds and music. The sounds are so detailed, that we can't even realise it at the first time; as for the music, I can only say that every time I listen to 'lit(var)', I start to cry against my will. I'm just thinking about it right now, and it's enough to make me emotional. You can imagine how good the music is, if it can make me cry by just listening to it.\n\nAnd last but not least: what is this movie about? When I first thought about it, I wrote something like \"Connections with other people, and depression\". Well, this is still true partly, but from now, I think the main subject is 'forgiving and accepting'. \"Forgiving is easier than forgetting\" - I hear this everywhere. But lets be real: you may forgive something to someone, but you will still carry that scar with you. It doesn't matter how big it is, you have to carry it in your entire life. If the scar is that huge, it can change your personality or ruin your whole life. This is the reason why 'accepting' is even more important than 'forgetting' or 'forgiving'. And this is what the movie taught me. It taught me throughthout tears and pain, but in the most beautiful way I can possibly imagine."

Deaf girl, bully, romance and tragedy ensues. But I always come back. The music, personally, is the best aspect of this film. Kensike Ushio is brilliant, and I listen to their music regularly. But the story, as simple as it is, always makes me feel something. I always feel the same thing, but it's the feeling itself that has me coming back this third time. A Silent Voice is about the innocent cruelty of youth, the way we look back at ourselves and see foolishness, and the responsibility we have to correct our ignorance as adults. This movie is about learning compassion, learning to let people into your life, learning that all humans deserve love, and accepting that no matter how many mistakes you've made, it's never too late to change and never too late to make a difference. This movie always makes me cry."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story of the silent voice, a story about a young man troubled by his past wrongdoings of bullying seeks to find forgiveness in those he has hurt. This story is simple, a guy who troubled another person looks to seek forgiveness from them because they found out what they did was wrong. However, A Silent Voice's execution to this story made it worth my time. First, we need to know that the movie is revolved around a young man, Shouya who bullied Shouko, a deaf girl to the point he became ostracized by his class. That becomes our main driving point on to why Shouya wants to look for redemption.\n\nThe characters of this movie are all abstract and complex, and the director uses very clever cinematography to define which characters have that complexity. The soundtrack becomes one of the focusing points on this story, the piano themes of the characters, Shouko's piano theme became such an immersive piece as it was recorded with the sound of the piano hammers hitting the strings and you could hear all all the vibrations in the wood which were meant to resemble how Shouko's world was like, they were all vibrations and sounds that could be unintelligible but still heard and felt.\n\nOur characters grow throughout each act in the film, each character experiences an epiphany about their lives and begins to change. I would say the buildup to each character's development was done fairly well, although not every character is highlighted to the maximum. The main plot of redemption shifts into something bigger, not only redemption is tackled by the story but themes of love and acceptance play a significant role towards the second and final act of the movie.\n\nOverall A Silent Voice is a great movie to watch, a real tearjerker as well. Its cinematography uses clever shots to show more than meets the eye and paired with its incredible soundtrack, it becomes immersive. The story is simple yet executed with grace. I recommend anyone to watch this movie, even if it is your first or 100th animated film, this movie will be sure to make you feel a wave of emotions."

This could have easy fit in the movie but it would make him a more complex and real person. Shoko get alot of attenuation, but the rest of the group get almost none and some even have changes are detrimental to the character which make no sense.\n\ni followed the author from the first release and am aware of the issues with other parties wanting a different direction for the story (an example is this movie and the english translation changes) the japanese version is slightly better but not by much and the english voice actors dont always match with the characters.\n\nall i can say is \"Yoshitoki Oima you first pubished story is amazing, try not to let other push you around\" and if you like the movie the manga is better but a little darker but asks about moral questions on acceptable behaviors and their effects on peoples lives."

        "review_detailed_main": "A Silent Voice or Koe No Katachi tells the story of a boy named Shoyo who growing up in school, was a mean kid in which he and his friends were at the top of their social hierarchy. One day, a new student joins Shoyo's class, Shouko, a girl who happens to be deaf. Shoyo, being the nasty kid he is constantly bullies her to a point where she leaves and to a point even his friends abandon him knowing that he has gone too far. The story of the movie is set during the present where Shoya is a shell of what he used to be. He has no friends and no will to go on. He decides that this life he is living can only be fixed by making ammends with Shouko and this movie tells the story of his redemption and the relationship these two characters create.\n\nNow, before watching this, I never considered myself an anime sort of guy. I had nothing against it but there were never any places to watch it where I am from. I found this movie on some illegal movie streaming service and I saw Chris Stuckmann review this movie earlier that week so I watched it just to see if it was as good as he says. And holy hell, the moment I finished this movie, I think a switch went off in my head.\n\nThis movie helped me in so many ways in terms of my personality. For one, after watching this movie, I really became interested in Anime and I have watched many great movies and tv shows because of it. It also helped develop my love for film greater than any movie I can remember had. On an even deeper level, the development of Shoya's character helped me realise many things about letting people in and not being afraid to admit, I'm sorry\n\nBut why? Why this movie? There are so many movies out there with simmilar undertones so why did this movie help me. It is because A Silent Voice is so much more than a film about a guy and a deaf girl, it is a masterpiece of character relationship creating. The only way I can describe it is when you watch this movie, you, sitting on your couch become Shoyo, you become so invested in the story, you become personified into this character and you grow just like him.\n\nThe animation of a Silent Voice is probably the best animation I have ever seen and this is coming from a huge animation fan. The way this movie manages light is no short of a triumph. Every frame feels like a painting yet the way the light bounces around each shot is magical. One thing I love about the animation is how they use the background around them. Every thing feels as if it is 3D in a way in relation to the characters, not to us of course but you can see the depth of how the environment reacts to the characters.\n\nI watched the dub, I know sue me but can I just say, the voice actors for this movie were bloody terrific. Especially the two main characters of Shoyo & Shouko. They each brought so much to the table and you believed every word they said.\n\nDon't be fooled though, this movie in my opinion isn't a love story, it may look like that on the poster but I don't see this movie as a love story. This is a story of redemption and friendship. This is the story of a kid who feels like he has nothing to live for climbing and trying his god damn hardest trying to forgive himself for what he did and in the end, the result will make you cry\n\nWhy is this movie my favourtie movie while films in my top 10 include the likes of masterpieces and classics such as Pulp Fiction, American Psycho & Midsommar. This movie, the reason this film beats them is 1) I cried for the first time watching a movie &- 2) This was one of the most real feeling movies I had ever watched What I mean by this is that you completley buy in to every single characters dynamic and what they are striving for. They all feel like real characters. Even my number 2 movie made me think for a minute what each of my characters true role in the film was. A Silent Voice however, captures so much humanity\n\nA Silent Voice receives a 10/10"

The characters were well-developed (Soko was SO LIKEABLE, Ishinta wasn't likeable at the start of the movie, but when he got older he realized his mistakes and I kinda liked him!). Gladly, that movie didn't include many fantastic elements. It was so realistic, especially the bulling scenes, they were portrayed really well. Some scenes were kinda emotional. The first 20 minutes of the movie were so intense emotionally. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was, the duration (it was too long). Anyway, it was a nice movie that it totally deserves more attention. Last but not least, the ending was unexpected."

Hope that was enough to get your attention towards this movie. If yes, read on ---- It's a Japanese movie that talks about bullying, friendship, forgiveness, social anxiety, etc., with the core message being 'All of us should try and understand each other better'. Unlike my previous recommendation, this one is more realistic, about real life and very relatable characters. Characters that we might have grown up with, characters whose shoes we might have been in. It shows that us humans have the capacity to be good and do good, while showing that we're all imperfect/flawed in various ways.\n\n---- Should you watch this movie?\n\nWhen it released, people apparently debated if this one was better or if Kimi No Na Wa/Your Name was. And, clearly, those numbers ^ indicate that this movie meant A WHOLE LOT to SO MANY PEOPLE. If you liked Your Name, you might as well watch this one and decide for yourself. The one thing that I'd ask you to be mindful of though, is that comparing these movies with each other is like comparing.... Inception and.... Pursuit of Happyness?...if that's a good analogy? Please be mindful of the fact that just because anime LOOKS the same, doesn't mean they're all the same. The plot determines what sort of a genre the content falls under, much like the case with any other 'regular' movie.\n\nIt's a really good movie, but would i give it a 94% ? Eeeh...i don't know about that. But that's just me. Clearly millions of people thought it was an AMAZING movie, and maybe you'd feel the same way. People apparently also louved the Piano score throughout this movie and say that it brought out so many emotions in them (Look up this score from the OST called Lit) PS: I really liked how they made the use of an \"X\" to portray people who aren't in this guy's circle. Very new, haven't seen anything like this before.\n\nCheck it out, it's on Netflix. If you watch and really like it, I'd like to know why and what it meant to you. If you have kids in schools, yep, them and their friends should totally get together for this one."

Although it involves a little defect, the style make me feel nice and catch my eyes. The background is about student's stuff during school time, major point is about bully and sympathy. I could say the leading lady is so beautiful and so kawaii, I suggest the movie makers can involve some beautiful ending more. Like they got married or indicated the leading characters fall in love finally. Sometimes someone likes a open ending, but sometimes someone wants a perfect ending."

        "review_title": "As Sincerely Hard-Hitting as it Gets",
        "review_detailed_main": "When approaching the subject of bullying and depression, there aren't many films that tackle said subject nearly as well A Silent Voice. Released in the middle of the 2010 decade, this film is often regarded as one of the most poetic looks into teenage harassment for its intriguing characters and themes of overcoming personal fears and hurdles. The main storyline revolves around a deaf grade school student named Shoko Nishimiya who is bullied mercilessly by Shoya Ishida, and years later in high school, he sets out to make amends with the girl.\n\nAs a character, Shoya lost what it meant to truly feel like a human being due to his past bully persona and how it messed him up emotionally, which is something anyone can relate to growing up acting mean to others. It's through Shoko that his goal to be a better person becomes stronger and stronger, especially since she tries to live life with a smile on her face in spite of her past trauma and disdain for herself. The past can often hurt, but the way to overcome it is to make a better future and be the best human being you can be, even if you can't always please everyone. Through Shoya's teen years, he either makes new friends like the naive Tomohiro and Shoko's responsible sister Yuzuru, or former peers from his school who either bullied Shoko with Shoya or were genuinely kind to her. The most notable of these has to be Noaka, since she still holds a grudge towards Shoko for being different and is a great representation of people who refuse to grow past a certain point in their lives and continue harassing others to get their way, unlike the sincere people Shoya meets in his life.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the cinematography really ads a special colorful aesthetic to the visuals, especially since the movie is quite harmonious in how it displays the effects of childhood trauma and teen depression. While the scenes can often come off as a little too bright, the filmmakers still cleverly find subtle transitions between the past and present to show just how conflicting Shoya becomes to himself and the people around him. It almost feels like if the movie was live-action, all the rich beauty would be lost in a realistic environment, since animation is able to emulate the real world in ways that are more visually enticing than the common day lives of real humans. Also, the voice cast did a wonderful job bringing their characters to life through monotone line deliveries and distinctive characteristics. The little details in their voices, like Shoko's almost robotic sounding voice or Shoya's horrific gasps, are extra little bits of detail that help distinguish them from most leads in movies like this, providing a good amount of personality and even relatable gestures.\n\nNeedless to say, A Silent Voice is one of the few teen dramas that manages to successfully blend pessimism and optimism through themes of isolation, bullying, mental health and growing up through honesty and care. Just because you made poor mistakes some time in your life doesn't mean you can never change, and arguably the best way to do that is acknowledging your past whilst progressing forward in becoming more friendly and sincere in your age. And yes, that may include accepting others for who they are on in the inside, regardless if they're impaired or not."

Social media are teeming with inspirational quotes and posters about change and acceptance, but true change isn't as easy as posting a picture or leaving a comment and it seldom comes without a price. When you look in the mirror, do you really see the change you crave for from the world? When was the last time you befriended someone you initially disliked, the last time you talked to someone outside your immediate social circle, someone of different background, race, religion, belief system? A Silent Voice carries that message and asks us to cast aside the mask and truly step into the world. During its two hour runtime, it made me cry more times than I'm willing to admit. It is a movie of unparalleled beauty and quiet bravery, a movie that speaks honestly about acceptance of others as well as ourselves, about disability, social hierarchy, trauma, guilt, isolation, self-loathing, the unspoken sacrifices we're asked to make in order to grow up, the bleak childhood pictures that haunt us well into adulthood, the pain of causing pain, the bonds we make and the losses we suffer."

You can ENJOY it without focusing so much.\n\nSecond, there are some FUNNY moments which are good enough.\n\nThird, you watch the world through the perspective of an INTROVERT which i watched very less in movies. This movie shows you a journey of a boy from a bully to an introvert to an extrovert.\n\nNow, let's talk about some negative points :-\n\nFirst, if you try to find LOGIC in movie, so sorry you got disappointment. There's no logic in the movie. That's why I told you to just enjoy without using your brain. Just go with the flow of emotions.\n\nSecond, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is so bad like how can a girl be that much innocent. And how a bully transforms so much. These questions arise due to weak character development.\n\nThird, it is so DRAMATIC."

The animation it self was absolutely as expected and it got me in tears between family, friendship and relationships. Its message of bullying, karma and isolation really had a reflection in life which made me really love this film. One thing I remember when I stepped out of the cinema with teary eyes was that there were small adaptations to the film which left some character development for other characters and which had some funny panels from the manga I was expecting in the film which never showed because it would of never made sense. Although the approach to shorten the story from the manga really fit and didn't have any plot holes knowing that they cut out a few things and conflict between characters (but these were still shown).\n\nAfter reading and watching this. It has been hands down my number 1 and will probably always be my number 1 film/animation."

I would have liked for example, if it have given more time to explore Naoka Ueno's character, which I found as the most realistic one of the bunch.\n\nTo sum up, a lot of people seem to love this movie, so you probably should give it a try, but to that I would attach a trigger warning, if you were the victim of abuse as a child or if you know someone who was."

I for one I'm only 18 and I still don't know myself. This movie what the main character sees when he looks at other people i believe it to be a similar kind of thing, we all have people we look at and would even think to talk to. A silent voice focuses alot on destiny the type of belief that some people are meant to be and it doesn't matter where you are in life, how far, how close; you will find your way to the one you're meant to be with - spend the rest of your days with."

        "review_detailed_main": "Words alone cannot describe how much I was hooked onto this dramatic story.\n\n'Koe no Katachi' (or A Silent Voice) revolves around Shoya, a 12-year-old boy in junior high who is at odds with a disabled girl named Shoko in his class since she is unable to speak clear sentences and can only use Sign Language to communicate. When one of his teasings finally gets out of hand, it affects his social life greatly as an older teen. Hoping to seek redemption and repent over his past, he finds Shoko again years later and tries to make amends for himself and those he hurt.\n\nAfter seeing Makoto Shinkai's 'Your Name,' I see what Shinkai meant when he described this film as an interesting piece of work that he cannot easily replicate. Creator Yoshitoki Oima and director Naoko Yamada sure brought these characters to life with both depth and emotion. Even with the use of Sign Language, it has this sense of realism as it's being shown. The imagery involving physical abuse, suicide, and inner turmoil were things I couldn't imagine be pulled off this dramatically well in an anime film. For a runtime of a little over two hours, it's definitely a must-see from beginning to end. Whether you're into Japanese animation or not, the story is what really matters as it can pertain to real-life as well.\n\nShoya's predicament had me reflecting on my own life at a young age too. Through pride and vanity comes damaging repercussions on one's own outlook. I had my share of regrets and if I could take any of them back, I wouldn't hesitate. It sure had me thinking of the social follies in some people.\n\nThe moral: The past cannot be changed, but discover that there's more to life than just hurting those around oneself by starting anew."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been meaning to review this for ages but I've been putting it off because I'm not sure where to start.\n\nWhen I first heard the premise, I had an immediate idea of how the plot would develop and how it would end. And I was basically right. It went exactly where I thought it would. However, when it reached the point that I thought would be the end, we were actually only one third of the way through.\n\nThis is a movie that accepts no easy answers, it takes no short cuts and does not need you to meet it half way.\n\nAn ambitious movie for sure, I've seen a ton of movies about alienated protagonists or characters dealing with bullies but never one where we get to see things from the bully's perspective and see a person deal with being the real bad guy with all the consequences. And these consequences are largely interpersonal not material.\n\nA story of redemption to an extent but I would be shortchanging it to not point out that it is so much more than that. It reminds of Anomalisa (so much keeps reminding me of Anomalisa) in how it uses slight but conspicuous stylization to represent visually how we perceive other and I know that sounds pretentious but this movie is anything but.\n\nIt's hard to put this film's exact tone into words. It's breezy and restrained but with something powerful always simmering beneath the surface. That doesn't quite do it justice but that's the best I got. There's a fascinating attention to apparently trivial details like how the protagonist abuses his mechanical pencil (didn't we all?) and glimpses of the strange man who turns out to be the step-father. They're ultra-subtle about it but I think anxiety about his mother remarrying may have motivated his behavior to an extent.\n\nMy point is that, watching this, I really felt I was looking into a real world with real people where even the minor characters feel like someone you could meet but there is still the same vibrancy that ol' Hayao wishes he could manage it the art direction.\n\nit's a movie that lingers in the mind for a long time afterword. There is an interesting amount of coincidences and there is so much you could discuss afterwards. It also serves as a frightening reminder of how far the Nipponese are willing to go to keep shoes touching carpets. Haven't they ever head of vacuuming?\n\nAnd the deaf girl (I never remember names), well I will say that she is adorable. I might have a deaf fetish now. She doesn't actually have much of a personality but that isn't a mark against the movie. It isn't really about her. She embodies a somewhat old fashioned vision of disabled people in that she has this Christ like level of benevolence, patience and forgiveness. Again, I'm not condemning the movie, it's just interesting.\n\nOne more thing: did anyone else think the mother and the sister were the same person for a while?\n\nI think this is my 2nd favorite Japanimated movie so far, after Grave of the fireflies."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is seldom a movie with such complexity and nuance as Naoko Yamada's Koe No Katachi, known in English as A Silent Voice. Right off the bat, the English title loses much in translation. A direct translation would actually be The Shape of Voice, which, as the movie progresses, is a much more descriptive and meaningful title. At its most basic plot point, it is the story of two young people who are dealing with the ramifications of bullying, self-hatred, and a search for redemption and acceptance. In the opening scene, teenager Shoya Ishida is climbing the ledge of a bridge, intending to commit suicide. He's interrupted by the sound of children playing with fireworks. He stops what he's doing, and then the film launches into a series of flashbacks.\n\nAs a 6th-grader, Shoya is a rambunctious kid, easily bored and always looking for action. Then one day, a new student, Shoko Nishimiya, comes to class. Shoko happens to be Deaf, and carries a notebook with her so that she can communicate with her hearing classmates. The class accepts her with curiosity, eager to be her \"helper\" as she goes through the school day. But as children are wont to do at that age, the classmates soon tire of their new responsibility and their interest and curiosity soon wanes. Students slowly begin to take frustration out on Shoko, including Shoya. In fact, Shoya becomes relentless in his bullying, ripping out Shoko's hearing aids and tossing them into the water. The bullying becomes so bad, in fact, that Shoko's mother complains to the school, and the teacher demands someone be punished. Naturally, all fingers point to Shoya. His mother, a single mom, has to dig into her savings to repay Shoko's mother for the lost hearing aids, and to beg for forgiveness for her son's behavior. From then on, Shoya becomes the brunt of everyone's ire. He has become a pariah, labeled the school bully. Meanwhile, Shoko tries desperately to befriend him and teach him Sign Language. He wants nothing to do with her. Shoko's mother removes her from the school and has her placed in a different school.\n\nAnd so begins their journey.\n\nAs time passes, Shoya does what he can to make amends for his behavior in the past. He takes Sign Language lessons. He searches for Shoko to see if she can ever forgive him. He isolates himself from everyone at school and refuses to look anyone in the eye. He works to earn money to pay his mother back. It is at this point he had made that decision to end his own life, luckily stopping to reflect.\n\nWhat he doesn't know is that Shoko has her own demons to fight, part of which has to do with her family's reaction to her hearing loss. She is the one deaf child in her family. Her sister and grandmother learn signs, but her mother does not. And Shoko is continually made to feel inferior. She keeps a pleasant smile on her face, trying desperately not to cause anyone unhappiness. Secretly, though, she is filled with self-loathing and wonders if the world would be better off without her.\n\nWhen the two finally reconnect, they are still hampered by their own self-recriminations. Their journey has only begun.\n\nYamada is a master at using symbolic references. Everything in this movie has layers of meaning. Shoko's notebook is a physical representation of her desire to be accepted. A koi pond figures prominently in the movie, referencing our two protagonists' harsh journey to find meaning. Daisies grow defiantly through the cracks in cement, literally demonstrating the blossoming of their self-discovery and the resilience of youth.\n\nIt's a beautifully orchestrated movie, utilizing sight-and sound-to convey all the complexities of life. In fact, there are several scenes where the music is discordant and slightly muted, almost mechanical. Maybe it's a way of demonstrating the way that Shoko hears. But it's also a way of demonstrating how both Shoko and Shoya feel about themselves.\n\nWithout a doubt, this is one of the best movies made in 2017. While it is a fantasy of sorts, it is well grounded in the realities of adolescence, and should be considered for serious review. It is certainly a coming of age movie, encompassing all of the angst that teenagers go through as they navigate relationships. At first glance, several of the characters seem almost flat-or like a caricature. There's the pretty girl, the mean girl, the tom boy, the cool kid, the wannabe. These are the typical roles kids take on in school. But Yamada reminds us that no one is a caricature. We are all multifaceted beings with our own personal hopes and fears, and within this film we see those hopes and fears played out again and again, sometimes as comic relief. Sometimes with tragic consequences.\n\nAt the heart of this movie is this desire to be heard. But before one can be heard, one has to stop and listen. Both Shoya and Shoko are trying to communicate and find forgiveness, but before that can happen they both need to learn how to forgive themselves and they both need to learn how to listen to each other. Really listen. Really see. Because voice isn't always audible. Voice takes shape in a number of ways. And part of growing up is finding that voice and sharing that voice with others. Yamada asks us \"What do you sound like to others? What shape is your voice?\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Review By Kamal K\n\nKyoto Animation again brings great animation on to the table; The glittering eyes, cutesy-moe seifuku characters, great background, and much more. It is one of the finest animation quality out there, and if romance genre is your cup of tea, you will probably like the movie. Even if you don't like romance, it is not a disappointing film.\n\nThe animation quality of Koe no Katachi is just tremendously amazing; Kyoto animation with a film budget definitely get things glittering don't they.\n\nThis is a story about the importance of listening and the effects of not doing so. It something we can all understand and learn from.\n\nThe plot evoked a roller coaster of emotions, some easy to emphasis with, and others MADE easy to resonate with! The plot starts vigorously but with a pace you could easily keep up with. It slightly stagnates to build context until the plot's climax - which got my spine tingling - a climax that I don't want to ruin for the unsuspecting! But the stagnation is what stops it from getting a 9/10 for it's plot. The strategic retreat from the plot's focus enabled for a good few laughs and set up what was to come very well, but it turned a 2 hours movie into what felt like a 3 hour movie, where I was anticipating the end mid way though as it seemed like they had reached a happily ever after. It somewhat ruined the experience for me and I felt like it could have been executed better by adding some more romantic develop (because I felt more pity for the characters than love Social anxiety, Suicide, self loath/pity, forgiveness/acceptance, attachment, the desire/difficulty to be connect and most of all the complexity of human communication and emotions - all covered in this Movie as you delve into a journey to unravel a facade to find emotions we all contain and hide from others to void the difficulty of conveying them. We follow a character who closes his mind and refuses not to listen to create his own cynical narrative and in it we learn voice (koe) - or communication - has many shapes and forms (Katachi) and that it's shallow to think it's all monotonous."

I found this movie scrolling through the basic IMDb list and watched it. Words cannot describe the experience. I cried almost every minute of the movie. It related to me, the adolescence of childhood and my experiences with it. Nothing is more cruel yet beautiful than childhood. The innocence and profound realism in it. The soundtrack grips yet and never lets go, taking you into the spiral of emotion this film offers. The dialogue and plot is realistic and painfully replicable. Nothing about this film is a mistake, which is why it earns its score. This movie will pull you into a different headspace and make you adapt to how cruel we humans can be yet how beautiful this cruelness can be. A beautiful depiction of mental illness and struggles with self-love. It will be your favorite."

The themes about friendship and guilt in this film were potrayed perfectly. Shoya is definitely one of my favorite starring characters easily. This movie will make you happy, it will make you laugh, and it will make you cry at individual moments in the movie.

I love how the film shows that people who did bad can turn things around and work hard to earn others' trust and compassion.\n\nThis is a MUST SEE for not just teenagers and young adults, but I believe it is also for an older audience as well.

Anyone who has been a victim of bullying, dealt with depression, attempted or contemplated suicide, felt like an unnecessary burden to their loved ones, who felt ostracized, suffered from loneliness, felt like a loser, suffered from social anxiety, tried to maintain a perfect facade, or had done an act so cruel it haunts you for the rest of your life, then you could relate to this movie. I warn you, you're going to cry and I'm not a crybaby myself. Two minutes after this movie ends, you're going to still be thinking about it. Don't go in thinking it's a romance. It's about redemption and learning to forgive the hardest person in the world to: yourself."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"A Silent Voice\" is simply an astonishing film. A movie that deals with themes of bullying with serious maturity. And even though I wasn't bullied in school, I can still appreciate the movie for that.\n\nThe movie centers around a man who in elementary bullied a deaf girl (Shoko) until she moved away. Now, several years later, he attempts to redeam his actions. The movie deals in heavy themes of bullying and suicide in a way no other has, as well as in a very grounded and believable way. As we sympathize with the main character, following him on his journey. As in the beginning, he was simply unaware of how much damage he was doing to her, and not understanding her. But once he realized that, she had moved away. From there, his friends shun him, and he becomes an outcast, unable to look at people in the eyes, has trouble communicating with people, and even contimplating suicide.\n\nIt's a very real depiction of how actions can change people. And during his plan on suicide, he decides to tie up every loose end, including giving Shoko her notebook back (the one she communicated with), and also apologizing for everything, and asking they can be friends. However, after giving it back, his plans on suicide change.\n\nThe supporting characters are also great, but underdeveloped. And that's my only gripe.\n\nI also really like the animation. From the character models, to the lighting, to the backgrounds, it's beautiful to look at, and doesn't dissapoint.\n\nThe movie is an emotional, heart-wrenching masterpiece. A movie that does something new by following the bully, and not the victim. As we follow his journey, his regret, and his tramatic expierences. And excellently unconventional romance, and just a damn good movie, a movie that really surprised me. It's a movie better than most, and in my opinion, maybe the best anime film."

The emotion that resonates from the film is outstanding as you truly do feel all the thoughts and emotions of the characters that all culminates in a superb ending. And the relationship between the girl and the boy was done excellently with all the runtime being used effectively to tell their story. This is a movie of emotion and of love and if you're looking to feel that, then this is the movie for you."

Not only is this, my favourite film of 2017 (yes, it's better than Coco), or my favourite animated film of the decade, but my favourite film of all time with The Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2 in 2nd, the toy story franchise (including 4) in 3rd, Wall-e in 4th etc. This an underrated masterpiece that I couldn't recommend enough, except for thoses under 13.\n\nTo those at Kyoto animation, alive or dead, thank you for making this beautiful experience that I stays true to the original manga that is also my favourite manga of all time. Me and my others will cherish this until the day we die. I hope your all still okay...\ud83d\udc9d"

This movie is so sad and very heart warming.\n\nThe screenplay is another huge advantage as we don't always know what's going to happen next. The music is amazing. Especially \"qut\", \"slt\" and \"vignette\" are so good that I added them to my regular playing.\n\nAnimation is just stunning. The might be one of the most beautiful anime's I have seen. The symbolism in the movie is also really good.\n\nShoya and Shoko give each other a reason to live.\n\nThis is one of the movies you wish they didn't end. I can't get enough of Shoko. Wish I had a girlfriend like her. We all need a friend like Nagatsuka. Life would be great when you have a sister like Yuzuru in it.\n\nThe main problem however is those flashback scenes without context making it hard to comprehend what just happened but apart from that, this movie true gem capturing us throughout it's runtime."

All the small details work extremely nicely to build the world. The characters are of course the centre point of the film, and they are amazing, they are written extremely well and the development of these characters is well paced and just terrific to watch. Now I don't really have many negatives, maybe that the timing was off and about half way through the plot seemed to lack a sense of direction...but in the end it all works out brilliantly and becomes incredibly emotional. I do think that the ending wasn't quite as emotional as something that takes place earlier in the film. Which isn't necessarily bad but I do enjoy when the final climax of the movie is the most jaw dropping part. I would really recommend this movie to anyone, there is a lot to learn from this!"

For those that connect with the two titular main characters who've dealt with these issues throughout their lives, it will absolutely hit home and will pull on your emotional heartstrings. Even though it is a more simple movie with a generic dramatized plot, it was excellently well-paced and constantly made you wonder how much worse or better the characters lives would become. Every scene felt much-needed and the progression of the plot was a consistent natural buildup up to the tipping point of the film that will lead to an intense cathartic outburst. But for those who aren't interested if the plot itself was meticulously and well-thought out, and want an alluring coming-of-age story that will make you empathize with the characters to the point of constant lamentation, then this is an absolute must-watch."

The story's theme revolves around forgiveness; those who learn to forgive themselves and others end up more content with their lives. The characters are relatable, and the voice acting is incredible. In both the original and dubbed versions, the voice actors convey the raw emotion of the film. The animation is beautiful, and every tiny detail is illustrated and consistent. The effort the filmmakers put into this movie is amazing. The background music is only used in key scenes to help carry the film's emotion. Overall, this is a beautiful, heartwrenching movie about romance, forgiveness, and moving forward."

Every aspect of the movie is nice and the story is a lot near to the reality which makes it different from most of the Anime as most of them are fantasy or science fiction but this one is not. The movie tells us about what true friendship means, need of friends in life and a lot more life related stuffs and lessons."

        "review_detailed_main": "I found this quite different from the other anime movies I've seen. Most of the ones I've seen involve archetypes. But this one focused in-depth on character. While there is a clear protagonist, Shoya Ishida, the film is a character study of a bunch of high school kids. Sometimes I feel like the complex emotions they were going through and how they were handling it were much too much for high school kids, but let's roll with it.\n\nA huge theme among what all of the kids were feeling was a sense of worthlessness. The present day of the film deals with the repercussions of elementary school whence the deaf girl was bullied in school. Shoko Nishimiya, the deaf girl, seemed at first to be the angelic archetype, who was ever-forgiving and always trying to befriend her tormentors. But she suffers from deep-seated self-blame and views herself as causing all the problems around her. Shoyo Ishida bullied her at first, and later when he was heavily chastised, he got bullied himself, and eventually ostracized. And he also develops some of that nihilism that Shoko Nishimiya suffered from. This is probably why they are able to connect and understand each other as they start to become friends.\n\nBut then there are other characters also involved with the bullying. Naoka Ueno can't stand Shoko Nishimiya's apologizing because part of her does feel the guilt. Miki Kawai may not have directly bullied anyone, but she participated in it just the same, but she denies she did anything wrong and gets intensely upset at any accusation. These were the two that stand out. And these two are among the group of kids who have to learn to accept their faults and learn to love themselves despite those faults. Although this is the challenge with which Shoyo and Shoko both have the hardest time. And while they make progress, they're not necessarily all the way there by the end of the movie. But when I say much too much for high school kids, I think the progress that they do make was progress many adults don't make. Maybe I'm not giving them enough credit, but I'm glad they made all that progress for the sake of a cathartic experience for the viewer.\n\nI was expecting a cheesy romance like Studio Ghibli's Whisper of the Heart...or you know any Studio Ghibli movie that treats love between children as epic romances. But this was a grounded tale, which focused on the importance of self-growth and self-love. And it was a truly touching film."

The themes and messages that A Silent Voice sends to it's viewers are essential, and ones that everyone should experience for them selves thorough this film, and maybe even through your everyday life.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the movie is one of the best looking pieces of animation ever produced by Kyoto Animation, and possibly one of the best ever made in general. The film is accompanied by gorgeous sound and editing along with a fantastic score. The film is filled with beautiful uses of lighting and color that make it's scenes of nature and just everyday life something to behold.\n\nThe film isn't perfect it does have its flaws, but very few at that. Taking from Chris Stuckmans review of A Silent Voice, the movie does feature some scenes that feel unnecessary at times that can add to its long runtime of 2 hours of 10 minutes( though I personally didn't mind it).\n\nOverall just go watch the movie"

I didn't realize that he's not looking at them in the face. It would be more meaningful to do his POV all the time. There are so many emotional blows in this movie. I would like to wrap up the plot a little quicker in the second half. It is so emotionally pounding that it feels a bit too much for too long. It has some amazing emotional points.

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me preface this review by saying I'm not generally a fan of Japanese animation. Maybe it's just a lack of exposure. A point about about this movie that interested me was that it involves a deaf character. As I've been learning sign language for awhile what they would do with that characteristic. While it does factor in, the movie on the whole is just a great film about the difficulties we can all have with fitting in, expressing ourselves, and how valuable friendship can be. You forget that it's a foreign film, animated, etc and just become engrossed in the emotional story being portrayed onscreen. There are a number of backgrounds displayed by different characters and I believe everyone will be able to relate to at least a couple. Ultimately, I hope everyone comes out of watching this film with a bit more empathy for the people around them, even if they don't seem very relatable at first. Great movie. And--it's on Netflix right now!"

From the very first second, until the very end, it perforates them with a thousand harpoons and pulls with the force of a neutron star.

If I have one critique, it's that there's too much crying, which ultimately detracts from the emotional impact said crying is supposed to have. Nevertheless, this is hands down one of the best animated films I've ever seen, rivalling the fabled Disney films of yore. There's very few things that I would approve of more. Drop whatever it is you're doing and watch this."

The film's breathtaking animation and captivating background music elevate its storytelling to an extraordinary level, making it an unforgettable cinematic experience.\n\nThe story follows Shoya Ishida, a young man tormented by guilt after bullying his deaf classmate, Shoko Nishimiya, in elementary school. As he seeks redemption and tries to reconnect with Shoko, the film explores the profound impact of bullying and the long, painful road to forgiveness. The characters are beautifully developed, their emotions raw and genuine, pulling you into their world and making you feel every ounce of their pain and joy.\n\nThe BGM is nothing short of spectacular. Each piece perfectly complements the scenes, enhancing the emotional depth and leaving a lasting impression. The animation is stunning, with meticulous attention to detail that brings the story to life in a visually mesmerizing way.\n\n\"Koe no Katachi\" broke my heart and made me cry more than once. Its poignant depiction of the characters' struggles and growth is both moving and inspiring. This film deserves an Oscar for its brilliance and emotional impact, far more than films like \"The Boss Baby.\" It's a travesty that \"Koe no Katachi\" was overlooked and robbed of the recognition it truly deserves.\n\nIf you haven't seen \"Koe no Katachi,\" it's a must-watch. It's a powerful, beautifully crafted film that will stay with you long after the credits roll."

        "review_title": "A Deeply Personal Experience",
        "review_detailed_main": "What I had originally expected to be a sappy clich\u00e9 anime story about bullying and disability awareness ended up being a truly profound film that connected with me on a deeply personal level. My perspective of this film is bound by my own past experiences and regrets to such an extent that I honestly don't expect anyone else to feel the same as I do when I watch it. Rather than unpack all of that complex emotional baggage, I will attempt to summarize what I love about this movie and what it means to me without spoiling too much of the story.\n\nThematically this film covers a lot of serious topics including, as I previously mentioned, bullying and the awareness of disabilities, as well as various other communication barriers. On top of this, the film also takes an in depth look at the value of close friendships, the importance of self-confidence and self-worth, and the idea of redemption and forgiveness. All of these themes and more are handled with maturity and sensitivity with respect for the subject matter.\n\nThe story and plot has a natural progression driven by the actions of the characters and it helps make everything seem more authentic. The characters feel like real people with real emotions and real flaws; the child characters act realistically like children. The protagonist in particular is a character who I strongly empathize with, mostly because I relate to him far more than I care to admit; in fact, I can't remember the last time I identified with a fictional character as much as Shoya Ishida. The way he struggles to look people in the eye when speaking to them and the manner in which he awkwardly pushes people away is something I personally can understand.\n\nThe general presentation is both professional and purposeful. The design and framing of the animation is reminiscent of a live-action film with its blurred backgrounds and occasional faux-camera movements. The piano score is beautiful and complements the visuals nicely. I love how the recurring motifs of the various flowers and the koi fish add subtle symbolism to the events of the film. I am also glad that the music is not overbearing or inappropriate and that the director decides to keep things quiet during the more crucial scenes - a choice which allows the viewer to absorb the background ambiance and appreciate the moment more.\n\nHonestly, you should ignore my rating and just focus on this: A Silent Voice is a movie that affects me on a personal level because it shines a light on important issues and those issues just so happens to be ones I have dealt with and continue to struggle with today. Any film that can tell a genuine story chock full of serious themes without falling for sentimental overkill or uninspired tropes is one that I believe should be celebrated. I would recommend this film to just about everyone, even people who believe they may not like anime movies for whatever reason. This is a truly unique and encouraging film that still moves me whenever I watch it and it is one of my favorite films of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "A beautiful story about friendship, family, love, human-relationships. I have to say, this movie really took my breath away, in both sad and good ways. I would always get punched in the feels every few minutes, either crying my eyes out or laughing with the characters.\n\nThe depth that the writers of the manga and movie created both regarding the characters and the plot is so enriching and fresh considering the past few animes I've watched.\n\nI love how this story doesn't have its sole focus on romance but more about how human the characters are, probably encompassing one of the best character creations out there. It's spectacular how realistic and heartbreakingly detailed the creators put into the character's personality, how they see the world, and their values. I especially am in love with the main character himself, Sho-chan, and how the producers revolved the story from his eyes. Truly am amazed at how soul-touching it is to see things from his point of view. The ending at that is very satisfying, I cried a long with him as a big change happens to him.\n\nCredits to the animators! You have to admit that the story would be different if the production value is altered a bit. They truly bring life to the story. As I truly like watching stunning animations, I fell in love with this style immediately. The subtle 3D effect, the way that \"camera focus\" was used on a basis here, and the camera shake that makes the story come to life.\n\nProps to the director and team of the movie. Has to be one of my favourites. And props to you all for choosing to watch this movie. As an emotional crybaby, this movie made me cry legit every 20 minutes or so, so take my word and this will become one of your new favourite movies!"

Having taught middle school kids for over forty years, I was able to identify with the angst, the abusiveness, the anger of the characters. Bullying is at the center of this film. It starts when a deaf girl comes into the classroom. The kids immediately begin to resent that she is gettin special treatment and they are expected to bridge the language gap. She has speech but has had no training in communication skills and can only express herself with a note pad. In the class is a boy who is a walking time bomb. He taunts and literally attacks her at one point. They also take her hearing aids (she has a tiny bit of hearing) and destroy them or throw them out the window. She tries to befriend people but because it is awkward, they turn on her. Now we move ahead a few years and see the results of the previous events. We focus mostly on the boy who treated her so badly. He is trying to come to grips with his previous actions. Anyway, this is an extraordinary anime with striking animation.\n\nDoes this review contain spoilers?\n\nYes No Submit."

This is one of the challenges that \"A Silent Voice\" has to deal with it as our main character, Ishida, bullied a deaf girl when he was younger.\n\nHowever, this film succeeds in this whilst also tackling deep themes such as depression, guilt and bullying. One thing this movie avoids falling into is being overly melodramatic. There is some drama and some romance but they are not the central theme. I appreciated that the film remains focused on the problems that Ishida and the deaf girl, Shoko, are dealing with. There are also side characters ranging from the likeable to the unlikeable but even the unlikeable ones have a sort of redemption arc as well.\n\nThe story being told is just so engaging and seeing Ishida and Shoko trying to overcome their issues was just so wonderful. I was almost brought to tears near the end of this film.\n\nThis is also thanks to the phenomenal music score and the gorgeous animation.\n\nA Silent Voice is a film that will always remain in my mind whenever I think of anime films. It still baffles me though that Oscar picked \"Boss Baby\" over this amazing movie.\n\nFlipping Boss Baby!!!\n\nA Silent Voice is a stunning movie and I highly recommend people give it a watch."

I didn't regret watching and even encourage others to watch. It is based on a girl who wore hearing aids but went through bullying, the children have all grew up, one kid that used to bully her had grew up and he is more mature minded now. He still regret how he behave in his past when he was a kid, but now all grown up and want to re learn from his mistakes, he make efforts to learn sign language and built up courage to become a better person, the story goes on of them all finding each other and begin to form friendship again and everyone no longer holding on to the heavy weight of pressure but to finally feel fullfilled and resolved the matters and accepted a peaceful date encounter for them."

This one really just hits. I didn't expect it to be as heartbreaking as it can be. I came fully unprepared watching A Silent Voice and still to this very moment of writing this review, my heart is still beating fast for all the pain and suffering these characters had to endure that were too attached to my own well-being. The fact that you can actually relate to each of these characters and truly understand their flaws is out of this world. This one really has an immersive amount of writing that just works. It takes a great amount of talent, blood, and sweat to be able to produce a movie as beautiful as this. It is a film where you can learn something from. The characters are all uniquely their own; relatable and they all feel real.\n\nThe two protagonists mirror each other's burdens in life- it's like Bergman's Persona that comes from a tortured feeling of guilt, regret, and suffering. It's a story of transformation: a chance to forgive, to grow, mature, and be kinder to people as well as dealing with problems rather than wanting to end your life."

        "review_detailed_main": "Each and every shortcoming this movie has is made up tenfold by the sheer quantity and volume of emotional depth it is capable of presenting. Not a second of time is wasted in this movie. The opening immediately hits you in the feelings and the movie never lets up for a second. Every moment, piece of dialogue, and character serves a purpose that the movie would not be the same without. The reincorporation and payoffs this movie provides are subtle, while still being meaningful and powerful in their effect. Each character is unique, memorable, and perfectly realized. Even the smallest and most trivial exchanges between characters are loaded with emotion and purpose. The pacing is remarkably efficient for a two hour movie and there is never a dull moment. The animation is beautiful and eye catching, with the environments and expressions being particularly note worthy. The editing and cinematography is sublime and artistic, always adding to a scene drastically. The medium of animation is fully justified through the series artistic choices that would simply be impossible in a live action format. The music is incredible and dynamic, and may be the best part of the movie. All of this together makes for one of the most genuine and heartfelt experiences in cinema."

We should also respect people even if they are disabled. In the movie, Shoya bullied Shouko and he realised his mistake when others started bullying him too. Both Shoya and Shouko were kind of alike both of them hated themselves for who they are, and tried to kill themselves.\n\nI really cried when Shouko tried to do suicide and Shoya saved him and fell off the building himself.\n\nShouko and Shoya are really amazing and memorable characters potraying literally everyone's problems that is lonliness and depression.\n\nMust watch movie!!!"

The gorgeous animation and music really set me in a contemplating mood. The quietness throughout didn't feel melodramatic, but instead captured the lack of voices that many characters had.\n\nThe relationship between the two main characters and their struggles was masterfully crafted to create a emotionally depressing tale. The symbols of koi fish, firework, notebook, and more were at times quite too complex for me to comprehend. Still I was engaged in the story, and multiple I was on the brink of tearing up. The way voice was communicated in different shape was beautiful.\n\nI watched this movie a while ago, but I still remembered the ending well before coming to this rewatch. However, this time the ending was all the more emotional, and I could not help but letting the tears lose.\n\nThere's some minor problems like uneven focus on some of the minor characters and occasional pacing issues, but they didn't really bother me that much.\n\nOverall, a beautiful drama in many shapes. 9-9.5/10."

People who have experienced bullying know... it doesn't just happen one day with a cruel bully picking on a kind victim. The situation arises among children, just children thinking something is funny or a good time... but the consequences later on lead to regrets in life, traumas unrecovered from, relationships broken... innocence lost simply by humans just being human.\n\nVery unapologetically devastating.

The animation explores sensitive topics such as suicide, depression, anxiety, loneliness and many more real life issues. The story is a literal rollercoaster of emotions from anger, sympathy, warmth, comfort, etc. If you watch this movie just be ready to ball your eyes out...I am not an emotional person but this movie broke me."

Although im not technically the demographic for this (English white guy in his 30s) it finds a way to pull you in through sheer emotion. I empathized with almost everything these characters went through, despite never having been through much of it myself. I have not and could never understand what its like to be an 11 year old Japanese girl, who is deaf, starting at a new school but somehow, the writing in this film is so good that I felt every emotion that girl went through.\n\nThats pretty amazing.

        "review_detailed_main": "An animated Japanese feature from 2016. A young boy in school meets a new female transfer student who happens to be deaf. She can read lips & speak but generally most of her communication rises from a notepad she carries around w/her to encourage participation between her & her classmates. The boy, named Shoya, hates the way the new girl, named Shouko, has disrupted the students' status quo so to lash out he constantly abuses her verbally, rips out her hearing aids (in one instance drawing blood) & tosses away her prized notebook into a pond. Once Shouko's mother comes a-calling (looking for financial restitution for the damaged aids), Shoya is put in his place by his mother. Years pass & Shoya has been suicidal of late (he works hard saving up money to pay for I guess a multitude of sins) but when he encounters Shouko, all those memories & regrets from his past behavior come flooding back as he attempts to rekindle their friendship. His old friends (some of them also tormentors from years before) come back into his orbit. Shouko falls in love w/Shoya but circumstances or fear prevent her from admitting so which is ironic since Shoya feels the same way but his slow integration back into his social circle is glacial (personified by 'X's hovering over his classmates' faces & never looking anyone in the eye). Feeling like a burden to all around her, Shouko attempts suicide (by jumping from her apartment's balcony) but is saved by Shoya as he grabs her falling hand but once he pulls her to safety, he slips & falls downward ending up in a hospital bringing all his friends together to once & for all evaluate their relationships w/Shoya & Shouko as Shoya recuperates. Hugely emotionally satisfying not only as a piece of animation (where blues almost look like they've come from Van Gogh's id) but as a piece of mature drama tackling a subject even most live action features would shy away from or render its subject matter exploitative or histrionic. My one gripe is the typically drawn characters (wide eyed, colored hair not seen in any color spectrum) which cursory viewers may dismiss as same old, same old but stay tuned & the benefits reaped are gargantuan."

I'm glad I watched it, it's beautifully animated and the situations presented real.\n\nOne of those great surprises that I had no idea about beforehand, and glad I know of now. If nothing more, I think the theme of hitting rock bottom and slowly, but steadily turning yourself back around is a very powerful one."

He starts to cope with this troublesome past by fading his surroundings and hardly connects to anyone around him. Until the day, when Tomohiro Nagatsuka taught him what friendship looks and feels like. So step by step, Shoya starts to open up and connect to certain people in his life including Shoko. To process his past, he felt responsible for Shoko's happiness who he'd used to bully for her inability to hear. With each step towards her, he learned about Shoko's real emotions and unravels the meaning of moving on in life. The story is capturing in a way that it connects the protagonist's past and present experiences and pictures feelings like rejection and depression from an empathetic point of view. The animation was leading the audience with the choice of soft colors and the presentation of little details that helped to understand the characters and their choices. The music was used discreetly but appropriate to the scenery, wrapping up the overall experience as enjoyable and recommendable to everyone who resonates with the struggles of growing up and finding their way out of the past and into the present."

        "review_detailed_main": "A Silent Voice: The Movie (2016) is a movie that my daughter and I recently watched together on Netflix. The storyline follows a group of children who bully a def girl in elementary school. As they grow up the def girl needs to switch schools and make new friends and the bullies need to deal with the guilt of what they've done. The young man who went hardest on the little girl becomes suicidal and may need to seek forgiveness to save his life.\n\nThis movie is directed by Naoko Yamada (Liz and the Blue Bird) and stars Miyu Irino (Spirited Away), Saori Hayami (Demon Slayer: Mugen Train), Aoi Y\u00fbki (Kamen Rider: Ghost), Yui Ishikawa (Attack on Titan), Yui Ishikawa (Hunter x Hunter) and Mayu Matsuoka (Shoplifters).\n\nThis is a movie with a unique storyline and a worthwhile premise. The characters are entertaining and easy to root for and against. The bullying scenes were rough to watch throughout and may have gone a bit overboard at times; however, it did a good job of driving home the premise. The animation was excellent and does a perfect job of capturing the settings, circumstances and characters.\n\nOverall, this is a worthwhile family movie that is tough to watch, but has a great premise. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it."

This film speaks to me so well as I know what happens in this movie happens in real life everywhere.\n\nI have never understood why people feel the need to bully others who are different from them. This movie captures so well the herd mentality behind this. A lot of people would help bully others, despite feeling sick to their stomach themselves about their actions, because they don't want to look different, don't want to be isolated by others, or don't want to suffer some form of loss. There is no such thing as the right time to do the right thing. A lot of horrendous things such as persecution and massacre has taken place and grown because many people fear of being singled out if they were to do the right thing."

You can't change your past and you think that the present is like a roller coaster and you are those who are just seeing this for a very long time but without reason. Your mind is not inside you, you're searching for someone or something but you don't know what this is.

Also, many people that thought the character Ueno was not good in this movie but let me tell you first,you have to understand her point of view and understand why she is doing certain stuff.

A very emotional movie touch on the importance of family and friends' supports shaping an individual's behavior and being there when youre going through something. Highly recommended. It was a very long movie for me but i really enjoyed it and moved by the tear jerking storyline. Unexpectedly good."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have watched many anime from shonen to rom-com but I have never rated any anime 10/10. Even though this is a movie it still accomplishes way more with it's run time than shows that are going for years. It is an emotional rollercoaster and while thinking about it's flaws I couldn't find a single one. While this may have some cute moments here and there it is not a love story it is a drama. I do wish they could have delve deeper into the main characters relationship especially a romantic one but there was no time left. By the end it almost feels like a new beginning rather than an actual end.\n\nComing to the minor spoilers It has a good ending while it may make you cry throughout the film by the end you will feel satisfaction and fulfillment and it doesn't break you like a bitter sweet ending or a sad ending. This movie is about regret, guilt and self loating from both the main characters.\n\nFinal thoughts: As I said I have never rated any anime 10/10 the closest to this is code geass which was 9/10. The reason why I gave this more than code geass is because of a good ending while code geass has a great ending it is a bittersweet ending. Personally I love the anime that makes me cry but it has to have a good ending because I am willing to put up with all the sadness as long as it makes me feel happy towards the end."

While the premise of the film revolves around Shoyo Ishida, who attempts to make amends with a deaf girl he bullied in the 6th grade, the main story focuses on his relationships with the people around him. Ishida's journey is a tale of bullying, friendship, mental health, love and redemption and everything just comes together so well. I highly recommend everybody watch this masterpiece of a film."
