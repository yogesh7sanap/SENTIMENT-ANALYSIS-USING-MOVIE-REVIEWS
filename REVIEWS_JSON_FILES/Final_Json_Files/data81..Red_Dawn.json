        "review_detailed_main": "The United States gets invaded by North Korea. That pretty much sums up the ludicrousness of the film. I mean, the original had Soviet Union being the invading force, which at least played to the fears and politics of the time. This didn't have the guts to go with Russia - although they kinda did - but couldn't they haven chosen anything else but North Korea?\n\nNot that it really matters. The whole premise is silly, but so is the movie as a whole. And the worst thing is that it tries to take itself way too seriously. The tone is grim and dark, the characters suffer, there's death and dismemberment, the whole gruesome nine yards. And throughout this whole ordeal were supposed to believe that North Korea successfully invaded the only superpower of our time. Yeah... no.\n\nAnd the worst thing is that I've seen this idea done much better. I haven't seen the original film, but there's a film called Tomorrow, When the War Began, released a few years before this one, which takes place in Australia and has China as the invading force. Well, they don't explicitly specify the nation. But it's China. And yes, it's a stupid, silly film as well, but it acknowledges it. It's a teenage action-comedy and has much greater camp value because of it. The main characters are teenagers, like in this film, but the ludicrousness of the situation is turned to the film's advantage through decent writing and characters. And it still gets to have its guns akimbo action scenes and character deaths needed to sell the point that war is not actually such a hot idea.\n\nSo, to summarize, if the premise interests you, see Tomorrow, When the War Began instead. Enough said."

Aaameeerica, Aaameeerrrrriiiicaa!! God save them all, they do make me laugh and cry at the same time.\n\nEnough has already been said in previous reviews about the wildly idiotic plot and lazy directing. Rather get the 1984 version. At least it had some heart in it, though the plot was just as ludicrous, playing on the strange fear of communism America has always fostered.\n\nOne more thing! Modern movies (this one being no exception) way overuse the lazy technique of compressing together various sorts of character growth sequences into a few minutes.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure why everyone is so hard on this film.. maybe because they were comparing it to the original Red Dawn? Or maybe they were expecting too much?\n\nI skimmed through some of the other reviews which all seemed to base their low rating 3 ideas. 1. that it's unlikely North Korea can occupy the US; 2. why they would choose to invade a small town; 3. and why a band of teenagers would make a difference.\n\nThose reasons are irrelevant. If you think of every movie like that, there are lots of things that aren't realistic but that doesn't mean the movie can't be entertaining. For example, it's unrealistic that Bane can hijack a military plane, blow it up, and then jump out of it safely onto another plane, all in mid-flight thousands of ft above ground.\n\n1. In the movie, they briefly mentioned that the N. Koreans had some kind of new EMP that knocked out the US' communications and equipment. Sure.. that's a far fetch but that's not the point of the movie. The US can attack and occupy other countries, so why can't N. Korea (with Russian assistance)? (N. Korea has one of the largest military in the world)\n\n2. What city they invaded is not the point either.. they could have made it about Manhattan if that makes you happier. They mentioned that the N. Koreans invaded many parts of the country so this is just one of the places they occupied. Perhaps, this small town, USA was a geographical location that gave them some kind of vantage point for a region of the country?\n\n3. Why can't a band of rebels (even teenagers) make a difference? It's not that unbelievable that teenagers can shoot. It's also not that unbelievable that they can organize themselves into an effective force under the right leadership (like a marine). They're not trying to say that the group will save the entire country or kill all the invaders in the town. As Chris Hemsworth stated near the beginning of the movie, it's moreso that a small group can make a nuisance for the invaders and defeat their spirit. Look at the movie Defiance, which is based on a true story. There are also elements of rebellion in other more famous movies like Gladiator, The Last Samurai, Braveheart, etc.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this movie actually, despite what others say. I think many people were probably expecting something else and had high hopes and felt disappointed, but if you watch this movie without reading any reviews first or criticism, you may be entertained!"

Whether you have seen the 1984 original or not, If your a fan of against the odds action flicks you will enjoy this, its a great popcorn movie. Some critics ( this is what they like to call themselves, although I believe they are stuck up adolescents with hardly any worldly experiences) say the violence was too toned down.. well boohoo, a great movie doesn't need to be gory and contain large amounts of gratuitous violence, to be honest some movies do this because they are bad movies and have nothing else to offer.\n\nOn another note, have any of the critics bashing this movie actually watched it from start to finish or have they just flicked through it enabling them to give their review?\n\nHere are an few shameful comments from the movie bashers\n\n\"why would N. Korea invade a small US town..WTF?\"\n\nDuh.. they invaded most of the US... listen to the dialogue\n\n\"Where is the US Army\"\n\nThis was explained in the news footage montage at the start, the US army is scattered across the world, fighting conflicts in the middle east and other parts of the world... plus,they never expected an attack on their own soil\n\n\"We couldn't stop laughing when the N. Korea military leader kept yelling \"The wolverine terrorists are attacking\"\n\nOh yeah, and I couldn't stop laughing at your comment! the plot was very simply, why couldn't you follow it? these radio transmissions came from the Korean Marine, made purposely to cause confusion... plus a little comic relief for the audience (the one's paying attention anyway)\n\nFor the people saying that the story was unbelievable, i just don't have anything to say to you retards except... it's a movie, it's make believe, it's for entertainment.\n\nAll in all a great popcorn movie, does it deserve the 10 I gave it? probably not, but a solid 8 easily, it gets the 10 the offset the unfounded 1's its been getting... what's wrong with people today"

But wait, hell with them, let's have a greasy-looking, stoner-faced, mumbling Josh Peck as our war-torn hero.

Hell with them, there's some device that shut them all down, and these kids are our last hope! Yeah, right. If you can tie an anchor to every last one of your disbeliefs and drown them in the waters of horrible cinema, then maybe you can appreciate one or two of the well- orchestrated and intense action scenes that \"Red Dawn 2.0\u2033 has to offer.

I watched this shortly after watching the 80s version, and I have to say that I enjoyed the new version much more.\n\nThis one was more briskly paced, even though the invasion starts later. They did a good job of keeping the story moving forward without getting boring at times like the original tended to be. Having said that, there is still enough character development to get to relate to the teens and what they're going through - though the original version did a better job at relaying the struggles and fears of the main characters. There is also a good balance between action and dialogue, with a few humorous scenes and also some nods to the original in the form of similar scenes done in different ways.\n\nAll in all it was an enjoyable film for what it is, and even though it had its far fetched moments, like the teens jumping down 20 foot heights more than once and just walking away from it, or the fact that the North Korean army could stage an invasion of the US (the original Chinese army version was more plausible), they didn't detract too much from the film. I would say give it a shot if you don't have unrealistic expectations given what kind of film it is, and you may be pleasantly surprised. I grew up in the 80s and think some classic films from that era should never be remade, but this one was an actual improvement over the original and I don't think it deserves all the hate it's getting."

With no time to waste, Jed takes his brother and a few of the neighborhood kids to safety. Now it's up to him to teach these teenagers what it's like to shoot, blow up, and kill the enemy.\u2013 A story of honor, courage, and determination.\n\nI had a lot of fun watching this film. A sense of patriotism could be felt throughout. The action sequences were methodic, suspenseful, and explosive. It's obvious some military trained personnel were on the set for this project, as you can see in some of the infiltration and attack scenes. The absence of CGI was a definite plus. While sitting in my seat, I was taken back to a time when filmmakers blew up things for real. I'm telling you almost every scene after the first ten minutes\u2013 EXPLOSION. Also, the choices for location assisted very well in creating the feel the filmmakers wanted to convey . The use of a peaceful middle class suburbia, a busy downtown district, and the \"old high school football field\" seemed to help elevate the stakes. All this amazement has a price tag on it though. I call it acting. As with many action movies, this is usually a lacking aspect. So, if you've read this far, I'll assume you already know it's an action film and performance is something you can easily forgive. I'll warn you though. The character arcs of the two brothers are the exact opposite and don't really serve Jed's character. With that said, the premise is also another aspect one should \"overlook\" to fully enjoy the film. Most of the characters in the story seem to work except for the foul-mouthed Marine. You'll know who I'm talking about when you see it. I'm done spoiling the movie. \"But why should I go and see this movie,\" you ask. Well\u0085 In conclusion, I will leave you with two comments: 1. From the Critic: I felt I had to relax a lot to go along with the premise and the acting. That along with the forced \"military\" dialogue and the brother's feud, I would tell my friends that it was enjoyable, but not the best.\n\n2. From the Moviegoer: I got a little more than what I came for. Guns, bombs, hot chicks with rocket-propelled grenades, and a Banana Republic version of Thor. If you don't see it for yourself, see it for America!"

I prefer the guerilla fighting in the mountains from the first one. I did tell the movie tried to put some of the original elements in it but it seemed to happen only in the last five minutes of the movie.

The cast provides enough eye candy for both the male & female movie viewer as well. Speaking of the cast, Josh, from Drake & Josh, is worth the price of admission alone. He is simply so unbelievable as a hero it makes for great cinema.\n\nHonestly, the rest of the cast is good, not great.

        "review_detailed_main": "'RED DAWN': Three Stars (Out of Five)\n\nRemake to the cult classic 1984 hit about the invasion of a small American town and a group of young people (mostly teenagers) looking to defend it. The original was about the invasion of America by the Soviet Union (and it's Nicaraguan and Cuban allies) and centered on a small Colorado town. It came at the height of the Cold War so it was very relevant and popular because of it. This remake (which was finished filming over two years ago and shelved due to the studio, MGM, having financial troubles) is about an American invasion by North Korea (and some Russian allies) and centers on the town Spokane, Washington. The film was originally about a Chinese invasion of America but scenes were re-shot and re-edited, while it was sitting in wait, due to China being offended and America wanting to keep their box office. The already unbelievable plot was made even more unrealistic by changing the invading army to a North Korean one (which is very small compared to the American Army) and makes no sense. The film spends little time trying to make sense though and is just a cheesy bad war film that is actually pretty faithful to the original.\n\nChris Hemsworth was cast as the film's lead prior to playing 'Thor' (and was only known for a cameo in the 2009 'STAR TREK' reboot, playing George Kirk). He plays Jed (a role played by Patrick Swayze in the original), who is on leave from military duties in Afghanistan and has returned home to his family in Spokane unexpectedly. His brother, Matt (Josh Peck, playing a role previously played by Charlie Sheen), is a high school football star who just blew a big game. He's mad at Jed for suddenly leaving home after their mother died and is not happy to see him. The next morning (after Jed arrives) they both awake to find North Korean soldiers parachuting into the streets and taking over their town. Their father Tom Eckert (Brett Cullen), a local police sergeant, tells them to flee to their cabin in the woods (which is funny if you're a Chris Hemsworth fan). They take some other high schoolers with them. After witnessing their father being executed the boys decide to form a resistance force and call themselves 'The Wolverines', after their high school mascot. The rest of the film focuses on their rebellion against the North Korean Army. It co-stars Isabel Lucas, Adrianne Palicki and Josh Hutcherson (in a role previously played by C. Thomas Howell) as fellow resistance fighters.\n\nThe film was directed by stunt man (and stunt coordinator) turned first time feature film director Dan Bradley. It was written by Carl Ellsworth (who co-wrote the thrillers 'RED EYE', 'DISTURBIA' and the 2009 remake of 'THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT') and Jeremy Passmore. The original was directed and co-written by the great John Milius. It was just as bad a film as this remake but it came at a time when it had a lot greater impact. Milius was a very talented director and writer and had a lot of fun with the 1984 hit but the filmmakers behind this one aren't too shabby either. Still the film is somewhat of a mess and kind of sloppy. What's going on is never very clear or how it's at all possible but the original was almost as unbelievable. The cast of the original was a little more impressive but Hemsworth is a good leading man and Isabel Lucas is gorgeous. If you compare the two this film isn't really that much worse but it still will never be as fondly loved or remembered as the original.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD9BHpPUnE8"

        "review_detailed_main": "Another holiday weekend means another round of movies to review. I'm Robbie K with another review on the latest movie remake entitled Red Dawn. For those of you who remember the 1984 war movie, you might wonder what was going on through Hollywood's heads when they decided to remake this \"classic\". For me I had no answer, other than more money by putting guns in hot teenager hands. However, I went in hoping that this movie would surprise me with something impressive that would make the price of admission worth it. Did I get my wish? Read on to find out\n\nJust like its predecessor, Red Dawn focuses on a small American town that is rapidly occupied by a foreign military power, this time North Korea. After parachuting in and establishing a military regime, a band of high school kids and one marine (Chris Hemsworth) ban together to fight the technology superb country in an effort to reclaim their city. As noble as the plot seems, the idea that a bunch of kids with no combat experience can put up a major resistance is a bit of a stretch to most. Nevertheless this film is a chronicle about how American Pride and cowboyism can be a deadly combination in fighting off bad guys.\n\nSo what would I say are the strongest aspects about this movie? The answer is the action of course. With the evolution of technology, also comes the evolution of action scenes, which some choose to ignore. Red Dawn, however is one of those films that gladly takes advantage of pyrotechnics and CGI flashes to make guerilla warfare even flashier than before. Like a Michael Bay film, Red Dawn has plenty of fiery explosions to start off a battle. At the start, the action is very low key amounting to only a few chases and a small round of gun fire. As the movie progresses, the action picks up going from skirmishes to full on shoot outs that will get any action junkie nodding their heads in satisfaction. Unfortunately many of these battles last less than a minute, so don't think you're getting ten minute fights with every confrontation. Keep in mind though that this movie does have a really good battle near the end that lasts for a decent amount of time to quench your holiday thirst for action. You might be asking now, \"Robbie if these battles are short lived, what makes me want to keep watching the film?\" The answer is simple, the uncertainty as to which characters are going to live through this ordeal. Red Dawn's story team made it difficult to predict which character, if any, would get whacked, only having one or two obvious picks for who wouldn't live to see victory. This connection to the characters helps the audience member add their own suspense that makes the action scenes a little more emotional to the movie.\n\nUnfortunately these characters are very shallow in this movie, with very little development taking place outside of the two brothers. Yes, my friends the cast for this movie was chosen more for their looks than for actual character development, most likely to bring in more audience members. Cast members like Josh Peck, Josh Hutcherson, and Chris Hemsworth are playing the \"macho\" men, more being used for eye candy/ fame to drive people into the theater. To help get males further interested in the film, they put beautiful women like Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas, and Alyssa Diaz in to help appease the good look category for the males. I'm not saying their bad actors at all, but the directors got away with the shallow characters, by putting these big name faces in. Now this wouldn't have been as bad, had they not sacrificed action for their rather useless background history. Many of the lulls in action are quips where we learn one or two tales about what the teens did when they were younger, which is really kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things. The only meaningful information comes from between the brothers, Peck and Hemsworth characters, who reveal the tension and rivalry you see in the movie. Regardless, fans are going to be rooting the characters not based on their morals, but by their looks and previous movie history.\n\nAside from these two things, Red Dawn really doesn't offer too much more in the movie department. The fact that a technologically strong country like North Korea doesn't have better armor for their troops is complete fiction and makes the threat of the enemy a little less intimidating. Throw in the fact that the kids can shoot better than the troops, and well you get a classic American cowboy film that further pumps up someone's ego. Aside from American pride, this movie also has a vague ending just like its 80's precursor that sets the stage for both ending and opens up for another movie. Whether or not this sways your vote I can't tell, but I'm just warning you that there is no definite closure to this film.\n\nOverall Red Dawn is a glorified video game brought back to the theaters. The action again is decent for most of the movie, though could have been longer for my tastes. However, again its mostly people coming in to see model like teenagers toting guns and rooting for their favorite new generation star to survive the day. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Probably not, but is worth picking up a copy at Netflix/RedBox when it comes out. My scores for this movie are the following: Action: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5 Until then my friends I'm signing out. This is Robbie K saying enjoy the movies and please continue to provide constructive feedback by contacting rkarim11@su.edu. Thanks"

There's nothing the actors could do to save this ridiculously illogical story.\n\nWhereas the original had the US invaded by Russia and Latin America, this one is invaded by North Korea. At least the 80s version passed the smell test. This one is just too stupid. Originally, this 2012 version was supposed to be Chinese which actually had a chance. But the change is the new history of Hollywood financing. This movie was held up in editing hell. The Chinese money didn't like to be shown as the bad guys. So a painstaking re-editing changed all the Chinese soldiers into North Koreans.\n\nAs for the story, it's still basically the same idea. Except this time there is some kind of fantastical briefcase that explains the success of the foreign invaders. It just adds another element of disbelief into the movie. I like most of the actors in this, but there are too many unreasonable things to buy into."

        "review_detailed_main": "The sea of bad reviews has turned on Red Dawn and as far as I can tell it is full of some empty criticisms. Most of them sink within a moment's thought. It is as if they were paid to write negative conclusions about every single thing that happened on screen. Maybe the director or one of the actors wronged them in some way and this their way of exacting some revenge.\n\nThe simple fact is that what they say doesn't reflect what is projected on the screen. Like spotty camera work. Sorry didn't happen. And don't they possess a modicum of disbelief? All matter of strange and bizarre events have taken place in a movie theater. Does the premise of the United States being occupied by foreign powers \u2013 meaning more than one \u2013 exceed these limits that have historical been extremely laid-back?\n\nOnce clear of these little hiccups there is no turning back. The writing is engaging and at times really moving with a cast of characters that carry the action and drama to a degree that can be believed. From the vehicles, to the number of extras, and explosions it is clear that a great deal of expense went into the production. It would be a shame that a bunch of uppity hecklers would steer away a movie goer looking for a film that delivers PG-13 level action with some nice twists and turns, mixed in with a fair amount of drama and a little humor. If I were more cynical I might conclude that these naysayers just cannot stand Americans fighting for their county. I am reminded of Act of Valor (2012) and how it was also riddled full of holes as well with dubious reasons.\n\nIf you can stomach patriotism perhaps you will enjoy this movie otherwise you might be forced to regurgitate your findings into a lackluster falling star review."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a remake of a 1980s film where America gets occupied by the Soviet Union and Cuba . Hardly a credible premise but you have to meet it on its own right wing terms . Originally this remake was going to feature an occupation of America by the Chinese . Hardly a credible premise but the fact American films get shown in China nowadays means there's a massive potential market and being worried about losing money the producers then changed the enemy invasion force to the North Koreans . This is where the whole movie collapses from the outset\n\nSome people have defended this film on the grounds that such an invasion could be possible down to the fact that NK has an army of one million people under arms . Indeed it does but this misses out that it lacks any logistical capacity . While amateurs talk tactics professionals talk logistics . NK lacks any force projection . By this I mean it lacks any capacity to invade neighbouring countries . It has no real serviceable navy and even a possible invasion of South Korea would involve hundreds of thousands of troops being transported in either trucks or on foot so any surprise attack on America by NK is laughable . The screenplay does try to get around this unconvincing premise by stating the Koreans have launched an attack by EMP weapons that have destroyed America's communication systems and are are being helped by the Russians though it's never stated why the Russians would be brothers in arms with North Korea\n\nJohn Milius wrote the original RED DAWN as a right wing wish fulfillment . The world has changed beyond all recognition since then so what's the political subtext ? Is there one ? I'm not sure . One of the protagonists is a former veteran of the Iraqi conflict and leading the band of guerrilla fighters he makes the point \" When I was abroad we were the good guys because we brought order . Now we're the bad guys because we bring chaos \" I fail see the thinking behind this . Order=good , chaos = bad ? How is that then ? Surely it should be democracy good , tyranny bad ? If you're expecting any profound discussion about the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter you're watching the wrong film because the remake of RED DAWN is more concerned about setting up action packed set-pieces where brave Americans kill nasty Asiatic commies\n\nEven then the action scenes collapse when you give them any thought . Don't the North Korean soldiers have things like road blocks where anyone passes through has to be searched for weapons ? There's also a lack of internal continuity . You can guarantee that when the script demands it there's literally thousands of NKs patrolling the streets of the city then when the guerrillas launch an attack there's only a handful of North Koreans who are cannon fodder , then the good guys are back in their camp safe and sound . Why didn't the thousands of communists just head them off in the pass ?\n\nThe original film was bad enough but this one is worse . You can perhaps say this remake has better action scenes but for an action scene to successfully work then there has to still an element of credibility involved and everything about this film lacks any credible element and feels anachronistic in any point it might be making . Indeed in the 1980s American control was criticised in case America became a target of foreign invasion . Try claiming people should be allowed access to guns in case of a sneak attack by North Korea and listen to the laughter"

Good characterization so you felt it each time one of them died. This movie was much more enamored to shaky camera shooting of sub-par action scenes that any of the above.\n\nI could be more forgiving if it was linked to some larger analogy to a modern conflict, but it isn't. Whomever greenlighted this movie should never work in the industry again."

One rule \u2013 Every time you see or hear an overused clich\u00e9 or war trope, drink. You'll be soused 15 minutes into the film. On the up side, the rest of the movie will probably be better that way.\n\nOne of my friends that saw the movie with me summed it up nicely. OMG, it really is a remake. Up until we actually started watching the movie she had been holding out hope that they had re-done the movie and fixed the oh so many problems the first Red Dawn had.\n\nThe original Red Dawn had its place. I remember seeing it back when it came out. It had all the hot young actors of the day. It's problem wasn't the cast, all of them were good actors, most when on to long successful careers. I suspect many of the actors from this movie will do the same. (I'd tell you who was in it, but I suspect they are already hoping that people forget that they were involved.) The problem wasn't even the concept. Everyone loves an underdog story and there is nothing more under-doggy than a bunch of high schoolers trying to fight back against overwhelming odds. They could have handled the concept, lets be generous and only say, A LOT better. To their credit the writers did try to fill in some of the plot holes for the remake.\n\nThey setting was moved from some agricultural town in Colorado to Spokane, which at least has an airbase and decommissioned missile silos that might make it a strategic site if someone was to invade the United States. They also made the point that the kids weren't trying to beat the invaders, but act as insurgents, making trouble where they could.\n\nThe new movie does offer a nice training montage and lots of high quality explosions. Sadly the dialogue is just as painful to listen to as it was in the first movie. Too bad they didn't spend a bit less on the pyrotechnics and a little more on the script, but hey, it does have a lot of things that blow up.\n\nBANG! POW! BLAST! And don't forget to drink up, because someone is probably saying something cheesy. ;)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The world is in crisis and suddenly North Korea invades and occupies the US, with the help of Russia for some reason. We follow some kids through all this as they hide in a cabin in the mountains. Among them is a returning marine Jed and his goofy looking younger brother Josh. We learn that Josh isn't one to follow advice but goes on his own to do stupid stuff, he doesn't care about the team but only about himself. Josh has a pretty girlfriend who like most of the population ends up in a a concentration camp.\n\nThe escape by the kids catches the attention of main bad guy in charge of the area- Captain Cho. When Jed and Josh's dad basically commits suicide by government after giving an encouraging speech, the kids decide not to turn themselves in. In a fast forward scene we learn that suddenly the kids become freedom fighters, with the help of the population and they manage somehow to travel freely from city to county without any problem. And indeed they start committing acts of terrorism against the new government while gaining the support of the locals. They call themselves the wolverines and are now chased by Cho and his unit. At some point they meet up with two lone marines who are actually looking for them for help. They want to capture a communication device Cho uses and keeps in a suitcase and to get it they all will mount a complex operation to infiltrate Cho's headquarters.\n\nI'm not sure Red Dawn knows what it wants. It's not adolescent enough for teens and it's not mature enough for young adults. I sure would have liked to have seen more of the lovely Isabel Lucas and Adrianne Palicki. There are some very serious themes that could have been touched or focused on, but Red Dawn avoids that, too. Casting is equally unconvincing. Hemsworth is alright, Peck isn't. How does any professional casting person figure these two would make believable brothers? The girls are lovely but don't do much. There's a Cruise kid in there as well for some reason.\n\nRed Dawn is a timely movie no doubt. America still isn't done with the business of interfering in the affairs of other nations. And the parallels between one powerful nation invading another one in fiction and reality are fairly evident. We briefly see some propaganda posters the North Koreans have plastered all over the city and the rhetoric of the big shots all argue that invasion is for the good of the invaded. It's the same everywhere and at all times. The powerful know what's better for everyone and if the weak don't accept voluntarily they will have to at gunpoint. The movie also gives a good perspective of what \"terrorism\" is, once you look at it from the side of the occupied country. And I'm all for instilling some patriotism in kids, which isn't easy to do given all that is going on.\n\nRed Dawn could have been a strong movie had it been a bit more political. The quick-fast forward scene of how the kids become freedom fighting \"terrorists\" deserved much more attention. The ending also looks a bit unfinished, they were going more for visual effect than for story. Clearly the first-time director didn't know how to tell the story effectively enough. Of course one could argue whether a story liked this is suited to be put into the world of young teens. This is one movie that should have been at least 15 minutes longer."

This analogy is well drawn by Jed when he says, \"now, we're the bad guys\" and explains the situation. Also the film never tries to be too optimistic by making super humans out of some high-school kids. They are shown as rebels creating chaos. And the movie succeeds in showing that.

I turned it off just 10 minutes in, aching with emotional heartache at this atrocity of a remake. Months later I was surfing Netflix and decided to give this \"movie\" another shot. Finishing this movie may have been the most trying hardship I have EVER been through, and I have been through as much as the next guy. What director in there right mind would cast some Nickelodeon burnout as the main hero. As for the rest of the C Team cast, consider your careers short and unpleasant. I suppose besides Chris Hemsworth. It was amazing to see a bunch of punk as*** go from generic Adolescents to one of the most elite fighting forces on the planet, enough so that the trained North Korean Army was defeated by them more times than the laugh track played on Drake and Josh. If my memory serves me, the REAL Wolverines from the original weren't so into high-jacking buses in the middle of the zone, or stealing some lame as* secret weapon briefcase, they were a little more realistic in that they blew things up and then immediately retreated. However I must say that Josh Peck did a wonderful job in making me utterly hate him and any t.v. show or movie that he has even been associated with. Stephen Hawking would have been a better pick for an action movie that this Mel Gibson wanna be. If Josh Peck ever told me to \"move my ass\" I would smack him so hard he would wake up on the set of the \"Amanda Show\" As all of this was going through my mind, I was wondering what this Director was thinking while filming this POS. Upon further research I came to understand that the movie in fact did not have a director, It had an untalented stunt coordinator trying to play Michael Bay, which resulted in one of the decades greatest filmography failures so far. Dear Director (thy name shall not escapeth from mine tongue) please for the love of Humanity and America please never even lay eyes on a script again. At one point in the movie I was so horrified with Mr. Pecks acting capabilities, I was actually rooting for the North Korean, I expected a plot twist where Kim-Jong-Un would break into the set and Rip Josh Pecks treasonous head right from his shoulders, and show himself as the true protagonist. If I could sue you for damages, being time wasted Director I would gladly do so."

It seems like a lot of reviewers might grew up with the Dirty Dancing casted 1984 version. I had never seen the 1984 or the 2012 versions but did so yesterday (2012 version) and today (1984 original).\n\nFirst, the 1984 release has a 6,3 and the 2012 remake has a 5.4 rating. That's not a huge difference.\n\nJosh Peck has received a massive amount of hate for his performance. Yes, the casting of him is weird and his performance is not solid, but I can remind you that good acting was not overrepresented in the 1984 version either. No, Josh Peck doesn't look like a brother to Chris Hemsworth but does Charlie Sheen look like a brother of Patrick Swayze?\n\nThe new film gets criticism for unrealistic warfare tactics (and outcomes)... But I couldn't really find less of it in the old original...\n\nSo here's what I did. I had a bad day and needed something where I don't have to think too much, I get into my 12-year old mode and enjoy the ride (People! It's a bunch of kids killing hundreds of trained soldiers that has superior fire power, one has do dumb down first!). It worked, and was a prerequisite for BOTH versions."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original Red Dawn, released in 1984, is one of my all-time favorite cult classics. It was the first PG-13 film ever released. Its story about the Soviet Union invading the United States sounded like a generally plausible idea at the time, because the United States and Soviet Union were still engaged with each other in the Cold War. The original film was written and directed by John Milius, who also directed the film that jump-started Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, Conan the Barbarian, and he also co-wrote Dirty Harry and Apocalypse Now, and created the HBO series Rome. The original film starred up-and-coming actors like Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Gray, and also had film veterans Harry Dean Stanton and Powers Booth as supporting cast members.\n\nThe premise was simple: a bunch of high school students escape to the mountains near Calumet, Colorado after the Soviets, Cubans, and Nicaraguans take over the town in the first days of World War III. The students quickly grow into adults as they decide to fight the bad guys and try to free their fellow townspeople, naming themselves the Wolverines after their high school mascot. They get help from an American jet pilot, cause lots of chaos, but eventually, the group gets worn out, they begin to drop like flies, and eventually the leaders of the group, Jed and Robert Eckert (Swayze and Sheen), sacrifice themselves to save the survivors of the Wolverines, and the members of the group become national heroes.\n\nRed Dawn was filled with cheesy dialogue, some pretty laughable special effects, the same music was played over and over again, and some of the actors' performances made me want to cringe and say, \"Did that actor really become a star?\" Even so, the film is a guilty pleasure in its own right, and it's one of my favorite films from the early 1980s. When the word came out that MGM was producing a remake, I got really excited. We were promised an action film showing the U.S. being invaded by the Chinese (a potential possibility), and a new generation of actors donning the Wolverines name and fighting for freedom. Until 2010 that is, when MGM went bankrupt, and the film was shelved for two years, and then some scenes had to be re-shot, and the Chinese had to be digitally edited to become North Korean for the fear that China wouldn't want to show the movie in their theaters. So, after two years on the shelf, is Red Dawn (2012) really worth the price of admission? Yes...and no.\n\nIn true remake fashion, the original story remains relatively the same; the world is struck by depression, rising political powerhouses, etc. In Spokane, Washington (I'm sensing a Twilight vibe), Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) has come home from a tour of duty in the Marines. His brother Matt (Josh Peck) is a quarterback of the Wolverine football team. The morning after the game, the North Koreans, with the help of the Russians, launch an invasion of the United States, and take over the town, while the Eckert brothers and some other teenage survivors (Josh Hutcherson, Connor Cruise) flee into the mountains, and decide to fight the bad guys, and call themselves the Wolverines, and...I have a strange feeling I've seen this before.\n\nRed Dawn is a passable remake at best. The plot pretty much borrows straight from the original, although the remake does change some plot points for the audience's amusement, but what makes this film stand out is its action scenes. They're actually pretty exciting and well done; the scene with the cargo planes over the town was pretty impressive, and the Wolverines' attacking the North Koreans in a modern day guerrilla combat style actually worked to the film's advantage. The actors are surprisingly good, except Adrianne Palicki and Isabel Lucas, they're just eye-candy, and Jeffery Dean Morgan is sadly underused as Lt. Colonel Andy Tanner. The film actually has an ending far different from the original, and it left me quite pleased.\n\nOverall, Red Dawn is a decent remake, but I still prefer the original for its campy qualities. The last generation had the original with Patrick Swayze, the current generation gets Thor as their hero. This is a Red Dawn with really good special effects and some impressive performances, but unfortunately, this is just a remake. It doesn't take risks with the plot, the bad guys are stereotypical bad guys, and when the Wolverines start to die off, you have no real emotional connection to them as much as the original. Also, why couldn't the bad guys be Chinese? It would've been more realistic. Overall, this is a decent remake that unfortunately didn't really survive its long shelf life, and has the feeling that its story and themes are thirty years out of date. It's not bad, it's passable, but I'd recommend going to see Skyfall or watch the original instead.\n\nFinal Verdict: 6/10"

However, I knew the story - America is invaded by a hostile force and its up to some good looking teens to turn into 'the resistance' and fight back.\n\nHow much you enjoy this movie will depend on how much you can suspend your disbelief. The whole movie is pretty far-fetched from start to finish. If you can believe that America is that easy to overtake and that a small town seems to be of real importance to an invading force, then you can probably believe that the country's armed forces seem pretty powerless to do anything about it, leaving it to the kids to save the day.\n\nThe transmission between ordinary high school kids and urban guerrillas is handled in a short montage soon after the invasion, showing us how they're now a considerable force to be reckoned with. However, this can probably be explained away by the fact that they are led by 'Thor' (also apparently known as Chris Hemsworth) who has a near indestructible pick-up truck. He gives them motivational speeches which make you want to thank your lucky stars that you live in a land of freedom.\n\nIt's all pretty cheesy and, although I may be being a bit flippant about it all, I actually quite enjoyed it. There are some pretty intense and dramatic scenes, mainly involving the carnage the invasion brings.\n\nUltimately, don't take it too seriously. It's daft, cheesy, over-the-top and desperately trying to get a sequel made, but if you can excuse and overlook its one hundred and one faults, then you might be able to get something out of it. At least it's short, so it won't take up too much of your time!"

Most of it felt like paintball in the woods.\n\nThe cast is bad. Josh Peck and Chris Hemsworth as brothers? Josh looked really daft and his character was so annoying. Chris doesn't look good with a crew cut - in fact it makes him look like an overweight redneck. The ladies Isabel and Adrianne looked like they would rather be elsewhere. Poor Will Yun Lee - his biggest role in this drivel.\n\nIn fact the audience would all be better of being elsewhere than watching this."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not going to critique the acting, photography, or editing too much. They're bad/average for Hollywood.\n\nNo I'm going to focus more on the huge failures in basic logic and basic film making the new 'Red Dawn' makes.\n\nOf course this is a remake of the 80s Reagan era classic about an American everytown invaded by communist troops. The only escapees of the high school massacre opening scene become survivalists in the deep woods and become insurgent freedom fighters calling themselves \"The Wolverines.\" In this sense 'Red Dawn' is true to the original plot.\n\nThe first major flaw is high school students (all in their early thirties) awaking to poorly animated CGI airplanes dropping CGI paratroopers. These are some of the worst FX in recent memory. How difficult and basic is it to simply dress some stuntmen in military fatigues and film them parachuting? The did it in the first film just fine! The second, which many fans were already groaning over was that red China threatened a boycott not only of this but all of the studios films from ever being released in there, if the Chinese were portrayed as the communist invaders. Hence we're stuck with North Korea as the villains.\n\nIn an opening montage a sarcastic reporter asks, \"What are they building a army this large for?\" The logical guess would be that North Korea is still officially at war with South Korea, but 'Red Dawn' would have us believe they're secretly planning to invade the American West Coast? There is also some dispute as to how much of the film was made prior to villains' nationality change. Some rumors state the actors were actually filmed speaking Mandarin and had to be dubbed speaking Korean. It's unclear from the released footage.\n\nThird, much like 'V For Vendetta' Hollywood also seems to have forgotten why communism is evil. In one ridiculous scene the Wolverines rob a Subway restaurant for its fresh bread and meat. See this is why communism doesn't work, the people are too poor to have things like fresh food. HOW THE FXXX would a communist Subway have fresh food? This is why it took decades for McDonald's to open its Moscow location. Because communists don't understand basic principles like farms delivering food to restraints. This isn't so much an insult to the intelligence of the audience as it is to the film makers.\n\nThere are various other plot holes, such as the blonde love interest (Isabel Lucas) being held as a political prisoner. \"She's a survivor. I'm sure she's fine,\" the Wolverines reassure each other. Yes, certainly the invading troops wouldn't be using a gorgeous blonde teenager for gang rape or anything. As you may recall in the original Jennifer Grey and Lea Thompson were both gang rape victims.\n\nAnother flaw is the Wolverines driving into the woods and looking for a radio. Certainly one of the three cars they drove in would have had a radio.\n\nAll in all the new 'Red Dawn' isn't that bad. It just strips most of the emotional scenes we loved from the original and turns a bold premise into a 90 minute shoot'm up flick."

The writers and director don't care what The Village Voice has to say about a fun, patriotic roller-coaster movie. It is not a \"film\" about which you wax eloquent at a wine and cheese party. This movie is for pure entertainment. It IS entertaining. It IS exciting. And yes, the premise of North Korea taking over the Pacific Northwest IS absolutely stupid. Get over it.\n\nHad the writers, producers, director, been interested in impressing the likes of Peter Travers at Rolling Stoned, they would have included some tastefully \"artistic\" scene of some underage actor masturbating, or maybe a Catholic priest molesting a kid. Those always get you an Oscar nod :)\n\nTo break it down simply; if you enjoy movies for their excitement and entertainment value, you will enjoy this. If you get your \"News\" from Jon Stewart, you will not."

Although at the time, 1984, we were still in the depth of the cold war. The USSR were the bad guys and easy to hate. So at that time the movie may have resonated better than it does now.

Interesting how the film was made in 2009 and shelved for two years while we changed the villains from Chinese to North Korean because we have to think of that big Chinese market. That's capitalism at its finest.\n\nGeopolitically it doesn't make much sense either. The Russians if anything have become super nationalist with the Russian Orthodox Church having more power than they did with the Czars. I doubt they would be helping the government of the still true believers in Revolution. Ditto the Chinese. Back in the day I remember when one did not refer to mainland China without the prefix Red attached to it. But about 30 seconds after Mao Tse-tung could not fog a mirror the revolution was over in China and not a moment too soon. Those who survived Mao's Red Guards could testify to that. Now they're as capitalist as we are with certain lip service paid to Mao just like in Russia lip service to the ideals of Lenin.\n\nWhat these two did do after the fall of the Soviet Union which kept North Korea alive is say you're on your own Kim family and the little family enterprise you call a country. Like Prussia, it's a state that supports an army because if you don't join the army, you and your family might starve. And now they can't feed their people, but they can build their own nukes to threaten all around who enjoy prosperity. That's all of their neighbors.\n\nThe recent saber rattling of North Korea has given some credence to the popularity of this film as it did in the recent Olympus has fallen. The North Koreans invade, thousands of paratroopers over the Pacific rim and we're told that Russians are in the East Coast. They declared cyber warfare by screwing up our military defense systems and invaded.\n\nAnd like the first version some high school kids fight the invaders and they call themselves Wolverines after their football team. The Wolverine which ironically is an endangered species is one fierce animal that never gives up and will take on a bigger foe and win.\n\nUnlike the first version the kids are lucky enough to have Chris Hemsworth who was in Iraq to train them. Hemsworth's brother is Josh Peck and they gather a crew together and reek havoc on the occupiers. The action is also located in the Pacific Northwest and the Wolverines do some urban guerrilla warfare. The original story had the kids living and doing their thing in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming.\n\nIn the original which I liked more than this both Patrick Swayze and C. Thomas Howell were killed and the story had an Ishmael like ending with one Wolverine surviving to tell the tale of the kids who fought back while America regrouped to reclaim itself. This one ended on a more upbeat, but false note.\n\nThen again it was a far wackier premise with this plot than with the other version."

At least on this occasion the leader Chris Hemson is a military man unlike the Patrick Swayze lead in the original.\n\nThere are not many twists from the original storyline , the action is better along with the effects . Sit back , relax and remember its a film , not real , not meant to be real , just to take you to a different place away from the daily grind for its duration."

I think the film moved way to fast in the beginning, but it began to slow down after about 15-20 minutes.\n\nPeck and Hemsworth put on an amazing performance, showing a real sense of \"sibling rivalry\" between them. Peck also does a great job of depicting his character as all this crap happens to him. I really enjoyed the acting without a doubt. Always been a fan of Hemsworth, Peck, and Hutcherson.\n\nThe writing was pretty crappy at times, but not so bad that it makes you wanna leave, just kinda cheesy.\n\nAll in all, this is a good one time watch, maybe even 2 or 3. It's a 7 star film for me."

I missed the showing I initially was going to attend of flight and the next one was not for another 2 hours, so it was either watching this or twilight in the mean time. I should've listened to my sister and stuck with the gay vampires. Josh Pecks performance was comical.. it is beyond me how in the world he got a lead role. Chris Hemsworth should stick to thor. and hutcherson to hunger games. Josh Peck should probably do the world a favor and find another job. everything about this movie was just ridiculous, from the cheesy speeches to the whole Korea invading us, to the gun battles, to the romantic scenes... i honestly found myself laughing out loud because the \"sad\" moments were so poorly acted that it was indeed comical.... just awful.. don't waste your time and money, go watch django if you haven't.. or literally ANY other movie out right now will be better then this abysmal."

Could it happen in the US, absolutely, which in that perspective you can plainly see that it's not geared towards those that were around to watch the original but to the youth of our nation. If an event like this were to take place then those would be the one's that would need to bare arms and take the nation back. I think theirs a deeper meaning to the movie that has more of a realism than it does fine acting. In the day and age of \"Doomsday Peppers\" and \"Conspiracy Theorists\", it is fuel for the fire and a movie I enjoy watching."

But since there hardly was any dialog it wasn't that bothering.\n\nThere isn't really a story in this movie, virtually no time is spend on introduction of characters and very limited background is given on motivation or decisions.\n\nNow the above doesn't mention anything good, but I still pretty much enjoyed the whole movie. as far as the story line goes its very simple and takes place in a very small area. its very orderly in a sense. The movie jumps into action almost immediately and then keeps on being packed with action with properly timed breathers.\n\nIn the end they take the action a tad to far imo, but 'meh' its oke and it fits. I was never bored and enjoyed the action, which looked pretty good (also camera work was decent).\n\nSo in conclusion: -partly bad acting, but hardly any dialog to notice -no real story line, but if you can ignore the \"why's\" then the story is just fine (simple but fine). -no character development, but with all that action who needs it -good visuals -good camera work -loads of action\n\nI would say; watch it if you feel like such a movie. the concept is pretty funny, an invasion in your western home land. I enjoy those dystopian movies. But yes, this film will not win any awards."

Then they changed the bad guys from China to North Korea and Russia? Talk about bowing to pressure. It should have been China and North Korea together with Iran!!! Bad decision #3. Three was enough.

They are defending themselves from an invasion. But there lies the political irony, in how the main character talks of the land being their home, and for the enemy just a 'land they would rather not be in': what do they think Afghanistan and Iraq are?\n\nBecause of that irony, this film worked better 30-odd years ago with the original. However, it is still an entertaining and cool flick."

I went in to the cinema not expecting anything but a fun action movie, not expecting great dialogue or any of that business. I was however met with a complete pile of garbage, barely recognizable as any sort of 'film'. all the premises are completely ridiculous and unbelievable, and performed in such a stupid way that it pulls the audience completely out of the drama/engagement. (you'll see what i mean in the opening 10 minutes). Instead of going \"OH MY GOD WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?\" you will just be face palming and squirming in your seat.\n\nThe only saving grace this movie has left, then, is the action, right? Well, it was disgustingly bad. The director takes shaky-cam to the next level, with such tight shots and ridiculous layouts the audience will see nothing but motion blur, muzzle flashes in the camera's face and occasionally a huge explosion. You will have no idea where anyone is in relation to each other, and simply be watching a fuzzy mess of flashing visuals accompanied by overly loud wails and gunshots. Absolutely ridiculous, i didn't know action could be this boring.\n\nYou will be about as emotionally attached to the characters as you would a piece of damp cardboard floating in a clogged sink.\n\nOut of everything, though, the thing that makes me hate this movie so much is the fact that it thinks it is hugely emotionally engaging and dramatic, with constant inspirational speeches being made (by characters who have probably had about 2 minutes of screen time). The film just takes itself so seriously even though it utterly fails on every level on which it is possible to fail, and even in some which are impossible. I could forgive it if the film were simply trying to be a silly action ride, like The Expendables for example, rather than trying to appeal to the 'American spirit' etc etc.\n\nDo not see this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Do not support the industry that churns out this garbage, and save a few brain cells whilst doing so. I give it zero out of ten."

The story is pretty much the same aside from a few things they changed a little bit. The remake is a slick action flick that caters to anyone looking for 90 minutes of adrenaline fueled firefights and explosions. If you're looking for good character depth and a story to back it up then this is not for you.\n\nIt's not a great movie by any means, but decent enough if taken for what it is.

Of course when the scriptwriter said the North Koreans will run the subway efficiently he meant the one with trains, the Director thought of the well known chain of sandwich shops!\n\nMatt Eckert (Josh Peck) is the hot headed football player of the Wolverine college team. His older brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) has just returned from active duty in Iraq. Together they and a band of friends head out to the woods and launch guerrilla warfare against the North Koreans who are being aided by the Russians.\n\nJosh Peck despite his acting appearances in the kids show Drake and Josh is awful. To think Josh Hutcherson has a minor role as a sidekick when he should had been the lead. Then again it does not help that the character of Matt is a jerk going around moping for his girlfriend and putting the lives of others at risk.\n\nThe film is just bad, its ineptly made. It would be something if a character equated the shock & awe of the North Koreans to the events of the US army in the middle east so it could at least have claim to be some sort of parody.\n\nThis is a remake of a cult film from 1984 which itself was no great shakes. Only the fact that there was some decent action sequences in the latter part of the movies saves it from a total bomb rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "The remake to the excellent 1984 John Milius action film is mediocre at best. It has some entertaining moments for sure, but this would have been better off not being remade. It is at its best when the action is going on, but at its worst during the build-up scenes. The premise of the film is preposterous, unlike the original film. Seriously, it's doubtful North Korea has the ability to overtake the United States. There are some serious flaws in the screenplay and that makes for cringe-worthy dialog at times, especially when they are trying to go patriotic.\n\nDan Bradley's remake of Red Dawn is about a group of teenagers who form a military group called the Wolverines with the motive of fighting the invading North Koreans.\n\nThe results of the acting is mixed, or at least that's what I believe. Chris Hemsworth does a great job here and I felt in line with his character. Adrianne Palicki also does a good job. Josh Hutcherson does okay, though he has done better. Josh Peck, however, is seriously miscast and does not belong in this film.\n\nOverall, this is a mediocre film at best and it's just one step of being a film with that dreaded failing grade. It's entertaining at times thanks to some well-crafted action scenes, but this film could use lessons in the dramatic department. It's much more believable in the original film. They should have never remade this film, but of course they have to do the same exact thing but in a more modern period with North Koreans to boot. Not an awful film, but not too good either. I rate this film 6/10."

Their father is the local sheriff and their local school mascot is the Wolverines. they live in Washington State.\n\nSuddenly, the US is invaded and they are under attack from the North Koreans. You'll see a lot of guns and bullets and bombs, but not much of a plot. Still, there were enough tiny twists in the plot, and poignant (sad) moments to get you to root for the good guys against the bad guys.\n\nIt's worth a rental from your library. I don't know how this compares to the original from 1984, but I guess it will be similar. Enjoy."

The blank look on his face during scenes were just painful. Seriously, if you're putting that your time and money in a movie think about giving it the best chance possible of being a good movie and use actors who can actually act. That goes for Connor Cruise too, but in a lesser degree. I felt sorry for the other actors who had to work with them.

The actors and actresses all played their roles exceptionally well. A lot of people complained about Josh Peck's acting, but I found he nailed his role of a slightly irritating yet likable younger brother. Chris Hemsworth, obviously, did a fantastic job just as he did as Thor and the rest of the characters brought a great deal of variety and emotion into the group. The plot of the film was simple yet engaging, leaving the audience to attach the the characters and therefore feel for them throughout the film. I can't understand for a second why people called this film 'racist'. It shouldn't be offensive to the Americans, Koreans or Russians. It was an inoffensive war related movie and if people could sit back and enjoy the action film for what it is, rather than criticizing and scouring for flaws it would've received the far greater reviews it deserves. It was great fun, engaging and intermittently tear-jerking. I highly recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "So I've avoided watching this movie at all costs for two years, and when I saw it on the off-chance I was pleasantly surprised by its consistency; at least where it didn't fall flat on its face! Based on the original 1984 John Milius Cold War action fantasy of the same name, Red Dawn only really falls short in exactly the same ways its predecessor did. It's far-fetched, doesn't try to be too realistic outside of the action sequences and, most importantly, it's a smack in the face of all human intelligence on the other side of every ocean surrounding Muricah the Bootiful.\n\nIf you loved the original for what it was, and I grew up on this stuff, you won't be too likely to hate on this. With a throwback theme of full-on action and guerilla warfare, Red Dawn updates not only its characters and story so that it isn't a cheap imitation, it also flips the wartime dynamic so that the lead characters of the movie aren't good ol' boy survivalists, but schoolkids turned \"terrorist insurgents\" by carrying out daring assaults on the invading forces and operating right under their noses.\n\nThat's about as intelligent as it gets, turning things around so that American viewers might understand what it is to be treated like Middle-Easterners. Looking back to the classic, this version is shorter and more full of action and the action is exceptional, but it doesn't have the same level of desperation and heartbreak, although it doesn't dismiss it altogether.\n\nSurprisingly, the movie isn't filled with too many baby faces who look like they wouldn't know which end of a gun to point at the enemy. Those kids also make for pretty decent stuntmen. Chris Hemsworth and Adrianne Palicki pretty much run the show until Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Kenneth Choi and Matt Gerald join in and instantly turn up the charisma and I feel that it's all a lot better balanced than the original.\n\nAs a standalone movie, it's good fun, even if it wasn't the brightest pupil in the yearbook. I'm pretty sure we can end the hate-offensive now. After all, Kim Jong-Un would have invaded by now had he found it that offensive!"

Or... scratch the aliens, make it robots, then it would say something about human nature and misuse of technology I guess. Wait, that's been done too?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelp, I'll own it. To be honest, I got about what I expected with this movie. I did it to myself. I bought it. I clicked, I was tired of using my brain for the moment and thought I was clicking the 1984 version. I meant to reminisce my childhood on my way to bed after a plane flight.\n\nI wanted to see the 1984 movie with adult eyes and get why Dad said it was so stupid, because I hadn't gotten it when I was 11.\n\nI was a bit surprised when I saw Obama in the opening montage. What? They made a remake? Apparently they did, who knew?\n\nI guess it was a movie made for overgrown 12 year old boys who want to break into a six-pack, settle into a good ol' action flick with flag in one hand and... gun... in the other, feel right about the way things are for a couple of hours, and have their Murican values stroked.\n\nGood flick to fall asleep to, I guess."

        "review_detailed_main": "Red Dawn is probably the only remake in the history of film that sports a title that is less relevant to its subject matter than when it was originally used. I get it; red represents communism, but never have I heard North Koreans be called \"reds\" like the Soviet Union. China would've been more plausible, but when the filmmakers attempted to make the Chinese the invaders in this remake, they were outraged that a country they assisted for so long would go back and demonize them in a piece of patriotic propaganda. This spectacle makes me seriously wonder how we Americans are portrayed in foreign cinema.\n\nIf it's anything like how we've portrayed foreigners in our cinema, I would anticipate nothing but caricatures filled with enough greed and bigotry for an entire country. But back to the film at hand; Red Dawn is just what you'd expect of a film that remakes the 1984 film. The original film's values have been decreased to nothing more than a cult hit depicting one man's \"what if?\" thought stretched into a near two hour film. Here, we are greeted with more incredulity, soullessness, tiresome action sequences, and redundant explosions than in the first film, but we are robbed of the pleasant appearances of actors like Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, and Powers Boothe.\n\nThe film revolves around the town of Spokane, Washington, where Jed Eckhert (Chris Hemsworth), who served as a Marine for six years after the death of his mother, returns home to greet his father and football star brother Matt (Josh Peck), only to be disturbed by a power outage the same night Matt loses a big game. They awake in the morning to find North Korean paratroopers dropping to the ground and F-16s hurling through the sky, and quickly pursue their pickup truck to round up their teen neighbors, Robert (Josh Hutcherson) and Daryl (Connor Cruise) and proceed to hide out in a remote mountainous cabin that just so happens to shelter days worth of bullets, food, and other supplies just in case them North Koreans decide to drop in.\n\nWashington soon turns into a battleground, and we learn from seconds of disjointed news footage that the United States government has lost all control of their country. Koreans have detained citizens, constructed concentration camps with large signs reading \"YOU DESERVE TO BE HERE\" rather quickly, have shot hundreds of innocent people, destroyed a number of buildings, and have begun establishing new world order, calling out corruption and greed as the United States' reason for failing (also stating they're the ones who will help us). Isn't it nice to have a leader tell you your country's system has failed as him and his men have done us the kindness of dropping onto our soil and killing a number of innocent men and women, while trapping the ones they've let live in detainment camps? But ththeir ways are better and more fair than ours. Trust them.\n\nWhatever. It turns out Washington's fate rests in the hands of these brave teenagers, now calling themselves the \"Wolverines,\" after their high school football team, as they prepare themselves, retrain their reflexes, build bombs, and blow the hell out of a lot of Korean soldiers in an effort to take back their homeland. What I wondered throughout the whole picture was what the hell the Korean military was thinking and what they tried to accomplish by invading the U.S.? The Korean population is not even a fifth of the United States', and I doubt all their citizens are part of this militia, so why would they try to apprehend and attack a country so much larger than them, and what was their main goal? Imperialistic greed? That would be an act of hypocrisy towards their new policy they are trying to implement. What plan could possibly involve detaining citizens, killing them, blowing up buildings, and plastering their flag all over the country while reminding them they're there in the population's best interest? And do not get me started on the abundance of action sequences that are choppily edited, haphazardly choreographed, and pathetically compiled together trying to resemble something of a coherency timeline. Ever play a Call of Duty game? Join an online match, turn the volume all the way up, begin playing, and have someone shake the TV in the process and you got the action scenes in Red Dawn.\n\nSome will question whether or not this film improves over the 1984 cult hit and I will say in some cases it does. The tone is more serious and the invasion sequence is more suspenseful and a lot grittier than in the original picture. Both Chris Hemsworth and Josh Peck have been in some great films (hell, what hasn't Hemsworth been in this year?), and this genre of guerrilla action has scarcely seen brighter days, but the remake of Red Dawn is just as redundant and as tedious as the original film, only at least the original film had a valid reason for existing.\n\nNOTE: I find it amusing how this film has gone so far under the radar in terms of controversy when Larry Charles' The Dictator (released this same year) had so much criticism reflecting off of it and all it was was a raunchy satire, no more crude and raucous than such works as The Hangover: Part II or Project X. Considering which one is more realistic, although they both pack an incredulous resume, I'd expect to see Americans speaking poorly about a Red Dawn remake in the modern day; not rushing to see it.\n\nNOTE II: Visit my blog to see an analysis of both Red Dawn films to see which one I feel is the better film, http://stevepulaski.blogspot.com\n\nStarring: Chris Hemsworth, Josh Peck, Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas, Connor Cruise, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

The film contains action-packed, violence, crossfire, blow up and tensions build as the teens try to decide whether to surrender to the invaders or resist. This imagines about a Korean invasion of the American heartland by crack airbone troops . Is the dawn of World War III. There is a high school football player called Matt Eckert's (Josh Peck) who gets picked up by his girlfriend, Erica (Isabel Lucas), who's one of the cheerleaders in the school, and they go off to a party that night. While Tom (Brett Cullen) finds his returned son, US Marine Jed (Chris Hemsworth). From out of the sky, Korean troops begin landing in the United States. In a few seconds, the paratroopers have attacked the school and sent a group of teenagers fleeing into the mountains. They manage to pick up a few more people, including schoolmates Robert (Josh Hutcherson) and Daryl (Connor Cruise), as some other escapees follow them in another car. Armed only with hunting rifles, pistols, and bows and arrows, the teens struggle to survive the bitter winter and the military invaders . Patrols hunting for them. Eventually, trouble arises when they kill a group of soldiers on patrol in the highlands. In the west mountains of America, the group of teenagers band together to defend their town, and their country, from invading Korean forces. Soon they will wage their own guerrilla warfare against the invading Soviet troops under the banner of \"Wolverines!\". When Marines die, we go to hell and regroup!. This Thanksgiving, The Fight Begins At Dawn !. Welcome to the Home of the Brave !. In America, heroes aren't raised !. They're orphaned !.\n\nDespite scrupulously reconstructed battles and partisan raids, it military thesis is patently ridiculous. Exciting , entertaining and moving movie about an absurd invasion for invasion US that threatens American economic prosperity . The picture concerns a dangerous international terrorist army trying to destroy United States via some continued series of terrorist operations . It's a pulp movie of political war genre ; resulting to be quite bemusing . The history deals with cruel Korean soldiers causing destruction and panic , versus American patriots who fight strongly to vanquish them.\n\nThis is a routine and passable actioner, stars Chris Hemsworth as U. S. Marine Jed Eckert, resulting go be one of the best roles he'd made to date , as he's nice as tough, cold, stubborn soldier. He's well accompanied by a good cast of young newcomers who'll follow decent film careers, such as: Josh Peck, Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas, Connor Cruise, Alyssa Diaz, Edwin Hodge, Will Yun Lee playing a nasty , ominous korean villain and veterans as Brett Cullen, Michael Beach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.\n\nIt's a predictable , shallow and brainless film though will appeal to warlike enthusiasts because of it contains some excellent action sequences . An agreeable and entertaining film, but the plot is almost ridiculous and senseless but it's developed in fast moving and numerous surprises and that's why it is amusing enough.\n\nThis paranoia-political-thriller movie has precedent in those films of the 50s and 60s in which take place fantastic invasion on America as \u00a8Sinister invasion or Invasion USA (1952)\u00a8 by Alfred E Green and \u00a8Battle beneath the earth\u00a8(1967) by Montomery Tully . The motion picture takes part of a genre which in the 80s achieved splendor, thus : \u00a8Red Dawn\u00a8( by John Milius with Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe Tom Cruise) , US Invasion (by Joseph Zito with Chuck Norris) and \u00a8Amerika\u00a8 ( by Donald Wyre with Kris Kristofferson) where the communists -Russkies generally- execute invasion on America.\n\nThe film was mediocrely shot by Don Bradley, without any originality, being his only film as a director . Bradley is a stuntsman and stunt coordinator who has worked in a lot of films. Bradley was originally cast as Jason Voorhees in Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part 1986), however after only a few days of shooting, he was replaced by C. J. Graham, some of his footage remains in the film, as he plays Jason during the paint balling sequence. Rating Red Dawn. 5/10 . Passable but mediocre reboot."

If you are someone who saw the original and thought it was cool but like me, wouldn't mind seeing an updated version this isn't a bad one. I actually like some of it better then that original (The ending for one thing...which I always thought was a weakness of the original.) I much prefer how the remake ended and there are some action sequences that are to die for. Oh and the females in this have a larger role which is always good in my book. Look this isn't a perfect movie, it has its flaws but if you are in the mood for a good \"Ra Ra America! Action movie there are worse ones to watch"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie, as you know by now is based off a 1984 film of the same name. Chris hemsworth plays Jed Eckert, a veteran of the war in Iraq who is now home from combat. After being invaded by North Koreans he trains a group of teens including his younger brother Matt (who is played by Josh Peck) to fight back for their home. Reading the reviews from every body else it seems like they haven't seen the original because the \"flaws\" they point out are apart of the first movie. In the first it was a group of teens who fought against Russians. Another thing was that there was an even shorter IntroductIon to the characters In the original. It was just Jed dropping his brother and his brother's friend off at school, a short remark about how Matt had lost the game the night before and about a minute of a teacher teaching a class before the Russians are dropped In. Also they lived in an even smaller town than the one in this one which is another concern of these reviewers (because if someone invaded the U.S of course they would take over every city except for small towns *obvious sarcasm). The one thing I was mad about when I saw the previews was that it wasn't as small as the town in the original. That's one of the reasons why the original was so great. In my mind the citizens of a small town are even more likely to be a threat because they can actually do stuff and they know how to survive a lot better than the people in the cities can. I should know because I grew up In a small town and I live in the city now. I have a hard time finding out the reasons why people think this movie is so unbelievable. I mean yeah the EMP would take out all electronics and yeah it is a long shot to think a group of kids could do all that but does that mean it can't happen? I mean in Africa there used to be villages that were taken over by child soldiers. Also for the one person who said it doesn't seem possible that the North Koreans could do that in one night, I believe he has forgotten all about how we got into WWII with Pearl Harbor. Bottom line is it's Hollywood every movie has something unbelievable in it and it doesn't go to the point were it is unbearable to watch because of how unbelievable it is."

But Josh Peck, who plays Matt Eckert, really steals the show. You'll find Matt Eckert to be annoying, wimpy, hard- headed, sympathetic, and ultimately likable. And the remaining supporting actors does a decent job in rounding the cast.\n\nOverall Red Dawn is a fun film. I would not warrant a full purchase but if it's in the bargain bins it won't hurt to grab it."

I remember being a teenager in Colorado (where the original Red Dawn was set) when the 1984 movie came out, and felt like I could identify with the school aged clan fighting back against communist forces. That was a different time in history, with the cold war still being fought and living very real fears of the powerful Soviet empire. Both the original and the remake inspire patriotic feelings, with a re-emphasis on our desire as Americans to be free.\n\nMy only gripe about this film was its portrayal of North Korea as the enemy with whom the students engage in battle. My understanding is that the script was changed from its original enemy, who was likely China or a Muslim terrorist organization. And while there are economic reasons for making this change, i.e. many feature films bring in a majority of their gross revenues from outside the United States, there was clearly an element of political correctness in not portraying Muslim terrorists in a bad light. How pathetic of Hollywood to show this kind of weakness in a movie that is supposed to depict strength and courage.\n\nSo if you set your expectations for watching an action flick without a lot of character depth, you won't be disappointed."

Even if this was the original I would still hate but maybe 5% less. What made, at least the intro, of the original is that i had zero setup.

Add that to the worst US President to ever hold office, including Jimmy the Peanut Carter and a movie like Red Dawn had no more chance than the USA in a real life invasion. The author of the 1984 Red Dawn wasn't writing about Russia and Cuba invading the United States. His vision was that our own government would turn on the country. Possibly even aided by outside communist countries. As that likelihood comes closer to happening, Red Dawn will become less and less popular with critics.

If it wasn't for Chris Hemsworth, I would have just switched he movie off because I just cringed all the way through it, especially the corny ending. Badly written, Badly performed and unrealistic action. Terrible!\n\nRound-Up: I was quite impressed with some of the CGI in the beginning, but that was the only good thing. I am surprised that they released a movie about South Korea taking over America because I would have thought that would be a touchy subject. Anyway, I can't really remember the Patrick Swayze version of this movie, but it can't be this bad. None of the kids have has army training, but the all end up like proper little Rambo's by the end of the movie. It also picked up a bit once Jeffrey Dean Morgan got introduced, but not that much.\n\nBudget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $45million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there pointless action movies, but don't expect anything amazing. 2/10"

No. But every American kid born after the year 1995 should watch this movie.... and the original. Because Americans would be foolish to think that something like this is not a possibility. Russia, China, Iran, N. Korea.... they all would love a world without America.\n\nThe acting is freshman at best, but you shouldn't watch the movie because of it's acting, screenwriting, or realism.\n\n(Clearly the pro-China trolls have read this review - hence all the bad review that have appeared on this and some my other reviews - stay classy haters.)"

The storyline has been modernized but still a pretty well made film and a good concept of what an invasion might be like. The two biggest criticisms I would have are the fact that why the US military was never involved, this was never addressed in a film about an invasion by Korea on the US. The second would be the reactions to family deaths. Seemed to get over the fact the two close relatives were killed in front of them! Worth a watch though."

I typically dislike remakes and while I don't think this remake is better than the original, it's not terrible at all. It's actually pretty good. Chris H delivers along with several other actors and the interactions of them are believable and work.\n\nTechnically there are several errors which I guess goes back to the unthinking original choice to make China the bad guys. All said, I wouldn't go out of the way to watch it, but I'd definitely make time to watch it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Lets get this out of the way--the new Red Dawn is watchable, but barely. The cast is OK, but barely. The action scenes would be barely watchable if they weren't so badly edited to the point that you can not tell what is happening from cut to cut in each fight/action sequence that occurs. You get the general idea of what's happening--but there are so many times during each of the lets say four or five major action sequences where it looks like chaos is reigning. I don't know if this is a fault of the director not being good at staging these scenes--or not being good at the placement of the camera during these scenes--or if its the complete fault of the editor---i do not want to blame the editor because i read that the original first cut of this remake was nearly 4 hours along and had to drastically be cut down to fit the hour and a half running time that is this movie's current length. I am 100 percent positive that this could not have been easy on the editors who worked on this thing to whip it into a kind of shape so that the film could be released in theaters. I wish I could say that the sloppily choppily done action sequences were the only flaw in an otherwise watchable mediocre remake--but it really a huge flaw especially when these sequences more or less make up half the movie right there!\n\nits almost like a film from Dimension studios from the mid to late 90's in its editing--you remember Phantoms? It was watchable but it was hard to tell exactly what was happening in the big scenes--its a lot like that.\n\nOn a positive note tho I would like to point out that Chris Hemsworth makes a fine leading man in the film--he very much is the anchor that keeps this film from being completely and totally weightless--I'm not saying that he's a great actor but he does a fine enough job as the man whose chief job it is to whip everyone into shape--you believe him as his character and you believe he could form a good resistance group--unfortunately everyone else in the movie is either way too underused (Josh Hutchinson may as well be a background character for all the lines he actually has in this thing---he's supposed to be one of the lead resistance fighters but the film must have left a good number of his scenes on the editing floor because he really only a handful of scenes here) or just plain old bad--which brings me to Josh Peck as the second lead--Chris Hemsworth younger brother who's supposed to be the character who picks up the spark of resistance and runs with it. Josh Peck is really really wooden here---his character is supposed to have these really strong emotions--his entire world has been more or less been taken away from him!--but his um big heartfelt emotional scenes in which he expresses this are very much lacking in any kind of feeling. He smiles effectively tho--when he's taking a compliment or kidding around with his girlfriend at the beginning of the movie he's very convincing--unfortunately that's pretty much the last time in the movie he's convincing and by the end of the movie its kind of hard to believe that he's been truly changed by all the craziness that's happened. Still if the film had been better staged--I don't think I would have been so hard on him, because when the film isn't full of choppy action sequences its filled with scenes of Hemsworth sermonizing to his freedom fighters or scenes of Peck brooding, its not terrible but if the action scenes in Red Dawn aren't delivering, all the emoting in the world isn't gonna save the film.\n\nStill the film remains watchable in that you can watch it, think about what really would happen if some country in the east invaded us and how we would react, and pretty much forget it by the time you get home from the theater. ALSO WOLVERINES!!!!"

It's produced on a decent budget and there are a couple of well known names amongst the cast. The action is solid. Given its only 90 minutes long it can't hang around. It has one of those \"what if\" scenarios that have fascinated many film fans for a long time. This is a remake of the 1984 cult classic and instead of Russians, it's North Koreans invading US soil. In the 1940s it could have been the Japanese. Perhaps in the current climate they should have gone with the Chinese! But you could also think about recent apocalyptic tv series and also The Man in the High Castle for inspiration. The film moves pretty fast which is a shame because it doesn't have much time to develop the characters, so we're a little force fed at times but on the whole it passes for a quick action movie and I confidently give it 6 out of 10. Its worth a watch if you're stuck for what to see next and with Chris Hemsworth in the lead you can't go wrong. There's even a Walking Dead star in the third act that maybe keeps this film relevant. Watch it, enjoy it. There are plenty of dreadful high budget Netflix and Amazon films to wish you'd never watched, so why not."

It seems that the North Koreans decided to occupy Spokane and no one else in the US cared enough to help. There is virtually no American military presence.\n\nSpecial effects are decent, but the storyline is so improbable and cleansed of a good guys vs bad guys dynamic that you find yourself hoping this will end soon so you can leave."

Unfortunately that magic can't be manufactured and it's either there or it isn't.\n\nI wouldn't say this is as bad as some of the other reviews here on IMDB suggest, it's entertaining.

Do the actors a favor and pass on this flop so as you won't judge them in their future endeavors. Maybe in another 20 years someone will come around and make a version that actually captures the essence of gun collector fantasies and boyish hero daydreams. It's seems almost unsportsmen like to pick this movie apart, like prodding a wounded animal with a sharpened stick. There is nothing so bad about this movie that it should insult the viewer (Like the movie \"2012\" with John the Tool Cusack) however, if one has not seen the original version of Red Dawn, which the new one assumes of the viewer, then this 2012 version of Red Dawn should be utterly frustrating."

It's not the fault of the actors though, that the movie could not live up to the original (which did not age well itself).\n\nEven though you sort of get a new villain (sort of, \"instead\" of Russia) and one that is personified, it doesn't really touch you. The plot just doesn't fly. There are more holes here than in swiss cheese. It tries hard to explain things, which often times makes them even more ridiculous. Even the original knew better than that. Of course the action is updated as mentioned above, but is that enough for the lack of passion and the obnoxious use of the \"piece symbol\" (with fingers)? You have to answer that one yourself. Characters are not consistent and overall it's too \"smooth\" for its own good"

Look, I may not be interested in a documentary like 2016: Obama's America, but I can at least understand how a film like that plays into one view of what's going on in the country. But this new Red Dawn is utterly, scarily devoid of a basic understanding of current events. The movie plays up the fact that Jed is a Marine who did a tour of Iraq, which makes him an ideal leader for this ragtag bunch of pretty, vacant people squaring off against scowling North Koreans. But the way that the movie tells it, Jed was in Iraq to do, uh, heroic, awesome things. There's not even one moment in which Red Dawn troubles itself with the notion that perhaps the way Jed and his buds feel about these invading North Koreans is precisely the way the Iraqis felt about him coming to their country. At a time when everything from War of the Worlds to Battlestar Galactica has subversively retold the Iraq story by making the heroes the insurgents, Red Dawn just plows forward, confident in its belief that as long as America is in trouble, we can do whatever the hell we want."

Josh Peck is by far the worst actor i have ever seen and tbh his performances in Drake and Josh where by far more convincing than I've seen him in films recently, the guy is just awful and i will avoid any film in the future that stars him or in fact even has him as a extra, I cannot stress how awful this guy is, too sum him up hes living on the fact he lost loads of weight and thats it end of!!!

North Korea invading the USA just doesn't seem possible but remember this is a movie which all the other reviewers seem to be forgetting. So taking into account the unlikelihood of this scenario ever occurring and putting it aside the story is honestly not half bad.\n\nThe story is basically the North Koreans invading the USA. Somehow the national guard and army etc are all MIA and the USA civilians lost all their guns. Anyway the movie follows a group of teenagers who fight back against the NK's and bring hope to all. Decent storyline, okay execution and makes for an interesting movie.\n\nThe casting is probably the best part with Chris Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki and Isabel Lucas among others. Chris Hemsworth as expected does an amazing job and so does Josh Hutcherson, no complaints there. We also have the gorgeous Adrianne Palicki as well as evil decepticon girl Isabel Lucas who are both great in the movie.\n\nThe VFX and SFX are awesome. Love all the shooting and combat scenes. Looks pretty good and sounds good as well.\n\nOverall a 6/10 from me. Movie has an interesting scenario and storyline. Great cast and good effects.

Nowadays there seems to be other threat besides North Korea. So to put it plainly ahead of its time but executed sub par but still a fun watch and recommend it."

Really? REALLY?\n\nI'll start with the portrayal of women as weepy sycophants who bemoan their plight while the men stand around and comfort them. Not one of the guys in this movie cried, but every woman who entered the scene after the invasion was weeping.\n\nOne of the two leads is vapid(Jed) and the other is an idiot(I still can't remember his name--the younger brother).

And were supposed to believe that Matt would forsake everything for a girl? If that happened in the first movie, Robert would have shot him on sight. Nothing about this movie is believable.

Hollywood film makers think there are too much movies in which the U.S(mostly, I can't understand why) was occupied by some sort of alien, so they simply replace them with N.Korea army. Well, that was not a good idea. Hollywood is making more and more movie of this kind, and the plots are almost the same : the \"great nation\" of USA being threatened by someone (or something), and then some action heroes, or some \"brave\" teenagers jump out from nowhere, give a speech, then go kill some one/ destroy some thing, and that's it, the mother nation was saved, await some more invaders to come. I can believe this kind of film can be made by a U.S director. They invade Vietnam (and LOST), Iraq,... and then they make THIS? RIDICULOUS!! I would give this movie a zero if it possible"

        "review_detailed_main": "Say what you will about the original, but it's a masterpiece compared to this atrocious mess. Terrible acting (I'm looking at you Josh Peck), no character development what so ever, bad pacing, tons of plot holes, and very poorly film with way too much shaky cam. I can suspend disbelief in films, but when a film ask me to suspend my disbelief even further after already accepting the incredibly implausible and dumb plot by doing more things that simply just don't make sense, it seems that the writers just believe that the audience is stupid and won't question anything and that pisses me off. I could've rolled with it if it was being played as an over-the-top silly B-Movie, but it's being played off as a dead serious war film that feels more like watching watching two rival gangs fight than the two opposing forces that are presented to us. The only positive thing I can say about it is that Chris Hemsworth was at least trying with what he had to work with and the film never slowed down despite the poorly pacing. The only way I could ever recommend someone to watch this is if they want to watch a film thats laughably bad. Another positive I can say about it is that for the first hour, me and my buddies were laughing non-stop at how terrible the film was, but after about an hour, there really is no more material to make fun off anymore and it becomes a pain to sit through the last 30 minutes that lead up to the incredibly bad ending that tryings to be an emotional cheap-shot to get the audience to feel sad despite the fact that we don't feel anything for these characters since they are all undeveloped and mostly unlikeable. So even for laughs, it's a hard recommendation. Save your time and money! Avoid this horrible remake at all cost and just rent the original."

Instead of cheesy one-liners delivered by Arnold you get a huge bunch of patriotism and freedom loving. The story is still silly, probably more so than it was 28 years ago. But it's good enough to set the premise of being under siege.\n\nThe acting isn't stellar but it isn't terrible either and the casting works well enough to let you stereotype people. Which is important because the script doesn't really do much in the line of character development. It goes along the nice black and white lines of \"HE STRONK\" and \"HE EVIL\", and it's honestly alright in this type of movie.\n\nThe action and the guerrilla warfare really shine though, it's always adrenaline pumping and like the original the fighting isn't all fun and games.\n\nI loved the original and here 28 years later I'm loving this remake.\n\nOf course it's not the kind of movie you're going to look cool appreciating openly. That being said I'm sure it's perfectly fine to secretly love it."

        "review_title": "A propaganda movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Red Dawn\" is a lukewarm remake of a classic with an incredibly stupid story line when North Korean invaders attack the United States of America with the help of the Russians and impose their ideology. A few young men seek refuge in the forests and try to fight the invaders by organizing a guerrilla. In the beginning, they are very unexperienced and a few of them won't survive their brave acts which leads to important tensions within the team but the guerrilla gets better and better and finally decides to attack the main building of the enemies.\n\nThe positive thing about the movie is its short length and the fact that it never gets boring. The dialogues and the acting are a little bit weak but better than I would have expected. The action scenes are a little bit ordinary in the beginning but get better and better towards the explosive and entertaining end. I also liked the fact that the ending was rather surprising and dramatic. It's not your usual happy end and included two rather sad scenes even though the final message happens to be positive and warlike again.\n\nOn the negative side, the story is completely stupid and unreal and the movie's intentions are not a far call from propaganda movies of the Cold War which feels rather inappropriate in modern times of globalization. The American screenwriters still seem to think that their government is the best in the world and that anybody who disagrees such as communists are automatically evil. This kind of movie only supports the propagandistic ideas of the North Korean government who takes the Americans for their worst enemies. While the North Korean government slowly opens for economy, diplomacy and modernization, Americans are still stuck in the past and release this kind of questionable movie. Some people might identify with the closed minded attitude to fight anything and anybody who attacks your country at all costs and that's what creates more and more conflicts but I simply can't agree on that point. As a German I can only say that I'm glad that my own country which I still love and respect a lot got defeated during the Second World War and I wouldn't have defended it if I had been able to chose. It's always a mistake to blindly follow a government and accept anything it asks you to do. American governments have created lots of wars, sometimes with good, sometimes with bad intentions, and it's strange that such a story line comes from this country because they haven't been the victims apart of 9/11 which was a terrible incident but definitely not a year long war as what happened in Korea or Vietnam. When arts and politics mix, the final result is always extremely biased and that's also the case of this movie. I'm surprised that these kinds of stories are still written today and one simply can't ignore this aspect if one watches this film. If there wasn't the political dimension of this movie and if the invaders would have been anonymous, I would have given one more point to the flick but this movie is still only of an average quality.\n\nIn the end, I can only recommend this movie for those who are looking for a patriotic action flick. It's quite entertaining and gets better and better towards the end but the acting and the story are rather bad. Anything who expects a thought out story line or a strong acting shouldn't watch this movie. If you like war movies, you should go for the Korean \"Tae Guk Gi\" who shows you a very balanced and realistic view of what happened during the Korean War."

It appears that it might have, currently at 40 million at the box office. Josh Peck should have stayed fat and on Nickelodeon if this is what his going to put forth in terms of acting.\n\nI also read that it sat on a shelf for awhile and had to be re-edited to make the invading army North Korean instead of Chinese. Usually when I see movies like this, I can at least laugh. I was unable to at all. Save your money and watch the original on TBS next weekend, or every weekend for the next twenty years."

Just the thought of something like this happening is crazy, personally I would love to live this, the adventure, adrenaline and risk are all portrayed extremely well on the screen.

After some clich\u00e9's flickering TV news reel telling us how terrible North Korea is we're quickly introduced to a bunch of teenagers, played by much older actors for some reason, and in a big bar scene we're quickly thrown some hints of possible romance and sexual jealousy as well as a super quick reference to Iraq so we know who is going to be the leader of this band of teen heroes. The next morning suddenly we're propelled almost 50 years back in time and large WWII bombers are dropping thousands of soldiers out of parachutes into the small typically American town. Apparently they are actually North Korean soldiers invading the US.\n\nSeriously? Not with nuclear weapons or drones or computer hacking to cripple the US economy and infrastructure that we see them accused of every day in the news but somehow unnoticed they have flown across the Pacific and decided to do it old school, parachuting in thousands of troops to invade some small town. Although I've never seen the original I can guess the rest of the story as out band of teens are somehow going to defeat the 4th largest military in the world... who cares. I know this is supposed to be just a bit of fun but I can't have fun with something where the creators don't even seem convinced of their own proposal enough to think the basics through.

It was a wish-fulfilment fantasy, one which hasn't dated too well, so this rework sees the Russians replaced by North Koreans, although otherwise the storyline is much the same.\n\nUnfortunately RED DAWN has some huge problems which scupper it from the outset. Credibility is one thing - the film never gets over the problem that North Korea would never have the resources to launch an invasion like this - but the main problem lies with the characters. In a word, they're horrible. The producers have picked the most unappealing young actors of the modern generation (I'm talking about you, Josh Hutcherson) and given them scenes in which they're completely out of their depth. It hurts when the best and most veteran actor is Chris Hemsworth, a guy who would be merely average in any other movie.\n\nIt's a pity that the lack of decent characters had me hating this, because there's good stuff here. First-time director Dan Bradley is best known for his work as a stunt co-ordinator and yet he does a decent job here, particularly when it comes to crafting the superior action sequences. The use of CGI is very effective, and that early scene with the parachutes coming in is completely chilling. What a shame, then, that the action is wasted in such an insipidly-cast and predictable movie."

And I hope, that I won't be banned from IMDb for revealing such classified military information. So please guys, don't try to conquer USA this way at home: All you need is just some big planes, all of them hiding in the clouds for weeks. At day 0, just appear like from nothing everywhere in the air. And with a special super electric burst, just eliminate all communication systems. Now a with a surprise parachute attack, soldiers can conquer the US within 3 minutes, shooting from the air. Of course they would attack civilians only. Why? Because this way, US military is not involved! How smart! I mean, some of the soldiers probably don't even know they have been invaded. See: no communication, no idea what's going on.

Check mate.\n\nNow the real and stunning story: It begins, when a couple of high school students decide to free the country. They are outnumbered by whole armies of course. As the main character says, they have to be smart. And they are! They decide to use heroic-guerrilla techniques, which is much different then classic guerrilla techniques. You see, classic guerrilla would demand you hiding and attacking from distance, preparing bombs in the shadows and placing them at night. The heroic-guerrilla-techniques do all this, but in plain sight! And of course it involves opening fire on hundreds of soldiers with only a couple of teenagers. Why does it work? Because and true heroism can't be defeated and only the guilty hide! That deep message within this movie really got to me! Of course, the story gets complicated, when one of the teenagers wants to free his blond girlfriend. This way, he puts all his team at risk. And for what? For love! So it is also a love story, that broke my heart! And the blond was so convincing! I felt in love with her the moment I saw her on the bus. Definitely Oscar material!\n\nWell, some of you would think, this movie is a little bit discriminating, because the Asians seem to be the bad guys here \u0085 and the Russians \u0085 and the black mayor. But I think it is not discriminating. Because, the movie doesn't tell you whom to hate! The Koreans, the Russians \u0085 or the Chinese \u0085 or the black mayor. It's good, the movie doesn't discriminate just one race or country. It's totally up to you, whom to hate. You may want to hate all Asians or Russians. You may even want to hate yourself. That shows real quality, that you have that choice. I liked that philosophy on that movie and decided to hate myself in this situation. I was so angry at me! Thank you movie makers!\n\nThe movie has a lot of shootings, bombs and so forth. The whole time I was like: \"whoooo ... explosions ... cool! Ohhh, bad Asians, you are so mean, leave them alone ... ohhhh, love story, how neat, I want to cry. Ohhh, bad Russians, go away. Oh look, bombs again. Kill them .... ratatatatata ... ohhh yeah!\" It's good that the movie ends with the teenagers showing the piece symbol. That's the real message of the movie I guess. The movie shows you, that world peace is important ... and love of course \u0085 \u0085 and the right to carry automatic weapons ... and that we will all miss Sub Sandwiches, if the Asians take over.\n\nWhen the movie was over I was so sad, because so many good people died."

And the poor camera shots and mumbling are annoying.\n\nHemsworth did a great job though, he played the big bro ex-Iraqi war vet well.

Many people are just getting sick of favourite classics being redone in a more dumbed down way for a younger audience. Case and point - Red Dawn. When comparing the original to the remake, the remake is just plain garbage. For example the original captured the genuine fear and paranoia of the 80's when it came to the cold war. Russia was a believable enemy or even China but North Korea? For those who aren't ignorant about these things would know that would never happen, so it all sounds ridiculous.\n\nOther than the ridiculous plot line, the film like so many other remakes doesn't have anything unique about it to set itself apart from the original. The Red Dawn of the 80's also had better acting, character development, emotion and a darker tone compared to the remake. Red Dawn (2012) has terrible acting and unlike the original, I didn't care if most of the characters lived or died other than Chris Hemsworth. Not even Thor or the modernized action sequences can salvage this piece.\n\nOverall, if you liked the original I can't see how you could like the remake. I could only see this movie being liked by narrow minded conservatives, someone who plays too much COD: Modern Warfare or those who've never seen Red Dawn of 84'.\n\n2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Red Dawn may have one of the most appropriately ironic titles in movie history as it never should have seen the light of day again. Red Dawn originally came out in 1984 with big names like Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen, and was revamped in 2012 with Chris Hemsworth and Josh Peck. From an improbable war stratagem, we should have known better than to watch this movie.\n\nThe movie, originally directed by John Milius, is the story of how a motley group of teens becomes a formidable resistance force when their peaceful community is suddenly attacked by the Russians who, in the 80s, were still under scrutiny after the Cold War. Writers Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmore made the North Koreans the invaders in the 2012 movie.\n\nThe 2012 version opens to a football game in which Matt (Josh Peck), a hot-headed senior quarterback, sees his older brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) after his return from a tour in Afghanistan. After this brief introduction to the brothers, we are immediately thrown into a full \u2013scale invasion early next morning by North Korean Paratroopers, bombers, and tanks. Focusing on the logistics of an invasion of that magnitude, this movie is suggesting three rather improbable things. First, the US military's defense system must have been knocked out by the North Koreans. The idea that North Korean forces could hack into a system that formidable countries like China and Russia have failed to gain access to is laughable. Second, the US's invasion into Normandy, the largest invasion in military history, was about an 8 hour flight. The flight from North Korea to Washington is about 12 hours. This flight is nigh impossible for the amount of resources in North Korea, and certainly impossible with the US's Navy patrolling the entire Pacific Ocean. That brings up the third obstacle the North Koreans would have had to climb over \u2013 the US's Navy. Known as the best Navy in the world, US vessels would have to be sunk by the invaders on the way from Korea to Washington so they would not alert the US of the invasion. Put all of these hurdles together, and the sheer audacity of the invasion should sink in. For the sake of dramatic illusion, let's say that we ignore the implausible invasion. The action scenes in the movie are more explosive than the original, but some are unbelievable. For example, when the rebels conduct an ambush that happens right outside of the town the North Koreans have occupied there is gunfire that the guards at the gate adjacent apparently didn't hear. They also have a series of shots in which the rebels are training and practicing shooting. Why doesn't anybody hear the gunshots? What about all of the ammo they waste practicing? We as movie goers shouldn't blame anyone but ourselves for watching a revamp of a movie in the 80s like Red Dawn. Instead, we should make conscious decisions on what we watch. Take the lesson from me: refuse to be tricked into wasting the next two or three hours the next time you sit down to watch Netflix with a bowl of popcorn; and look into your movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really don't understand why people moan about films like this being unrealistic. All films are for entertainment, if they made them real there wouldn't be many films made. I would also miss films like The Avengers and that would suck! Just a point. Original had Cuba invade America with help from China. This one had N Korea invade with help from Russia. Russia & China are as big as America. Just a wee point for fact based realists.\n\nThe only worry I had was how it would live up to the original. I think if people haven't seen the 1984 version, they may enjoy this better. Unfortunately I am a fan of the original and this is another film remake that doesn't do the first one justice.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it isn't that bad, but there is a lot that it fails on.\n\nI felt the first allowed you to get to know and relate to the characters more. There are some reviews I agree on, Josh Peck really wasn't too convincing with the character Charlie Sheen played. Chris Hemsworth done a reasonable job on the Patrick Swayze character, but I felt for Patrick's character more.\n\nThe same goes for the character Robert, originally played by C. Thomas Howell. This was one of the main characters in the 1984 film. There wasn't the same intensity with Josh Hutcherson. I don't blame the actors for this but the writers and director.\n\nEach character grew on you in the original and you liked, loved, or hated them. I didn't get that feeling for any of the ones in this version.\n\nThis film was obviously rushed in production, and it just didn't flow as good as the original. There was nowhere near as much tension. In fact I don't think there was enough at all never mind compared to the original.\n\nI give this a 5 cause it is watchable and people will enjoy it, but was miles away from being better or even as close to the 1984 version. It saddens me to see remakes like this as they obviously just try to cash in on the popularity of the classic.\n\nHaving someone who hasn't Directed before maybe didn't help. Too late now, unless someone gambles on another remake. I just hope if someone takes another one of my favourite films that they can actually do it justice.\n\nJust felt I had to write this as I am a fan of the 1984 film and disappointed in another ballsed up remake (although don't agree that it is that bad)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Red Dawn (2012): A Red Dawn of Disappointment, Starring Josh Peck's Whining\n\nAh, the 2012 Red Dawn remake-a film that tried to capitalize on 1980s nostalgia and instead gifted us the cinematic equivalent of reheated leftovers. The plot is the same: America gets invaded, teenagers become guerrilla warriors, and we're supposed to root for them. But this version's biggest failing is putting Josh Peck front and center as the supposed hero.\n\nPeck plays Matt Eckert, a character who's supposed to be brooding and conflicted but instead comes off as a petulant teenager perpetually on the verge of a tantrum. Every scene he's in feels like it's punctuated by his whiny, breathless attempts to convey emotion. Whether he's screaming at his brother (played by Chris Hemsworth, who deserved better) or trying to rally the troops, Peck delivers each line like he's still stuck in a bad Drake & Josh episode-mouth agape, eyes wide, and voice straining to be taken seriously.\n\nThere's a specific brand of irritation that comes from watching someone who thinks they're carrying the movie when, in reality, they're dragging it down. His character's stubbornness isn't endearing-it's grating. By the time he's barking orders at people, you just want to shout back, \"Shut your stupid gaping mouth and let someone else take over!\"\n\nIt's almost impressive how a single performance can be so jarring that it makes the entire invasion of North Korea (yes, North Korea...) feel less threatening and more like an inconvenience. The rest of the cast, from Hemsworth to Jeffrey Dean Morgan, does their best to salvage what they can, but Peck's presence is like a constant mosquito buzzing in your ear-distracting and impossible to ignore.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a masterclass in how to take a decently-budgeted action movie and sink it with miscasting, look no further than Red Dawn (2012). And if you value your sanity, avoid any scenes where Josh Peck tries to do anything heroic-it's a painful reminder that sometimes, the enemy isn't the invading force; it's an annoying protagonist who just won't shut up."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mindset before movie: I watched the first \"Red Dawn\" for the first time about 2 years ago. I enjoyed it, it had some really good action and the story is a great idea. Was I surprised there would be some sort of follow up? Not really. I was pretty excited to find out Hemsworth was in it, \"Cabin In The Woods\" and \"Thor\", his career is shaping up nicely. The recent remakes and sequels have shown me that the passion of making a good movie is more and more becoming the passion of making a good buck with the 'real' filmmakers being way too few with far between, with that in mind my expectations were hopeful but in doubt.\n\nMindset after movie: Not bad. I felt a strong presence of the original throughout with the wardrobe, haircuts and action sequences. Hollywood decided to take the original and mix it up with some more current events while ignoring some of the military and technological advances of the past 30 years(because then they would have had to re-write a lot more of the story and who wants to put in that kind of effort?) The action was just as solid and of course the special effects were a lot better. My biggest problem with this movie, as it exists with many others coming out of post-production these days, is the way too over-dramatic acting. I've yet to meet anybody in the real world who talks or responds to situations in any style resembling these types of characters, I know it's a movie, it just makes it hard to relate to the characters I'm supposed to relate to. I found myself not even caring about the characters (I don't blame the actors because they all acted this way... which means the fault lies between producers, director and writer(s)). I was still sucked in by a story good enough to justify all the crazy action sequences, I even caught myself cheering aloud at some of the scenes; there were some really good ones.\n\nIf you're like me and are a big fan of the original \"Red Dawn\" you will probably find the new \"Red Dawn\" is a lot like the old one, just a little more current. If you couldn't give two craps about the original's existence and you like action, you will enjoy this movie because it has most of what you're looking for. I'm still not sure if this remake(or whatever) was entirely necessary but Hollywood is running out of ideas so everything is necessary, apparently. The ideas don't have to be good, they just have to make money....\n\n...our world is dying..."

Part of the reason why was my belief that a remake of John Milius's Cold War classic was not only unnecessary, but pointless. The reports about the production problems didn't help, while the delay in its release underscored the sense that this movie was a bad idea. Eventually, though, I decided to give it a chance. And even with my lowered expectations, I was disappointed. It didn't help to see such a great cast wasted. How someone could take actors with the caliber of Chris Hemsworth, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Adrianne Palicki, and Josh Hutcherson - to name just the most prominent ones - and still produce such a lousy film is truly amazing.\n\nTo me the problem is not that the movie was insufficiently faithful to the source material. If anything, it was too faithful. Too often I found myself watching scenes that were little more than inferior imitations of ones from the original movie. If the producers really wanted to remake the film, they needed to do more to justify its existence than adding an annoying teen romance subplot and a MacGuffin hunt that was utterly devoid of narrative interest. You can add this to the long list of examples of why remakes more often than not are a waste of money and effort. It certainly doesn't help when the filmmakers completely miss what it was that made the first film so memorable."

And in this this movie exceeded my expectations.\n\nYes, it is very unlikely that the North Koreans could invade the mainland of the United States, but I understand that the original antagonist was suppose to be Communist China, until the Peoples Republic caught wind of the plot and threatened the movie producer. But knowing this and still seeing the movie then ones expectations should be moderated.\n\nSo for a quick plot recap, the North Koreans invade the Western USA while Russia apparently invades the Eastern Coastline. A bunch of high school students in Spokane form a guerrilla group calling themselves the \"Wolverines\" after their high school nick name.\n\nYes, the plot is somewhat unrealistic. But there are several good points about the movie.\n\n1. The acting was not as all around bad as some of the others would have you believe. The acting was OK. Chris Hemsworth (Jed Eckert) was pretty good, and his acting skills salvaged the movie. Also there was some good supporting acting from Brett Cullen (Eckert's Dad), Michael Beach (The mayor) and Jeffery Dean Morgan (the Soldier). Will Yun Lee played a menacing Captain Cho and showed his best acting when under pressure from his general (that story should have been developed more). In some sense it was like Adrianne Palicki and Isabel Lucas were in the wrong movie, but that was probably due to the weakness of the plot.\n\n2. While watching the movie and realizing that we (the USA) are just concluding military incursions into Iraq and Afghanistan. In both of those countries we have experienced insurgency problems, whose insurgents were likely saying the same things to their people that the Hemsworth character was saying to the Wolverines. So in a strange sense this is the movie of the occupied made in a way where those people are sympathetic to the viewer. It is a perspective which one does not get in American movies.\n\n3. The 1984 RED DAWN is an artifact of a time when an invasion of America was more plausible. It was so much more in American popular culture that there were actually board games made on the subject such as \"Invasion America\" and \"Fortress America,\" (games where the communist world gangs up and attacks the USA). This is THE MOVIE for those games.\n\nMany of the reviewers were exceptionally hard on the movie, so I am guessing that they were expecting some other type of movie. If you can suspend common sense for the premise and not take the movie too seriously then its not a bad rental. I am sure this movie will become very inexpensive. When it does I might pick it up and keep it in my copy of Fortress America.\n\nThe truth is I've seen movies that were a lot worst."

On the very next day, the North Korean army then invade the small town after conveniently losing all their electrical power. Jed then led his small group of teens to fight against them naming themselves the \"Woverines\" after the North Korean gov't is asking them to join up onto their cause. If anyone were to look at the customs of the North Korean army would know that the way this film portray them is absurd, just like how my dad told me that Russians don't fly their helicopters low. I mean, since when did old customary North Korea begin to know anything about operating computers, since as of right now they have a hard time conserving whatever resources they have such as electricity and food. In the original \"Red Dawn\" movie, it's the school that's taken hostage, in this one it's the whole town where they don't even lock everyone up- they just try to use old style and don't work manipulation. And then some rebelled, by acting like terrorists by planting automatic explosive devices. I was somewhat into this film, until the stupidity regarding one of the characters who chose to save his so-called girlfriend. This film also has some inconsistencies such as if a planting beeper was implanted into this student before, how come it wasn't used until much later into the film. And if any of the soldiers of the North Korean army were killed, they would've killed some of the local residents which is peculiar why the army didn't do that. Theirs some nice action set pieces but hard movie to accept if they're that many inconsistencies."

But about the movie, they really try hard to make it work, even though the original cannot be bestes as it wd a timeless peace of it's own time and cannot ever be made again to what it was back then. So with a final salute to Patrick Swayze and that great cast of back then that brings tears to the eyes of my 15 year old self. I admit that Red Dawn is my favourite movie of all times, and i do mean the original. I do like this remake though, the kids seem to have taken it all to heart and i can see they are good actors.\n\nVery convincing but ultimately unrealistic, who wozld ever invade a country armed to the teeth like the US?\n\nIr's just insane as in Invasion USA back in the day. Far more realistic is a scenario with terrorists or religious fanatics, or both. Now that,s a 9 11 kind of reality that sends chivers down your spine, maybe a little Hams and Irn si you would have tge common events covered. Anyway watchibg this flick was well worthy of my time and writong e review for you guys is also an effort well worthy of my time.

I heard my dad \"tsk\" a few times and even I rolled my eyes over the original but this one I did not. The acting of some of the cast surprised me as I have not seen them before like Conner Cruise or Josh Peck whom to me is the kid \"from that Nick show\" my daughters watched.

Ever-increasing budgets and declining domestic audiences have forced studios to look for box office success abroad. \"Aimed at Bangkok and Bangalore as much as at Bangor,\" David Denby recently wrote in the New Republic, \"our big movies have been defoliated of character, wit, psychology, local color.\" He's right. But it is not only the adult dramas championed by Denby that have been sapped of their vitality; action films, too, have seen plot and character sacrificed for commerce.

You don't tell your boss that the person's rank literally when a higher rank person comes in. Even it's \"Ten-hut\" in English, do you really think it's \"general\" to give attention to the room?

I do understand that the original is FAR more liked and I do intend on watching it down the road, IN FACT even sooner that intended after watching this!\n\nRed Dawn is about a group of young, hip kids living in Spokane, Washington; life couldn't be more simple and carefree. Chris Hemsworth and Josh Peck play Jed and Matt Eckert, the former of which, is a marine coming home after 6 years in Iraq. There are other, pointless, forgettable characters and Josh Hutcherson, who seemed really miscast in this movie, but more on that later. One day, out of the sky come North Korean infantry, guns a blazing and taking over the small Washington town and inevitably the entire Free World. However, Mr. Thor says nay and rounds up a random group of his little brother's class mates to fight the North Korean menace and take back their homes as The Wolverines!\n\nMAN! Talk about missed opportunity. I would be lying if I said that there weren't parts of this movie I didn't enjoy. Mindlessly, I gloss eyed over the explosions and the PREMISE of a foreign invader just up and taking over America, it's a scary but intriguing idea, again I will see the original film very soon.\n\nSure, Chris Hemsworth is in it and he isn't too bad as the lead role, though there was one performance in this movie that stood out in a bad way. Josh Peck, was once the chubby kid on Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh show, where over exaggerated acting and attempt at comedy drowned his camera time. Now, he's 2nd to his on screen big bro Hemsworth and completely misses, his dramatic face is laughable, he can't deliver a good dramatic tone, and his character's story line with the girlfriend just angered me with it's unnecessary existence. Josh Hutcherson, you know the guy who starred in another 2012 movie before this one, The Hunger Games, should have played the young brother. He's no Colin Firth himself, but you'd think after being in the next big franchise like HG, the filmmakers here would've put him as second billing under the Son of Oden. Every other actor/character in this movie is throwaway, no character development with any of them mixed with bland dialog made me cringe at every scene that didn't have bullets flying.\n\nThat was my biggest gripe, everything else just kind of adds a nasty smell to the Josh Peck turd. The film had a decent budget, I believe over 60K, and it doesn't really show. This movie looks like an overblown Michael Bay movie and at the same time feels really cheap. A darker color palate and perhaps some better camera work could give the movie a gorilla style look and add some much needed grit.\n\nThere are plenty of action scenes, but with no emotional tension or care for any of the characters, it all seems pretty wasted. Now let me say, I didn't completely dread the entire viewing; like I said some of the action was pretty cool and the idea of a foreign attack effecting rural America could make for a pretty interesting movie.\n\nI can only rate this as an average action movie, hopefully watching Patrick Swayze kick some Russian butt will save the Red Dawn name for me."

He can't even reveal the right emotions for the role he's given. The only reason i sat through this movie is because I needed to pass time so I could get ready for work. It would have been better if I just sat there staring at my wall. The characters make you want to jump into the screen and smack them all because they are not giving me what I paid for. Chris Hemsworth really tried to save this movie, but nothing came of it. I'm shocked it's rated higher than BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 3.\n\nDON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE, PLEASE!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved the original Red Dawn. It wasn't the greatest movie ever made but it was a great action movie. The plot for this movie has so much potential that can be lived up to. The original did a good job but there was certainly room for improvements.\n\nWhen I first heard about the remake coming, I was initially excited. When I began to hear about the casting, I lost a lot of luster for this film. Chris Hemsworth isn't the worst pretty-boy actor out there but he's by no means a good actor. He's definitely an, \"in the moment\" pretty boy that will probably pass. Josh Hutcherson is just a flat out bad actor. The kid lacks emotion. Or at least the right emotion for the right scene. Josh Peck has actually turned out to be a good actor but the fat kid from Josh and Drake just isn't the right casting for a young Charlie Sheen's replacement.\n\nSo when the trailers for the movie came out my worst fears appeared to be confirmed. The movie appeared to be action'd up, CGI'd up, glazed over depth and more of a paycheck movie than something someone in the making process actually felt inspired by. I didn't watch the remake I was once excited to see in theaters. After bad reviews I didn't even rent it on BluRay when it came out. Instead, I decided not to watch it. Eventually when TV watching was hard up and it was free I watched the movie. My worst fears were confirmed but it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.\n\nThe best way to describe this movie is with an analogy. The \"bad guys\" parachuting into the town would have been a powerful emotional scene if the bad CGI hadn't taken me out of it. Everything in this movie was close to being good but something (i.e. CGI, bad acting, pointless action, not reaching for enough depth) took me out of it and kept it from being as good as it could/should have been.\n\nOverall not horrible, but a below average movie. All this can be blamed on the director or whomever was controlling him. There was some bad acting. Chris Hemsworth was as usual, towing the line between descent and bad. Even that falls onto whoever was in charge of this project.\n\n4 of 10 - A lot of failed potential that overall just missed the mark."

        "review_detailed_main": "Red Dawn 2012 is a very underrated action film that actually does better than the original Red Dawn. Reviewers and critics alike panned the film for its plot. However, the film resembles the recent 2011 video game \"Homefront\". The game was not panned for its setting and time line, which the film follows similarly. This does not make much sense, since both are related in writing material and plot in one or more ways.\n\nThe film is a blast and is very entertaining. The plot makes more sense than the original Red Dawn and you have to watch further to get the whole clear picture. Film critics and moviegoers alike are spoiled from some modern films, since most films hand the viewer the plot on a silver plate the first few minutes or half hour of the film. The film's action is brutal and very entertaining and the thought of a North Korean occupation scares me, since North Korea doesn't take too kindly to Americans or Westerners in general.\n\nThe acting is great and kudos to Josh Peck for giving his best film performance yet. Though the rest of the cast did a great job, Josh Peck deserves some special attention, since Red Dawn is basically his first huge big-budget action/war film. Well done to you Josh and I wish Drake was in there as well so that you can through one of your famous lines in there! XD Overall, the film is great. Great action, along with a sensible plot that everyone seems to ignore and good acting performances, especially to Josh Peck, make Red Dawn one of the most under-rated action films in recent memory. Red Dawn enters the list of The Most Under-Rated Action Films of the 2000s and 2010s, joining \"A Good Day to Die Hard\" and \"Battleship\" in my personal list."

So I didn't bother when this movie was making its rounds. I took heed to the critics (and the IMDb masses) and for once it paid off. Fast forward to today\u0085. It's a snowy Sunday in the Midwest and I was bored. Scrolling through Netflix I stumbled onto Red Dawn (2012) and since I wasn't paying extra for the opportunity I decided to give it a go. Now, it's over and I was wrong. I DID pay for it by wasting 2 hours that could have been better spent watching Gigli or Disaster Movie. I have never universally rooted for bad guys in any motion picture until today. For 2 hours all I could think of was Ian McDiarmid's line from Star Wars EP-I, \"wipe them out... all of them\". The plot was weak (although the premise is still intriguing), the plot holes are too many to mention, the 'shaky-cam' made me seasick, Ramin Djawadi's soundtrack was bland, the acting mediocre, and CGI overload which normally covers a multitude of sins didn't help. If you want to see a bad movie, check out Red Dawn (1984). But it you want to see something really bad, watch Red Dawn (2012)."

        "review_detailed_main": "This remake of the 1980's cold war paranoia era feature film that starred Patrick Swayze, among others, isn't a patch on its predecessor. The original film, while not a classic, was an enjoyable movie about a fictional Russian invasion of the USA in a barely plausible non-nuclear war scenario.\n\nHere we follow in a similar set up, its the Chinease (Opps we changed our mind in post) I mean a pan-Korean led coalition or something. America is invaded from the skies while all its electronic defences are knocked out. In the films most spectacular scene as paratroops fall from the sky a group of local college youths assisted by an older (marine) brother soon flee to the mountains and start a guerrilla war. However what could have been a fun film is soon spoil-ed by some obvious plot holes and glaring scene omissions that are obviously as a result of the fact that the production shut down before all the filming was completed. Some characters seem to just disappear and scenes which should obviously been included are not. The ending just seemed like it was cobbled together in an edit room at the last minute so the film could be released. This time the group has to steal the device responsible for making the bad guys immune to the black out in the first place.\n\nPeople have made comparisons to 'Tomorrow, When the War Began' but you have to remember that this movie actually shot first, and also the original Red Dawn came out in 1982/83 so such claims are unfounded. Tomorrow is actually a much better film than this as the characters are more solidly defined. Here, there isn't much of an arc for anyone and while there are a couple of good action sequences, the film doesn't have the feel of scale as its predecessor. There's no chases with Hind gunships in this movie. The actors acquit themselves well, considering the trite dialogue they have been handed, but I was expecting a much better film than what is served up here. Special mention should go to Connor Cruise (I didn't realise he's Tom's son, and stop calling him, his adopted son people, he's just his son, adopted or not!) He puts in a good performance as the conflicted Daryl whose father has gone over to work for the other side. I suspect there was much more to be filmed that never went before the lens when the production shut down, and that's a shame. Whatthere is, the opening invasion sequence not withstanding, is, alas,instantly forgettable."

Any time anything happened that had even a slight bit of suspense or action, they had the camera rocking at least 45 degrees. Because of this you couldn't really see everything that was going on in the action scenes, which is the part that interests me the most.\n\nAnother of my pep peeves is the lack of character development in most of the characters. The younger brother and one of the other kids are probably the only ones that actually developed.\n\nIts worth going to see but could haven been so much better."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really ought to re-watch the original 1984 version of \"Red Dawn\" again, even if it were only to see if that one annoys me just as much as the remake does. I saw the original already, but it must have been nearly 20 years ago or something, and back then my standards for plausible plots and misplaced patriotism must have been set a lot lower. The only things I remember from the 1984 \"Red Dawn\" are awesome action sequences and performances from the utterly cool Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen. The 2012 version has pretty much the same plot, except that the evil Soviets have been replaced by evil North Koreans for obvious political reasons. I can imagine how that brainstorming session at United Artists headquarters must have gone: \"Let's take North Koreans as the opponents. We don't know anything about them except that they are not allowed to watch American movies on television, so they'll never find out anyways\u0085\" The \"Red Dawn\" movies have the most implausible and ridiculous plots imaginable, but only like this they can shamelessly glorify the true American patriotism! History has made it unmistakably clear that warfare through ground troops invasions are guaranteed suicide missions. If you want to claim another nation as your own, you drop bombs \u2013 preferably nuclear ones \u2013 from planes. Those awful North Koreans clearly didn't learn anything from Napoleon's or even Adolf Hitler's defeats and nevertheless decide to invade America's heartland by dropping thousands of soldiers with parachutes. In Spokane, a sleepy little Washington State town, a handful of teenagers fight back. They call themselves the Wolverines and exist of the two Eckert brothers and their girlfriends, the mayor's son, the town nerd and a few other members of the football team. The self-acclaimed leader is a former mariner, so I can still accept his killer instincts, but the other teenagers' transformation from regular American kids into relentless military killing machines by far surpasses my suspension of disbelief. All the American born actors with distant Asian roots (Will Yun Lee, Steven Chan, Cindy Chu\u0085) must have been desperate for work and the tagline \"Heroes are made in America\" nearly makes me nauseous."

The movie is about the North Korean army invading America with the help of other communist countries such as Russia. And a band of teens and one marine dude is trying to put a stop to them by destroying the North Korean army plans. So the high school teens and a marine dude create this freedom fighter team called the Wolverines. And constantly attack the North Korean army that invaded their turf. But this is done in a way where just about nothing makes sense and the invaders act like they want to be shot. Because they walk around like open targets when they know dangers all around them. Sure some movies have villains that make incompetent moves but this is just way way too much. It gets too much to the point it can even give you a headache. This might have worked as a video game but as a movie it fails. All the characters are underdeveloped and the comradeship is just so darn weak. I didn't care who lived or who died. Just pass on this one, unless you want to see a movie that annoys you. One of my co-worker said this movie looks so dumb when we first saw the trailer before the screening of \"Skyfall\" but what I didn't expect was how this flick takes the word dumb to another level.\n\n3/10"

I thought that all the actors did a great job in making their characters seem authentic. I would recommend this film to anyone who liked the original as well as other similar type story lines. In this day and age such an event as the film depicts isn't too unbelievable. I was very pleased with the entire production."

Suspending disbelief is pretty much a requirement for most movies to some degree, and I don't really know where you live and what it's like there, but before the first North Korean soldier could invade just my subdivision, the firepower he would encounter out the windows of all the second story bedrooms would be enough to flatten an infantry company, so an invasion of the entire US by North Korea is really a stretch. And if my high school English teacher is on here, that sentence was fine...just a little long. It did my heart good, though, to see Jeffery Dean Morgan in a bit part in a terrible movie when he gave up a great recurring role in the TV series Supernatural (now in its 7th season) because he was \"better\" than that and wanted to be a big star."

        "review_detailed_main": "While the original was no great shakes due to over-length and extreme lapses in realism, it had its share of amazing 80's action and some good production values and ideas here and there. It was the first movie I'd seen to tackle the prospect of a ground war on American soil and an ensuing insurgency against foreign occupiers. The fact that it came at the height of the Cold War gave it a sort of historical relevance as well. It had a great supporting cast and an okay central one of up-and- comers who went on to a lot of bigger things. It also had the benefit of no-nonsense direction from John Milius and a fitting score by Basil Poledouris.\n\nThis remake has none of that. No excitement, poor casting, zero characterization, bland music, shaky camera work, and of course CGI overload. It's everything bad in modern action movies focused and amplified into one mindless excuse to show a bunch of pretty people stand around whining and brandishing weapons. None of the action scenes have any life, originality, and a lot of the last portion of the film is so vague, tiresome, and too dark to even make out what is going on and to whom and why it is even important.\n\nMost unforgivably, the film was altered in post-production by cowardly MGM executives, changing the Chinese invaders into North Korean ones in order to not insult the Chinese market, though if the the Chinese censors were smart they'd still ban this disaster anyway for fear of damaging the minds of their population. This alteration takes an already implausible film into the realm of the preposterous and laughable. It may have been fascinating if there was any analysis on the North Korean military, culture, occupation etc. but the circumstances of this last minute change make that impossible. It's so underwritten that it misses major chances to add any interest into the concept, focusing instead on a bunch of macho posturing, teen angst, and infighting.\n\nI had the feeling that the writers were even younger and less experienced than the teenagers the film was aimed at, especially considering the film features a working Subway restaurant functioning in North Korean-occupied America! Even behind the battle lines in an apocalyptic war-zone, the franchise food and soft drink distribution remains completely undisturbed? Or are the employees growing and harvesting the grain for the 7-grain wheat bread on the roof of the building?\n\nDon't waste your time, even for a laugh. This film is so bad it will just make your head hurt. I'm consistently amazed by how much money can be spent on objects of so little value. Some heads at MGM surely rolled because of this, but of course nobody learned any lessons outside of outsourcing more work on the next terrible movie in order to cut costs."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a case were curiosity gets the better of me. I own the original Red Dawn from 1984 on DVD. I was a big fan of that movie which today has become a cult classic. I knew this remake was gonna be bad, yet I went to see it with some friends simply cause its an action flick. My advise, keep you expectations low and understand what this film is. It's a silly film, it was fun, but trust me it's still a bad film. The storyline, the pacing, the acting, Character development an execution is really bad. I think Red Dawn (2012) could have been so much better with the right people involved in the project, instead things just seem half baked or not well thought out. In the end we get a clich\u00e9 action flick with the feel of a B-Movie.\n\nThe Original Red Dawn from 1984 was set during the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. So as far fetched as it was it was \"small\" possibility that the Soviet Union and it's communist allies could invade the United States. I guess many saw it as a worst case scenario. In the remake the invaders were originally suppose to be Chinese, but at the last minute the film makers changed the invaders to North Koreans. Being that China would ban any film that depicts them as in such a hostile manner, the film makers made an attempt to get this film into the lucrative Chinese market. Well i didn't work. Even in the near future how would North Korea Invade the United States? That idea seems so ludicrous seeing how North Korea is a small country that is basically bankrupt, and struggling to feed it's own people In the film its suggested that the North Koreans are part of a multi-national coalition, so their assisted by stronger nations like Russia & China. Still how the hell could they bring their forces across the ocean, and how could the United States with it's capabilities not notice a massive buildup of that magnitude. Based on what I saw in the film the enemy invades within less then a day which is quite impossible. The North Koreans come off more like bond villains then the ruthless professional army they are known to be. They also aren't wearing North Korean Army uniforms. The story line seems half baked, and they throw in this last minute plot near the end with the Marines. The acting is pretty bland and boring. It seemed like a bunch of young model looking brats running around looking cool with guns. The bad guys are over the top and the good guys are underwhelming. We really don't know these people except for the brothers. On the other hand the original is far more developed in it's story, characters, and action scenes. Also the original had a much more darker & serious tone then the over the top clich\u00e9 style of this remake.\n\nHow would I have done this film? Well the North Koreans should be more of a supporting role as auxiliary troops like the Cubans & Nicaraguans were to the Soviets in the original Red Dawn. The Invaders should have been Russians in a large coalition. Even after the end of the Cold War our relations with Russia are fragile even sometimes hostile, and it would keep in style with the original. In respect the invaders should be treated with more humanity so the film doesn't come across as over the top American patriotism and like were demonizing other countries. Instead of being set in Spokane, Washington I would like to see a major city such as New York City or Los Angeles being invaded. I would like to incorporate themes like 9/11, the War on Terror, the Iraq War, the Occupy movement, so as to make this a more meaningful film in todays standards. Yes the original Red Dawn was silly but the characters were well thought out, the action was great, the story was well written. Red Dawn (2012) could have been a much better film, unfortunately we just get another stupid remake of a superior film. Watch this film somewhere for free just for a laugh."

It is an American in-your-face extravaganza at its best. As a red blooded male who eats steak I loved each and every minute of it. Overall a 9/10 and I will be buying this on BluRay/DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had to write a review for \"Red Dawn\" because not only do you chose to remake a terrible original movie \"Red Dawn\" (1984), starring Patrick Swayze, the remake is just as awful. We all understand remakes are a given--but's it's horrible to begin with, currently irrelevant--and just as bad. It's so bad it's almost good because it's so hilariously bad.\n\nA city in Washington state awakens to the surreal sight of foreign paratroopers dropping from the sky - shockingly, the U.S. has been invaded and their hometown is the initial target. Quickly and without warning, the citizens find themselves prisoners and their town under enemy occupation. Determined to fight back, a group of young patriots seek refuge in the surrounding woods, training, and reorganizing themselves into a guerrilla group of fighters. Taking inspiration from their high school mascot, they call themselves the Wolverines, banding together to protect one another, liberate their town from its captors, and take back their freedom. The nature of the invasion quickly becomes clear. The velocity of events picks up considerably, however, in an endless and mindless combat sequence--in which the Wolverines prove to be fierce combat troops, and the North Koreans are reassuringly incompetent.\n\nThe kids--even the girlfriends, are highly adept at handling heavy-duty automatic weapons. The home-team Wolverines are headed by star player Matt Eckert (Josh Peck), whose older brother, Jed (Chris Hemsworth), is a Marine just returning from active duty. Jed takes unofficial command as the Wolverines go into action against the invaders. Matt's girlfriend is Erica (Isabel Lucas), a cheerleader, and Toni (Adrianne Palicki), is a spunky hometown girl who develops a crush on Jed.\n\nIn 1984, \"Red Dawn\" was as at the very least relevant with our cold war with Russia. Yes, it was a bad film, but kids could at least get behind the paper thin storyline. This is 2013- and \"Red Dawn\" is inconsequential, forgettable, and destined to irrelevance once released on March 3rd. You remake a terrible movie and make it just as terrible. Mission accomplished."

For a moment I thought it might have been shot on the cheap in the Cape Town movie precinct down the road from me, but it's too amateurish for that. Which shouldn't matter. Unfortunately it shows. Why export this drivel to the rest of the world? The CIA can surely do better when they invest through dummy companies in propaganda movies. Were the 'Koreans' recruited from Mexico or the Philippines, with voice-overs?"

This contemporary remake is dumb, with exacerbated patriotism and funny lines. I laughed a lot when Jed explains that the invasion of Iraq was right since they were the \"good guys\", but the invasion of his country is an absurd since the invaders are the \"bad guys\".

Everything that was good about the original was stripped from this film. They made some pre-fab feel-good \"yay America\" movie and it sickens me. THAT IS NOT WHAT THE STORY IS ABOUT!!! There are few movies that bring a tear to my eye and the original Red Dawn is one of them. I'm going to have serious reservations about seeing any movies made by this Dan Bailey guy. IMDb gives it 5.2 out of 10 stars...I guess all those ratings are from young kids who thought it was original. Ban together and boycott this movie.\n\nWOLVERINES!!!"

        "review_title": "Remake of the 80s original is a major letdown",
        "review_detailed_main": "Directed by Dan Bradley, Red Dawn is a remake of a 1980s war flick about a group of Colorado teenagers who hide up into the woods and form a guerrilla army to defend their town when it gets invaded by the Cuban and Soviet army. This time around, the main villains are the North Koreans. Set in Spokane, Washington, Chris Hemsworth plays Jeb, a U.S marine who returns home from active duty to watch his high school brother Matt (played by Josh Peck) play football. Matt is a nice guy who is dating a smoking hot cheerleader named Erica (played by Isabel Lucas). After facing a disappointing loss, Jeb and Matt meet up at a local restaurant with some old friends including Jeb's crush Toni (played by Adrianne Palicki), Robert (played by Josh Hutcherson), Daryl (played by Connor Cruise), and Danny (played by Edwin Hodge). Next morning, Jeb and Matt wake up to find their neighborhood being occupied by North Korean soldiers with thousand of paratroopers descending from the sky. Surrounded by neighbors being abducted by Korean troopers, the two brothers hop into their truck, along with their friends, and escape into a cabin deep into the woods where they meet a few other survivors including Greg (played by Julian Alcaratz), Julie (played by Alyssa Diaz), and eventually Lieutenant Colonol Andrew Tanner (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Upon discovering their own to be overrun the North Korean army, the team form their own army and begin waging guerrilla warfare against the North Koreans in attempt to save their town from invasion.\n\nI really enjoyed the 1984 original with Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Brad Savage, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey. It was fun to watch and express a clever, if unrealistic, idea. This movie tries to reprint the same idea of the original film, but fails execute effectively. With its appealing cast of teen stars, this movie expresses an interesting idea, but butchers it with poor writing, lack of character development, and combat action scenes that are sadly not too exciting to watch. When the North Korean army first appears, viewers get filled with excitement and suspense to the point where the characters make their escape from all the mayhem. From there on out after this scene, the movie immediately stops becoming interesting. Nearly every character feels one-dimensional, and none of them are even memorable. Chris Hemsworth's character Jeb who is the main character isn't even very likable. In the original movie, Jeb, played by Patrick Swayze, was a tough, but loving older brother who just wanted to look after his little brother and his friends. Here, he's kind of a jerk, especially towards his brother. Then there are the active combat scenes which are rather boring and lack any sort of emotional investment. With the exceptions a few explosions, most of these scenes are not very exciting. Lastly, the film ending is way too abrupt as it ends in a way that will make viewers say \"What?, that's it?\". This is very disappointing, especially when the film only runs of 93 minutes, unlike the original film which lasted for almost two hours.\n\nWhether this film is a remake or something original, it is still quite a letdown. This movie had so much potential with its compelling idea and stellar cast, and it only manages to waste it on a poorly written script. This is quite disappointing, especially due since this film spent three years trying to be released."

THis recent remake isn't even OK - it's woeful. The acting is dreadful, the story is thin, the action scenes hard to follow because they are mostly in dark or filmed so close you can't see what's going on (ie they are cheating). I give it 3 for a few good moments in an otherwise dire production, I mean I have seen worse, but not by much. The patriotism and \"inspiring\" speeches just don't ring true - it all comes across as lame & desperate and a lot of the \"acting\" is not much more than blank stares conveying nothing at all. Isabel Lucas should be banned from anything resembling a screen, she is an embarrassment to Australian Film & Television and the rest of the cast were only marginally better. Don't bother with this unless you're really really desperate for something to fill in an hour or so without taxing your mind."

The acting was average if not below. I know some of the scenes were suppose to be sad but i couldn't help but laugh at how terrible the acting was and I couldn't take it seriously. I thought the structure of the movie was all over the place; there was no real flow to it. It seemed like a complete rip off of the the movie \"tomorrow when the war began\". the ending was the worst part of the film! it was so rushed and just did not make sense! I honestly would not waste my time watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Following a series of financial crises that leave NATO fractured and much of Europe in disarray, North Korea is able to consolidate their power on the world stage with the help of backing from ultra-nationalists in Russia who've come to seize power. In the town of Spokane, Washington, recently returned U. S. Marine Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) and his estranged high school football star brother Matt (Josh Peck) are reunited only for their home to come under siege by the invading North Korean army. In the initial chaos and confusion, Jed and Matt travel to their family cabin in the woods along with several of Matt's classmates and overtime fight back against the occupying North Korean regime.\n\nIn 1984 MGM released the film Red Dawn, a teen targeted take on cold war paranoia written and directed by John Milius (repurposed from a script by Kevin Reynolds). While absolutely ridiculous in hindsight with its naive fantasy of not only a Soviet invasion but a ragtag group of high school kids fighting them off, it did capture the popular consciousness of Reagan era America with it catering very much to the mindsets of middle America. In 2008, it was announced that MGM would be remaking Red Dawn with the threat of the Soviet Union replaced with an occupying Chinese force motivating by the U. S.'s defaults on their massive debt to China prompting \"repossession\", to be directed by Dan Bradley, a noted stunt coordinator on Spider-Man, Bourne, and Bond films. When the script was leaked, China's state run media issued statements condemning MGM of feeding anti-china rhetoric and like many MGM films at the time ended up getting caught in release limbo due to MGM's bankruptcy. When MGM emerged from Bankruptcy the film underwent re-editing to switch the antagonists from Chinese to North Korean (with MGM hoping to secure a Chinese theatrical release, seriously) and MGM secured a deal with then upstart distributor FilmDistrict in 2012. The movie went over poorly not even recouping it's $65 million dollar budget and audiences and critics gave the film a cold response. Deservedly so because Red Dawn is a massively misguided remake and dull and boring to boot.\n\nRegardless of your thoughts regarding the 1984 original Red Dawn, it's undeniably an ambitiously made movie with good pacing, a feeling of passion behind the camera, and from the actors. From pretty much every frame of the original film there's a sense that John Milius is dedicated to selling this concept to the audience despite the inherent ridiculousness. Even if you don't like Red Dawn '84 it's a sure bet you remember its iconic moments such as the opening paratrooper invasion, or the \"Avenge me!\" line, and the \"Wolverines!\" battle cry. Red Dawn 2012 doesn't have that feeling, it's very dully and inertly directed by Dan Bradley as he overindulges in the shaky cam often filming the action too close and the visuals are very bland as the switch from small town Colorado to Spokane, Washington just look visually generic with no real visual standouts or moments that match the original, outside of a scene at a Subway restaurant that seems to be operating still under the occupying regime (and doing incredible business) that leads to a stupid scene where two of the Wolverines steal sandwiches from the Restaurant then later eat them at their hideout in some of the most brazen product placement I've seen in a recent action film. Speaking of the Wolverines, not only are they less defined than they were in the original, but they can't even overcome their thin roles with their charisma and screen presence because Bradley's direction and Carl Ellsworth Jeremy Passmore's script don't give the cast any strong moments or opportunities to make an impact with the exception of Josh Peck whose role as Matt comes off as a selfish braindead brat whose ineptitude leads to the death of one of his friends because he deviated from the plan to save his girlfriend.\n\nRed Dawn was a product of its time from when people were less informed and Russia and its inner workings were less well known among the masses so you could sell them this \"invading boogeyman\" concept with a straight face and that World War II era \"give 'em Hell boys\" attitude. Even if they had kept the original antagonists as the Chinese, this concept still wouldn't have flown in today's world because most of the audience knows (to an extent) that there'd be no real benefit to invading and occupying the United States because the cost will always outweigh the benefit by a considerable margin. The fact that MGM thought they could somehow sell this movie to China for a theatrical release is quite funny because even though they've taken away the \"China\", it's still a very anti-authoritarian \"freedom fighter\" movie with featuring prominent color schemes inspired by propaganda either real or fictional associated with countries not dissimilar to China's system of Government. It just goes to show that making this remake was a complete mistake because Red Dawn was only able to exist in that specific moment in time in the 80s and it wasn't going to get recaptured.\n\nThe Red Dawn remake takes a bad but somewhat entering 80s relic and turns it into a bland homogenized sit that will be forgotten immediately upon viewing. I'll always remember scenes and exchanges from Red Dawn '84 despite thinking the movie is bad. I'll never think about Red Dawn 2012 ever again and will most likely forget it exists except for when I stumble across it and remind myself: \"oh, yeah, that was a thing\". And that's all you can say about it, it's a thing that exists."

        "review_detailed_main": "\u00a8We're not doing too bad for a bunch of kids. We're gonna fight. We're gonna keep fighting cause it's easier now and we're used to it.\u00a8\n\nI agree that this was a totally unnecessary remake and that the plot is beyond ridiculous, but I still had a decent time with Red Dawn as long as I didn't try to think too much about the unbelievable scenario. The real reason why this movie failed is because they took the ridiculous plot way too seriously when they should have played with the concept a little. A much lighter and playful approach would have made this film work. I really don't understand why the producers thought a remake like this would be a good idea considering the original film wasn't all that great either. I think it's about time the film industry begins taking bigger risks instead of recycling the same material over and over again and only adding new faces and better visual effects. This version of Red Dawn was directed by Dan Bradley who is known mostly for his work as a stunt coordinator in big budget films like the Spider Man and Bourne franchises. This was his directorial debut and of course it has several flaws and a rather terrible and unsatisfying ending, but it still managed to maintain my interest throughout most of the film. It was adapted from Kevin Reynolds's story of the 1984 film by Carl Ellsworth (Disturbia and Red Eye) and Jeremy Passmore, but their script wasn't much brighter. I think that if the film didn't take itself so seriously and played more with the ridiculousness of it all then it could have been much better. It never ended up embracing the absurdity of it all.\n\nThe original Red Dawn dealt with the invasion of Soviets, but since we are in different times this time the enemy is North Korea. The story is very fictional and you have to be very imaginative in order to go along with the entire situation. The story takes place in a small American town in Washington while the local High school team has suffered a defeat under the leadership of its star quarterback, Matt Eckert (Josh Peck), while his father Tom (Brett Cullen) and older brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) watch from the sidelines. Despite the loss, his girlfriend Erica (Isabel Lucas) manages to lift his spirit and they all go out to celebrate at the local bar until they are interrupted by a blackout. Everything changes the next morning when a swarm of North Korean soldiers come parachuting down several jet planes and begin taking everyone hostage. Jed, who has recently returned from his service in Iraq, manages to escape along with his brother and several other friends to the woods. Together they decide to fight back the invaders and disrupt their plans. The young kids form a revolutionary group and call themselves the Wolverines, like the school mascot. Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki, and Connor Cruise all form part of the rebellious group that is led by Jed. It is impossible for a group of young teenagers to take down such a big military force, but somehow they manage to create chaos and inspire the rest of the American citizens to fight back.\n\nThe film was shot in 2009 but due to some production problems it was finally released last year. I don't think they should have gone with all that trouble because the outcome wasn't really satisfying although the recent fame of Chris Hemsworth (Thor and The Avengers) and Josh Hutcherson (Hunger Games) may have helped the box office. Hutcherson who worked with Hemsworth's brother, Liam, in The Hunger Games doesn't really have an important role he. The true stars of the film are Chris and Josh Peck (from the Josh and Drake show) although there really wasn't a strong performance in all the film. It's hard to believe the actors when the script is pretty much unbelievable. The entire film feels like watching a couple of friends play Modern Warfare. The film could have worked better as a television miniseries or something like that, but as a two hour film everything felt way out of place. This is Friday Night Lights meets Pearl Harbor.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

That one obviously took place over a period of months, this one seems like it happened over a period of days.\n\nToo bad, as the updating of the story was decent, and well set for modern times, I just wish they would've taken some time and really put meat on the bones here.

Not only the premise is stupid, the production is worthy of a High Schol project and the handful of known performers do pitiful jobs, no doubt not due to lack of capability but because of the low IQ of the producers and director.\n\nI watched this piece of garbage on a boring Saturday and managed 6/10's of it through sheer obstinacy.

Unbelievable.\n\nhonestly i guessed 7 things at the start of this film and 6 of them came true. From amazing feats of courage like speaking out against the invaders, to cheesy quotes from the marines, i literally would have bet my life on sum of the things that i thought would happen in a \"save the country\" type of film...\n\nIt was good with the action and shooting coming together to make a nice 'war' film and make it entertaining, but it lacked emotional interest and i found myself asking whether or not i cared about some their group being killed. It was as if the director tried to put it in there so that people would renew their interest. It didn't really cut it.\n\nI honestly didn't find the 'overall' picture to be too bad with lots of gun fights and guerrilla warfare, because thats just my personal preference, but with boring, predictable scenes around every corner, i almost zoned out and fell to sleep. 4/10, only because i like fighting sorts of films"

I'm a big fan of Thor and it was great to see him doing something like this. I was pretty much on the edge of my seat the whole time. There is a few \"all is lost moments.\" Then the story lifts you back up again and shows you that there is hope. Honestly, I think they should've changed the characters names from the original and just completely did their own thing with it. On the other hand, there was a big following from the original so I can see why they did that. There is EXPLOSIONS, GUNS, PRIDE, HONOR, RESPECT, COURAGE. If you like that kind of stuff, you'll love this movie.\n\nThere are some anti-war people who don't like this movie. That's fine, stay away from it please. It definitely wasn't meant for you.

Then, just before I started to scratch my eyes out to stop the pain, the film gets into explosion/gunfire mode and severely lifts its game. It's not mind-blowing action by any standard \u2013 and the rapidity of how the ragtag bunch of kids become a proficient guerrilla unit spits in the face of credibility \u2013 yet it has a rough-around-the-edges quality that raises the tension and by the time the exciting finale arrives I found I was actually enjoying myself. A glaring misstep on Chris Hemsworth's resume and definitely not worth parting with your hard earned to see at the multiplex, but consider renting on DVD if there's nothing else on offer."

Once again, Hollywood cranks out another so-so film that makes you say, \"eh, at least they tried.\" Here are some frustrating things:\n\nThe characters are unbelievably underdeveloped. The brothers conveniently have two women to cling to, which is another predictable element of a modern Hollywood action movie: you can always be sure that there will be romance awkwardly put in somewhere. The pack of \"Wolverines\" consist of the main characters such as Chris Hemsworth, Josh Peck, and Josh Hutcherson, and then a bunch of other people thrown in there that you can't identify well or relate to. You can easily tell who is likely to die and who is likely to live in the next shootout by how many lines they have spoken. It almost seems that these people are there to simply fill up space.\n\nThe plot accelerates too quickly. Not even a minute after the invasion, the neighborhood boys are ready to go with their convoy and supplies. It almost seems like they were waiting for an invasion to happen so they would have an excuse to fight for something. In fact, I fear a lot of young men in this country really do hope for the day that a foreign country invades so they can shoot people and be able to justify it. Not only does the plot accelerate too quickly, but the movie is not long enough. This would be more suitable for a series, but is packed into an hour and a half. This makes things rushed, and good moments breeze by.\n\nThis movie is disgustingly patriotic. The Koreans are portrayed as evildoers with nothing better to do than coerce other people into being like them. As if the American military doesn't do that in the Middle East by \"establishing democracies to better the people\". In fact, the Koreans barely show up in the film except for when they are targets for AK-47 bullets. Their side is not really explained, so most people just who they are by a single word: socialists.\n\nThis movie certainly appeals to young men that love guns, guerrilla warfare, and of course, the fantasy that one day they might be able to live the life of a \"Wolverine\", shooting up Koreans and sneaking around.\n\nI do need to point out some positive aspects of the film, since I rated it 5 stars and not 3. I did like the blend of Hemsworth, Peck, and Hutcherson. I also think the remake did fix some of the irksome elements of the original."

In this movie, the Americans lost homes that they might have had for a few decades. But much of the Iraqi population lost homes, towns and even cities that their families lived in for several centuries. Most Americans can barely manage a shrug in response to that atrocity. Iraqi insurgents were labeled as terrorists and evil for wanting to defend their homes. How were the Wolverines depicted?\n\nIt is important to recognize the humanity on both sides of the fight."

Congratulations. Not much is exactly what you get, only for variety this time it's a North Korean invasion of Washington (the state, not the city). You do get Chris Hemsworth \u2014 who's done good work as Thor and in Cabin in the Woods \u2014 as Patrick Swayze, er, Jed Eckert, US Marine on leave from overseas combat, but he isn't given anything to do except ooze testosterone and carefully maintain the 5 days' growth of beard that he started the film with and continues to sport thruout the entire movie. The extremely thin SF premise is that an EMP has knocked out the electricity in the US (shades of Dark Angel, a much superior drama) just before the paratroopers start raining out of a fleet of transport aircraft that cover the sky like passenger pigeons. But the Koreans themselves have hardened communications, so they scoff at the lack of power. If our heroes can only liberate some of that tech, they may be able to mount as effective a resistance as those guys in the black pajamas did during that little contretemps in the '70s. Whether they succeed in doing so or not is left as a thot experiment for the serious student. Nah, just kidding. Of course they pull it off, and the gals look damn ravishing while doing it, too.\n\nTho set in Spokane, the film was shot in Michigan, and the resistance fighters adopt the nickname of their high-school football team, the Wolverines.

Once achieved they do what all oppressive, maniacal regimes do: set up loads of check-points and put posters up all over the place.\n\nCue the squeaky clean American teenage resistant fighters.\n\nNow there is room in the world for simpler movies and I like to switch off and watch a bit of action. But the characters insist on making comparisons with themselves and the insurgents in Iraq, but it is a false analogy. The Korean solders don't go home to their families get a prosthetic limb fitted and try to deal with their PTSD, they die face down in the dirt - in their droves.\n\nAnd that moves us to the main flaw with this movie. The Korean's are useless, they run after the Wolverines like old English bobbies yelling 'stop!' before being shot in the face. For ninety minutes they go down like so many bowling pins - every encounter is a bloody, one-sided, yawn-inducing, full gone conclusion.\n\nA stupid film that would be OK if it didn't force you to look it squarely in its stupid eyes and realise it is indeed very stupid."

It was supposed to be a big deal in the movie I guess, but when a character dies and no one knows anything about him, it takes away from the movie. No one can check the 'Contains spoilers' box because there is no plot to spoil. The acting for some scenes were pretty lame and while there is supposed to be inter group tension at times, it fails to draw the viewer in. No character development, no reason to care when anything happens in the movie. I'd avoid this movie. It is mediocre at best."

For the film to be remade and set in a time where they can track one man from space, they somehow don't see a shed load of troops popping over to the states. Even if we take it as a movie, just silly action, it does not hold up for me, and when I start looking at my watch its not a good sign. The 80s one is worth seeing, silly 80s action flick, but fun, and the 2012 version is just stupid. Best thing they could have done is drop the guys in, hold the town all hush hush like, make a base without the rest of the world knowing, a sort of first step to bigger plans.......and set it over 24/48hrs, still silly but makes it a bit more (could happen)"

Thus, the idea to bring the remake's events into present day was the first misjudgment. And the cast - several cute faces with the aim to bring young people into the cinemas, but no catchy characters (Chris Hemsworth, for example, is rather overrated actor, but I can imagine his popularity among a certain audience) and their unlike development (party chicks and dudes would never become skilled fighters within weeks). The ending is dull as well. The strongest part of the movie are visually effective fight and burst scenes.\n\nLuckily, the movie is less than 1,5 hours... As for movies like this, I would prefer those with Dolph Lundgren or even Steven Seagal."

Now this remake is just that a remake the acting was ok action could have been better but it wasn't a horrible move let that be clear. But i feel this would have been a great even superb remake if it was with an R rating and completely dove into its action and violence. This was made by a stunt man an experienced one i want to see what he can do action wise unchained this story would have been perfect for that. Overall its a half baked movie not to say there isn't potential though definitely i think this is a story that can be done way better and with justice to the original one."

The trailer to this 2012 film looked good, though, so decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAs with the original film, I was not impressed. In fact, this version made the 1984 film look good. There are a few good action sequences, but none of which were believable. They were fun; don't get me wrong. I just didn't find the film believable in its entirety. I didn't really care for the characters. There was no chemistry between them and I didn't know anything about any of them, except for the fact Jed (Chris Hemsworth) is a Marine.\n\nSo, a handful of young people called Wolverines are being trained by Jed to fight back when a group of North Korean soldiers seizes control of their town. Together, they make a stand and change the course of the invasion.\n\n'Tomorrow, when the war began' has a similar premise, but is by far a much better film, more believable, and a hell of a lot more fun with lots of tension, as well. 'Red Dawn' is simply a bland action film with no heart or emotion, and dull characters.\n\nThis is a remake that should not have been made. The film was also a box office failure. The draw card here was Chris Hemsworth, but even him couldn't save the film.\n\nWould I watch it again? No."

You could make a case in the Cold War days of the early '80s for a Soviet invasion of America. People did talk about that in those days. But you really can't say that in 2012 about the Chinese or the North Koreans , or whoever these guys are supposed to be. The Chinese have never shown an ability or desire to project power outside of their own sphere, and the North Koreans barely have enough gas to drive to Seoul, let alone invade the US mainland.

The original it was Russia, Cuba and Nicaragua allied together (focused on Russia and Cuba).\n\nOverall - it's a so-so action war film.\n\n5/10."

There is always the possibility that it'll happen.\n\nThere is a decent amount of action in it, not too much that its overwhelming but not too little that its pointless.\n\nWhen I saw Josh Hutcherson was involved I knew I had to see it and i ended up loving the whole thing.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to friends and family."

What I mean by that is if we continue on the path we're on, society will crumble and we'll have a socialist/communist police state like the one in this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "After watching this film I have lost ALL faith or respect for critics on the various film rating sites, and now realize that the political agenda comes first before the quality and contribution of a story. Or maybe they are North Korean trolls ;-) Seriously, I think it goes beyond having bad taste by those poor reviews and being back-to-front in their reviewing, as there seems to be an obvious agenda at play to attack the pro-freedom pro-Americana themes in this film which a lot of people nowadays are stating to hate on, and that is the only logical reason I think there have been so many negative reviews. If you believe the absurd consensus you would think this film is a real stinker, but to my delightful surprise it was very entertaining and positive on so many fronts! Action, romance, adventure, and a believable story, this film is well worth checking out, and isn't cliche, predictable or nauseatingly left leaning\n\nFirst of all the acting: It was good, had a bunch of next door type young kids who were good support for Hemsworth in the lead role, which was believable and enjoyable to watch. While the 2nd main lead \" Matty \" wasn't my ideal pick for the role , but I think he came through in the end. There are attractive female characters that have a strong supporting role and did well in their role.\n\nThere was a fair bit of action that was balanced in well with the overall story-line, of a bunch of kids and an older ex-marine that go out in the woods after an invasion by a foreign force. The story then develops in a logical, easy to understand manner which builds tension. There are many good moments where you feel good for the team, and has a range of emotions covered from joyous victory to sacrifice, loss of loved ones, fatigue and terror. But I won't spoil it for you\n\nIf you enjoy films that have a bunch of positive and inspiring themes ( Libertarian), and are devoid of the nauseating cliche of modern Hollywood (eg once upon a time in Trollywood), trust me, watch this film!"

Maybe Emma and her 2 Moms are in Paris or London at this moment, fighting for gay rights in europe and can't defend the freedom of our country, so a few little boys from the football team get the job done. Good Popcorn movie with a great message for 2022, i think nobody thought that it got downhill for the USA that fast. Only 10 years and this movie is realistic. Hell No."

Although the motrads line I loved. What can I say, I'm huge Christopher Titus fan.\n\nThe only part that strains suspension of disbelief is N. Korea being a capable military force. The few N. Korean troops with shoes, weapons, and food have had their joints destroyed in a few years from goose stepping and standing at attention 10-18 hrs at a time.\n\nOverall, I love the setting, the acting is done properly, they had to have a real veteran or three in the back ground to set the details right.\n\n\"I miss Call of Duty\" \"Dude, we're living call of duty, and it sucks\""

This is a great survival/war movie with great acting, superb story line and great F/X. It is more then worth watching if you are reading this review at all!!!! The acting is above par for the most of your remakes. The gentlemen that portrays Jed from the original hits it hard on the nail!!! The story line fallows closely with the original in enough ways to even please those of you that ARE looking for \"The original\"!! Do yourself a favor, watch it and decide for yourself if it's good.
