        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. I went way too many years without watching this movie again, so when Cinemark included it in the summer classic film series, I was in my seat nice and early. Mention this movie and the first thing people do is quote one of the most famous lines in movie history: \"What we have here is failure to communicate.\" No question that's a great line. But there is so much more to this movie and it holds up beautifully 45 years later.\n\nBased on the novel by Donn Pearce, who spent two years on a chain-gang, this is the story of Luke (Paul Newman) who just can't bring himself to conform to the rules, regardless whether those be the rules of the military, society, prison, or those self-imposed by the convicts. We are introduced to Luke as he drunkenly cuts off the top of parking meters on main street of a small town. Later, in a throw away line, we learn he was gaining revenge on someone. It's the clear indication that while he doesn't always want to fit in, Luke clearly knows right from wrong.\n\nThere are so many terrific scenes in this film, that it's not possible to discuss each. Every scene with the prison warden, played by Strother Martin, is intense. Each of the Boss guards are frightening, especially Morgan Woodward as the sharpshooter behind the mirrored shades. There are numerous impactful scenes featuring the group of convicts. Even though we learn little about the individuals, we realize the fragile male psyche is on full display. Despite the power of all of these characters and scenes, the real strength of the film is the relationship between Luke and Dragline (George Kennedy). Watching the early cat and mouse game, and the subsequent transfer of power, feature two amazing actors at the top of their game.\n\nGeorge Kennedy rightfully won the Best Supporting Actor award and continued on to become one of the most successful and prolific character actors of the 70's and 80's, and his career culminated with his iconic role in the Naked Gun series. As for Paul Newman, this is one of his best performance in a long line of standout performances. This one is in the middle stage of his career and he exuded manliness with a touch of sensitivity. He and Strother Martin would meet again in one of the best sequences of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\nWatching Luke win over all the convicts, including the previous leader played by Kennedy is stunning, yet gut-wrenching when offset by the scenes with the guards who are hell bent on getting Luke to understand his place. They understand the risk he poses to the systematic rhythms of the prison.\n\nThe supporting cast is downright incredible. This was the feature film debut for: Ralph Waite (4 years later he became the beloved paternal figure of TV's The Waltons); Joe Don Baker(Buford Pusser from Walking Tall); James Gammon (later the crusty manager in Major League); and Anthony Zerbe, another iconic character actor of the 70's and 80's. Also featured are Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton (singing a few songs), Wayne Rogers (from MASH), Richard Davalos (James Dean's brother Aron in East of Eden), and Rance Howard (Ron's dad as the sheriff). In a brief, but truly great scene, Jo Van Fleet (also from East of Eden), appears as Arletta, and we quickly understand Luke's background.\n\nOften overlooked by film historians, \"Lucille\" putting on a show for the convicts as she washes her car, is a scene that is meant for more than titillation. As she creatively buffs the windows, the reaction of the convicts reminds us that these are still men and no amount of humiliation and degradation can change that. One of my friends argues that Joy Harmon was clearly cheated out of an Oscar for this scene.\n\nThe score is the handy work of Lalo Schifrin and expertly captures the moment ... especially in the black top scene. Director Stuart Rosenberg was known only for his TV work when he got this script. He went on to direct another prison movie in 1980 called Brubaker. Starring Newman's Butch Cassidy co-star Robert Redford, the film was a decent prison drama, but not at the level of Cool Hand Luke ... which by the way, was installed into the National Film Registry in 2005."

It's a study on the theme of the indomitability of the human spirit in the face of oppression. I was about to name this as Newman's finest performance until I thought of Eddy Felsen in \"The Hustler\" and Frank Galvin in \"The Verdict\"; it's impossible to choose among such a cornucopia of acting achievements, but Luke is right up there (the analogy to Luke as Christ becomes a tad heavy-handed when we see him, at the close of the egg-eating scene, stretched out, arms outward, feet crossed, as if crucified; none the less, it's a powerful image). There is no doubt, however, about George Kennedy as Dragline; it is his finest achievement, and fully deserves the Oscar he got for Best Supporting Actor. It is also fascinating to find so many familiar faces among the inmates - actors such as Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Joe Don Baker, Ralph Waite. and Wayne Rogers - who would go on to fame in their own right. This movie can unquestionably be called a classic. American Movie Classics just started (11/2000) showing a beautifully restored letterbox version which shows it in all its glory."

The kind of angles and perspectives the camera uses, the way it zooms in and out or even allows itself (literally) to get dirty - the way this whole picture was shot is just something I haven't seen in an American film released prior to this one.\n\nAnd yet, although it is considered a classic, when people talk about the \"New Hollywood\" somehow 'Cool Hand Luke' is hardly ever mentioned - despite the fact that it came out only a couple of months after 'Bonnie and Clyde' in 1967 and before 'The Graduate'.\n\nI look at this film mainly as a character study but the story arc also works very well and it hasn't aged a bit. This is one of those rare films that was way ahead of its time and which has simply everything: great acting, iconic characters and scenes, wonderful music - and the cinematography is just unbelievable.\n\nFunny, tragic and moving, 'Cool Hand Luke' is one hell of a film. What we've got here is NOT failure to communicate - but a 10 star masterpiece.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

        "review_title": "Not just a prison film, but an excellent film about not being able to conform in a world that requires it",
        "review_detailed_main": "Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce's novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke, it was with great anticipation that I awaited it's transfer to the big screen. I was not disappointed.\n\nCool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn, but it is so much more than that. It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into. When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters, his explanation to the prison captain(Strother Martin) is \"Small Town, not much to do in the evening\", which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid. Later, to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer, but importantly adds \"just settlin some old scores\". It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property. As a service man, we also discover that Luke won a bronze star, achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private. Again, early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body's rules but his own. Yet, we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong. At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances, he tells the boss, \"calling it your job don't make it right, Boss.\" In a visit from his mother Arletta(Jo Van Fleet), Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her, \"A man's got to go his own way\" or as he also puts it, \"I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can't seem to find no elbow room\".\n\nAs Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years, we meet the other inmates. Some of them wear chains, some of them do not. It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg, emphasizes. We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform. You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to, or they will find the means to get you to walk the line. As the Captain reiterates, \"for your own good, you'll learn the rules\" A point driven home often.\n\nWhat we discover about their crimes is minuscule. One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car, another is a paper hanger, another new inmate is charged with breaking, entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us. It enables to view these prisoners as men, and while we don't feel any genuine sympathy for them, feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce's story, and Luke as the focal point.\n\nBecause of his individuality, it doesn't take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates. It is not a role he chooses, or even wants. It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others. He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship, and would be just as happy if he didn't have to deal with it. He is still trying to find his way in the world, and if there is any real purpose for his existence.\n\nAnother principal character is Dragline(George Kennedy). It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten. Dragline's admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that he(Dragline)has learned the rules on how to get by, but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process. He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm. I can't remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in, and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.\n\nCool Hand Luke is not without it's humorous moments especially in the early going. It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages. Perhaps, for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke's dilemma.\n\nIn translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson, has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen. Lalo Shifrin's memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang. Director Stuart Rosenberg made more good films after Cool Hand Luke, but in my opinion never achieved the same degree of perfection that he does here.\n\nAs Cool Hand Luke, Paul Newman give one of the most memorable performances in a long distinguished career. It is not an easy task portraying a man who travels the road from being a sincere individualist, to a man who may be beaten and defeated, yet in the end is still unwilling to accept that fate. Although Rod Steiger won the best actor award that year, one could argue that Newman's role was more difficult, as it required substantially different subtle ranges in character. As for the failure of Cool Hand Luke to achieve a Best Picture nomination, I'm at a loss to explain that malfunction, especially when the likes of Doctor Doolittle and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, far lesser efforts than this were nominated.\n\nCool Hand Luke is a true classic in every sense of the word. It is a film that will long be remembered.\n\nMy grade: A+"

        "review_detailed_main": "I first saw \"Cool Hand Luke\" the first week it came out. Went to see it with my father at a theater on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. We were just a few blocks away from the hospital where my Mom was dying of cancer and we just needed a break. It was cathartic. Feeling as beat up and left for dead as I was at the time, I came across a character who knew how to take the punches. \"Luke\" is a beautifully crafted film. Not one wasted frame or moment. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson's screenplay is nothing less than a working man's parable of a truly good soul who just couldn't seem to get a break. In ways, it could be said he truly didn't let himself. But the strength within Luke that would not let him compromise who he was for who he was told to be, the resilience to fight back against those who tried to fight him on that was inspirational. Whether it was a carefully chosen remark or just one of them Luke looks, They knew They couldn't knock him out no matter how badly They knocked him down. Seems he handled life like that, and it was an example I've clung to and have tried to follow in the almost fifty subsequent years. Conrad Hall's cinematography was breathtaking, providing the scope of all the integral parts of the story with the immediacy of all the most intimate moments. Any single frame could hang on your living room wall as the centerpiece. The cast: Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite ... and George Kennedy. Academy Award Winner George Kennedy. \"Dragline\". The most unforgettable \"gentle giant\" I believe I've ever seen on the silver screen. Each and every one of them, in all their glory and in the simplest of nuances, helped raise Paul Newman's masterful portrayal to an ever higher level, maybe his best work ever. The character is very much the story in \"Cool Hand Luke\" and the ensemble brings it to life. Frustrating, challenging, confusing, pain- in-the-ass life with just enough of that rebellious spirit to bring hope to those facing some of their tougher times. I saw the film four more times that first year, and probably twice each year since whenever I could find it. Check in with Luke and the boys for a breath of fresh air and some world-shaking hope. Can't speak for anyone else, but Luke is right up there with Atticus Finch for me when it comes to celluloid heroes, these are the two whose stories got me through some really, really bleak times. And for me, \"Cool Hand Luke\" was ultimately a story of hope. The story of a man who never gave in. Never gave up. And never stopped grinning. All that they piled on him, all they tried to bury him under ... just wasn't worth his getting worked up over. Wasn't gonna get to his spirit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Set in the rural south, a man serves time on a chain gang after vandalising parking meters. When inside, he stubbornly refuses to bow down to anybody, be it the prison authorities or his fellow inmates. Soon, though, he becomes a symbol of hope to the other prisoners and his rebellious nature teaches them that their integrity is the most important thing they have.\n\nThis anti-authoritarian film is very much in a similar mould to Bonnie and Clyde which also came out in 1967. In both of these films the establishment are shown to be the bad guys and the criminals anti-heroes deserving of our sympathy. With this in mind it would only be fair to say that, like Bonnie and Clyde, Cool Hand Luke could be regarded as one of the very first New Hollywood movies. It certainly is a film which indicates that the cinematic norms were changing. It's also one of the first of a new type of prison drama which tried to reach for more authenticity. In many ways it is a precursor to the classic incarcerated-man-against-the-system movie One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). For me, it's not in the same league as that one but it's pretty obviously a very influential work. It benefits from a good ensemble cast, with Paul Newman leading the picture very well, with impressive support in particular from George Kennedy who would go on to win an Oscar for his efforts."

Well he is just superb here, very cool and charismatic as well as the skills he is best at. The cinematography is also a delight, the Technicolour is just stunning, and Stuart Rosenberg's direction is a career-best. The dialogue is crisp and memorable, and the story is beautifully constructed. As for any memorable scenes, the prologue and the egg-eating scene are classics, the film succeeds adeptly at being a character study and I for one had no problem with the religious symbolism. Lalo Schifrin's music is very nice too. So all in all, if you love Paul Newman, you will love Cool Hand Luke. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Highly rated film that I don't rate that highly, if truth be told. There's plenty to savour, particularly in the acting stakes but I was ultimately confused and disappointed by the resolution to the various themes at play here.\n\nThe enigmatic opening, with Newman's Luke character casually vandalising the state's parking meters amusingly recalled to me the famous tag-line from Bob Dylan's near contemporaneous song \"Subterraneaen Homesick Blues\" - \"Don't follow leaders and watch the parking meters\", (both parts of the line are relevant - at one point he screams \"Stop feeding off me\" to his \"follower\" inmates) as Luke gets incarcerated in a brutally-run Southern prison work-house and becomes the unlikely and from his point of view, at times unwelcome talismanic figure representing to his fellow inmates a focal point of resistance to authority and in a wider sense, general conformity.\n\nAnd yet this self-effacing persona which Luke adopts more than once however doesn't square, with me, to the self-publicising acts he does elsewhere, most famously the fight scene with the prison's \"Big Daddy\" inmate, Dragline, played by Arthur Kennedy and of course the egg-scoffing scene, where he deliberately draws attention to himself. I also didn't get Kennedy's character's change (adapting Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\") from George to Lennie, when after punching Luke to a pulp and establishing one would think once and for all superiority over him, we see him by the end almost acting as his lackey. Add to that an admittedly revisionist minor revulsion at the blatantly sexist soft-porn episode of the tongues-out chain gang ogling a scantily-clad nymphet foaming up a car and you can tell I had some issues with the movie, although a minor counter-case against the latter could be made for the insertion of the very mild homo-erotic and played for laughs sub \"Jailhouse Rock\" scene of the prisoners dancing with each other, dressed only in their shorts, on the 4th of July.\n\nThe ambiguities in the narrative however threw me off-kilter and while I can see that I was expected to cut Newman's character a lot of slack as a societal misfit whose \"different-ness\" is accentuated further after his beloved mother dies, ultimately, again to paraphrase Dylan, nothing has been proved. As to style, director Rosenberg certainly captures the heat and sweat of the workhouse but even then a lot of his imagery seems second-hand, lifting from the likes of Leone and Sturges. Lalo Schifrin delivers a satisfactory if occasionally blaring soundtrack.\n\nThe acting is great though, yet I'm sure I can see Steve McQueen playing the Newman role better. Arthur Kennedy is robust enough until he's reduced to a simpering wimp by the conclusion. Strother Martin, with that enervating southern drawl gets most of the best lines (especially the well-known \"What we have here is a failure to communicate\") and his underlings similarly exude cruelty and inhumanity, especially when breaking Luke over the pointless digging of a ditch. Amongst the inmates, by the way, it's interesting to note emerging actors of the television screen like Wayne Rogers (\"M.A.S.H.\"), Ralph Waite (\"The Waltons\", \"Mississipi\") and Anthony Zerbe (everything else...) plus the young (Harry) Dean Stanton and Dennis Hopper.\n\nGrandstanding scenes notwithstanding, by the conclusion, the film hadn't held me as it should have done and further weakened its case as an expose of the working methods of jail-masters of the recent past with a sentimental collage of Newman's smiling image set before us with all the integrity of an episode of the afore-mentioned \"The Waltons\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Released in 1967 and directed by Stuart Rosenberg based on Donn Pearce' novel, \"Cool Hand Luke\" is a prison drama starring Paul Newman in the eponymous role as a loner who disdains rules in the early 50s. He is sentenced to two years on a prison farm in Florida run by a stern warden, the Captain (Strother Martin), and guarded by a stoic rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey (Morgan Woodward). Carr (Clifton James) the floorwalker, tells the rules to the new prisoners with violations resulting in spending the night in \"the box,\" a small square room with limited air and little room to move. George Kennedy and Dennis Hopper are on hand as fellow prisoners, amongst many others.\n\nI was wondering about the totally stoo-pid reason Luke gets 2 years in prison at the beginning of the film. He likely got a ticket for a \"violated\" parking meter while in town. So he has a few beers, gets his mitts on a big pipe cutter, and thought, \"I'm gonna show these jerks.\"\n\n\"Cool Hand Luke\" has a big reputation but, for me, it doesn't quite live up to it. The highlight is the iconic car wash sequence with Joy Harmon, as well as the ending when Luke talks with God about why He made him such a misfit. The rest is a decent prison drama about an eccentric individualist who inspires those around him stuck in the same pen. It's a character study of a likable, impressive, but unruly person who doesn't seem to grasp that getting sloshed and destroying public property has negative repercussions. Gee, maybe you shouldn't try to solve your problems by getting drunk and vandalizing. The movie is realistic and well-made, but generally tedious, although I'm sure that's the point \u2013 being confined on a prison farm WOULD be tedious. The Christ typology is interesting, however; and I can understand how some grade it higher.\n\nThe movie runs 126 minutes and was shot Tavares & Jacksonville, Florida; and San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, California, with studio work done in Burbank.\n\nGRADE: C+ (5.5/10)"

Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp -- and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain. Along with stellar performances by Newman, Kennedy, and Martin, Cool Hand Luke features a superb supporting cast, including Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, and Joe Don Baker as members of the chain gang."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Cool Hand Luke\" is a classic cult film. Lots of people love it and it's ranked very high in the IMDb Top 100 list. While I, too, like the film I can't say I am quite as sold on the film as the crowd--I think it's very, very good but wonder if perhaps it's a tad overrated. But, there certainly is a lot to like about it as well.\n\nLet's first talk about the good. The acting is exceptional. The fellow chain gang members are made up of LOTS of very familiar faces--as is like a Who's Who of character actors. Additionally, the stars of the film (George Kennedy and especially Paul Newman) are great--and at the top of their game. Additionally, the writing and especially the dialog are great. But, the writing, while very, very good also left me a bit cold at the end with its vague ending. Additionally, the film is very episodic and seemed a bit disjoint. Still, it is a heck of a good film--and one that probably would appeal most to guys (I have NEVER met a woman who loved the film, though I am sure there are plenty who will read this and take exception)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Cool Hand Luke (1967)\n\nA movie famous as an anti-establishment send-up and for the charming, smiling Paul Newman. Worth seeing for either reason. It does have comic moments to talk about--egg eating among them--and it has an especially low point for the treatment of women, even though it is justified internally by the characters. Most of the time it's a well paced, well acted chain gang movie, with one getaway (that's no spoiler--all prison movies have getaways) that is an homage or ripoff of the 1932 LeRoy chain gang movie to beat all chain gang movies.\n\nBecause the movie is clearly set in the past, it doesn't indict the prison system directly, but does critique the problem of authority, and of what exactly is a punishment suitable for petty crime. I don't know if the title character (played by Newman) is an anti-hero exactly (he lacks any true badness) but there is no doubt by halfway through who the true good guy is. And by the end, the Christian symbolism is overwhelming. If Cool Hand Luke the man isn't quite what you think of as messianic, he still does at least show what it means to be good in very ungood circumstances. It's a complicated thing to be a hero, and to survive those who are threatened by those better than them, and in the end, that's what the movie is about. Compelling if never amazing, and most of all enjoyable."

I, like I assume many people of my generation are, am only familiar with Kennedy through his role as the police Captain Ed from the Naked Gun series, in which he was hilarious, and his stint selling breath mints on infomercials. I never expected that he ever won an Oscar! And it was entirely deserved. He created a very complex character in this film. Bravo!\n\nI loved Paul Newman, too, of course. I just looked at who else was nominated that year, and I have not seen either the winner of that year's best actor Oscar (Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night) or one other nominee (Spencer Tracy in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner), but of those I have seen (Warren Beatty, Bonnie and Clyde and Dustin Hoffman, The Graduate) I would personally have picked Warren Beatty, seeing as Bonnie and Clyde is one of my very favorite films, and I love Beatty in it.

        "review_detailed_main": "The many other reviews posted by the time of my writing discuss the plot and other aspects of \"Cool Hand Luke.\" So, I'll just comment on the source of the movie and what I think the aim was in making it. The film is based on a 1965 novel of the same title, by Donn Pearce. The premise for which Luke is jailed and then continues to try to buck the system, escape and then return is ludicrous. Unless one can see that Luke puts life and energy into the prison and his fellow inmates. He is a spark of hope that helps these men survive otherwise monotonous and endless days of drudgery. I don't know if it is that way in the book, but that seems to be the intended drive for the plot in the film. It shows how much difference one person can make \u2013 not just in prison, but in the life of other people wherever they are.\n\nDonn Pearce himself spent time in jail and prison. He ran away from home, a suburb of Philadelphia, when he was 15. He lied about his age to get into the Army in 1944, then went AWOL and then turned himself in. He spent 30 days in the stockade. Then, before he got shipped out, the Army learned of his true age (his mother had written a letter) and threw him out. But he was then old enough to join the Merchant Marine, which he did. He served on ships that took him to various European ports and to India. He was caught in France for counterfeiting American money and was imprisoned. He escaped and crossed the Italian border. From there he got forged papers so that he could sign on a ship going to Canada. From Canada, he crossed the U.S. border and revved up his criminal activity. He went into burglary and safe cracking. All of this was by the age of 20. In 1949, he was caught and sentenced to two years on chain gangs in Florida.\n\nPearce began writing stories based on his experiences and the characters he met. His 1965 novel was the first of four. Between books he worked as a freelance journalist. He wrote the screenplay for this movie, and he has a cameo shot in the film as a prisoner named Sailor. In a 2008 bonus video that comes with the DVD of the movie, Pearce says that his character of Luke is partly autobiographical. He says one-third of the character is based on him \u2013 the eating parts and working hard. Another third was based on a real guy named Cool Hand Luke. And the remaining third was just general stuff to tie the two characters together.\n\nDirector Stuart Rosenberg and Warner Brothers assembled a fantastic cast for the film. Paul Newman is excellent as Luke. George Kennedy is stellar as Dragline, a role that garnered him the Oscar for best supporting actor for 1967. Strother Martin is superb as the Captain of the prison road gang. Many notable stage actors fill the roles of fellow inmates and guards. Lou Antonio is Koko, J.D. Cannon is Society Red, Wayne Rogers is Gambler, Clifton James is floorwalker Carr, Luke Askew is Boss Paul, Robert Donner is Boss Shorty, Charles Tyner is Boss Higgins.\n\nThis is a highly regarded film that most people should enjoy. Newman and a number of the crew said that this was one of their favorite films to have been in and worked on."

Hell-raising ne'er-do-well with nothing to lose winds up on a prison chain-gang, setting a new pace for the guards and other inmates. Fairly straightforward crowd-pleaser, though with odd flickers of melodrama, heightened by Stuart Rosenberg's overeager direction and Lalo Schifrin's mercurial score. In its latter stages, the overlong film appears to aspire to loftier meanings, but for the most part it's Chain-Gang 101--though well-played by Paul Newman, Oscar winner George Kennedy, and a solid, sometimes funny and colorful supporting cast. The central character's sunny rebellion turns serious by the midway point, and director Rosenberg overdoses on inmate clich\u00e9s, but one is so apt to be drawn to Newman's characterization that the sour residue the movie leaves behind is not likely to catch up to viewers until later. *** from ****"

But it was made, keep in mind, in an era when assembly line symbolism was all the rage, and mainstream American movies were often hard pressed to express some kind of 'heavy' relevance. The film is actually a good deal less pretentious than it sounds, with attractive photography, several notable performances, and a lively sense of humor helping to offset the lazy pacing and obvious emphasis on subtext. But it deserves to be seen in a theater, on a big screen, because any movie filmed in wide-screen Panavision is bound to have its impact crippled when viewed on television."

Newman can distill Luke's emotions with just a grin or an eyebrow twitch. Luke's best friend Dragline, played by George Kennedy, juxtaposes Luke's meek nature in his energetic and over-explicit demeanour. Dragline's leadership and command contrasts perfectly with Luke's reservedness causing both characters to be dependent on one another in need of what they lack.\n\nAnalysing the practicalities, there are a few cases where the editing is very erratic - for example the transitions in music between scenes are very jumpy! There are some very long shots which don't progress the plot and so if you are wondering why the running time is 2 hours well that's your answer!\n\nOverall, although I was initially sceptical about watching this film it was a very entertaining watch!\n\nPS.

There we watch him refusing any authority and he does not care about anything except himself. This has as a result the other prisoners to admire him and see him like their hero. Although the camp staff has an another opinion about all of that and they do their best to destroy and break him.\n\nI liked this movie because of the plot which I found simply magnificent, also the cast was well picked and these choices had as a result this great result. Of course the direction of Stuart Rosenberg was for one more time very good. I also believe that the interpretation of Paul Newman who played as Luke in this movie was one of his best interpretations ever. Another great interpretation that has to be mentioned is George Kennedy's who played as Dragline and he was simply outstanding on it (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role).\n\nFinally I want to say that \"Cool Hand Luke\" shows us the truth behind the rural prisons on that times and how this influence all of the people who are getting involved with it. Also this movie wanted to make us think about the choices that we make in our lives, how important are and if were correct or no.

        "review_detailed_main": "I read another comment on here that said that this and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are two films which are pretty much identical. While I was watching Cool Hand Luke I did recollect the other classic (to me still much more extraordinary) guys-locked-up movie Cuckoo's Nest, as it did have its hero knocking an authority as tough as a ton on bricks. But there's a big difference between the two films- in Cuckoo's Nest, you had in Nicholson a rebel-rouser who didn't mind getting some real words across to people with his plight, and the people he was locked up with are actually, to a basic degree, sane. Newman is, much as the title suggests, 'cool', as he really doesn't have that much dialog for most of the picture, and the system he's bucking isn't supposed to be \"helping\" him and the people he's with. They're there on the chain gang to bust ass and do the work that nobody in their right mind would do unless pointed by a gun to do so. Though on the other hand, this dynamic from Newman, amid a very good prison movie, still makes Cool Hand Luke quite memorable for its ways of bucking the system.\n\nIt's also by turns an often funny movie, with the centerpiece of the 50 egg bet being one that is just sheerly, unabashedly entertaining. And it's the kind of scene that does almost remind someone of that scene in Cuckoo's Nest where they all get riled up during the 'baseball game' on TV. But sometimes the filmmakers doing Cool Hand Luke do perhaps push a wee bit much allegory on such a simple set of events, less a story, than necessary. At the end of the 50 egg sequence, Newman is basically laid out on the table- and I'm sure it's meant to be intentional- in the form of Christ. This is played up for a lot of the rest of the film, as it's perhaps really intuited that he's suffering for the other prisoner's sins, and may even perhaps someday die for it all. This side ends up becoming a little preachy, even if its meant to be subtle, which I don't think it is, and it detracts from the greater pleasures of watching a picture like this.\n\nBecause really, aside from the allegory, this is just good old prison picture, and one that pushes the boundaries of the prisoner-escape angle, such as that Newman's Luke escapes for the whole second half of the movie! It's also kind of bittersweet that the filmmakers decide not to show how Newman gets captured, but leaves it at first on the prisoners- who after getting beaten up by Oscar winning George Kennedy's rily character, and getting them to fix a road like its some competition- and then just suddenly he's caught again. At one point this even leads to the now classic line, once sampled in a Guns n Roses song, \"what we've got here is failure to communicate\" by the always great character actor Strother Martin. Though if you're not really looking for message or allegory, it's also just a really neat 'guy' movie, in the best sense of the word, with scenes like the torturous girl-washes-car-in-front-of-chain-gang scene, and of course ones that just show them acting like real guys. It's populated by a plethora of acting talent, with Kennedy, Dennis Hopper, Luke Askew, and even a guitar strumming/singing Harry Dean Stanton! (Which is a hoot if you've seen as mant Stanton films as me).\n\nAnd then finally there's Newman himself, definitely in one of his seminal roles even if it's not a full-on total masterwork. Here he actually does create a character out of someone who is really sort of a nobody with no real aims. He doesn't even know what do to when he breaks out of prison, even as he gets as far as Chicago. \"I never planned anything in my life\", he says at one point. That the character only has maybe 15 lines in the film isn't a problem for Newman either. He makes such a thin character, ultimately, likable and strong, and fulfills such an anti-hero very believably, especially when he's most needed to put up his acting chops towards the end of the picture. Even if you're not too much into prison movies- and this one does have in it the kind of spirit that speaks back to the films of the 30s (in a good way for the old-school fans)- it's worth it just to see what Newman does, alongside the other actors. It also holds up pretty well decades later, which is a credit not just to Newman but to the screenwriters and director Stuart Rosenberg, probably the highlight of an otherwise journeyman filmmaker career."

        "review_detailed_main": "One problem with society is its tendency to marginalize those who are different or don't fit in and, to a degree, this is what \"Cool Hand Luke\" is about. Luke is a loner who is picked up by the cops one evening for cutting the heads off parking meters while drunk. However inconsequential this crime might seem, it gets him two years on a chain gang and what transpires over the next couple of hours shows how one man resists a system which seemingly has no place (or use) for him. Despite the overall downbeat tone, the film still manages to have a sense of humor which is heavily derived from situations that one might find while in prison. It also helps that Paul Newman as Luke is so likable and \"cool.\" The title of the film comes from a scene in which Luke is playing poker with the other guys and wins by bluffing the other guy into folding. He says that \"Sometimes nothing is a cool hand,\" and from then on is called \"Cool Hand Luke.\" Aside from Paul Newman's excellent performance, Strother Martin gives a great turn as the prison captain who, while seemingly easygoing on the surface, is quite authoritarian and does everything in his power to beat Luke into submission. He also gets an awesome quote which has become quite famous: \"What we've got here is a failure to communicate.\" Not only is that a great line, but the way in which he delivers it suggests a weariness with the way that Luke has thus far managed to resist being broken. It was also nice to see Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite and Dennis Hopper in supporting roles. Lastly, the cinematography and score by Lalo Schifrin were also excellent. My favorite element was a repeated closeup of a guard's sunglasses which showed the reflection of what he was looking at, and in general, the on-location shooting gave a very palpable sense of what the characters were feeling whether it was the scorching sun or pouring rain. Overall, this is an outstanding entry in that latter days of Hollywood's golden age which has been extremely influential on the films that have come after it. Whether you feel like you fit in or not, \"Cool Hand Luke\" tells a great story with fine performances from its cast."

        "review_detailed_main": "The evolutionary trajectory of the anti-heroic archetype in cinematic discourse, epitomized by the seminal work \"Cool Hand Luke,\" marks a departure from entrenched paradigms of heroism towards more nuanced and morally ambiguous characterizations. Antecedent to the film's release in 1967, the cinematic landscape had already borne witness to the ascendance of protagonists such as Terry Malloy in \"On the Waterfront\" and Jim Stark in \"Rebel Without a Cause,\" whose narratives challenged prevailing constructs of virtuous heroism. However, \"Cool Hand Luke,\" under the directorial aegis of Stuart Rosenberg, assumes a singularly distinctive position in this trajectory, presenting a compelling portrayal of a charismatic and defiant protagonist, embodied by Paul Newman's titular character.\n\nSet within the confines of a chain gang prison, \"Cool Hand Luke\" intricately delineates the protagonist's journey towards self-discovery and existential defiance against the strictures of authoritarianism and societal conformity. Through a tapestry of interpersonal interactions with both fellow inmates and custodial authorities, the film navigates themes of rebellion, redemption, and the search for existential meaning amidst the oppressive milieu of the penal institution. Luke's resolute refusal to capitulate to established power structures resonated deeply with audiences, reflecting a zeitgeist of societal disillusionment and yearning for individual autonomy, particularly against the backdrop of the tumultuous 1960s marked by civil rights activism and the Vietnam War.\n\nDirector Stuart Rosenberg's deft employment of cinematic techniques imbues \"Cool Hand Luke\" with a visual poignancy that transcends the confines of its narrative milieu. Through innovative camera angles and evocative mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, the film immerses viewers in the austere and claustrophobic environment of the prison, heightening the palpable tension between individual agency and institutional oppression. Iconic sequences, such as Luke's Herculean feat of consuming fifty eggs in a wager, and the haunting denouement depicting his lifeless form crucified on a makeshift structure, underscore the film's thematic resonance and enduring cultural impact.\n\nNotwithstanding its critical acclaim and enduring legacy, \"Cool Hand Luke\" has not been immune to critical scrutiny and scholarly interrogation. Some detractors have levied charges of romanticizing the anti-heroic archetype and exalting violence and insurrection as viable modes of resistance. Furthermore, critiques pertaining to gender representation and racial stereotyping have been marshaled, highlighting the film's purported deficiencies in rendering fully realized female characters and its reliance on reductive portrayals of African American inmates.\n\n\"Cool Hand Luke\" occupies an indelible position within the annals of cinematic history, serving as a paradigmatic exemplar of the anti-heroic narrative tradition. By interrogating established paradigms of heroism and valor, the film engenders a discourse that transcends the confines of its temporal and spatial context, resonating with audiences across generations. Through its multifaceted exploration of existential defiance, redemption, and the human condition, \"Cool Hand Luke\" continues to serve as a testament to the enduring allure of morally ambiguous protagonists and the inexorable power of cinematic storytelling to illuminate the complexities of the human experience."

Research will show the interested that the daily life of the prisoners were true to life. Luke's message to others is to live life to the fullest and do not meekly take dirt from anyone. You can't help but like Luke. Almost anyone can look into Luke and find bits and pieces of him (her) self. I think Luke is not a child of the 60's, 70's or 80's but rather is a character that is ageless. Luke took risks and accepted the consequences. I like Luke, but feel sorry for him too. In the end his greatest victory was a defeat."

        "review_detailed_main": "At it's time in 1967 \"Cool Hand Luke\" was clearly a masterpiece a work of art in it's time frame with it's main theme being to learn to adapt to the rules of conformity. Set in the rural south classy Paul Newman plays Luke a southerner who's rebellious and a loner. So upon his arrest for another petty crime it's off to a camp that's rural just like a work style road prison. The work is harsh ranging from digging ditches, shoveling dirt, and cutting and chopping hay. Along the way for Luke learning to adapt is a struggle, yet help is provided from fellow prisoner Dragline(George Kennedy)I must say that George gives a fine and likable performance by showing his character could be such an anti establishment role model. Very memorable is the accent and performance of camp captain played by Strother Martin who chills Luke with one of the most memorable and famous lines in cinema history \"What we've got here is... failure to communicate\" Though the film is not a modern day prison film and seems outdated to some the film is with rich humor and clever in it's own way. Especially during the chase scene when Luke uses pepper to throw off the smell of the chasing dogs. And the storytelling is powerful with the scenes of the inmates communicating by folk music and hymns. Overall a powerful film about trying to adjust to conformity, and it shows at the same time it's so hard when a strong detached and indifferent character like Luke is just so prone to the crime of non conformity."

What is it that draws people to watch bored characters make themselves into losers for no good reason? In Cool Hand Luke, the main character, Luke, played by Paul Newman, ends up in prison for a short sentence he earned by destroying public property (parking meters). For anyone with any shred of common sense, serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in, get out, lesson learned.\n\nBut, to make the story interesting, Luke manages to create friction where there was none, for no good reason other than tendency to self-destruct. He is not an anti-conformist, not very smart, and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy, and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames, albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God, but the \"conversation\" is lacking, uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled, self-absorbed, angry teen.\n\nPerhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged, or searching for God, or inspiring others to be different, but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments, and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anti-conformism, one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that.\n\nAll in all, this depressing, pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening. I gave it 2 stars only for Paul Newman's performance, otherwise, it would be a firm zero."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sentenced to a stint on a chain gang for a minor offence, a disillusioned former soldier becomes an unexpected role model for his fellow inmates due to his unwillingness to conform in this iconic prison movie starring Paul Newman. Often cited as one of Newman's finest performances, 'Cool Hand Luke' certainly provides him with one of his most complex and dynamic characters as he has to balance pretending to be subdued by the wardens and actually feeling subdued by their harsh treatment. It is also easy to relate to Luke's uncertainty with what he wants to do with the rest of his life, which surfaces in a touching scene in which he is visited by his mother who is shocked that he has no plans for the future. As the film progresses though, Luke becomes bent on escaping captivity, and the way he is treated, it is hard to blame him. On the same note though, his wanting to escape goes directly against his characterisation as a man with no plans for the future. It also never quite gels that he would escape given that he was serving a quite minimal sentence. Prison escape movies are almost always interesting though, and Luke's ingenuity is remarkable in itself. The entire film is also buoyed up by the genuine sense of camaraderie that radiates between the prisoners throughout; they are not out to attack one another, but rather share a strong bond similar to POW inmates. The film has several memorable scenes too beyond the famous \"failure to communicate\" exchanges and Lalo Schifrin's slowly swelling score is a blast, especially during a pivotal boxing match."

It is all too easy for them to quickly revere and rally around laid back Luke with close to no backstory or reason. As a character Luke is never fully explored nor is there any strong substance driving this story. Paul Newman is a great actor and icon but the film leaves a lot to be desired. You end up having 2 hours of film with no ground covered, great directors have done a lot with less.

        "review_detailed_main": "Cool Hand Luke is an engaging movie with symbolism, about one of the great characters of cinema. Throughout the whole film there is symbolism, which supports the things that have been said earlier by characters. I like the inventive and fitting camera work that supports the messages and lends more power to the film. I also like the sound design, which especially in the beginning often has a dazzling effect, in combination with the cinematography, like, when the camera closes in on the ventilator.\n\nIt's the kind of film with symbolism that doesn't get much appreciation from the art-house crowd (you know you're one of them, don't lie to yourself), since it could be dangerous to acknowledge the symbolism in a film that is easy to understand for everyone, with characters that are emotionally engaging. People could falsely believe that you like it for those reasons, which could lead them to doubt your intellectualism.\n\nIn the film things are often told twice in two different ways. Usually within a few minutes, in the same scene or in two successive scenes. Like in the scene when Luke bursts out: \"Get out there yourself. Stop feedin' off me. Get out of here. I can't breathe. Give me some air.\" Oh, how right Luke was when he yelled those words to his fellow inmates. A few minutes later they are literally feeding off of his plate when he has to clear his plate but apparently has no appetite, putting this line into a completely different (more positive) light.\n\nNotably, the initiator for him to yell those lines is that when they show him his picture with the two women, they don't want to believe him when he says it was staged. The movie closes with this very picture. To me this said that we, the audience, have fed off of him. We let the film be our catalyst for our wishes to have the guts to fight for a boundless world, our wishes to have enough of a will to shake the world. Oh, how right the film was with that.\n\nSome folks may wouldn't call this symbolism. Well, I do. Other than some of the art-house stuff it's symbolism with an intention behind it. It's not just thrown in there so that the audience can find some meaning in it, just so that we have something to think about, while the filmmaker failed to do so himself. No, this symbolism supported the story and our understanding of the characters.\n\nNeedless to say that the Luke character spoke right out of our hearts. I love the fact that he essentially stayed a loner till his last breath, since films with a main character like that usually end with the guy being very social and as a functioning part of society. Sure, it's depressing that in this world there seems to be no place for good ol' Luke, but then again, I think there ain't a place for good ol' Perception de Ambiguity either."

        "review_detailed_main": "Since watching this film last night I have been struggling to understand why, as it is so well made and admired, I disliked it so much. Admittedly I had for some reason imagined it was about gambling and not a prison film. Not that I'm keen on gambling films which always seem to go the same agonising way but prison films as well if they are serious and involve prolonged periods of guys testing themselves against each other in a closed environment. WIP are OK because the focus is inevitably not on male bonding or rivalry which is what seems to have no interest for me. So here I found the first fifty minutes or so rather tedious and uninteresting in the extreme, the middle section unpleasant and nasty and the end rather silly. Presumably what I don't like about this film is what some do and here I'm thinking particularly of protracted scenes of semi naked men sweating in the midday sun with bosses being bossy, a heavy overtone of religious symbolism and an overriding tendency towards glorifying sadistic behaviour. Thinking about it those three do fit quite nicely together and are epitomised by the fearsome boxing encounter and the well filmed but horrible egg eating sequence which culminates in Newman laid out as if crucified and abandoned. The only exception to all this is the rather exceptional sequence of the buxom and barely clad young lady supposedly cleaning the car but seemingly more like offering herself teasingly to the inmates digging their trench. Although even here there seems just as much attention on those bulging and sweating male chests as on the young girl's body parts. In conclusion, I would mention that any film with Harry Dean Stanton seems to get my hackles up and here it is all the worse in that it falls to him, in the main, to sing the spirituals, another element of the level of religiosity it was felt appropriate to lay over this peculiar little, yet overlong, film."

Are you kidding me!\n\nLet me school you a little...to play a role a subtle as Newman did is acting at its highest level. He couldn't hide behind words but only use the squint of an eye or slight smile to communicate an entire scene. To not understand this reveals how many Vin Diesel and Keanu Reeves movies you've purchased!\n\nThis movie is a classic in every area. There is NO sense of commerciality here and selling out of anykind.

        "review_detailed_main": "I never really thought much of Paul Newman's acting until he played Cool Hand Luke. When I was growing up in the 1950's, I viewed Newman as sort of a poor man's Marlon Brando. Even his glorious role in \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof,\" I viewed as mainly an attempt to emulate Brando's magnificent performance in \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" I was impressed by his role in \"Hud,\" but thought that was due more to the excellent script and direction than to his performance. But with \"Cool Hand Luke\" I came to realize what a truly gifted actor Paul Newman is. Like any great actor, Newman actually becomes his character, a nonconformist of a prison community who would rather die than surrender his individuality. He captures the essence of the protagonist who is rebelling against the system or as it was termed in the 1960's, the establishment. Without Newman this film would have gone nowhere, not even with the brilliant performances of the rest of the cast, especially those of Strother Martin, George Kennedy, J.D. Cannon, and Jo Van Fleet.\n\nThough Strother Martin is most remembered for what became a catchphrase in the counterculture movement, \"What we have here is a failure to communicate,\" I like the line he throws at Luke when they first encounter each other, \"Cuttin' heads off parking meters! Just where'd you think that was going to get you?\" because that line epitomizes the diametrically opposed personalities of a Hitler-type authoritarian monster who appears harmless to the naked eye and that of a rebel who is determined to crush tyranny in any form that threatens the freedom of mankind. This tension and antagonism is also central to another movie classic, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" based on a novel written during the same time period, where we discover it between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched. This is indeed high drama and it takes the likes of Paul Newman and Jack Nicholson to pull it off."

Newman plays \"Luke,\" a southern convict and loner who shines through his tough exterior, humor, and smile. The film concentrates on a chain gang set in post World War II (1940s), yet has a strong appeal towards the 1960s. Released in 1967, the film depicts modern day conflicts, which are conveyed through the camera transitions, directions, music, and screen play. The film also offers an excellent opportunity to see fine performances from Jim Jeter who played \"Hans Dorfler,\" the blacksmith on \"Little House on the Prairie,\" Ralph Waite and Robert Donner who played \"John Walton\" and \"Yancy Tucker\" from \"The Waltons,\" and Morgan Woodward who portrayed the role of \"Punk Anderson,\" (Jock Ewing's friend) on \"Dallas.\" This is a wonderful film worth the attention of all who enjoy movies that deal with conflict, the criminal justice system, and themes from the mid-20th century."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film a treasure trove.\n\nStarting from a script (Donn Pearce and Frank R. Pierson) that not only captures life in a Southern prison camp, but also the characters in it, this film tells a rich rollercoaster of a story. Even the smallest characterizations like Society Max and Bobaloogats (young Dennis Hopper) are human and wonderful. And that's not even mentioning the superb work of Paul Newman and George Kennedy, who won a Best-Supporting Oscar as Dragline. Unforgettable lines delivered... unforgettably.\n\nThe acting only scratches the surface of what is lovable about this movie. While the story is entertaining it is also richly nuanced, sometimes suggesting the story of Christ, sometimes acting as a primer for Existentialism. I myself lean toward a more Existential interpretation -- but the greatness of the movie is that this does not distract a first-time viewer from a compelling story. It adds depth, not pretension.\n\nDirector Stuart Rosenberg keeps the action moving. The pace and overall construction of this movie could be a textbook for aspiring filmmakers. His work with legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall on this movie is gorgeous. Watch this one on DVD in widescreen if you can.\n\nThe great visuals are backed up by the music, especially the simple but versatile Lalo Schifrin theme, which is alternately melancholy, menacing, and ecstatic.\n\nThis movie never gets old to me, and I've seen it many times. The filmmakers have created a rich world, full of human characters and a dense symbology. Look for motifs of stoplights and stopsigns, crossroads and bridges. This is one film that is top-level in nearly every department, especially the one that really matters: it is a story that just gets better and better as it gets older. And I'm not \"just standing in the rain, talking to myself.\""

This film like many of Paul Newman's career tries to mix some light comedy and drama.\n\nNewman is one of the first top movie star actors to start out more on television rather than in live theater. It shows in the way he plays to the camera more effectively than some of the actors from the other back ground. What we got here is a good film that doesn't quite make the grade as a great film. We are a few eggs short of sealing the deal here."

A group of prisoners work on a chain gang, one of whom (Luke, played by Paul Newman in what is not his greatest performance) refuses to bow down to the system. But at first, he is not especially defiant and his antics seem more like pranks, played to test his own character and to give him something to do, but there's never a sense that too much is riding on them; and the soundtrack seems to emphasise the comic over the grave. Then his mother dies, he attempts to escape, the guards turn nasty and eventually he is engaged in a fight for his life and integrity. The disconnected nature of the two halves of the film means that neither is especially effective; some scenes are entertaining but the whole does not cohere, and Luke seems too simplistically nice to really convince as a prison hard-man. It's still fun to watch, especially for the famous egg-eating episode."

        "review_detailed_main": "Paul Newman may have one of the silver screen's richest careers, but it's hard picking a single film of his that shows off his star power in better light than \"Cool Hand Luke.\" Co-star George Kennedy got the Oscar and Strother Martin delivered its most famous line, but this is a Newman film through and through, maybe his best one, and along with \"Lawrence Of Arabia\" maybe the most perfect movie of the 1960s.\n\nNewman plays Lucas Jackson, a decorated war veteran who has a hard time adjusting once back at home. After he is arrested for cutting the heads off a row of parking meters, perhaps inspired by Bob Dylan, he is sent to a prison work camp for two years to \"get your mind right,\" as the prison's Captain (Strother Martin) puts it. Only Luke has different ideas, after living his life the way the Man wanted only to be rewarded with violence, guilt and heartbreak.\n\nLuke has come through this crucible with breezy bravado and an indomitable spirit that gives the film much of its power. When he faces another inmate named Dragline (George Kennedy) in a boxing match, Luke quickly gets the tar beaten out of him so bad the other inmates lose their appetite for carnage and tell Luke to just stay down so Dragline will win. Luke won't quit, though: \"You're gonna have to kill me,\" he grunts.\n\n\"Let him draw some blood, maybe the guards will break it up,\" says one of the smarter inmates, a check-kiter named Society Red (J.D. Cannon).\n\n\"I wouldn't want to frighten him,\" Luke grunts back.\n\nThe film actually works as something of a comedy for the first half, with Newman's lovable-loser persona on a par with his role in \"Slapshot\" years later. We sense a deeper pain, but Newman brilliantly keeps us at bay with his killer grin. Then as the film develops, Luke's uniquely unbending character and his popularity among the other inmates (\"You're a genuine original,\" Dragline notes) make him a target of the camp bosses, especially after Luke addresses the chief screw, Boss Godfrey a.k.a. \"No Eyes,\" with less than the requisite amount of humility after No Eyes shoots a snake Luke is holding. Luke winds up locked in a box, a ridiculously excessive punishment made worse still when the Captain announces it's being done because Luke's mother just died and they want to keep him from getting ideas about \"paying his respects.\" The only worse thing one can do than incarcerate a man wrongly is proclaim it is being done for his own good. After that, Luke really has no choice but to rebel, a role he seems reluctant to take, alternately blaming God and the other inmates for \"feeding off me\".\n\nLike another institutional inmate flick, \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\" there is an interesting Christian subtext that runs through \"Cool Hand Luke.\" Luke becomes a figure of compassion and inspiration for the camp's other inmates, performing miraculous feats and challenging their spirits to believe in their own greater power. Actually, the message seems less orthodox than one you would get in church, rather more in line with the philosophy of Christian existentialism, where one is left to do what he feels best in a hostile environment and God comes in the form of a quiet voice inside rather than thunder from on high.\n\nYou could make \"Cool Hand Luke\" today and it would be just as impressive, but something about the time the film was made adds to its relevance. Questioning authority became quite the thing to do by this time, but few films raised those questions as entertainingly and intelligently as Luke.\n\nAnd what a rich ensemble! Kennedy, Cannon, Joe Don Baker, Dennis Hopper, Anthony Zerbe, Ralph Waite, Wayne Rogers and the other actors playing the inmates mesh superbly, as do the authority figures played by Martin, Luke Askew, and Clifton James as Carr the floorwalker, who sets down the rules of the camp in a terrific speech. Harry Dean Stanton shows off a fine singing voice, while two other actors give powerful performances without delivering a line; Morgan Woodward as No-Eyes and Joy Harmon as a girl who washes a car in one of the most memorable torture sequences ever put on screen.\n\nMake no mistake, this is Newman's film all the way. He laughs, he screams, he prays, he fights, he even sings and plays the banjo and shows some skin. And he earns our devotion every bit as much as Luke does his prison comrades, giving us a figure of inspiration to hold onto long after he's gone."

The religious subtext is completely uninteresting for me. The movie probably intends to bring criticism on the penitentiary system in America but the characters are totally unrealistic. Hence, I take it as a comedy rather than drama. This way it is more watchable. I remember the egg eating scene from my childhood but didn't know it was in this movie. It was fun to see it again."

Nevermind the numerous themes and philosophical angles happening.

The books author was an inmate at that prison in the late 1930s and early 1940s. There are still some of the old buildings from that prison work camp still standing on Hwy 19 just south of Tavares, Fl. From what I have been told from some older people in the area, the movie is pretty close to the actual environment at this prison camp. The local Sheriff in the area back in those days took no pity on any prisoners unless prisoners family had money to pay him on a monthly basis. This is one of the best \"attention holding\" movies I have ever seen. Worth watching many times."

Although there are a few films I would rank higher, and I when I say few I mean about 3, I would recommend Cool Hand Luke because a lot of people from the newer generations have not seen this classic.\n\nThere is no movie that the phrase \"they just don't make them like they used to\" belongs to more than this one. Newer generations have become more and more unlikely to watch movies before the 70s and really the 80s. That doesn't mean they haven't seen the top classics like The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly or The Godfather, but films like Cool Hand Luke are more likely to go under the radar.\n\nIn my lifetime, have watched hundreds and hundreds of movies. I have watched movies that were good and bad, old and new, all of the above. Everyone's rating system is different, but me personally I have only given out a handful of 10s out of all the films I have seen. For a movie to be a 10, it has to perfectly encapsulate the message or story it is trying to tell.\n\nI don't want to get into spoilers for this one because, as I've said, I know for a fact it is one of the lesser known classics today. This movie is a prison movie, but that is not important if you don't like that sub-genre. It's a character study through and through. And its the best one out there."

Many of us who lived through the sixties (I actually live near Woodstock, NY) can see part of ourselves in Paul Newman's archetypal antihero, but the character is eternal--the individual against the system, against authority, against political correctness. The Christian imagery reflects director Stuart Rosenberg's sixties interpretation of Christ, one which is open to reflection. I also see parallels between Kafka's The Castle, in which the individual is squelched by faceless bureaucrats who fail to communicate. I was thinking about how I can integrate this classic into the business class I teach, which includes discussions of conformity and communication. Strother Martin's classic line can be integrated into a discussion of the importance of communication and its relevance to power and conformity. The ensemble cast blew me away. I spent several hours figuring out where I've seen the various actors before--Dean Stanton in Big Love, for instance. What a movie! The carefully crafted plot and Rosenberg's meticulous, artistic direction make this a true work of art on a level that is rarely duplicated in the post-millennial world of instantaneous gratification."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everyone knows the famous line: \"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\" It's been quoted and spoofed so often that when you finally watch the original in Cool Hand Luke, you'll probably burst out laughing.\n\nBut Cool Hand Luke is actually a drama, so despite that one humorous line, you won't laugh at all. With many familiar shades of I Am a Fugitive from the Chain Gang, it's a prison movie completely geared towards a male audience. There's only two women in the film: Jo Van Fleet for five minutes as a classic long-suffering mom, and the famous \"car wash\" girl who teases all the men with her suggestive movements and skimpy dress. If Paul Newman wasn't such a cutie, I don't know why any woman would watch this movie.\n\nWhich brings me to my one criticism: Paul shouldn't be such a cutie. Much of this movie is far too glossed over to be realistic. Prison movies are a very popular genre, and most of them are very \"Hollywood-ized\", and this is no exception. Despite looking perpetually sweaty, the men don't look like chain gang convicts. The five o'clock shadow on their faces indicate regular shaves, their clothes have only small smudges of dust and patches of sweat (which indicates either a regular laundry service or a hardly strenuous workday), and no haircut is overgrown. They joke and talk with each other all the time, get mail regularly, and are only punished if they deliberately disobey the rules. If it's supposed to be such an intolerable situation that Paul can't stand it, shouldn't it be portrayed that way? It comes across as a grown-up boys' camp, with a few hours a day working on the side of the road. When Paul starts breaking the rules, I couldn't help but wonder why he was doing it.\n\nBut if you do love his sparkly blue eyes, you'll probably want to see this movie. It's very famous and has some iconic scenes, and who really tires of his bad boy attitude? He's too cool for school, and we all love him for it. You'll also get to see George Kennedy's Oscar-winning performance. He has great screen energy, and his reaction to the car wash is very funny."

Well acted, excellently shot, it really helps to create this environment of heat and stagnation that it's so clearly going for. What really gets me though this time around is this metaphor for non-conformity and how much fighting the system alone can wear someone down and eventually break their spirit. An aimless man refusing to bend or be broken only to be worn down to nothing. This is a tough movie though. There's no real hope here, no great triumph or achievement and while that can be a depressing thought it's such a strangely refreshing change from the normally saccharine fare Hollywood mass produces now.\n\nThis is a solid recommend from me. It's a bit slow and ponderous at times and it's not terribly upbeat in message but it's wonderfully watchable, the characters are all super engaging and it's overall just very well done."

I was very mad at some of the guards too, because they seemed to take too much pleasure in punishment- but anyway, I get that that's a human flaw too, just like the prisoners themselves have. Like I said though, not fun to watch, and there are some scenes with animals too that were hard to take. But, the film score is very good, and the humanity in the film is deep.\n\nAll in all, good film, and it made me really appreciate Paul Newman- the man responsible for my favorite salad dressing.

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching this movie was a massive letdown for me. It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same.\n\nThis movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called \"Let's be brutally realistic.\" But that's exactly what's wrong: you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work.\n\nImagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else.\n\nThe most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies.\n\nThere is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons.\n\nDon't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit.\n\nOh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared \"subconsciously\" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie."

Mainly because it came at an accurate and critical point in my life and also because I saw myself in Luke's character, his existential calamity and struggle to find his path. Cool Hand Luke also caught me because of its portrayal of the strong bonds between men, it's also a beautiful showcase of masculinity with luke as the unsettled rebel, Courageous, perseverant, cool and stoic.... etc representing the man model, however, it's these patterns that lead to his end. Yet, masculinity and men bonds aren't the main subjects of this film. The storyline of Luke is one of a tortured and free man brawling with this freedom and struggling to give meaning to his bleak life. Luke self-destructive behavior leads him to this work- camp/prison where he was supposed to get his mind right and comply with rules and standards. however, this place makes him more resilient to find his own way in life, trying to escape as he realizes he can't fit in with these ideals. Even if at some point we see him regretting not starting a home and settling down. It was stirring, as he turned to god and tried belief as his last resort in one of the most classical and best scenes of cinema, in my opinion. All this to end up to the realization that he was on his own. Add to it Paul Newman nailed his role, he gave his complex character this enthralling charisma and infectious witt but most importantly he triumphed at portraying the light and smiley despair of luke. A film for the ages, it truly resonated in me for all the right reasons."

        "review_detailed_main": "A Not-So-Wonderful Life\n\nNo one can determine by themselves what the greatest movie of all time. That is a collective decision made through the prism of time. But we each have a right to their favorites and this is mine. But why this one? I'm not particularly sympathetic to prisoners: if you can't do the time, don't' do the crime. But my favorite Tv is 'The Fugitive' and my favorite movie is 'Cool Hand Luke'. Go figure. Both reached their heights in 1967, when the TV series ended with the successful resolution of the problems of Dr. Richard Kimble and the movie ended with it's protagonist dead. It helped that Dr. Kimble was innocent. Luke Jackson was not but his crime, (drunk and disorderly) doesn't seem to deserve what he's put through here. Dr. Kimble is on the run constantly, Luke intermittently. Both stories produce great poignancy and identification with the protagonist. Dr. Kimble becomes a symbol of the unfairness of life, Luke of the dignity of the individual.\n\nFor many people, their favorite movie is 'It's a Wonderful Life', in which the protagonist, under great stress, suggests that it would have been better if he'd never been born. An angel shows him how things would have been: his community would have been a cesspool of vice. His brother would have died and would have bene unable to save others. And his wife would have be condemned to loneliness without him and their unborn children. I agree that it's very powerful but somewhat under-cut by the fact that George Bailey is a pillar of the community: creating a case for his value as a human being is easy - there should have been a statue to the guy. I've previously contrasted that to the Billy Bigelow character in 'Carousel', a nere-do-well whom no one respects but is redeemed by his ability to love and inspire love in others. Luke is a similar character who is redeemed by his refusal to give up and that \"Cool Hand Luke smile of his\".\n\nIt's the greatest role of my favorite modern actor. (I'm also an Errol Flynn fan but that's another story). He's supported by an incredible cast of 1960's talent: George Kennedy, the best supporting actor ever, Strother Martin, Morgan Woodward, JD cannon, Dennis Hopper, Lou Antonio, Robert Drivas, Clifton James, John McLiam, harry dean Stanton, Wayne Rogers of TV's MASH, Ralph Waite, (Papa Walton), Anthony Zerbe, Dick Davalos, who got the role in East of Eden, (1955) that Paul had auditioned for, acting with James Dean and Jo Van Fleet who would have played his mother in that film and does in this one.\n\nAnd I love the scene where the prisoners have gone from treating Luke with disdain to almost worshiping him because the picture he had placed in a magazine during one of his several escapes, only to see him captured again and delivered to them beaten up. They want him to tell tales of his exploits and he shouts at them \"Don't feed on me!\" I've bene feeding on Luke Jackson ever since.\n\nBut it's Lalo Schifrin's incredible musical score that puts this one over the top for me. Schifrin is most famous for writing the iconic theme for TV's Mission Impossible, (who's first season ended in this same year of 1967). Whenever a see a movie so good that I wonder if it might become my favorite movie of all time, the Ballad of Cool hand Luke starts playing in my head and I know that it isn't."

        "review_detailed_main": "Good Newman film - taut energy - the strength of the film lies in Newman's portrayal of Lucas Jackson, a non-conformist who under most circumstances wouldn't even be considered a criminal. But he's paying the price for a drunken jag resulting in some damaged parking meters, and without trying, ingratiates himself with fellow prisoners following a physical beating at the hands of fellow prisoner Dragline (George Kennedy). That confrontation sets up the story for Luke's repeated attempts at escaping not only from the work farm, but from his own restless sense of being a prisoner in his own skin. Director Stuart Rosenberg magnifies Luke's struggle for redemption in the strongly imaged fade out right after the egg eating contest, showing the prone Newman in a crucifixion pose with arms outstretched and legs akimbo.\n\nNewman's not the only standout in the picture though. George Kennedy earned a Best Supporting Actor trophy for his portrayal of Dragline, the nominal head of the prisoners who is so inspired by Luke's work ethic and integrity that he eventually comes around to calling him 'my boy'. Strother Martin also makes an impact as the prison captain, and I wonder now if his signature line in the picture, which is now a staple of middle managers and parents everywhere, was the first time it was ever used - \"What we have here, is failure to communicate\".\n\nTo be sure, there are a lot of great scenes in \"Cool Hand Luke\" - the fight, the car wash, the egg eating contest, the escapes. I myself could watch Carr the floor walker (Clifton James) over and over again as he explains what it takes to earn a night in the box."

        "review_detailed_main": "27 years before The Shawshank Redemption, there was another movie about a person who didn't want to let the prison bend himself and make him give up on his ways. The thing Andy Dufresne and Luke have in common is that they both are gutsy and stubborn fellows. But, unlike Mr Dufresne, Luke doesn't seem to have much wits.\n\nNow, the whole fifty years after the film's been released, it's really hard to tell why it's become such a cult classic. I guess it was once a very relevant representation of the people's dream of a wayward hero. A person men would secretly envy and women would openly worship. But these fifty years had certainly changed our world, just like they have changed us. And if back in 1967 we'd probably have been captivated by the reckless stubbornness of a person put in constraining, albeit still very mild, conditions, and if in 1994 we'd be swept away by an everlasting will of a person who believes that no prison, however harsh, is worth giving up on remaining a human being, then today's hero would probably try to avoid the jail's heat at all.\n\nHaving said that, I really don't think that Cool Hand Luke is still able to uphold its former status. It's by no means a bad film. On the contrary, it's a fine piece of cinema. But definitely not thanks to the rebel spirit it was once meant to convey. Just like a 20 year old hotshot people once admired for his daring and bravery, who in fifty years becomes a tiny and quiet white-haired old man kids like to play around, this film is appealing not because it's bold - but because it shows the precious naivety of the old ways, when prison was almost as liberal as the army, while twice as fun, and when people with guns were still soft on the people in chains. Back then, this story could have been about one person's victory over the cold system. But today, it's more like a showcase of one dumb idiot who couldn't simply enjoy the life he was given. Which, considering the modern day hardships, both inside and outside the prison walls, is not heroic but rather plain stupid."

        "review_title": "Grotesque Egg Eating",
        "review_detailed_main": "I think that the characters of Newman and Nicholas (one Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) are very similar in the way that they both have knowing smiles and beaming confidence. I think that Nurse Ratched is the Manager with the sun glasses in this film just like her hat showing power and both Newman and Nicholson don't like authority heads. I feel that they are both really just rebellious unlike what they are made out to be which are a whack job and a very bad criminal that have really done minimal damages apart from the under age sex ordeal with Nicholson. With the scene with the eating of the eggs the scene with the voting to watch the game is when they really are both accepted and both scenes are equal bringing all of the characters together.\n\nThe main scene that stood out to me was the escape scenes as you really wanted him to get away and for the film to end for his safety. But my favourite scene was the egg scene. He ate 50 of them, I liked the scene as it was when he was accepted into the group, it also had some humour not only eating 50 eggs he was bloated with an over-sized stomach, this also made me feel sick just the thought of an eggs makes me feel sick, I literally start gagging, yuck. I think the ending was very when he was shot, although was killed but also escaped from the enclosure but not the way he wanted to. With his smirk on his face maybe also realising.\n\nThere are stars and then there are actors like Paul Newman who is iconic for this role and many others like Butch Cassidy. The cocky motion of Cool Hand Luke may wobble from time to time but Newman's magnetic personality lends the film some weight. I love that is shot in widescreen. The story is quite straightforward with a anti-authoritarian story to a macho tall tale and winds up ultimately as somewhat of a curious and incomplete Christ tale. Luke represents man's journey from Genesis to Jesus' death. He was living in a perfect world, or eden, where everything was free and such, but Luke decides to leave by doing a very stupid act in retrospect. When Dragline questions Luke about this, Luke replies, 'Well you can't stay in Eden for too long.' Luke doesn't feel too bad about being sent to camp until he realises that it is unlivable once his mother dies; the only way out? to escape, but in the bible, the way for individuals to escape the restrained world was for Jesus to die, just like Luke. Also, Luke is able to motivate a great number of people to finish tarring the road quite easily. Dragline represents Judas, turning Luke in. But all the same stay very engaging. The film is filled with quotable lines such as 'What we've got here is a failure to communicate.' and memorable scenes. It is light in meaning but is full of cultural significance. A great deal of Cool Hand Lukes greatness is the supporting roles from Dennis Hopper and George Kennedy as Newmans Rival turned right hand man. But Luke doesn't clarify his motives, he seems as if he was put there for a challenge, inviting a conflict with the system to see if he can win. It isn't till the conclusion that the rebellion seems to be more free-spirited. The thing that makes one certain character quite dominant is the use of the sun glasses by the manager hiding his eyes; eyes are the doors to the soul.Unlike the other prisoners Luke rejects the prison conformity's that come with the enclosure and his unco-operative stand leads to tradegy. If Cool hand Luke is about how far one man can push the system, it's also about what happens when the system pushes back."

        "review_title": "Newman is perfect",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Calling it your job don't make it right, Boss.\"\n\nThe magnetic Paul Newman is absolutely perfect in the role of an anti-hero with the heart of a lion, a man sentenced to a chain gang after vandalizing parking meters out of boredom. He doesn't believe in the establishment, doesn't believe in god, and served valorously in the army but not because of a devotion to a higher cause. He wins over other prisoners not by beating George Kennedy's character in a fight, but by getting up time and again, never surrendering. He seems to see right through people, and references the crass commercialism of religion in the song 'Plastic Jesus.' (The film has both Newman and Harry Dean Stanton singing, which was pretty cool). Luke is a classic counterculture icon, and even though he does dumb things without thinking them through, we get the sense that if he had been brought up right or gotten breaks in the world, he could have been successful.\n\nIn one of the great early scenes, Luke's dying mother comes to visit him, which in an understated way reveals to us quite a bit about his past. He never knew his father, and while his mother professes love for him, it's clear they've been distant for a long time. She says she wishes that people were like dogs in the sense that the mother could forget she even had puppies after awhile, and meanwhile, he doesn't even call her 'mom,' addressing her as Arletta instead. It's an incredibly sad scene, and there is real pain in Newman's eyes.\n\nIn another fantastic and gut-wrenching moment, the other convicts become disillusioned with him, and, beaten, he screams out \"Where are you now?\" evoking Christ and abandonment, another form of cruelty in people. There are some bits thrown in to lighten the tone - the poker game where Luke gets his nickname, the 50 eggs scene, and that silly bit where they ogle the big-chested woman teasing them while washing her car - so it's obviously not as real as it could have been.\n\nOn the other hand, it plumbs the depths of man's brutality in how prisoners are treated, seemingly borne out of needing to dominate and humiliate, making for some gritty and tough moments to watch. The film references a couple of 1932 prison films, 'Hell's Highway,' in which a convict is put in a similar box (and dies, based on the real-life Arthur Maillefert case in Road Camp 36 that shocked the nation), and 'I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,' in which there is an escape sequence using a truck, so it's interesting to think of the film in a larger context. America is an incredibly punitive country - 35 years before this film was made the cruelties of the Maillefert case were all over the headlines, and 20-30 years later, with the wave of \"get tough on crime\" politics, excessive sentencing and the solitary confinement form of torture were reinstated, existing to this day. The film may thus seem like an anachronism with its chain gang in the deep South, but it's really not at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Cool Hand Luke (1967) : Brief Review -\n\nA prison drama glorifying an Anti-hero where Paul Newman puts his Best. In 60s decade some anti hero films and criminal films came which tried to glorify the main characters even they were not such good souls and apparently those films were loved by Critics as well as audience. Cool Hand Luke is another chapter from the same book trying to glorify the free spirited and unplanned living soul. This is a story of Luke, a war veteran is sentenced to two years but his notorious nature doesn't let him conform. He has Nothing to beat someone else but he keep coming back and he grows as a popular fella in the gang. His several attempts to escape the jail, his thinking to look at life and the kind of impression he leaves on everyone is all about this storyline. This entire storyline is very funny, engaging and full of fun. Some hilarious scenes in the first half feel pleasant and different from previous films. The scene of a Sexy girl washing her Car and the scene of eating 50 eggs are very entertaining. Paul Newman plays Luke as if he was born to play this role. Such a brilliant performance he gave in the film that for me his performance is the best thing about this film. George Kennedy deserved the Oscar Award for his supporting role. Stuart Rosenberg kept the narrative interesting for 128 minutes which is quite impressive considering the anti hero theme. However, few scenes lacks conviction and even climax doesn't reach the high level. The problem is in the script actually so there is no one else to be blamed but the writer. If writing had something outstanding in the climax which could compile the basic theme and the characterisation then it would have been a better experience. In short, Cool Hand Luke is a Cool looking film for Cool minded people but nothing High Class stuff.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

Feels a little TV-ish.\n\nHere's my breakdown:\n\nSTORY: As prisoner stories go, this is different on one hand and common on the other. It has many elements you'd find in the plethora of WWII prison stories, e.g. \"Stalag 17,\" etc. However, the chief character here (\"Luke\") has a self-destructive but endearing disposition.\n\nI wish the story would have drawn out his relationship with his family more, but alas, it's really about him. A strong-willed individual that just lacked direction, I suspect.\n\nACTING: The whole cast played their parts well. Newman is / was a stable and talented actor, but I wish he'd stretch more.\n\nTEMPO: A decent pace with tension running constant, except for occasional levity and a touch of somber tenderness\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Hot, dirty\n\nDIRECTING / WRITING: Director: It's funny because the directing style and the cast felt TV-ish. After looking at Rosenberg's resume I see why.\n\nHe also directed Robert Redford in \"Brubaker\" which I saw many years ago. Prison flicks are depressing. Why shoot two?\n\nWriters: This crew were either neophytes or TV-hacks, and that further underscores the feel here. Not bad, but lacking.\n\nIs it a good film? Quality work, but not all that interesting as a story\n\nShould you watch this once? Yes, Newman is a good watch (except for \"Torn Curtain\")\n\nRating: 7.5."

The best scene is probably where the prisoners play poker. Strother Martin's \"failure to communicate\" speech is a classic.\n\nMy main criticism is the pace is extremely, painfully slow. There is a pattern of brutality we have to witness and the point is well made about what these men are subjected to but for a feature film this does not move or develop with any rhythm. Even a documentary on a chain gang would need to have more pace than this.\n\nThe dialogue is so-so and a lot of the scenes are too pretentious and of their time. Not sure how the prisoners get instruments to play. Harry Dean Stanton is good.\n\nI dont consider this to be a top 200 film as it is rated here. I was quite surprised with how unmoving this picture was considering how highly it has been regarded, and how often it has been named. This is not even one of Newman's 10 best acting jobs or movies he played in. And he is very good but this isn't great by any means."

        "review_detailed_main": "With Stuart Rosenberg's COOL HAND Luke in 1967, Paul Newman completed a series of five films, including THE HUSTLER(1961) by Robert Rossen, in which he provided audiences with an extraordinary hero/anti-hero unparalleled (bar Marlon Brando) in cinema history. As Luke, the former war hero turned social misfit imprisoned for chopping the heads off parking meters despite claims he has \"a score to settle\", Newman gives a striking and unforgettable image of a man that just won't lie down, no matter what treatment he endures. Whether it be the seemingly endless torture by the guards, treating him as a dog in order to discipline him after his second escape attempt, or the stomach-churning scene in which he upholds his bet to eat 50 eggs in the space of one hour, Luke always proves his doubters wrong and grows to become a hero for the others prisoners. His bravery, \"more guts than brains\" as states the incarcerated lawyer, and downright stubbornness leads all the others, even the ultimately naive tough guy Dragline (played by George Kennedy in an Oscar winning role), to silently worship him as their hero...the guy standing up for the things their cowardice won't allow them too. Newman's role became iconic, and this is down to some legendary scenes that have turned this movie into an all-time great. For instance, the Saturday afternoon fight scene with Dragline, in which Luke just won't \"stay down\" despite the barrage of punches coming his way, concluded by him muttering: \"to keep me down, you gonna have to kill me!\". Or the scene where Luke is able to push the other members of the chain gang to work at twice the speed, thus giving them more free-time and puzzling the guards. The film is also filled with memorable one-liners, such as: \"What we have here, is failure to communicate.\" This in a way sums up the entire film, Luke is a rebel, someone who won't be repressed by the rules set down, whether it be those of the guards or of his inmates. His incarceration is due to his nonacceptance of the rules set down in the outside world, his reason for his crime being that it was \"a small town, not much to do in the evening\". But the world to which he is introduced represents many more \"limits\" which, every time he breaks, imposes increased and harsher punishment. He pushes the Captain, played with a peaceful but easily ignited rage by Strother Martin, into demonstrating to the full extent his \"mean son-of-a-bitch\" side, whose wrath parallels Luke's vision of the \"Old Man\" up above who sees him solely as a \"hard case\".As he says, \"You've got to admit, You ain't dealt me no cards in a long time\". The spectator may or may not like his character, but what's sure is that definitely dosen't give a damn whether we do or don't. And that's what makes COOL HAND Luke such a powerful movie.\"You run one time, you got yourself a set of chains. You run twice you got yourself two sets. You ain't gonna need no third set, 'cause you gonna get your mind right\", the other characters, the other members of society are doomed never to comprehend him, leading to his actions being completely unpredictable. But as he says himself, \"I never made a plan in my life\". The movie may not be beautifully filmed or as exciting as other prison escape movies such as Steve McQueen's THE GREAT ESCAPE and PAPILLON, but that is not its point. COOL HAND Luke represents a cultural and historical milestone, with Newman's performance up their with the very, very best. 18/20"

Amid constant threat of punishment, each building in cruelty, Luke continues his quest to escape. Surprising amount of emotional depth throughout. Best performance here is George Kennedy as Dragline, who is sort of a fiery, baritone Cajun who takes a father's liking to Luke. Also, interesting enough are the small roles of Dennis Hopper and Harry Dean Stanton, before they were famous. On a final note, try not to eat 50 eggs.. not a pretty sight, or for that matter, smell."

By extension, this is a social metaphor for everything that happened in the 60s - Kent State, the Chicago 7, etc. The 60s were about rebelling against and trying to change the established order and having those in power strike back, usually with excessive force, and Cool Hand Luke is all of this in miniature. Here Paul Newman plays Luke, the essential rebel without a cause, butting heads with prison warden Strother Martin, who tells him, in a perfect encapsulation of the Establishment's attitude toward the youth of the 60s, \"Boy you need to get yourself right in the head...\" Martin gets the script's best material as the spokesman for Law and Order, warning the new cons, \"Man tries to run, he gets hisself a set of leg-irons. He runs twice, he gets two sets. Don't nobody get a third set.\" In his world, as in the button down world of LBJ and Nixon, the most the individual could hope for was to be ignored. To raise a fuss was to get slapped down. The supporting cast is superb, especially George Kennedy as a tough, none-too-bright convict who becomes a reluctant admirer of the cool, anarchic Luke, marveling how \"He just kept coming back with nothing.\" The script is a marvel, wonderfully memorable and full of ideas and attitudes about society, the value of and need for regulations, the place of the individual etc. and very entertaining, despite a bleakly existential message: there is no salvation or redemption, no reward for virtue, merely consequences for getting out of line. Also significant is the fact that the picture is firmly set in the humid, sun-scorched Deep South with its backward looking traditions and entrenched unwillingness to modernize. A rebel is not only slapped down, he is dragged backward in time against his will. So much here is watchable, meaningful and resonant that even 40 years later it deserves an audience."

That doesn't stop him though.\n\nThey made an excellent decision to have the character of the guard who doesn't speak.

Sure, Luke was a hero, but not the model of resistance that he truly was revealed to be in little of the next couple of years. Today, Lucas Jackson is still the coolest, far cooler then Dean, Travolta, or Cruise. No character since has personified \"cool\". He makes DeNiro look like high school! Luke was fearless because we was right, not to mention very righteous, because he knew he was going to die someday, and he didn't exist simply to justify being alive. The end parts of the film are painful because we see that authority will try to break resistance, kill what it cannot break. Yet dying is a part of resistance. Today, we need a Luke Jackson; but to be like Luke, you gotta know that NO ONE gets out alive."

This is symbolized greatly in 'Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on 'Alien') live vicariously through him.\n\nFilled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, 'shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic. Released the same year as 'Bonnie and Clyde', it makes one long for the days when you needed a real script to make a movie."

I don't know if it is that way in the book, but that seems to be the intended drive for the plot in the film. It shows how much difference one person can make - not just in prison, but in the life of other people wherever they are. Donn Pearce himself spent time in jail and prison. He ran away from home, a suburb of Philadelphia, when he was 15. He lied about his age to get into the Army in 1944, then went AWOL and then turned himself in. He spent 30 days in the stockade. Then, before he got shipped out, the Army learned of his true age (his mother had written a letter) and threw him out. But he was then old enough to join the Merchant Marine, which he did. He served on ships that took him to various European ports and to India.\n\n7/10."

Brilliant performance by Paul Newman as the titular Luke who's put in prison and endears himself with the rest of the guys with his can-do, jokey attitude and willingness to do stupid stuff as well as his aloof and singular need to break the rules. The egg scene was really funny. Humour, drama and quite a lot of heart, and an interesting study in human behaviour and dog psychology. Really enjoyed it, didn't know what to expect but can see shades of every other jailhouse drama in this. Shows how a film can be honest and psychologically affecting without resorting to graphic violence and brutality. This is a clever film, and his character is intelligent and crazy - dangerous because he just doesn't care and is somewhat damaged and at odds with God. A young Dennis Hopper puts in an appearance. George Kennedy is good as the crazy using sycophantic \"big brother\" of the jailhouse, who's not so bright. Incredibly watchable."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some actors whose penchant for wanting to do challenging material is one of the most significant things that got them to where they were. Paul Newman was just such an actor. Known for his good looks, Newman, from the outset, wanted to be known even more, however, for being an actor who could stretch. This he did early and often, from the late 1950s onward, via such films as THE LONG HOT SUMMER, EXODUS, PARIS BLUES, THE HUSTLER, HUD, HARPER, and HOMBRE.\n\nAnd then in 1967, there was COOL HAND LUKE, in which he played the ultimate non-conformist, in one of the cruelest places one can be: on a prison gang in the post-war South.\n\nNewman is Lucas Jackson, who is arrested one night in a small Southern town for decapitating parking meters while under the influence. For this offense, he is sentenced to two years on a rough-and-tumble prison gang where there are rules, and if you break any, according to Carr The Floorwalker (Clifton James), you spend a night in \"The Box\"; and if you get \"rabbit in your blood\", you get a set of leg chains. Of course, Newman, not one to follow the rules, doesn't exactly comply; and after a few scrapes with the head prison gang leader Dragline (George Kennedy, in his Oscar-winning Supporting Actor role), he becomes a hero to Kennedy and the rest of the gang. But it also isn't too long before he gets the attention of the prison \"bosses\" (including Luke Askew, Morgan Woodward, Charles Tyner, and Robert Donner), and, of course, the inimitable Strother Martin as \"The Captain\" who, after Newman's first escape attempt, upbraids him with one of the great lines in Hollywood history: \"What we've got here is...failure to communicate\".\n\nFilmed primarily on location, especially in the San Joaquin River delta area outside of Stockton, in central California, as a stand-in for the unnamed Southern locales, COOL HAND LUKE is ably directed by Stuart Rosenberg, a veteran TV director who made his big-screen directing bow here. He gets a marvelous performance by Newman, who had insisted that the screenplay by Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson (based on Pearce's book) not be changed merely to fit him. Kennedy, a ubiquitous actor throughout his career, does an equally fine job as the initially combative Dragline who comes to respect Newman after beating him almost to a pulp in a prison yard fight. The prison gang is made up of great up-and-coming actors, many of whom got their big break here: Dennis Hooper; Harry Dean Stanton; Wayne Rogers; J.D. Cannon; and Ralph Waite. And no one can forget Martin, one of the great character actors of all time, in his role as The Captain, not just for that aforementioned famous line, but one that he says from the beginning: \"I can be a good guy, or I can be one real mean man\".\n\nTopped off by Conrad Hall's clever cinematography and a genuine Americana score by Lalo Schifrin, COOL HAND LUKE was clearly one of the touchstone films of the late 1960s, and a true masterpiece. And it is all due to Paul Newman, a whole slew of great actors, veterans and up-and-comers alike, and a tight period prison story that does about as great a job as any other film of this genre.\n\nNewman says: \"Sometimes nothin' can be a real cool hand.\" But in the \"Hard Case\" of COOL HAND LUKE, the hand here is a truly affirmative '10'."

If he does survive, is his survival merely wishful thinking on the part of his fellow inmates? Note that the film's final image is a brief shot of a photograph. It was established in an earlier sequence that this idyllic photograph represents a lie. We also know that the photograph's image was staged and that the photograph itself was torn to shreds earlier in the film. The ending thus suggests that though Luke has died and the system utterly beaten him down, the men nevertheless choose to believe in him. They believe he has risen - indeed, the film is filled with Christian imagery) - that he's survived death and still fighting the fight, sticking it to the man for all of mankind.\n\nBut like that photograph, the inmate's belief is an illusion. Luke is dead, and though his fighting spirit remains in the hearts of these men, it will take something larger to wake them up and shake them out of weak surrender. In the end, \"Cool Hand Luke\" suggests something almost contradictory: that hope must be held onto lest we submit, but that such hope, fuelled by a kind of mythologising and shared delusion, is precisely what engenders submission."

I get the sense that Newman enjoys playing characters similar to his personality: Mischievous, cunning, opportunistic, and eternally optimistic, while masking a tortured soul. I can relate. The quote \"what we have here is failure to communicate\" is overused by boomers and corporate head hunchos. Understandable, because Newman's characters often have great and memorable lines. It's too bad that Slapshot quotes aren't mainstream...I guess we'll stick to Cool Hand Luke quotes to avoid offending millennials and genXers. Steve McQueen cool vs Paul Newman? Paul is hands down the cooler cat. Paul has charisma even when he plays belligerent good for nothing character that is evident in this movie."

The film seems to show, if compared to today, a republican point of view, shown by the great Strother Martin and his cronies, versus a democratic point of view, shown by the chain gang inmates, who fight and resist at first but ultimately come together through egg eating contests and never ratting each other out. even race relations were fostered, as Luke stopped off at a black family home to knock off his chains, a clear reference to the opposite of the way things used to be and the good nature of blacks, who could have easily been mad and turned him in. If only the stolen truck had resulted in a clean getaway, this would have been my favorite film, but they caught Luke, and for that I am eternally angry, meaning the film served its purpose."

I can see why his fellow prisoners seeing Luke as cool and aspire to be like and admire him. Newman does give a solid, interesting and enjoyable performance. I think Kennedy creates an equally important and realistic character as Luke's lead admirer type and champion, equal in importance to the story as Luke's character. Is Luke really a wronged, non-conformist hero to be admired and someone others can learn from about how to go through life? Absolutely not. However, he and Kennedy do represent two of life's types, and even though this film is not the great film some espouse it is still worth checking out."

In other words for messing with parking meters while drunk. The film takes us along with him into the prison, where his laid back manners and refusal to conform cause strife both with the other inmates and the brutal guards.\n\nIt's a fine example of a prison film. Newman plays the titular character beautifully and there's something infinitely satisfying about his drawling quips and his ever-present smirk. George Kennedy as Dragline, the leader of the prisoners, is also a fantastic role performance, for which he eventually earned an Academy Award. Deservedly, I would say.\n\nWhat is a bit peculiar about the film is the actual prison, or rather how it's showcased. Because to me this seems like a rather nice prison. Not to say that the Florida heat isn't shown as harsh. Not to say that the guards are not shown in an unfavourable light, once Luke earns their ire. Not to say that they're not serving way too long sentences for their offenses. But their actual day to day life. That's actually portrayed as rather idyllic. Honest work, plenty of food, long evenings playing cards and such.\n\nAnd this really wouldn't be such a problem, if I thought it was intentional.\n\nNevertheless, Cool Hand Luke is not a bad way to spend a few hours. Good actors, nice story, interesting location and fascinating point in time. Check it out if prison movies are your thing."

There's a long list of well-known actors in this, but that's about the only good thing I can say about it. See \"Shawshank Redemption, 1994\" or \"Bad Boys, 1983\" instead."

Who killed JFK? Are all Americans treated equally? This period of oppression was treated with studied indifference by America's \"Bosses,\" who did not consider themselves answerable to the American underclass that Marx referred to as \"wage-slaves.\" Their best response was pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook from the Captain (\"What we have here is failure to communicate.\") The film suggests a Higher Authority, who is the repository of truth and who Luke addresses as \"Old Man;\" it is filled with Christian imagery and references. Luke is Prisoner #37. The movie's theme is given in Luke 1:37: \"For with God nothing shall be impossible.\" Luckily, establishment heroine Bette Davis declined the brief role of Luke's mother, leaving the great Jo Van Fleet the opportunity to illustrate Stanislavski's famous aphorism. \"Remember: there are no small parts, only small actors.\" With an accompanying hymn sung by Harry Dean Stanton, the Madonna speaks to the Savior about his unpredictable, playful Father and explains why she will leave her earthly property to his brother, leaving him to his fate. Not only was this picture perfectly topical, but its powerful, enduring themes, powerfully expressed, rendered it an instant classic."

The movie has excellent dialogs delivered perfectly by the actors sometimes with sense of cynicism. Most notable scenes are the sexy blond (Lucille!!!) chick whose washing her car in order to arouse the poor prisoners (\"She knows exactly what she's doing, driving us nuts and loving every minute of it\"). another scene is the boiled eggs meal where Luke eats 50 eggs! this scene is priceless. the cast is top notch: Newman is perfectly suited to this kind of role and his acting is flawless. He really makes the character of Luke unforgettable. George Kennedy in his Oscar winning role as the prison's tough guy who befriends with Luke. also watch for a young Denis Hopper as one of the inmates. This movie is a prison drama at it's best.

        "review_detailed_main": "Stuart Rosenberg directed this ostensibly dark and realistic drama about an irresponsible drifter down on his luck who ends up in a Florida prison camp where he encounters both camaraderie with his peers and brutal oppression from his captors. The film is wonderfully staged and shot, with lots of dusty environments and sweaty bodies, which makes you feel the heat and hardships these guys experience (even if the inmates' daily life is more reminiscent of boot camp than prison). And like all good prison movies, Cool Hand Luke thrives on the closeness and bond between the inmates, some of whom we'd like to get to know even better (Stanton's character for instance). The script is strong, but has a somewhat too pronounced mission; it has a rebellious anti-establishment tone running through it, which is fair enough seen in light of the US' involvement in the Vietnam War at the time of production, but which also makes the film and particularly the title character come off as a bit stagy and overly symbolic at times. Paul Newman does his best in the lead, but the character doesn't seem like a real person as much as a figurehead - arguably both for the filmmakers and the other prisoners. He represents what they want to see in themselves: courage to oppose the system and a seemingly unbreakable spirit. But we never really get to know him and his disposition. The only one who really seems to get him is the George Kennedy character, but their relationship is largely fruitless, because Kennedy's performance is way over the top alongside Newman's reserved acting."

        "review_title": "Before \"Shawshank\" there was \"Cool Hand Luke\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "Here's a thought: would \"The Shawshank Redemption\" have ever happened without \"Cool Hand Luke?\" Both films examine prison life in a tall-tale sort of way. Heroes of questionable morality perform valiant acts in defiance of cold and rigid prison wardens and life is at its most fragile, balancing between the joy needed to stay alive and rock-bottom depression.\n\nHowever you choose to compare the films, there's no doubt both are on greatest film lists. \"Cool Hand Luke\" simply has the distinction of being first.\n\nPaul Newman's Oscar-nominated performance is one of his very best, or at least one of my favorites to this point. I have not seen \"The Color of Money,\" but I have little doubt that Oscar was rewarded to him for having been screwed over so many times.\n\nAs Dragline (George Kennedy, who won an Oscar) so perfectly points out in his ending monologue voiced over a montage of Luke, Newman's smile alone makes Luke such a magnetic character. There's always a sense that he knows something you don't, that he has mastered some secret of life that makes him impervious to hardship. His tacit contempt for authority makes him much more likable than your typical anti-hero (if he can even be considered one), and it also primes us for his few dramatic scenes, which are soft but moving.\n\nLucas Jackson is an honored war vet who is thrown somewhat needlessly into a prison work camp in the south after beheading parking meters while drunk. Compared to the crimes of some of the others, it's a bad deal. Luke quickly falls out of favor with the prison guards with his subtle defiance, and it takes him some time before he's initiated with his fellow inmates.\n\nThere are so many memorable scenes in the film because the most pivotal moments are also the most visually appealing. Director Stuart Rosenberg and writer Frank Pierson appear to be on the same page in really emphasizing scenes such as the \"Lucille\" scene in which a local woman erotically washes a car as the men look on from their work post, the subsequent boxing fight between Luke and Dragline and the egg-eating scene.\n\nPrior to Luke trying to escape after \"getting some rabbit in his blood\" when a personal tragedy befalls him, the plot doesn't have a whole lot of places to go, so the scenes become entirely about character development, which pays off for the rest of the film. The escape attempts have an underlying strength because of the entertaining first act or so.\n\nThe sense of camaraderie amongst the inmates is another thing you can't help but take notice of. Sometimes scenes are designed that way, but even when the focus is elsewhere, the extras and supporting actors are enhancing the environment, creating a mood for the film, one that expresses how caught in a bubble they are and gives you the sense of how prisoners will insist on life even in rough conditions.\n\n\"Cool Hand Luke\" eventually evolves into a story of leadership, the qualities that make a man great, or \"an original\" as Dragline says. Luke becomes an inspiration for his inmates through his attitude and his actions, though more an ideal to aspire to as opposed to a role model to emulate. Newman's performance hammers that home as truth for the audience too, which makes \"Cool Hand Luke\" a classic.\n\n~Steven C\n\nThanks for reading! Visit http://moviemusereviews.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Nothing else in the Stuart Rosenberg canon quite prepares you for COOL HAND Luke. It was an instant classic and it hardly mattered who the director was, (though I guess a bad director could have messed things up). This was the great anti-establishment movie of its day, (a late sixties REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE), with that blue-eyed beauty and most iconic of anti-establishment actors, Paul Newman, cast in the title role. As Fast Eddie Felson and Hud Bannon, Newman had already held two fingers up to the establishment and in many ways this was the role that came to define him.\n\nThe plot, by now, is familiar to generations of moviegoers. Newman is sentenced to two years on a chain gang for screwing the heads of parking metres, in itself something of a motiveless crime; he claims he was just settling old scores and you know from the second you see him he isn't going to stay put so it's a movie about a man who becomes a hero to his fellow prisoners for continually running away and for being continually brought back and it's full of classic scenes; the car-washing scene, the egg eating competition, the tar- rolling scene, the boxing match between Newman and George Kennedy.\n\nThe casting, of course, was crucial. It was a movie full of identifiable character parts where the actors cast as prisoners, the warden and the screws all had their marks to make, (though no African-American or gay prisoners)? Kennedy got the Supporting Actor Oscar and Strother Martin was magnificent as the warden but it has one of he great supporting casts, all brilliant and too many to mention with the wonderful Jo Van Fleet taking the only significant female role as Newman's mother. It was adapted by Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson from Pearce's novel, Lalo Schifrin did the score and Conrad Hall photographed it in Panavision so did it really matter who the director was or was this just one of those movies that was destined to become a classic from the pre-production phase? Like I said, nothing else Rosenberg ever did came close."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is very little one can say in a review of a classic film like Cool Hand Luke (CHL) that is both original and not repetitious. Perhaps the following observation might qualify as such a point. Over the years---I have increasingly reflected upon the perhaps novel idea that CHL and the movie version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ((OFOTCN) may have sufficient similarities so as to make it reasonable to compare and contrast them with each other.\n\nAs presented in both films, the male lead characters are quite alike. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and Luke (Paul Newman) are funny, irreverent, charismatic non-conformists who rebel against rules and regulations that stifle their creative individuality and free spirit. Under the confining environment of a rigidly cloistered life, each became the leader of a peer group and helped to change its ultimate destiny. But all this came at a terrible personal price each ultimately had to pay.\n\nWhile one was incarcerated in a mental hospital and the other in a prison farm, the particular problems they suffered with were substantially comparable. Each character somewhat resembled a Christ-like figure while achieving a victory over institutional oppression under the most difficult of circumstances. Their inherent integrity, decency and good humor helped each to succeed when a lesser person would likely have failed. In the end, McMurphy and Luke reached a sort of immortality by inspiring the lives of their peer groups---who then carried their memory forward to another (and possibly better) day.\n\nCHL and OFOTCN are great films because of how they depict the power of the human spirit---which against all odds can sometimes attain heights that defy rational explanation. When such stories are presented in a thoroughly entertaining way, they have the potential to accomplish lofty artistic and commercial success. That is exactly what has happened to these two wonderful movies."

What is clear is the communication of consent was indeed a failure. Was he a messianic man or just a plastic Jesus?"

Not only does he defy a cruel and vicious subculture, he becomes a hero to those who can't speak for themselves. It's interesting that someone who is a prisoner can gain our sympathy in such a way. His performance, as well as that of George Kennedy, are striking. It could be the best he has done although he has so many other fine movies. Obviously, there are serious prices to pay for one's actions and some would say they are too much, but I guess it depends on what is dear to that person."

There are very few women in this film, and what few there are are reduced to bodies to be ogled at.\n\nIn the rural prison it seems the men are very aware of the hierarchy. There are clearly more \"alpha\" men and weaker beta men. Cool Hand Luke starts off with a lot to prove, but soon he wins the admiration of his colleagues when he manages to escape the prison and live to tell the tale. It seems this earns him an enormous amount of social credit and soon he gains the respect of even Dragline. This movie shows the social dynamics of a men's group and how certain stunts can gain you a lot of favour but also land you in trouble with the guards.\n\nThis is a hard movie to watch because of the brutal conditions these prisoners exist in. They endure back breaking labour during the day, and are crammed into overheated bunkers at night. It's not fun to watch these men waste away and be belittled by the men who run the prison.\n\nBesides a few light reprieves such as the car wash scene, this a very heavy movie that has a through line and solid acting but could benefit from some more levity and a happier ending."

This movie resonated with me like no other before, and I can see what many reviewers mean when they use the term \"life changing.\" It really is a spiritual experience in a way no Ingmar Bergman nor Kubrick or Orson Welles film could possibly accomplish. Where Bergman made esoteric films that were solely for 'intellectuals', and Kubrick and Welles did films to either impress other directors or annoy audiences Cool Hand Luke speaks in a way wholly it's own. Much like The Seventh Seal (1957) Cool Hand Luke dwells on the meaning of life, and like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or Citizen Kane (1941) it focuses on what makes a person human. But unlike those films it doesn't get hooked up on the minutia of existential philosophy that bogs down many spiritual films. It all plays out in a way that is easily digestible for both intellectual and average viewer alike no matter their background. Cool Hand Luke treats death not in a blunt or purely metaphorical way, but in a comforting and understanding way. One of my friends committed suicide last week and the questions of \"why\" and \"how could this happen\" have been in my mind every second since then. This movie was a cathartic experience that did nothing but bring comfort to a mourner."

        "review_detailed_main": "The late sixties marked the rise of a culture of rebellion and challenge to the established order. Young people, university students, minorities, suddenly society goes into upheaval and begins to question and make demands. In a very specific way, I think this film fits very well into this movement, giving us the story of a man who made mistakes and paid - that's for sure - and who, between hits and misses, wanted to find his own space in the world and live life on his terms.\n\nLuke Jackson is truly a non-conformist man and the face of a generation of people increasingly dissatisfied with the society in which they live. The film makes clear that he had everything in his hands to have other destiny, a stable and comfortable life, but that his own actions ruined everything. Why? Because that wasn't enough, and he wanted something different. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he wanted, but he knew exactly what he didn't want: to feel subjugated. This expresses what American society, particularly young people, had been feeling: no more meaningless rules, absolute dogmas, ostracism and sacred cows. In that prison where even to urinate or drink water they have to ask permission, Luke questioned all.\n\nA good story, very well written and with magnificent dialogues, is accompanied by a good work of cinematography, sets and costumes, and an effective direction guaranteed by Stuart Rosenberg. It is in the editing work that I felt the biggest mistakes were made, giving the film an uneven rhythm, as the film was composed of a collage of episodes from Luke's time in that work camp. That is, it lacks the idea and feeling of unity and fluidity, with several situations similar to each other and a certain absence of dramatic tension, more palpable in the final half.\n\nPaul Newman provides a strong and charismatic lead and was a safe bet to play the rebel hero. Fortunately for us, the film has the support of several other great actors in supporting roles, preventing it from being a one-man effort. George Kennedy, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor thanks to this film, stands out from the crowd thanks to a careful performance, the best of this actor's career. Worthy of mention are also the efforts of J. D. Cannon, Jo Van Fleet, Lou Antonio and Strother Martin."

The the second half - marked by a brilliant, and nail-bitingly tense, egg eating contest - picks up the pace as the story really kicks into gear. The point of the picture really becomes clear once the central character starts trying to escape, which also leads to some really fun sequences. Newman's great performance is so emotive that you're incredibly invested in his iconic free-spirited character right up until the tragic and powerful ending. 7/10"

The Armed Forces got first release on the movies back than, even before they were run in the civilian theaters. There were no reviews, nothing in the papers or anywhere else because the movies were so new. All I had to go on was Paul Newman's name. I was mesmerized by the acting, script and production values of this film. The film taught me a number of things I used in my military experience i.e. 1) importance of comradeship 2) being able to stand up for ones self and 3) being a nonconformist when it counts. Newman was ex Navy and he devoted a good portion of his time and money helping veterans. He was also of course a very charitable man (all \"Newmans Own\" profits go to charities) and an accomplished race car driver. I have only a few of his movies missing from my DVD collection and I never tire or get bored watching his movies. Cool Hand Luke is one I've watched at least once a year for the last 10 years. I wish more Hollywood actors would follow his style. Newman was Cool Hand Luke in style, flair and coolness."

The captain of the chain gang(Strother Martin, superb) tries to tell the new men that he doesn't want any trouble, so he wont give any trouble. The overseer of the chain gang at work is called \"Boss\"(Morgan Woodward, memorable in his shaded sunglasses, and never says a word!) George Kennedy plays \"Dragline\", the veteran of the group who dislikes Luke at first, but later changes his mind when he sees how defiant Luke is, with his repeated escape attempts and eating 50 eggs. The captain is determined to break Luke, in order to make an example of him, and squash this \"cool hand\" talk.\n\nFine character study with solid performances and an insightful script that deals with defiance of authority, and one's fate as a consequence, and whether such a thing is even wise in the circumstances. Luke is no saint, though sympathetic, and certainly no role model, which is the central point I think..."

How it missed out on Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cimenatography is amazing. There are so many great camera shots. The one that stands out the most is after the \"Walking Boss\", \"the man with no eyes\", as Kennedy's character says, shoots the snake Luke is holding up in his hand. The camera moves to a close-up of the Boss' mirrored sun glasses and we can see and hear Luke talking in them. The religious symbolisms are many. Just to name a few; Luke spread out just like Jeasus after easting the eggs, the scene when Luke talks to God in the bad storm and even the way the roads form crosses."

By the look of it, it was recorded some time in the last year. Great story which I thought I'd add here.\n\nGeorge said that Joy was going to be brought in for a half a day of shooting by director Stuart Rosenberg. The male cast was given the half day off for this shooting and were told they would be called when the crew were done shooting with Joy.\n\nA half day turned into a full day, and the guys were not called to set. Then two, then three days, and the male actors did not get called. Rosenberg shot Joy washing that car for three days (although she had no dialog and was only on screen for under 80 seconds). Then the male actors were brought back to shoot their side of the scene. For their inspiration for this scene, Rosenberg brought in a teenage girl who just walked around the car wearing an overcoat.\n\nGeorge said two things about this. First, it was the toughest acting he ever had to do. And second, somewhere out there is about 28,000 feet of unseen film footage of Joy Harmon washing a car."

As regards the song sung by Luke after receiving the news of Arletta's death,does anybody know if Lalo Schifrin wrote this too, or is it perhaps, an old song, maybe a parody of a spiritual, and no disrespect intended; I would be interested finding out about this . It's the only item of info I lack about this magnificent movie Perhaps some one can help? Best regards to all Luke-lovers! Paddy Coen, Sligo, Irish Republic."

I enjoyed watching a movie in which today's Hollywood guaranteed happy ending was not for sure as it is today. Movies such as these make you think and really feel for the character.

The story, although a simple one, works on the base level but fails to completely overwhelm...me. I realize many enjoy this film and consider it a great one, but for me it was a little too simple for my tastes. Simplicity works when that's all that is needed, but unfortunately it wasn't enough here to be truly \"great\". But enough of that ruckus, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. It is really good. I'm just trying to talk it down a bit so you won't get your expectations up to an impossible level.\n\nPaul Newman plays his part marvelously, and although it's a simple role, he fills it more than adequately. Essentially, he is Luke and probably had no problems filling the role. Another good acting job comes from George Kennedy, who plays Dragline, the most prevalent supporting character and leader of the prisoners before Luke's arrival. He nailed the Cajun accent for the most part and that is no easy task for anyone outside of Louisiana. And although the prison setting and filler characters are for the most part, not realistic, I enjoyed watching Kennedy interact with Luke. Another enjoyable character is the lead guard, a man who always wears aviator sunglasses and never speaks.\n\nBasically Luke has never been one to follow the rules, and never will be. This attitude has the ability to inspire and enlighten. That's the jist of the story.\n\nMy main qualm with the film is the fact that it's somewhat repetitive. It could've been shortened considerably if certain events happened only once. I won't say what these events are, but after the second time I was getting a little annoyed. Another qualm I have is the ending, while good, I feel it could have been better. That is simply my opinion.\n\nAll in all a really good film but not a great one, and a little overrated, but don't let that stop you. This could end up being one of your all time favorites. 8/10"

But like many of those movies on the 250 list it is nothing memorable. Ask me in a week and I will not remember much of it.\n\nSo if you want to see all the classics be prepared to watch a rather slow movie, that centers around the main character's experience in a prison. Do not expect much more."

Absolutely gorgeous, Joanne Woodward is one lucky woman to have a steaming hot hubby like that. I think he has a great ability to really delve straight into roles and become the great characters he plays, he has an upbeat aroma about him and that smile always gets me its' just like music to your ears, you hear that caressing brooding voice and your knees go weak and you get goose bumps all over, a strange tingling sensation sets in and you can't control it. He is breathtaking to watch, he is unlike any other actor I have seen before and he really moves you."

The ending is in no way more telling, it actually just looks like a way to escape the storyline which by that time had pretty much nothing else to say.\n\nIf you put the movie in the historical context of the years it came out, you can understand it might have had an appeal, but that appeal is pretty dumb to me\n\nA few nice touches are blues musical references here and there.\n\nOtherwise boring storyline and annoying Paul Newman"

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a term one uses to state with admiration, anyone who challenges authority. In films, audiences have great respect for this individual who displays courage against a superior force. In this film, we get a first hand look at the Southern prison system otherwise known as 'The Chain Gang.' Although the system was deemed cruel, abusive and flagrantly torturous and eventually outlawed, it has returned. The movie is called \" Cool Hand Luke \" and stars one of the most beloved movie actors of all time. Paul Newman plays Luke, an unemployed, lack-luster ex-soldier who occasionally gets drunk, finds himself arrested, tried and imprisoned in a chain gang system. His crime? Malacious mischief. It earned him two years incarceration. Here Luke defiantly adapts to the 'Boss' system of authority. The cons he's imprisoned with are unimpressed with him until he fights the biggest and strongest to a admirable loss. There after, due to his motto, \" Sometimes nothing, can be a very Cool hand \" he is christened \" Cool Hand. \" The Warden of the prison seek to crush his independent spirit so when Luke's mother dies, he is unexpectedly placed into 'The Box'. Unfairly punished, Luke accepts the challenge and retaliates. There after it's a question of time before, Luke is beaten or he makes good his escape. A number of notable stars can be seen in featured parts who also make this film the Classic it has become. Men such as George Kennedy, Strother Martin as the Captain, Morgan Woodward, Luke Askew, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Roger, Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite, and Anthony Zerbe are the strength of this very serious film. The question lingers, is it Luke or the Captain who is responsible for the remark, \"what we have here, is a failure to communicate.\" Is the law guilty of provocation when one is punished unjustly for a minor infraction? Only the audience knows. This movie is easily recommended to all Newman fans. ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "Paul Newman definitely should have won the Oscar for one of his 1960's performances in either 'The Hustler', 'Hud' or the stylishly impressive 'Cool Hand Luke'. Newman's good friend Robert Redford was directed in another prison film in 1980 entitled 'Brubaker' by the same man who called the shots on 'Cool Hand Luke', Stuart Rosenberg. Rosenberg's style is a heavy handed reflective symbol of the attitude of the 1960's when individuality began to stand out more and more among society's people and the rebellious attitudes demonstrated by the populous are illustrated by Newman's performance.\n\nGeorge Kennedy's Oscar winning performance in the supporting role was a perfect blend with the rest of the players in the film. A victim of the so-called Oscar curse, Kennedy didn't really do much after this film and that's a shame.\n\nOne of the most important things that may be derived from this film is that its message is so simple that it may be overlooked, and that is that the punishment doesn't always fit the crime."

Not only is this picture extremely dated, and it shows, but the movie is wholly unconvincing. And quite frankly, Paul Newman in the lead gives a performance of utter blandness. The most laughable thing about this picture is how the likes of the individual who wrote the headline comment here (titled 'the evangelist') can write such twaddle and pretentious nonsense. Surely he must be joking? Lets face it this movie is about losers and will appeal to the like-minded. 2 out of 10."

His nonconformist stance lands him on a chain gang where he is predictably at odds with the guards. However, his fellow inmates idolize him. A battle of wills ensues, with Luke tirelessly striving for freedom and his jailers trying to break his spirit.\n\nPaul Newman landed an Oscar nomination for his performance; one which I think ranks among his best. George Kennedy won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in the role of a gregarious fellow prisoner. The rest of the cast is solid, including Strother Martin and Jo Van Fleet in small but memorable roles.\n\nThe script was nominated for an Oscar and contains more depth than I had previously realized. There are allusions to Luke as a Christ-like figure which are subtle and thought-provoking. However, the script's greatest triumph may be that it effectively makes us root for this anti-hero despite the fact that he does little that is heroic in the usual sense.\n\nThe direction by Stuart Rosenberg is well handled and, combined with the cinematography by Conrad Hall, gives the film an attractive yet authentic look. Also worth noting is the Lalo Schifrin score, which was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nToday this film is deservedly regarded as a classic; one which I recommend wholeheartedly. However, I would caution that it's probably best considered as a 'guy' movie, so I don't know if it will hold as much appeal for women."

I kind of thought that the main role was or could have been something Steve McQueen would relish in. Saying that though I do not want to take anything away from Paul Newmna, who's also amazing in this. Or the supporting cast, none as \"cool\" as Luke obviously.\n\nBut what does cool mean in that case? Someone who does not conform. Someone who will not anyone else tell him what or when to do things. Now if we only had rebels (without a cause - I guess James Dean would also have been great in this) in society we would have had a problem - or rather more than one. But while you can see the social commentary in all this, remember it is still a movie and it aims against overall oppresion. Against just following the rules - even if that means you'll be punished. It may wave the way for a better tomorrow. Then again, maybe this is just a prison movie and I'm reading too much into it ... either way, you can enjoy this and be entertained by it, but also take some life lessons from it.

        "review_detailed_main": "Only a few years after his role in the movie \"Hud\", Paul Newman is back playing a rebellious character again, only this time set inside a prison. And not just an ordinary prison; a chain gang prison, somewhere in the rural, southern part of America.\n\nThis movie has a very simple and very straightforward approach really but some movies really don't need much more than that. It's simplicity is actually what helps to movie forward and the reason why you remain glued to the screen. It's s true compelling movie, about real characters, kicking against authority.\n\nYou could say it's a slow moving movie but it actually never really feels that way. There is always something happening, whether it be on the screen or in the character's heads. It's what really gets you into the characters and make you care about them. Yes, they are small time criminals but only because society regards them that way. You could also say that they are free minds, who don't simply want to life by the moral standards of modern society and don't want to play by the rules. People who say that the movie and its story is just pointless because they don't see what exactly message the movie was trying to get across should really watch this movie again, with a clear and open mind. With all respect but there is so much in this movie and to its main characters that it's really ludicrous to call this movie a boring or pointless one.\n\nThe way the Luke character is set up and gets portrayed by Paul Newman makes him such a great and true rebellious character. By being different he actually slowly start to gain the respect of his fellow prisoners and as a viewer you can also really understand why. You'll slowly start to understand the character better and why he does the things the way the does. Unlike the authorities, you don't condemn him for the things he has done and does in this movie.\n\nBut really the movie still would had not been as compelling and great to watch, if it wasn't for its directing approach as well. Even though its 1967 movie, it has '70's style written all over it. I really loved some of the movie sequences and was really impressed with the movie its look as well. It has some great cinematography in it by Conrad L. Hall, who lets the camera move a lot and gives us some great looking compositions as well. I was disappointed to learn that it didn't even got nominated for an Oscar but perhaps that was also due to it that Conrad L. Hall was already also nominated for a different movie that year and the other acclaimed cinematographer Robert Surtees got nominated for two different movies already. Having only three different cinematographers compete would perhaps had been a bit too measly. But having said that; this movie its cinematography would had totally deserved to win and is worthy of all of its praise.\n\nBut luckily the movie did not got completely ignored by the Academy. It did receive 4 nominations but George Kennedy would be eventually the only one that also got to take the statue home with him. Quite funny, I never looked at George Kennedy thinking he was an Oscar worthy actor but after having him seen in this movie, I can't really complain about him winning.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise remains that this was more or less a one hit wonder from director Stuart Rosenberg. Prior to this movie, he had only mainly worked for television and after this movie, he never really delivered a movie of the same grandeur and stature again. It's why his name also probably won't ring a bell, unless to those who have seen the original \"The Amityville Horror\" perhaps. But it should tell you enough already about his career that the only movie people are still familiar with now days, next to \"Cool Hand Luke\" is the '70's horror production \"The Amityville Horror\". A real mystery and surprise to me, since this movie shows so much class and talent, it is hard to understand why he never came close to that same level again.\n\nA real must-see movie, in my opinion.\n\n9/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Newman is something of an anti-hero, where we love him despite his faults and hope to see him escape from his captors, though we know full well that he is guilty of the crime for which he is interred.\n\nThe most memorable scene? Of course, the egg-eating scene with fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour. Amazing (though far from any sort of record). I have read that this scene is supposed to have some sort of Christian symbolism. I'm not entirely convinced, and won't be until I hear it from the creators, but it's an interesting theory."

In the case of Cool Hand Luke starring Paul Newman as Luke who is in a Louisiana state prison where the toughest prison guard on the planet is a guy named Society Red played by J. D. Cannon. Now Society Red wears these dark shaded sunglasses while watching over the chain gang working on the side roads during the hottest part of the day in his effort to show them he is in fact the \"boss man\".\n\nBut there is one prisoner who just will not allow himself to be intimidated by Society Red and that prisoner is Luke who continues attempting to escape but always seems to get himself caught and punished for his effort. Now after each attempted escape Luke's hero character grows amongst the prison population especially with a lifer named Dragline played by the great character actor George Kennedy.\n\nThe one scene that is forever embedded in my mind and is one of those scenes that has helped make me a huge fan of the film industry is when Dragline suggests to the rest of the prison population and to the prison guards that Cool Hand Luke is invincible and he just can't be broken no matter what punishment the guards exert on Luke. So a bet is made that seems impossible to win and a lot of money and cigarettes are bet against Cool Hand Luke. What is this bet? The bet is if Cool Hand Luke can eat fifty (50) hard boiled eggs in one sitting.\n\nI do not want to spoil the film and especially this one particular all time classic scene but I will say \"attention children: do not try this at home!\" This is a most memorable film and Paul Newman is the epitome of the character Cool Hand Luke. This film is rated as number 172 on the top 250 IMDb list and it deserves an even higher rating. I give the film a perfect 10 out of 10 rating."

Like \"A Simple Plan\" and \"Leaving Las Vegas\", Cool Hand Luke is a well-done well-acted, fantastic film that will send you into a bleak depression. The theme basically is that if you're pig-headed and do stupid things, life will smack you around.\n\nHow much cooler Luke might have been if his unflappable pig-headedness had been aimed in the right direction by some brains. Maybe he would never have ended up in prison. That made it hard for me to identify with the protagonist.\n\nSo I think I get it, but in 40 years films have seen a lot more pizazz. The pace was pretty slow and I have to admit I was bored. Unlike One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest there isn't a lot of colorful personalities or plot twists, it's pretty straightforward.\n\nWho should see this film:\n\n-- People who love classics only.\n\n-- It isn't safe for people like me who are curious but don't normally go for classics if they're too arty. See \"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest\" or \"Catch-22\" instead.\n\nSince I use ratings to decide what to see, I think they should reflect the impact a film has today, not when it first came out. I'm sorry, I felt Cool Hand Luke was aging and will give it a 5 out of 10."

The entire cast deliver superlative performances. Newman is phenomenal and portrays one of the most iconic rebels to hit the silver screen. The plot revolves around a petty criminal named Luke who lands himself in a Florida prison and on the chain gang for two years. He is monitored by one of the most sadistic wardens ever portrayed who is called Captain and guards who aren't much better. At first Luke is not very welcomed by the other inmates however that changes once they see what he's made of. Luke continues to rebel against authority and repeatedly tries to escape. He also gains the inmates respect and admiration with his antics and unbreakable will. The plot is realistic, clever, funny, violent, ingenious, captivating and has a cathartic ending. The character Luke remains an icon to rebels everywhere. There are so many memorable scenes in this film. My favorite is the egg bet which challenges Luke to eat 50 hard boiled eggs in one hour. To this day you'll hear fans of this film quote famous lines such as, \" What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach\". In this viewer's opinion that quote sums up the main theme which is although Luke is viewed as a criminal and rebel it is actually authority that is in question, should be challenged and is the antagonist in the film. This is and always will be one of the greatest films in it's genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's often amazing how little it takes for a film to be taken as an Award winner. This is now looked upon as a good example of the grueling Chain Gang genre. Obviously 'they' have not seen \"I'am A Fugitive from a Chain Gang\", \"Sullivan's Travels, or \"Strange Cargo\". In this illustration the convicts have plenty of food to eat, get to have plenty of sleep, clean clothes, and even have time for silly food eating competitions like; betting who can eat 50 hard boiled eggs!. Apart from some hard road work it's more like a naughty boys club.\n\nLuke is somehow seen to be a Christ-like character, even though he is little more than a drunken bum, who endlessly blasphemes and vandalises parking meters. These writers clearly know little about Christ. Try Richard Sale's 'Strange Cargo' for a convincing Christ like chain gang character - this limp script seems to have 'borrowed' from Sales example - and not at all very well. The sequence with the floozy washing a car is so cheesy in its contrived construction that its little more than borderline el-cheapo R stuff to pad out the run time.\n\nConrad Halls Technicolor cinematography, and a curious cast of support players, offer more interest than the script. Also not sure Stuart Rosenberg was the quite the right director for this one. Lalo Schifrin's score is highly reminiscent of another Newman effort just few years earlier by Elmer Bernstein for \"Hud\". 'Luke' ambles on for over two Hrs towards a disappointing resolution, ending up rather forgettable but seems to have pleased someone!"

        "review_title": "\"For with God, nothing shall be impossible.\" - Luke 1:37",
        "review_detailed_main": "Lucas Jackson is sent to prison after cutting off parking meter heads while drunk one night. Upon entering the prison, he eventually gains respect from his peers because of his laid-back, cool attitude and his unrelenting fighting spirit even when he has nothing. Thus, he receives his nickname \"Cool Hand Luke\" by winning a round of five card stud with a hand of nothing and a few bluffs delivered with such cool ease.\n\nI can talk about Paul Newman's spectacular performance all I want-- about his perfect execution as this non-conformist in a prison camp-- but what makes this film special to me is something more than the terrific acting and interesting storyline. That something, which hits home to me, is the idea of spirituality.\n\nOne who is well-versed in the story of Jesus knows that His story and Luke's share many similarities (after the egg eating, make sure to look at how he lays on the table). The question of spirituality then, in my case, is the most powerful message of the movie. \"Does God exist?\" Luke questions numerous times. By the end of the movie, Luke gets his answer (you'll have to watch it to see what he finally figures out). In this way, he and I, two men both on the same road trying to figure out 'what of God?', are alike. I relate to Luke and to this film. And to relate so personally with a film or character or for either to have such an affect on me is an achievement in a film's own right. The power and the message effectively conveyed to evoke the audience's emotions makes a film great in my book.\n\nThere's more to it than that though, I'm afraid. There is more reason to watch this classic than being able to relate to this flawed, yet surprisingly admirable character, whether it is his beliefs or character with which you relate or admire.\n\nThe acting by Paul Newman and George Kennedy is superb. I apologize for mentioning it once more but I have to reiterate Paul's effective portrayal of Luke. I just can't let an amazing performance fly under the radar when I list reasons for watching films, though I realize one can make his or her own judgement and can easily spot a terrific performance. Paul Newman is among my top four favorite actors and number one still living. Every time I watch one of his films, I do not think of him as Paul Newman, but of his characters. He makes Luke seem so appealing, heroic, strong... very admirable traits indeed. And George as Dragline, the leader of the pack before Luke comes in and an idolizer of him upon learning of his sheer determination. Both of them perfect.\n\nOn top of it all, many scenes from \"Cool Hand Luke\" remain so vividly memorable. The egg eating, the church, Boss Kean's ditch... and of course, \"What we've got here is a failure to communicate.\"\n\nI recommend this film to absolutely everyone and anyone. Watch Newman in one of best films portraying one of the greatest movie characters. That old Luke smile will charm you, make you feel good, shake up your world. No doubt, the classic \"Cool Hand Luke\" is not something to be missed."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film might be the definitive Paul Newman film. Cool Hand Luke (1967), is what it says it is, cool. His portrayal of Luke, in this film, is him at his best (although, he has many other films that could be the one). He is classified as someone, who has more guts than brains and that is how he plays the character. However, there is a shrewdness to him that makes him the fan favorite of the men around him. The tough part, is the fact, that all of this takes place in a mid-western prison. A desolate, hot, horrible place. He only has to serve two years, but his guts forgo his brains and it gets him into a lot of trouble throughout the film.\n\nHis exploits eventually win over the other inmates he's with, to the point that, they begin looking at him, vicariously, like they want to be him. This grows into him taking on a messiah, of sorts, persona, among the other inmates. None of this is more evident until we see the famed \"50 egg\" scene. Without giving anything away, director Stuart Rosenberg, finishes this scene by positioning Newman in a perfect pose that strengthens the underlying feeling of a messiah complex. A persona that he is starting to make us believe too. Eventually, all this \"fun\" he is having in the prison, makes him want out. He begins, breaking out of the prison, testing the prison guards and the prison warden.\n\nThe warden is just called Captain (Strother Martin). Strother Martin's Captain is a very interesting character. He is polite, but brutal, a man of authority, but creepy too. He is the man, who coins the famous line, \"we have a failure to communicate\". Communication, is one of his favorite things and he deals it out fairly sternly. If you mess up, you are in the hot box for a night. His right hand man, Boss Godfrey (Morgan Woodward), known as \"no eyes\", wears these mirrored shades, that director Rosenberg uses for cool camera shots, that reflect what is being seen in the scene, but there are no eyes to see what he is thinking or even looking at. A mysterious figure and a brutal one.\n\nThe cast of inmates are a collection of future film and tv stars, just starting out in the 'biz. Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, Harry Dean Stanton and Joe Don Baker, just to name a few. But, leading the group is the legend, George Kennedy, as Luke's right-hand man, Dragline. Dragline is the catalyst for most of the problems Luke faces. Dragline is so over-inspired by Luke after their first major meeting, that he ends up being the one who exasperates the messiah situation. He pushes Luke to do the things he does. He is the one that creates the fantasy of Luke, the chosen one.\n\nSit back and enjoy this film like a book. It rolls along like it is broken up into three parts. The film came out during the few years, right before the MPAA came out, so it tests these lines and delivers a modern approach to the life of a prison inmate, surviving in the sweltering mid-western heat. The film has a sense of brutality, but always delivers the feeling of comradery among the men in the prison. Newman and the rest of the cast completely lure us in and we are delivered a really cool dramatic look at what loss really is.\n\nPMTM Grade: 9.0 (A-) = 9 IMDB."

An American classic, Cool Hand Luke (1967) is as much a product of its time as any important movie ever made. CHL marks the beginning of the end of the cycle of American movies about rebels standing up to authority. In many ways it is the apotheosis of such movies, providing in one fell swoop both one of the most appealing of the rebels, while at the same time fundamentally questioning whether the \"establishment\" is at all vulnerable to rebellion. It is, at its core, a pessimistic film... pessimistic about the possibility of justice, of reform, and of individualism. In the end Luke dies for his sins, and to an outside observer, his reification as a folk legend among a small band of convicts seems like a hollow victory at best. (Although obviously, the parallel to the founding of Christianity is striking.)"

The Captain punishes Luke by placing him in \"The Box\" to prevent escape to attend his mother's funeral. This injustice changes Luke, and the remainder of the movie covers his three escape attempts, climaxing in a final confrontation in an old church in a nearby town.\n\nThe movie includes one of those lines that any movie-goer knows--\"What we've got here is a failure to communicate.\" George Kennedy won Best Supporting Actor for his role. Paul Newman was nominated for Best Actor but lost to Rod Steiger for \"In the Heat of the Night.\"\n\nThis is really a Paul Newman vehicle. His blue eyes, enigmatic Mona Lisa smile, and anti-establishment persona shape Luke as he passes through doomed escape after doomed escape and makes it work. His character also has a couple of questioning one-way conversations with God, ruminating on his poor lot in life, though clearly, his own decisions were a factor.\n\nI'm not sure the film works as well in 2022 as it did in the late 1960s, but it's still worth a viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "I scored it a real cool 10. No bluffing as it holds a royal flush of cinema magic. A real cool hand.\n\nIt is centred on a rebellious character named Luke. Remember this movie was made in the 60s when rebellion was in the wind. These tendencies land him in a prison sentenced to hard time and performing hard labour for the big boss man. These days lawyers would buzz like hornets knocked from a shaken hive and screaming about infringement of civil liberties of a prisoner who was forced to sweat while incarcerated. These guys had no air conditioning, no weightroom, no TVs with 40 channels and no legal sharks to protect them. Just mean bosses, hard work and time. Life seemed a little more innocent and simple. These boys were all criminals, but yet they had some scruples of their own. They all had a line drawn in their conscience and if not society would draw it for them. In this prison, which is a common theme for a Hollywood venture, there is no F#*^# this or F^%#&!n that, no sodomy in the shower fiasco, and no gangs. Everyone knew and remembered that any man playing grabass or fightin' in the building spends a night in the box.\n\nLuke is a lovable character and has a grin like a baby. He is a carefree spirit who never plans anything. He shoots from the hip and is fountain of hope for the other inmates. Luke is a crazy handful of nothin and is stubborn as a plow pullin mule. He is not dangerous to anyone except himself. Paul Newman will always be a real Cool Hand Luke to me. One of the great performances ever. The surrounding characters are great. George Kennedy plays Dragline and wins some awards for his performance. Dragline is Lennie from `Of Mice and Men' with a rap sheet. I love the blues gospel of Harry Dean Stanton ringing out of the bunkhouse while raindrops fall on the boss's dirt. Those songs set the mood like Johnny Mathis and candlelight, but its not love that's in the air. The music sets the tone for gettin ones mind right. Captain, played by Strother Martin, has one of the most memorable quotes in movies. His line is a classic. His performance is a classic. Many of the quotes are always on the tip of my tongue. I love it when ole Luke tells Captain to stop being so nice to him. The eggs and wager scene is great. The car washing is a sexy scene without showing any flesh. She is a true Lucille!\n\nI have watched this movie several times. This film is a world shaker. I have the tape and I watch the reruns on TV. I will buy the DVD. Anybody who does not like this movie.. Well...What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some movie viewers you just can't reach."

        "review_detailed_main": "COOL HAND Luke is a crime drama film. This film is a very powerful representation of brutality and sadism on one side and a rebellious indifference on the other. The main protagonist tries to find sense in cruel conditions in a prison thanks to his ingenuity, charm, humor and firm attitudes. This leads to unnecessary idolization, which gets a tragic epilogue. It is based on Donn Pearce's 1965 novel of the same name.\n\nLuke Jackson is sentenced to a stretch on a southern chain gang after he's arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters. The chain gang is run by a stern warden, the Captain, and a stoic rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey, whose eyes are always covered by a pair of mirrored sunglasses. Luke refuses to observe the established pecking order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of the prisoners' leader Dragline. When the pair have a boxing match, the prisoners and guards watch with interest. Although Luke is severely outmatched by his larger opponent, he refuses to acquiesce. However, Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. After news of his mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might attempt to escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison punishment box. After that, he begins to plan his escape...\n\nThis is a story about a lonely man who hides certain doses of his defiance and scorn under his own mask of sarcasm. That man accepts his current life situation, but in spite of that he wants to consolidate his beliefs. However, his expression, in prison conditions, becomes a symbol of rebellion. He becomes a symbol of mutiny on one side and the subject of beating and torture on other. Such conditions destroy pride and will for life, however, a firm belief remains untouched in this case. This is the irony of this movie. An excellent characterization very well corresponds to a melancholic mood in this film.\n\nPaul Newman as Lucas \"Luke\" Jackson has offered a top performance as a loner who looking for his lifestyle. His unbridled nature and alienation are in reverse contrast to his actions. Simply, he is a positive character, while fate is playing with him. George Kennedy as Dragline is a pragmatic man who has found his own passion in the actions of his friend. A friendly, almost fraternal, mood has enriched his character. Strother Martin (the Captain) and Morgan Woodward (Boss Godfrey) are a personification of brutality and torture. Jo Van Fleet, as Luke's mother, shows, in a certain way, his emotional loneliness.\n\nThis is a realistic and very convincing experience."

The movie captures you from the first minute till the last. And you are easily attached with the characters. i really want to describe many scenes that i consider magnificent, but i respect the no spoiler rule, so i would just say that the scene with the eggs is more than hilarious!! Overall, i highly recommend it obviously! For your info, unlike what others might say, this is not so much like the Great Escape. It is far more emotional and less funny!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Although in this age of \"director's cuts,\" it's not as true as it once was, one of the most appealing aspects of film is that it is unchanging. The \"Cool Hand Luke\" that I recently saw on video is, with the exception of the widescreen aspect ratio that was lost in the panning and scanning, the same movie I saw several times in theaters in the late 1960s. I, however, have changed, and see things in \"Cool Hand Luke\" that I hadn't noticed before.\n\nWhat really stands out are the allusions to Jesus Christ. Ol' Luke, the decorated war veteran who never rose above the rank of private and is now serving a two year sentence on a Southern chain gang, is apparently meant by director Stuart Rosenberg to be a Christ figure. After the contest in which Luke downs 50 hard-boiled eggs, he is photographed lying on his back on the table, his legs outstretched and legs crossed in such a way as to suggest the way Jesus is depicted on the crucifix. Later, Luke moans his way through the song \"Plastic Jesus\" while accompanying himself on the banjo. At the end, the photo of Luke with two beautiful women that his fellow cons ripped in half after learning it was a fake, is shown taped back together and superimposed over an intersection in the road--a cross. I assume that the repaired photo is meant to suggest a resurrection in the sense that the cons believe in him once more. \"Luke is detached and indifferent,\" Paul Newman is quoted as saying on the back cover of the video, \"but he can't beat the system he scoffs at.\" Perhaps the religious symbolism in the film is meant to suggest that Luke, though providing his fellow cons with a vicarious taste of freedom through his repeated escapes, is no savior at all. He is merely a \"plastic Jesus\" just like the one in the song.\n\nWhatever the imagery is meant to suggest, \"Cool Hand Luke\" remains an excellent and thoroughly satisfying film. Paul Newman's performance is one of his best, and the rest of the cast (including such then obscure actors like Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper, and Harry Dean Stanton) is excellent. And let's not forget that terrific score by Lalo Schifren."

And he gets himself sentenced to a chain-gang, after he gets drunk and destroys some parking meters one night.\n\nThe chain-gang camp, is run by a seemingly fatherly, yet ruthless Warden, called the Captain. Luke and his fellow inmates, are forced to perform back-breaking chain-gang duty, in the scorching southern heat every day. Under the directive of the Captain, brutal punishment is meted out by the prison guards, to any inmate who disobeys the stringent prison rules.\n\nLuke, rebellious soul that he is, refuses to knuckle-under to the sadistic guards. Luke's steely determination, wins him the reverent admiration of the other inmates. After two failed escape attempts, Luke is subjected to vicious torture, by the guards. The Captain, with the help of the monstrous guards, makes it his mission to break Luke's spirit.\n\nPaul Newman is amazing in his role as Luke. I couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the character of Luke, as deftly as Newman did. George Kennedy plays Luke's burly inmate pal, Dragline, with consummate skill. Jo Van Fleet, gives a wonderfully poignant performance, as Luke's dying mother, Arleta. And Strother Martin, conveys the obsessive resolve of the Captain character, with a frightening intensity.\n\nOther members of the supporting cast shine too. Dennis Hopper, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite, and Harry Dean Stanton, all give moving performances as prison inmates. Bob Woodward gives a hideously chilling quality, to his mute, blind, sharpshooter road-boss character.\n\nIn summation, Cool Hand Luke will always remain a classic of American cinema, for generations to come."

I have always believed it was an inspiring movie; an entertaining movie and the gold standard for prison-themed films. Now not only do I believe it is all those things, it is also one of the best religious allegories in American cinema.\n\nFor the benefit of those who have not seen Cool Hand Luke I will summarize the plot. Luke (Paul Newman) is a former war hero turned drunken vagrant who is arrested for taking the heads off of parking meters. He's taken to a work-camp where he slowly by surely wins the respect of the prisoners to the chagrin of the warden and prison guards.\n\nThe character of Luke is meant to exemplify the words, body and mind of Jesus Christ. His name Luke is taken from the New Testament; one of the Gospels about the life of Jesus and one that most characterizes the humanity of Jesus of Nazareth. The book of Luke is also the only book that covers the parables of the good Samaritan, the prodigal son, and the unjust steward. A story about an undesirable person helping and gaining the respect of another, the story of a son who finds redemption and finally a parable about a man being dishonest for a greater good.\n\nEach parable represents a part of Luke. He gains the respect of the other undesirables in the prison by sacrificing his pride during a boxing match with Dragline (George Kennedy). Outmatched by the larger, stronger Dragline, he stays standing. Later during a poker game he gains the respect of the others including Dragline by bluffing in a hand holding absolutely nothing of value. He comment; \"Sometimes nothing can be a very cool hand.\" Thus his name.\n\nIn the middle of the movie, Luke's mother Arletta and his distant but above board brother John come to visit. John is coincidently the name of another New Testament writer. While he never speaks to Luke, he does seem to fit the description of a doting son by toting his mother around. Arletta bemoans her role in Luke's hardships while all but admitting he is the favorite of the two; the prodigal son.\n\nAfter her death, Luke is unjustly forced into the prison hotbox for a night. It is from that point on Luke starts to disobey and attempts his escapes. While Luke 16:1-13 is mostly about mammon and avarice, It still relates. For those unfamiliar with the verse, a disobeying steward forgives the debts of his debtors without his permission. \"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.\" If interpreted more liberally, the parable is an endorsement of disobeying unjust masters. In this case of Cool Hand Luke, the warden and guards are the masters and Luke is the unjust steward.\n\nIn addition to the parables, Luke does other things to exemplify the life and times of Jesus. There is a scene where Luke challenges himself to eat 50 hardboiled eggs at a time. When asked why 50, Luke replies \"Seemed like a good round number.\" It is also the same number of prisoners in the camp. The scene can be interpreted as Luke symbolically consuming the sins of the men. There is another scene where Luke goads the prisoners to shovel seed on a tarred road; a reminder of Luke 8:1-15, the parable of the sower. Finally, Luke speaks to God, referencing him as \"old man,\" much like a son would address a father.\n\nNow I'm not a religious person, nor am I deranged enough to think this is all one big conspiracy, but I can appreciate the universality of the many stories imbedded in religious literature. Even if the religious symbolism of Cool Hand Luke is coincidental, the prevalence of religiosity in our culture must have had an influence on the filmmakers. The writer of the novel Donn Pearce was himself an inmate of the Florida Department of Corrections and when he wasn't digging ditches he may-well have been reading biblical passages.\n\nThe famous line \"what we have here is a problem to communicate.\" comes from the movie Cool Hand Luke. In many ways this film has struggled for years to communicate with me. It is only now that I can appreciate the symbolism, the beauty and the elegance of Cool Hand Luke. Here's to hoping you can appreciate it too.\n\nhttp://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Cool Hand Luke is a classic film that has stood the test of time and remains an excellent example of cinematic storytelling.\n\nPaul Newman is absolutely outstanding as the titular character, bringing a sense of raw, rugged masculinity to the role that is both compelling and deeply moving. His performance is a true tour de force, and it's no surprise that he was nominated for an Academy Award for his work.\n\nThe film's supporting cast is also exceptional, with notable performances from George Kennedy who won best supporting actor at the academy awards for his performance and Strother Martin. They bring a sense of authenticity and depth to their characters that is rare to see in modern films, and their chemistry with Newman is truly electrifying.\n\nThe film's themes are also incredibly powerful and thought-provoking. It explores the idea of rebellion and nonconformity in a way that is both timeless and deeply relevant, and it does so with a level of nuance and complexity that is rare to see in modern films. It's a film that challenges viewers to question their own values and beliefs, and to consider the cost of standing up for what you believe in.\n\nOf course, like any film, Cool Hand Luke has its flaws. There are a few moments where the pacing can drag, and some of the supporting characters feel underdeveloped. However, these are minor quibbles that in no way detract from the overall power and impact of the film.\n\nPerhaps one of the most impressive aspects of Cool Hand Luke is the accolades it has received over the years. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Paul Newman, and it has been recognized as one of the greatest films ever made by numerous film organizations and critics. It's a film that has truly stood the test of time, and it remains just as powerful and relevant today as it did when it was first released.\n\nIn conclusion, Cool Hand Luke is a truly exceptional film that should be required viewing for any serious movie fan. Its performances are outstanding, its themes are powerful and thought-provoking, and it is a true masterpiece of cinema. While it may have a few minor flaws, they are easily overlooked in the face of the film's overwhelming strengths. If you haven't seen Cool Hand Luke, do yourself a favor and check it out - you won't be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Luke, played by Paul Newman, is a one of a kind character constructed solely of free will and originality. A man like this is a shining light for others who obtain the pleasure of meeting such a refreshing spirit. The inmates of Division of Road Corrections Number 36 received an opportunity to live vicariously through such a natural born world- shaker. This drama classic takes place in the 1960s Deep South, where brutal encounters between a chain gang and \"the man\" with no genuine values of mankind occur. Luke brings his winning smile and lucky-go- attitude to make the best of the hell he finds himself in. Once in a while, a nonconforming personality is just what this chain gang facility needs to break up repetitive routines the strict warden enforces on a diverse group of felonious young men.\n\nServing time is an age-old event for individuals to work out what to do with that time. It can merely slip by, or what Luke portrayed, exist in the moment. The ultimate freedom, answering to nobody but yourself, is a high price to pay. Once one becomes a number in the system, beautiful wings are removed and one turns in to property of the state. Sequentially, this produces a whole slew of dilemmas, which must be tackled or swallow one's pride to survive another day. Learning these character defects can be quite difficult to the defiant man, but rest assured those demons will eventually catch up with this careless lifestyle.\n\nWatching rehabilitation of deceitful men fifty years ago will have one silencing his cell phone and glued to his sofa right through to the end. Passing this original classic down to the next generation is a must to keep this film alive. Understandably, Paul Newman states \"Cool Hand Luke\" was the finest script he had ever read. May he rest in peace, Paul Newman. All viewers should make time to enjoy a timeless classic of this caliber."

There are some things that I don't liked about it, the studio kind of lightning for example, is way too obvious in supposedly external sets, what makes the things a bit weird. The ending is not fully satisfactory either, in my opinion.\n\nThe most interesting thing about this film is how it depicts the situations. There is an irony in every event in entire film. The reason of why Luke was arrested, as main example. A critique to the judiciary system. There is also some interesting philosophical questions risen. A man can really change his 'personality'? A theme that was explored better in the excellent A Clockwork Orange(Stanley Kubrick, 1971) but both films are worth anyway. You can't go wrong.\n\nRecommended. 8.3/10"

Anyhow, not only was the movie awesome and very well made, it was made from a novel. They say that books are hard to turn into movies (watch \"Sphere\" to see for yourself {the book \"Sphere\" was good but the motion picture sucks!}) and that you have to start from scratch when moviemaking- obviously not with Cool Hand Luke. Luke is copied for heroes in many other movies, books, and even video games (Metal Gear Solid), as is the mysterious warden (\"Holes\"). Cool Hand Luke is a movie about a man arrested for something he did while intoxicated, then makes every effort to escape a labor camp. Special appearance by Dennis Hopper when he was young. A must-see. 10/10."

Jo Van Fleet is seen only for a few minutes but is memorable as Luke's mother. Look for Ralph Waite who is excellent as \"Alibi Gibson\". Waite would go on to be cast as the father of John Boy in The Waltons. Great work by Wayne Rogers who went on to co-star in M.A.S.H. Much credit must be given to director Stuart Rosenberg. The film is visually stunning with an amazing amount of effective close ups."

Newman continually tries to escape, and fights \"sumbitch\" captain Strother Martin's attempts to \"break\" him. Finally, it appears Newman has succumbed to his captors, or has he?\n\nWith so many classic sequences - a car wash with busty Joy Harmon (as \"Lucille\"), Newman's fist-fight with Mr. Kennedy, the laboring to Lalo Schifrin's \"Eyewitness News\" score, the egg-eating contest, and Newman's final walk with God - director Stuart Rosenberg, writer Donn Pearce, and adapter Frank Pierson deserve a lot more credit than received.\n\nIt all ends up being another retelling of the Christ story, and it's definitely one of the better ones. Interestingly, the allegorical, unlikely-placed Jesus Christ stories that became so popular in the 1960s capture the spirit of the character (man, God\u0085 take your pick) better than the reverentially conventional epics remembered (but not exclusively) from the 1950s. \"Cool Hand Luke\" also connects its hero the then current counter-culture; and, this is what the film does extraordinarily well. The line, \"What we got here is a failure to communicate,\" defines its generation.

We see how Luke's relationship with his fellow prisoners changes over the course of the story and how he wins their hearts and minds. The supporting characters are also well developed and add to the depth of the story. The cinematographic design is simple but effective. The stark setting of the prison reinforces the feeling of hopelessness and isolation. The camera work sensitively captures the tension and emotions of the characters.

Outside the prison is actually a larger cage, and the uninhibited soul hungry for freedom is finally released with a smile. The metaphorical lens used in this film is very subtle, and I like the shape of the crucifixion Jesus after eating the egg."

Paul Newman is a natural in this role - he's got a great smile and he knows how to bottle up the angst. Little things used to bug me about this movie, like the jazzy editing style in a southern hemisphere drama but now it seems fine. A classic."

As the audience, we feel like we know every individual man who ends up in the prison, and the many bonding scenes create a warm feeling of camaraderie. However, these scenes were too long and were in need of some serious trimming. Watching this film got repetitive as we were bombarded with the same information over and over - the wardens are cruel, the labour is harsh and the inmates are really good men underneath it all. The technical aspects of this film were actually behind the times and felt disappointingly low-budget which was sometimes distracting. By the end, the film picks up pace and we are treated to more about Luke's backstory and escape attempts which makes up for the rest of the film's plodding timeline. Until that point, his character felt too contrived and one-dimensional to serve as any real inspiration.\n\nP. S. I can't even eat five eggs, left alone fifty."

        "review_detailed_main": "What I admire greatly in pictures like \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is how they merely place their settings in a conformity-based location such as a prison but instead focus on themes of nonconformity and rebelling against what may be a not-so-perfect system. For the same reasons, I really enjoyed \"Cool Hand Luke\" a 1967 Paul Newman classic based on a book by Donn Pearce. Author Mr. Pearce based the novel on his own experiences as a chain-gang prisoner.\n\nThe protagonist, somewhat based on the author of the book, is a war veteran-turned-vandal named Luke (Paul Newman), who is sent to work hard labor a rural prison for cutting the heads off of parking meters. Luke is informed by the steel-faced guards and captain (Strother Martin) of all his expectations and the rules he must follow. But after conforming to these guidelines for a while, he begins to rebel against the system, and inspires several of his fellow inmates to do the same.\n\nI think one of the reasons why people tend to avoid movies about people in prison is because when one tends to think of a \"prison picture\" they imagine a dirty, sickening, and unhappy experience. Maybe a realistic one, but depressing. That's not what movies like \"Cool Hand Luke\" is about. The prison is nothing more than the setting. What this movie is about is nonconformity. I sure hope it does not inspire real-life prisoners to rebel against the systems of our correction facilities, but that it will get lawful folks to take nonviolent action against systems that do not work. Like Luke himself. Luke does not club a guard over a head or hurt or kill anybody; he's still transgressing against the rules and trying to inspire change. And admit it, if you knew a man who could shove fifty hard-boiled eggs down his throat one after another in an hour, you would have some great level of admiration, too.\n\n\"Cool Hand Luke\" does a fantastic job of telling a great story. First it starts off introducing the protagonist (and audience) to a routine. Once he (and we) adjust, then it starts to give notes of inspiration and then it takes those inspirations to the next level. What's also very good is the way the film tends to sort of switch protagonists midway. At first, we follow Luke as he adjusts to rural prison life and then starts to rebel. When he does, we switch over to George Kennedy and other inmates. And we watch from their point-of-view as Luke begins a sort of self-sacrifice, like the crucifixion of Jesus as the movie continually parallels. The fact that these characters are so wonderfully-written with such memorable, and yet natural dialogue, and well-portrayed by Paul Newman and the cast enforces our interest in the outcome, which is notably affecting.\n\nNow there are some problems with the picture, however, they are sporadic. They all tend to revolve around the direction by Stuart Rosenberg. I must confess I am not particularly affected by his style. Two core moments in the movie are almost rendered static by hampering long takes that would seem lifeless if Paul Newman were not such a great actor. Rosenberg is clearly also a director willing to experiment and while I appreciate that, sometimes, I think, as he may have discovered, his experiments don't always work out. But he knows how to make a good picture, and most the time he does a good job setting up his camera.\n\nDespite some uneven directing, \"Cool Hand Luke\" has deservedly gone on to become a classic. I can't sincerely throw my fullest support behind director Stuart Rosenberg, but I can for the screenwriters Doon Pearce and Frank Pierson for their dialogue, characters, and themes. I must also commend the actors, who are indelible in their roles. Newman and Kennedy (who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor the following year) are fantastic, as are J.D. Cannon, Strother Martin, Jo Van Fleet, Clifton James, and Morgan Woodman.\n\n\"What we've got here is failure to communicate.\" - Paul Newman as Luke"

        "review_detailed_main": "For all you non conformists out there, take a look at this little film. I think you might enjoy it. In it, Paul Newman plays the epitome of rebellious and non conformist, Luke. Luke is serving two years in a rural prison on a chain gang and he absolutely refuses to conform to the prison way of life. The other prisoners admire him for his gustiness and his smooth coolness, hence the title of the film, and the audience admires him in much the same way. At least I did. He has got a lot of spirit, attitude, and life in him to make him an extremely likable screen character. It also helps that he is Paul Newman.\n\nThis film is an excellent insight into chain gang life. It conveys a perfect mixture of laid back ease as the prisoners go about their day to day work. There are a lot of fun moments that give the film a very cool and easy going feel, but then other moments appear out of nowhere that change the tone of the film instantaneously. Reality bites back hard in this when just as things start to look up, the harsh reality that this is still prison life comes down hard on Luke and his friends. Luke tries multiple times to escape and every time he is caught and brought back to the prison. There, the prison staff have no choice but to break his spirit any way they can so he won't try to escape again. This is where the film becomes its harshest, but also its most compelling. The film flows very nicely and is a slow crescendo to the riveting end.\n\nPerhaps one of the best things about Cool Hand Luke is its great effect as a character study. Paul Newman plays Luke extremely well and keeps him a steady hero to the audience as we root for him during anything he does. But what is also very interesting about his character is the relationships he builds with the other prisoners and how they morph and change throughout the film. George Kennedy plays Dragline, a fast talking rough and tough prisoner who Luke grows closest to. Their relationship is very compelling and developed incredibly well. Dragline, along with the rest of the prisoners, idolize Luke for his spirit and determination to escape, and seeing how this admiration develops on both sides of the equation is very interesting. As Luke grows more and more discouraged his adherence to the admiration dwindles until he is tired of it, making for some very interesting confrontations. The film is a very well rounded and interesting character study from start to finish.\n\nCool Hand Luke is indeed a classic that will be remembered forever and revered as one of Paul Newman's finest roles. It is a very interesting look into chain gang life and the minds of those who work endlessly on the chain. It reflects a golden age of cinema and exemplifies what good filmmaking is all about. There's no BS here. Cool Hand Luke is a very well made film."

He gets sent to a local prison farm in the south where like all prisons and reserved places (army, marines) he must be do as told.\n\nLucas has no trouble following the rules or making a few friends including the hillbilly incompetent Dragline (George Kennedy in an Oscar winning performance) who sees that the new fish is not cut out to be such a bad guy after fighting him. Lucas tells Dragline that he's nothing but a cool hand kind of guy in which everybody gives Lucas the nickname of \"Cool Hand Luke.\" Figuring he's got to be in prison, why not make the best of it by pissing off the guards by doing things his way from working fast in tasks to even escaping the prisons where all the bosses want him dead.\n\nI was first introduced to this movie in my high school class about cinema where I never thought i would fall in love with Paul Newman's portrayal of the rebel. This is also one of the best films about prison next to \"The Shawshank Redemption.\""

This picture isn't full of explosions and hi-tech special effects, it's full of real life action.

He had starred in movies like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Hustler, Hud, Butch Cassidy, The Sting, The Verdict and Cool Hand Luke (all of them Oscar performances). In Cool Hand Luke..Newman gives an outstanding performance as the laconic \"anti hero\" who really doesn't like anyone ....particularly those in Authority. He ends up in prison where..eventually he becomes a hero to his inmates. Luke knows they are intimidated by the villainous Warden (brilliantly played by Strother Martin) and that means he cant be friends with any of them. Luke shows no fear....and continually aggravates the hard--line Warden. There have been many parallels drawn about the Vietnam war Etc. Etc. , and his close resemblance (in behavior) to Jesus Christ. Luke sees defeat in the eyes of his fellow chain gang members..a willingness to toe the line. That is not the Cool Hand Luke way, so he goes it alone. It has to end in tragedy (this is Hollywood !!), and it does.....after the Cool One takes us on a wild and emotional ride. Stuart Rosenberg directs this wonderfully. Lalo Schifrins music score fits perfectly. A great motion picture."

George Kennedy,(Dragline),\"Bayou Ghost\",'97 had to beat up Luke in a fight that never seemed to end because Luke refused to just lay down on the ground. Kennedy gave a great supporting role to Luke right to the very end of the picture. Chain Gangs were a very real thing in the 30's and 40's, mostly in the South where I would often see them working in the hot sun and was told by my parents NOT TO FOLLOW IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Saw this at the show with a buddy, when I was about 12. Although much of it went over my head, such as the analogies of Newman's Luke being crucified like Christ after the egg eating scene and later when he is laid out in the hole he was forced to dig for punishment, I was mesmerized by CHL and knew I was watching a film on a different level I was used to. Recently caught it again on TCM, for at least the 12th time. Still as impressive as Newman shines in a large cast of talented actors in a prison movie taking place in the mid-60's, somewher in the Deep South. Luke's been sent up a couple years for basically being drunk and stupid, breaking into municipal parking meters in a small town while on a bender. He's been sent to a road crew work repair prison among what seems to be a non-violent segregated prison population in for writing bad checks, stealing cars, violating parole, parole violations, failure to provide child support, etc. There's really no rehabilitation attempted but it does provide cheap labor to work on the local roadways.\n\nLike any place, there is a prison hierachy that is led by Dragline, superbly played by George Kennedy. He probably became ex post facto leader by being the biggest, strongest and toughest among the population. He's illiterate, but clever and has learned how to survive in prison-indeed one gets the feeling he has spent the majority of his life in various confinement-reform schools or prison. He's learned the system and to show the proper respect and defer to the \"bosses\" i.e. The warden and guards. Newman's Luke as the new fish is one who will at first subtly, then overtly challenge the establishment hierachy.\n\nThe film becomes a series of entertaining sequences showing the prison life, some funny, some heartbreaking. The convicts going out daily for back breaking work clearing brush, the \"titillating\" well endowed local girl who teases the crew by washing her car in the flimisiest of dresses (at age 12, this was my favorite memory) the boxing match when Dragline knocks the absolute hell out of Luke, who refuses to stay down, ultimately earning the respect out of Dragline and the other prisoners. There's the comedic egg eating scene and later a sad reunion with Luke and his dying mother, well played by Jo Van Fleet who stops by for a final visit.\n\nMany other excellent performances and some familiar faces, including a pre-MASH Wayne Rogers, Dennis Hopper, JD Cannon, Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite and Harry Dean Stanton. Most notable.is veteran character performer Strother Martin, as the warden, AKA The Captain who tries to mask his cruelty with his phony benevolence with Luke sees through instantly. Indeed, Martin delivers the film's most memorable line after smacking Luke with a cane numerous times after backtalking to him.\n\n\"What we have here men...is a failure to communicate\""

        "review_detailed_main": "This is probably the best film ever played by the extraordinary actor Paul Newman. Nearly the whole film is played in a prison in a rural area, where the prisoners have their ways of living, and obviously a kind of boss among them (Dragline= George Kennedy), but once Luke is placed in prison, his way of resisting anything around him attracted the sympathy from many of his colleagues. He was never afraid of anything, he did not know why he was living in this life, and he had serious doubt about the existence of God. Probably he had a heavy childhood although he loved his mother very seriously. Prison in many parts of the world, not to say everywhere, instead of being a place for educating persons, it is just a place for punishment without any mercy. Many of the prisoners due to this was of living normally become more dangerous than in the past. This film shows an injustice, Luke's mother died, and the bosses of the prison put Luke in a hole just to avoid him to escape, So where is the logic? the man did not do anything wrong and is punished. Obviously, Luke became a hard rebel and escaped anytime he could. At the end of the film, there is an interesting scene when he tried to talk with God, whom he called the Old man. God did not reply to any of his questions, and suddenly a bullet reached him and is killed."

Instead, Newman gets to withdraw and simmer, and the supporting players come to represent the tug of war between different aspects of his personality. I can appreciate movies that never seeks to explain their main characters; they let the audience soak in the meaning from the details surrounding him. Left with nothing but inferences (and the exotic behaviors of everyone else), we have to insert ourselves into the part to sort out Luke's feelings.\n\nThe end of the song gives us a glimpse, but even that moment is fleeting and shrouded, so the title character remains a mystery to us forever."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is such an engrossing prison drama from start to finish that its most famous line: \"What we have here is a failure to communicate!\" is certainly not true of the film itself. As a matter of fact, by the time it winds to a rather sad conclusion, the viewer feels as though he's been harshly imprisoned along with Luke.\n\nAs the title character, PAUL NEWMAN gives what has to be one of his finest performances--full of cockiness, swagger, and the kind of macho stubborness that gets him in so much trouble in the first place. He clearly has an attitude problem that the guys in charge do their utmost to change--to no avail. His struggles to escape are met with defeat at every turn--but does he learn his lesson? Hell no.\n\nGEORGE KENNEDY's is the other great male performance, excellent as Dragline, who at first bullies Luke and then comes to respect him. The only female performance in the film (aside from the curvaceous car-wash gal) is JO VAN FLEET as Luke's mother who also has plenty of attitude and has only a couple of brief scenes that she makes the most of. She's almost playing the same character she did as James Dean's mom in EAST OF EDEN.\n\nBut it's Newman's film all the way and he's brilliant as the self-absorbed n'er-do-well whose confrontational attitude with authority is the whole raison d'etre for the plot and his whole reason for ending up on a chain gang. There's a moral there, but I'm not quite sure what it is. Still, it's an engrossing film, both gritty and humorous and sometimes powerful.\n\nSumming up: Well worth seeing for Newman's greatest performance."

If you \"Stay Down!\" then you can eke out an existence, but you become a 'leech' rather than a solid example of humanity.\n\nThe price for cementing your own presence saps your energy just as crucially, though, if less tangibly...\n\nPaul Newman is perfect for a role like this; because he seems to be the bearer of such a quiet dignity as a man anyway, let alone an actor. We're left to ponder whether it is in fact PRISON life which has imbued this kind of grace and dignity within Luke. He arrived there for some trivial misdemeanour, but in his current environment, even trivial undertakings eventually take on an extra symbolism all of their own. Things MATTER more, and how you approach them matters greatly, also. What exactly would such a man amount to in the open world, without the influence of oppressive and restrictive forces?\n\nIs the way to survive an institution to draw strength from others and yet not allow to be drawn from oneself? These are complex questions deriving from a basic theme; but there is a far simpler slogan that can become a 'byword' for handling your troubles...\n\nLuke would doubtless not be presumptuous enough to push it forward using the unwelcome 'leader' status he attains, but it goes thus: 'Know your limits, keep within yourself, and above all, be cool!'\n\n10/10."

The best parts were: Luke singing with the banjo on his bunk after his mother dies, the egg-eating contest, blood hounds sneezing from all the pepper, the way he fooled all those guards. When I watch it now, those \"best parts\" still stand out, but now that I'm older, I'm catching on to the other ones: this tormented man who could never deal with authority, the \"fair-weather friends\" who stick by him only as long as he remains their hero, Luke's tortured search for God (the ultimate authority figure). Kennedy's performance is wonderful, Newman is superb.... I recommend this to anyone who wants a good cry and some good laughs along the way."

Luke is a funny, memorable and I think it has a \"cool\" storyline, and it isn't one of the films that uses a boring story line that you see in every other film, this has one of its own. I think casting for it was good, none of the actors didn't play their role well, and they all added their own little finesse to the movie. This is the type of movie I would recommend to everyone. This film covers a lot of genres, from comedy to drama to action. Cool Hand Luke is a movie I've watched many times, and will definitely watch many more times.This film has had some films that have attempted the plot once or twice but none are able to match up with the Stuart Rosenberg original"

He was nominated for the Academy award for Best Actor as Cool Hand Luke for 1967 but lost out to Rod Stieger in a field that also included Spencer Tracy, Warren Beaty and Dustin Hoffman. The film received three other nominations for Supporting Actor which George Kennedy won, and for Screenplay from Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson adapted from Pearce's novel and Original Music Score from Lalo Shifrin. Novelist Pearce had himself one been a chain gang convict which inspired his story. It would be his first and only screenplay for a theatrical release. Director Stuart Rosenberg would go on to direct Newman in a couple more movies had just made the leap from television director to the big screen with Cool Hand Luke as his first theatrical feature. Rosenberg would enjoy continued success with Brubaker, The Drowing Pool, the April Fools and The Amityville Horror. Kennedy won the Supporting Actor Oscar but more people probably remember the remarkable performance by Strother Martin. Cast members also include Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Wayne rogers, Ralph Waite and Joe Donn Baker. Cool Hand Luke thumbs it's nose at conformity, establishment and oppression which made it very popular in 1967 with audiences. I'm generally not a big fan of prison movies but I would give this an 8.0 out of 10."

Graced by a stellar cast, this is the epitome of one of those excellent movies. Strother Martin had a never failing genius when it came to portraying southern cads, regardless of what level of society he represented. And as the cruel warden in this film he is just as wonderfully entertaining as his fans have learned to expect. Casting the amazing Jo Van Fleet in the cameo role as Luke's mother in failing health on a last visit was a thoughtful touch, adding depth and understanding to Luke's personal turmoil. Anyone who has seen her brilliant effort as the defiant elderly landowner (Van Fleet was actually 46 at the time) in Elia Kazan's Wild River would expect no less. George Kennedy turns in his usual stellar performance as the big tough, but not too bright prison ringleader. His best-supporting Oscar was well deserved. The only disappointment I have as I watch and re-watch this great movie, is the fact that the utterly fantastic performance by Paul Newman as the born loser who throughout the film was called upon to exhibit the extreme highs and low of human emotion, and did so with amazing realism, went home without the Oscar. He truly deserved an Oscar for this role."

His excellent performance as the non-conformist 'Cool Hand' Luke lends much to a film which has been eclipsed repeatedly as best prison movie. What the film lacks in the depth of it's characters it makes up for in audience feeling towards Luke and his desire to find his place in society yet not change his ways. You can't help but love his stubborn arrogance as he goes up against the system and many of the films ideas can be found in better and deeper movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption'. It's sad to think that it is better remembered for the egg-eating scene than for it's symbolism and regard to those who choose to live as social drifters."

I am sure that many modern and future film makers will draw from the charismatic wit, humour, charisma and defiance of Paul Newman's characterization of Cool Hand Luke.\n\nThis is MUST WATCH Cinema, don't even second guess it. This is one of the classics that every film lover has to see as part of their education.\n\nDo it! You'll be glad you did."

        "review_detailed_main": "A listless former soldier gets himself arrested on a triviality, then shipped off to serve two years of hard labor on a sweaty deep south chain gang. There, he establishes a strong reputation with the inmates and tests his limits with the guards before tiring of the tough conditions and attempting escape. Evidently, prison wasn't the panacea Luke sought and his particular brand of stir crazy still thrives behind bars. Shame, then, that this isn't a hotel and he can't check out on a whim. Upon re-capture, his relationship, with both guards and prisoners, changes overnight and he grows increasingly unraveled.\n\nPaul Newman is superb as the confused, complex character at the center of all this noise. At the best of times, we're drawn in by the raw strength of his personality, his anti-authority vigor and his chummy, jovial wit. At worst, we see why he's never been able to maintain a serious long-term relationship with anyone, including his immediate family. He has a nasty tendency to self-sabotage when trapped or complacent, and to suddenly turn on those he once held dear when things aren't going his way. His closest pal in the clink, the long-tenured camp leader Dragline (portrayed by a fresh-faced George Kennedy), experiences both sides of this duality. Luke will go through hell for you in the morning, then spit on your corpse in the evening. Their friendship confounds Dragline, start to finish, and leaves him a changed man at the end of the picture. Much like the viewer."

        "review_detailed_main": "Existentialism has been part of literature and movies ever since it was popularized by the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre and other French Philosophers.I've seen many movies which can be interpreted as having existentialist or postmodernist (Nihilistic) tendencies. I myself can't stand movies having nihilistic themes such as 'Pulp Fiction',although these movies have been quite a success at the big screen and no body feels reluctant to call them 'Blockbuster'. Existentialism on the other hand is not as hopeless a philosophy (If you consider it a philosophy) as Nihilism.Existentialism in a nutshell is philosophy 'individualized'.Its emphasis on human freedom and liberty is such that it has attracted many creative writers and film makers.The influence of existentialism spreads beyond the realm of philosophy. 'Cool Hand Luke',staring one of my favorite actors Paul Newman stands up as a movie which can surely belong to existential genre.The movie surrounds around one man's defiance against authority .The protagonist from start of the movie till its end ,struggles to get himself free.The problem with the most of the people is that they give up pretty quickly but the problem with our hero is that he never gives up.He can be described as a person who consciously makes all those efforts to get himself free,but is unconsciously aware about his futile efforts.Any person who have special affinity towards 'Existentialism' must see this masterpiece.Had Sartre reviewed this movie he would only have used one sentence to end it all,the sentence would surely have been ,'Man is condemned to be free'.But I will end my review with the tag line of the movie,'What we've got here is a failure to communicate'."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is in my opinion one of the greatest ever made. To sum it up in short, recall the clich\u00e9 that \"the brightest flames burn the quickest\".\n\nLucas Jackson is just that, he is nothing but a ball of passion, living life as his heart tells him to do. He has lived, he has done horrible things, he has loved, and all with nothing more than an innocent smile on his face. He did only what he felt was right.\n\nBut, burning with such passion has it's own negatives... even though he inspires everyone around him, for every ounce of passion he inspires, it seems that twice as much passion is ripped from him. As he creates life, his own life is drained...\n\nIt is a story about selflessness. It is about a man who gives all of himself despite the toll taken upon himself. It is a story about a man doing whatever he has to do, no matter what the risks."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's probably like 100 reviews that start out with the famous quote from the movie or raving about Paul Newman. I'd like to talk about some different things with this review.\n\nPlot is simple. Paul Newman gets arrested and sent to a southern prison and refuses to conform to the prison life. It's a very bare bones film altogether. Few characters, small soundtrack (1 theme and a couple of blues songs sung by the inmates are all I remember), and a simple plot sometimes make for a boring movie. But this movie is lighthearted and enjoyable. Paul Newman and George Kennedy put on good performances along with the other cast. And that's about it. This film is more a vehicle for Paul Newman to push it than a really great movie,\n\nOverall this is a good film but nothing special. Besides acting and partly the script, its kinda an average film. But this film does have is heart and maybe that's enough to make me like.\n\n7/10"

Maybe the carwashing scene is a bit corny, but it sure is funny in a manly way. \"I've never planned anything in my life\" What a line! And the song Plastic Jesus, I have started singing it to my daughter when she is about to sleep. When I saw Cool Hand for the first time, I saw some of myself in the character.

While I'm upset at the Academy Awards snubbing Newman's performance, 1967 would've been a hard year to choose a winner (Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night, Spencer Tracey in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate, and the icing on the cake, Warren Beatty in Bonnie and Clyde). All the performances were Oscars caliber, and I guess they couldn't have a five way tie....but Rod Steiger? Oh, well, that was many many years ago. Newman's performance finally got some attention this summer as his character of Lucas Jackson appeared on the list of the top 50 heroes of the movies of the last 100 years. It made me very happy seeing as AFI failed to list the film in the top 100 movies. But your favorite film can't win everything I guess. If you're a Paul Newman fan definitely check this one out, you won't be disappointed. If you don't check it out you're a \"Failure to Communicate.\""

Something they need to bring to prisons now, a work detail where the prisoners really work. Newman's character Luke brought relief from the noon day sun to the work detail. He brought change to the daily grind, in attitude and belief. He actually gave his fellow prisoners hope. Luke's prison buddy, Dragline, played by George Kennedy, rides Luke's coattails like a fumbling, bumbling idiot. I believe he actually won a Academy Award for this part, when the true star of the movie was Paul Newman. Many scenes and characters from the movie are still vivid. The \"man with no eyes\", who plays a shotgun toting guard, the chase scene where the blood hounds run themselves to death trying to catch Luke. And Strother Martin is memorable as the warden, especially when he utters the famous line to Luke, \"Now, what we have here is a failure to communicate.\" Newman's character, Luke DOES communicate, but it seems no one is really listening. This is one of the great movies from the 1960\"s."

The storyline follows a man who is arrested for stealing and sent to the chain line in the south. They have a system for making prisoners work and reside together with very strict rules and punishments. Luke treats prison much like real life, he follows the rules when he can but sometimes he just can't.... This movie is directed by Stuart Rosenberg (The Amityville Horror) and stars Paul Newman (Bitch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), George Kennedy (Naked Gun), Clifton James (Live and Let Die), Jo Van Fleet (East of Eden) and Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider). The storyline for this movie is so unique, interesting and entertaining. The circumstance are well developed and presented as is every single character. The acting is out of this world and it's easy to forget the men are criminals and root for them versus the justice system. Newman is brilliant as the main character from beginning to end as the reluctant hero. I also loved the \"man with no eyes\" character. There's some legendary scenes in this like Lucille, the egg eating segment and the picture of Luke on the outside. The line \"What we have here is a failure to communicate\" is also legendary. There's so much to like about this movie that's cinematic gold. This is easily a 10/10 and America cinema classic."
