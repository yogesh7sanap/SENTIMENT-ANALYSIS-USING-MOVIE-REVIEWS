        "review_detailed_main": "This is definitely worth watching. The direction is restrained, SRK has acted really well after a long time, and there is a naive yet charming idealism underpinning the movie. It could have been a tad shorter, crisper editing would have helped. BO-wise it is a risky movie - unapologetic in its depiction of poverty and almost childlike in its appeal to NRIs and India's middle class to acknowledge poverty and try to do something about it. Gowarikar's heart is in the right place - the shots with the family unable to pay land rents, and the waterboy were graceful and poignant. My hunch is that regardless of BO fate, this is an important movie and will be referred to for year to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently saw 'Swades' for the first time in it's entirety and was just blown away by it's mature and intelligent treatment on the subject of brain drain. Director Ashutosh G has succeeded in making me feeling completely rejuvenated. There are so many magical moments in the movie,to pin them down would be fruitless. It goes to show what conviction, effort and the power of imagination can accomplish when they all come together in such wonderful fashion. The movie has all my favorite elements- simple clean humor, realism, a blend of old and new values,some truly good old fashioned romance and idealism. I was swept away by the lyrical quality to the film. There were many scenes that stood out. The scene where Mohan and Gita meet for the first time was refreshing and witty.The scene where Mohan entertains the village-folk with the powers of his imagination when the movie projector breaks down....the train scene where Mohan witnesses the hardships faced by rural folk up close... It would be a travesty to think that anyone but SRK was born to play Mohan Bhargava. I've never been a SRK fan,given his penchant for safe roles and scripts.But this movie has changed all that for me. I have a new found respect for his talent. Maybe he will go back to playing inane lover boy roles in the future but for me, he will forever be NASA project manager turned rural crusader Mohan Bhargava. His honest,restrained and utterly convincing portrayal of a successful NRI works,and how! This movie reminded me of a lot of things I had forgotten or pushed into the back of my mind. Indian values.Ethics.The unadulterated and intoxicating joy of pure love.Respect for one's elders and nation. I rarely am moved by any recent Hindi movie. To my chagrin, I even got emotional at certain junctures of the film. I'm sure many of you felt the same way,especially those of us living outside the country. I understand that it's quite possible that's its impact is much more since I'm living abroad, but there's no taking away from the fact that this piece of cinema will be remembered and hailed as a classic work....even a few decades down the line. I salute the makers, crew and other technicians who created this movie. We need more cinema like this. It is relevant, entertaining and has a poignant message. Never, ever forget your roots. This movie made me feel proud to be an Indian and what we, as a people,stand for."

I loved the characters of pretty much everyone in the movie but felt that all the good work was little bit undone by the length. Yes, Lagaan was long too but then it had a cricket match running and that was enough to maintain the intensity. However, it has to be said that AR Rehman's background score especially during the scenes when Shahrukh Khan travels by train and boat is nothing short of brilliant.\n\nThe movie also fell a little short in that it failed to address all the ideas about India that it raised. However, I am giving it high ratings because the script is good and fresh and the director has done his job passionately.\n\nIts good to see Gowariker doing movies close to his heart and not falling for the \"mass-hit\" formula which many other promising directors have done.\n\nPrashanth"

        "review_detailed_main": "30 minutes after I had viewed the film on Sat, I was not sure about how I felt about this film. 48 hours hence, I vividly remember most of the scenes and can lucidly state that is truly 'haunting'.\n\nSwades is not colorful; Shahrukh doesn't appear in a GAP or POLO SPORT; there are no introductory shots; there are no romantic scenes and no fields with yellow Tulip flowers; It may be a tad slow and lengthy; But Swades hits you where your heart hurts the most; patriotic and root feelings of an individual with good intentions overcoming societal obstacle. It's brilliant, heartfelt and touching. The 'We, People' film really makes us feel like it's our film. We see in the film what we see everyday, the places as they are. It's very much contemporary and it's our story.\n\nCompared to Veer-Zaara, it's light years ahead. Comparisons with Lagaan are bound to be there, but in some ways it's even better than Lagaan. Primarily, for the authenticity and real-life feel unlike Lagaan which was a finely crafted fairly-tale. Lagaan is all about emerging victorious and fighting against the odds. You enjoy it when you see it. Swades is about the conscience trauma of an Indian, urging him to comeback and do something for his country. It haunts you for long enough after the cinema has ended.\n\nThere's a prejudice that the film is about bringing electricity to a small village. It's not. And the most poignant scene in the film, where we see a boy selling water for 25 paisa, hits you hard. Seeing the harsh reality and we'll find it difficult to suppress our tears. It's an answer to the generation of materialistic 'we', who never shy from proclaiming our great culture and tradition, but do nothing for our country.\n\nThe asset of the film is Shahrukh Khan, looking ordinary and real but in an extra-ordinary performance. His most real since 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa' and his career's best. ARR music is soulful and original. The theme song 'Yeh Jo Des Hai Mera' haunts both in terms of its visuals and wordings.\n\nBut above all, it's the good intention and the attention to detail, of director Ashutosh Gowarikar that makes wonders for this truly experimental and moving cinema.\n\nI can and will definitely view this movie once more, to celebrate it feel and spirit. I can't predict its box office outcome, as the masses love fantasies and escapist cinema. But it's definitely a treat for those who want to see moving and believable films on a large scale. Also if we don't embrace different cinema like this or even 'the torturous but different Musafir' for that matter, we'll continue to get more 'Sarson ka Saag', 'Karva Chauths', 'Maahi Ve' filled designer romance fables from the Chopra-Johar clan!\n\nRegardless of the box office outcome, take a bow Ashutosh, Shahrukh and ARR!"

Its been ever so often that as Indians we have lamblasted the mushy, one track nonsensical movies that were being churned out by bollywood and yearned for something slightly honest and celebral. And now it seems that the moment has arrived. Swades has finally reached the next level of Indian movie-making with the help of ashutosh, srk and rahman where the execution, the concept and the treatment of the film is at least (i can safely assume) close to world standards. There is no point comparing lagaan (the directors 1st movie) to this movie as his earlier venture was purely fiction with no semblance of realism in it. However this movie has so many ingredients of being a pathbreaker for Indian cinema that its almost scary. The feelings and expectations of an nri set aside, it tells the story of middle and upper class India losing touch with the harsh realities of the sufferings of the less fortunate ones all around us (and the fact that we can do very little to change the ongoing scenario is even more glaring and painful). Besides this the movie also deals with the desires and priorities of humans inspite of the trials and tribulations of daily living.\n\nThe maturity of the script, the actors and the score makes it a journey of epic proportions without it looking epic at all. The normalcy of the movie is something which might (and hopefully will) change the way cinema is seen and made in India in the future. One can only hope."

        "review_detailed_main": "Why is it that Indian filmmakers seem to believe that every movie, regardless of subject matter, needs to be over three hours long? Is it simply a matter of \"more is better,\" or is there something ethnical or cultural going on here? For indeed, this phenomenon is not restricted to certain specialized genres as it is in American film-making (the sweeping epic, the historical drama, the Broadway-based musical etc.) but seems to extend to films of all types made in that country.\n\nTake \"Swades,\" a rather simple comedy/drama about a successful NASA satellite designer named Mohan who returns to his native country in search of his roots and past. He travels to a village where Kaveriamma, the woman who took care of him as a child, now resides. His intention is to take her back to the States with him, so that she can live out the remainder of her life in the lap of luxury and affluence. However, while he's there, he falls in love with a beautiful but feisty and independent young schoolteacher named Gita who wants Kaveriamma to remain where she is. A struggle develops between these two attractive young people who are obviously madly in love with one another but too prideful and pigheaded to realize or acknowledge it.\n\nWhat might have been a meaningful and profound little personal drama at, say, a reasonable 115 minutes, becomes something of an endurance contest at a turgid 186. The story simply isn't compelling enough to sustain our interest for this enormous a length of time. The film does have some pertinent things to say about the caste system, the role of women in society, the need for universal education, and the conflict between traditionalism and modernity in 21st Century India (\"swades\" actually means \"we, the people\") - and I'm sure that people in the home country may find these issues more compelling than some of us watching the film in an entirely different part of the world. Unfortunately, writer/director Ashutosh Gowariker seems too addicted to romantic clich\u00e9s for any of these themes to filter through and register much of an impact. He also employs the kind of corny reaction shots one rarely sees in American films anymore, as well as too-cutesy-by-half musical riffs to highlight the humorous moments so that the presumably unperceptive audience will know when to respond appropriately - like a laugh track in a sitcom or the traditional drum roll of the stand-up comic. One of the reasons why the movie is so long is that the narrative is frequently interrupted by those seemingly obligatory musical numbers without which no true blue Indian film can exist. Some of the these sequences are high-spirited and enjoyable, but I have no idea why every single filmmaker in that country feels compelled to use them in every single film.\n\nAs the young lovers, Shahrukh Khan and Gayatri Joshi make a handsome, attractive couple, and Kishori Balal provides stability and warmth as the old woman who becomes the bone of contention between the two. And there would be no point in denying that \"Swades\" has moments of point and purpose as Mohan comes to realize the beauty and quality of the land and the people he has left behind. Now, if only a sensible editor could have trimmed the movie down to a more serviceable length, \"Swades\" might have been a film worth watching."

And definitely SRK's best performance till date. If I look back and see. The movie had a great story. Screenplay that was brilliant. Ashutosh's direction was perfect. And SRK definitely stood tall in a restrained yet poignant portrayal of Mohan Bhargava. His best performance till date, yet underrated. Kishori Ballal remains etched in your memory as Kaveri amma. Gayatri Joshi is perfectly cast. Sadly she didn't appear in any movie after Swades, atleast nothing notable. An untapped potential. All other actors leave a mark.\n\nWhy did it underperform at BO? It came out in 2004. 3 years after the magnum opus Lagaan. There were bound to be comparisons. Both stories had the underlying love for motherland as theme. But were completely in stark contrast in their content. Lagaan, set in British era, was more of a fight about the protagonist and his village's honor. It had a bad guy, his evil intentions and then protagonist and his ideals. A classic underdog story. David vs Goliath. And we love those stories for sure :) Swades on the other hand was more about an individual discovering his roots. His inner journey and conflicts. His choice of leaving a comfortable and cozy life to be with his people. It's a simple story minus the melodrama. But so effectively told that it just wins you over. I think it was the expectations that audience had from Swades that made it underperform. Please do not miss this gem of a movie"

Since that day my love for this movie is out of bounds, and still going strong.\n\nBelieve i am not a fan of Mr.Shahrukh Khan, but after this movie i really fell in love the way he enacted the play.

I wanted to pursue my masters in US but i am now a changed mind with pursuing the degree in here in my home land , India.\n\nThanks Mr. Ashutosh for creating this epic master piece. I would be grateful for the rest of my life for this movie you have crafted.\n\nThe characters simply have life and they are close to hearts, be it Mohan \"NRI\" Bhargava or \"Gitli\" Geeta or the Post Man \"Nivaranji\" who admires the Email as something out of the world invention, the American dream pursuing \"MelaRam\". Every one is astounding in performance, that makes this movie a special one that you would never want to forget for the rest of your life.\n\nFor all my NRI cousins and friends, do watch this movie and come back buddies, there is more to pursue in here. regards"

Swades manages to include the new aspects of India culture, becoming educated and proving abilities (NASA, no less), but superimposing how parts of India don't even have electricity yet.\n\nIt makes me appreciate my lifestyle here in America, yet the culture and traditions that India possesses is something to be a bit wishful for. As the actor playing Mohan said in the movie, America does have its own culture--somehow it doesn't run as deep as what I viewed in the movie.\n\nEnlightening, edifying, and definitely educational.

Obviously if you are expecting SRK to jump around with designer clothes, and colourful songs and dances, this movie is not for you!

Melody based tunes along the lines of Bombay or Dil Se.\n\nCinematography: Could have been much better.\n\nThe movie is all about its theme.

Not everyone will appreciate the movie as much!\n\nThe scenes of the small kid selling water in station, or SRK's rent collection from another village are very thought provoking.\n\nThe movie, however, I felt, appeals to NRI crowd more."

A constant diet of guns, explosions and emotional violence certainly doesn't model well as a reflection of the nation, does it? It is refreshing to find a beautifully acted story of a man who feels the magnetic pull of the homeland and struggles with giving up all his hard-earned wealth and glory to commit himself to others--what a novel idea! Name a major recent film that suggests such a thing! Very real third-world problems are graphically delineated, but as in other Bollywood films, there is always time for song and dance, and it's fun to take a break.\n\nI do not claim greatness for this film, but I was highly entertained every minute and admired the craft it took to marry the music, images and story. We used to make films about heroes and creators and except for the recent Lincoln, they remain far and few. Swades reminds me a good deal of Frank Capra films from the 1930's, but with more color, and certainly a good deal more dance."

The inconsistent pacing (try watching a 3.5 hr movie without a break in a cold theater after a large Coke). The first half rambled on endlessly without songs. Then, just as the second half seemed to acquire momentum, a song would come along to slow things down. 2. The dialogue, which plumbed new depths of imbecility and obviousness in some scenes (whereas others were extremely well-written). 3. The fact that the film raises so many more questions than it resolves. Which is not necessarily a bad thing by itself but the issues were raised haphazardly and without structure.\n\nBut, the movie has been made with obvious passion and sincerity by people who feel strongly about the problems facing India. The cast (including, surprise! Shahrukh) deliver good performances and the music is eminently hummable. I'd rather watch a failure like this (and it is a failure, even though I gave it a 7) than 90% of the bilge that Bollywood produces."

There are no corrupt politicians but rather heads of the village, with real issues and real ego; but still clearly human; the real people. There are no events for shock values but still the storyline is gripping. Perhaps it is not for teens and young people in twenties, who would rather be in a dream world idolizing a person with super powers. The movie is as realistic as any of my Desi colleagues I meet everyday at work here away from my Swades. Such a simple story but so well presented. After having to watch stupid Hindi TV soaps every evening where women are either screaming or slapping each other and less said about the male roles the better, it was a real nice change to spend yesterday evening watching this beautiful movie with the whole family. I really like movies that leave me in a happy state of mind. This was definitely the one; a rare one; a jewel."

I have not seen any movie by Shahrukh Khan after 96-97 (apart from Main Hoon Naa, which is another Decent Movie), but I must say only he could have played the role of Mohan in this movie. Just like the next-door guy, he wins everyone's hearts. Gayatri Joshi is simply breathtaking and enthralling and someone who looked simple yet beautiful in the movie (Waheeda Rahman is another one). Director Ashutosh, who started out with SRK in late 80s in the TV show Circus and also starred with him in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, has once again proved that one does not need skin show and gore in a movie to excel. Some of the actors, he has repeated from Lagaan, namely the Postmaster, who is outstanding in his cameo. The guy from Gangaajal was great too.\n\nIn the end, this movie will mean very much more to Indians settled outside of India, which may be one of the reasons, it didn't do that well like other commercial movies in India, besides winning laurels. A must see for everyone who liked decent movies. Music was simply beautiful. Too bad the BEST song \"Aahista Aahista\" was not even featured in the MOVIE. I think this is the only point missed by the director.\n\nThere is not much room for Romance between SRK and Gayatri, however, all little moments are simply beautiful and do wonders. GO SEE IT if you haven't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Sure it is not glamorized but it delivers, excellent story telling skills.\n\nIt is bound to touch your heart, and definitely relate able for the NRI's who think about going to India.\n\nThe icing on the cake is not only the wonderful performances by the support cast, but the natural and non preachy characterizations of the entire cast.\n\nShah rukh is likable, even with his usual and lovable antics, he is more serious, and clearly dominates the proceedings.\n\nRahman's music is a big plus, with Yunhi Chala and Yeh Jo Des hai being the pick. Rahman has a panache for delivering great music for topical movies.\n\nA movie with substance."

I must have seen it three times already since 08/05 and I have always appreciated a lot. First, I liked the songs, then the story and the last time, I really enjoyed everything! This is the story of Mohan, a NRI, top scientist who works for NASA and who is feeling homesick. He is longing for his native India, so... he goes back on a trip. And he takes us along. That gives us an opportunity to visit India( or part of it);to appreciate the beautiful sceneries and to meet very charming and friendly villagers: The People! Mohan is played by the handsome Shah Rukh Khan, funny, witty and adorable as always.The rest of the cast is awesome. The songs are very catchy and well acted as often in Bollywood. Although they are in Hindi, they stay in you very easily. I am sure that this movie will appeal to all the NRIs who have left India, but also to all the viewers who enjoy Bollywood cinema. Finally, anyone who wants to see great entertainment will be happy with this movie and might end up buying the soundtrack CD (like me!). It's worth it! yeh jo des hai tera, swades hai tera...Come on, sing along!"

Most of the Indian movies are a bubble full of happiness and dreams that everyone wishes in their heart, but Swades is nothing compared to these. I am a big fan of Indian movies and Shah Rukh Khan. Before watching this movie, I heard comments from different Indian people about it. Some liked it a lot, but some said that go watch Veer-Zaraa; that's a better movie. I saw both of them. Veer-Zaraa (which I liked a lot) was a typical Bollywood movie, but SWADES was a reality. I believe it was India's voice to its own people. If I as a non-Indian have seen this movie, then all Indians should watch this movie and appreciate the message in this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "With a name like swades, which seems a little contrived and dated, I didn't think I would like the movie. I may be wrong but maybe it was the name which scared audience away because they thought that they would be getting a boring and a very obvious lecture on nationalism. Also there is a general misconception that this movie is preachy. Now, I agree that maybe couple of scenes like 'bhai sahib kitabon ki izzat karna seekhiye' could have been avoided but I don't think that this movie tries to preach anything. Lecture on nationalism, I think not, so much so that in one scene the protagonist Mohan Bhargava tells the villagers in plain words that he doesn't believe that India is the greatest nation in the world, it has the potential of being the greatest nation but it is not. Lastly, people think that this movie tries to propagate that NRIs should leave their jobs and return to India. Although this movie is inspired by the story of Aravinda Pillalamarri and Ravi Kuchimanchi who returned to India to work on micro-hydel project in Bilgaon but I don't think this movie tries to do that.\n\nWhat this movie really does is that it shows a mirror to our generation of NRIs and IT consultants who are so caught up in this money making race that they have forgotten how to be a human and feel other's pain. Don't we belong to a generation who just doesn't care about anything else apart from how many cents I will save on Gas if I get this particular credit card? It takes a catastrophe like an earthquake or a tsunami to make us reach for our wallets and that too because it is in our face shown live on our cable TV these days. And then is it not the easiest thing to do; 'sending money'? If to tell you the truth is preachy then this movie is preachy and you can find one million reasons to avoid watching it. After all, who wants to face the truth?\n\nThe much talked about train sequence is the climax of the movie and probably one of the best scenes that I have seen. Think about it, there is nothing out of the ordinary that is being shown on the screen. You see small kids selling water or shoe shine everyday on railway platforms or streets without giving any thought. And that is the point. The scene hits you really hard and for that moment you are face to face with the truth in all its ugliness. I still get goose bumps just by thinking about it and that's how powerful that scene is.\n\nPerformance wise Shahrukh has excelled and is absolutely the opposite of what you see him in other movies, new girl Gayatri Joshi is good and has done her job well except for, well, the parting scene with Shahrukh in which she spoils everything that she has earned during the whole movie. Rest of the cast is competent and supports the movie well. Songs are unnecessary and could have been completely avoided which also would have shortened the movie to a desirable length.\n\nDirection wise, Ashutosh has what it takes to be a good director but what this movie suffers from is the inconsistency in the style. If you are making a movie with a realistic style, I won't expect a NASA Engineer to interrupt a village Ram Leela with a song of his own. And I agree that this sequence is preachy.\n\nIt is sad that this movie wasn't commercially successful and Shahrukh was ignored for the National award but who else can be blamed for this but Shahrukh himself. Diligently and consistently he has destroyed his own image as a serious actor and now no matter how well he performs, nobody takes him seriously. I guess it will take him more movies like this and 'Paheli' to help him build a new image and shed the old one that is doing him more harm than good.\n\nArguably a very good movie but without a doubt one of the most important movies of our times."

And it does nothing but reaffirm this superficial 'concern' for a fictional rural poor (not that there isn't such a category in reality, but this particular type in the movie is a work of fiction). Mohan's self realization is at the center here, not the 'simple' village folk who move in and out of his life as and when needed. There is not a shred of realism and people's accents, their costumes and their general disposition makes it seem that this particular village is a blend of UP, Bihar, Kerala all at once. And the methods for 'swades' brand of rural upliftment are highly innovative too-- dance sequences and technological utopianism.\n\nAR Rehman's music is, though, a high point of the movie, as are a couple of performances, mostly by the Lagaan cast. SRK does what he's best at-- shedding tears; and here he finds a willing companion--his old nanny. Some of the camera shots are 'inspired' by 'The Motorcycle Diaries', and incidentally, they're the best of the lot. In the end, the tagline 'We, the people' is a misnomer. Instead the movie turns out to be 'SRK, the saviour'."

It is, but in that simplicity comes a whole lot of baggage. Swades tackles tons of issues in those 3 and a half hours. More importantly, Swades does not bore and keeps the viewers interested in the going-ons (Most of the time). It seems like the viewer is with the protagonist during his journey.\n\nMohan is a successful scientist working for NASA in America. He has completed the first phase of a big project he has been working on for NASA. However, there has been something bothering him the past few months. He feels he has abandoned his nanny back in India and wants to bring her back. From then starts Mohan's journey, or awakening one can call it...\n\nOne viewing of Swades is not enough, in my opinion. The film is too poetic and full of symbolism. There are so many things to note in the movie. SRK's water bottle with him all the time. Him finally drinking water. The whole scene with the movie being screened. A lot of symbolism in the movie which some hard-hitting statements being made. the film tackles issues such as poverty, electricity, government regulations, traditions and various things affecting India. The scene when the villagers compare U.S. and India is surely to raise eye-brows.\n\nThe film is a tad bit too long, and that is one of the few flaws in it. Honestly, I don't have any other problem with that.\n\nMusic plays a great part in the movie. The songs come at the right time and are brilliant. Lyrics are amazing by Javed Akhter. Technical aspects are first rate! The dialouges are fresh and move you. The story, screenplay is excellent.\n\nAshutoush Gowariker directs the movie with utter brilliance. It takes guts to make a movie like that and he deserves full marks for direction.\n\nThe characters in the movie all act terrifically. Gayatri makes a good debut.\n\nSwades is carried on the shoulders of Shah Rukh Khan and he gives a performance that leaves you spellbound, speechless, just amazed! It's an act that only superb actors like SRK can pull off. Note the scene when the child is selling water by the train - Wow! His character change, his realization - a convincing act all the way.\n\nOverall, one has to give it up to 4 people. A.R Rahman, Ronnie Screwala, Shah Rukh Khan and of course, Ashutoush Gowariker. Thank You for making this master piece."

The movie will teach you about being kind to others, Solving your own problems without depending on your Government. speaking about the music and background score of the movie A.R.Rehman has done exceptionally well which helps you to form a bond with the characters as every character has got its own theme. finally this film will take you to a point where you will be forced to think that we always keep on crying about our country being corrupt and our leaders will do nothing about it But what are you doing for your own country.

        "review_detailed_main": "Swades I saw this movie with really high expectations from Gowariker thanks partly, to the number of Filmfare nominations and I was not let down!! What's New? Science has been blended into a Bollywood movie in the most magnificent way I've ever seen! As an Engineer myself, it was refreshing to see a Bollywood movie explain Science to the masses in a brilliant way! Way to GOwarikar! There was a new face, Gayathri Joshi. Frankly, I was not too pleased with her looks or performance. When I think Gowarikar and I think village belle, the face that flashes in front of my eyes is of course that of Gauri in Lagaan! Albeit, this girl is modern and educated, there are many faces I could fathom, that could have added a greater Jamba boost to this role.\n\nNoticeable: Shahrukh has done a great job, which seems amplified after the clich\u00e9'd role and his signature performance in Veer Zaara, which left me wondering whether this guy had a future in my TV screen, but he does! SRK or this film will probably not have the impact that Aamir and Lagaan did, but this movie was a good follow-up by the director. The king Khan has done total justice to his role. AR Rahman has once again delivered when it comes to a Gowarikar movie. Except for the \"Baaba Kich Kich taa\" repeat in a song and the background music, the other songs were really well executed. \"Yeh Taara Woh Taara\" was particularly good and reminds us a little bit of \"Mitwaa\" from Lagaan. The dussera song was also good and reminds you of \"Raadha kyon na Jale\". Thank god, there was nothing in parallel to \"O paalan hare\".. looks like the director has taken feedback from Lagaan! I am not getting conclusive about a pattern in here, but Gowarikar in his first two movies has exploited the thrill value very well. The thrill that the audience gets out of the electric meter is great, but no where near when Kachara gets his wickets or Bhuvan hits the winning shot! That's the problem any director has to face by delivering a marvel in his first attempt! But this one has met expectations really well! Verdict: This movie is superb! Definitely worth seeing once! Having lived in a village for 4 days, I can tell that the sequences are so natural! The characters like the \"Bijili paati\", Kaaveri Amma, the weaver turned farmer, Dadaji, the cook who has done some good comedy, etc. are likely to stay in your mind several days after you have watched the movie. This is the beauty of Gowarikar's movies that attach so much significance to the so-called \"lesser important\" characters! How can you forget Kachara, Ismail or Guran from Lagaan? The movie is a little drawn out and a little bit on the preaching side, but you've gotta watch it for ARR, SRK and Ashutosh if not anyone else!"

Overall, I liked it better than Lagaan. This is more touching and the sentiments have been shown very well. ITS VERY GOOD!! Of course, SRK was awesome once again!! Kudos to Ashutosh!! Everyone in the film did well, including the cook and the postman. Gayatri Joshi is a fine discovery, although she seemed a little stiff sometimes. The best scene of the movie was when the little kid was trying to sell water for 25 paise, the emotion that Shah Rukh Khan portrayed at that point was excellent, that was fine piece of acting by a great actor. I hope it is appreciated by the general public."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ashutosh certainly knows one fact that Ghar ka khana sabko accha lagta hain(Desi food is always preferred/liked by most over anything else) He/Aamir exploited that fact extensively in Lagaan but Ashutosh missed the bus this time without Aamir.\n\nWhere Lagaan was shrewdly crafted movie meant to touch/kick the pulse..Swadesh too has its few such moments but whats lacking here is \"touching of soul\" & \"connection\" throughout the film.It touches you in bits/pieces only & not entirely.\n\nThe premise is excellent (even better than Lagaan) but Ashutosh fails to capture the \"essence\" & loop it across the film.\n\nThe first thing which strikes consistently throughout is build up of all characters...Lagaan had achieved cent percent success in doing that.There was specific graph to each character properly sketched/defined.But in Swades apart from main characters all others have been not build-up properly especially Bavarchi...which could have been more detailed in terms of his passion to open Dhabba & his sudden decision to not to do so.\n\nWhen Mohan returns to Delhi & intend to go to Charanpur village he can afford to taken a big van but later can't hire a Satellite phone for internet connection especially since hes working on imp Nasa project.(Satellite phone can work from any corner of globe) Gayatri's character sketch is excellent ...but her sudden outburst against Mohan for possession of Kaaveriaama is not defined...more so how on earth she comes to know in Delhi bookstore that Mohan is asking for village address to take Kaveriamma away! When Kaveriamma decides to send Mohan to another village to collect rent..Mohan feels/cries a lot for that guy...fine...but why didn't he feel same when he met a person in similar state (more or less) in charanpur itself?? this person is the one who argues that he is lower caste person hardly making money to feed one time meal for his family & hence doesn't wish to send his children to school....so why doesn't Mohan feel for this guy....coz his focus is on child gathering for School or coz he didn't enter this persons house & had a lunch with them ?? Despite all these minute errors the film creates a positive aura & a message which definitely will touch all.\n\nAll characters more or less have put in great efforts.\n\nKudos to Ashtosh for being the Manoj Kumar of this era.We sure hope there will be more gripping & soul feeding films from him soon.\n\nP.S: Lagaan also had one factual error though....In that period there were no sixes...only fours in cricket books...So actually the match was lost !!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie is for the NRIs who feel guilty about living and working abroad. There are so many gaps in the story e.g. there is no mention of Mohan's parents and how a nanny became the only reason for his visiting India. It looks like hero and heroine both are without parents but the heroin at least own some property that is rented out to weaver. Both seem to have no one else but their common nanny. IN real life most NRIs are not very successful and are also taxi drivers, cooks but the movie is stereotyping as if all are rich and successful. Another drawback is the exploitation of religion for box office success. There was no need or justification of appealing superstitious story of Ram and Sita when the it is supposed to be against other social superstitions and tradition etc."

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved the film and its a welcome change from the unrealistic and annoyingly happy Hindi films that most people in India make these days. Thank GOD for people like Mr. Gowarikar who aren't afraid to \"think outside of the box.\" As a female movie-goer, I have been looking forward to watching this film since I first saw those trailers on SONY. You first see Mr. Khan on a train, then a bus, then a boat, then on the back of a scooter trying to get somewhere. I was so entralled that I just wanted to see the movie to find out just where on Earth was he trying to get to? I just HAD to go SEE it.\n\nThis film shows you a very realistic and human approach to the conflicts going on inside of a person who is trapped and trying to find the difference between living one's life for oneself and the urge to make a difference in the lives of others, to be a beacon of guiding light. I loved it! I loved it more than Lagaan. Take that you no-nothing critics! I went to see the film with my sister who is visiting and it has been probably a good 4 years since the two of us have done anything together. Life is what happens when you're busy working! On our car ride back home we discussed the film as we usually do no matter who is with us. To get an idea of what someone else might have picked up on and others might have missed. Both of us loved the fact that he went back to NASA to finish up his work before going back to India. It shows Mohan's sincerity to both countries. If that part in the film had been cut-out, both of us would've been extremely angry with the director. That would've shown immense hypocrisy on the part of the film-maker because that would've meant that he doesn't care whether or not he leaves one country hanging just so that he can follow his new-found purpose & direction in life.\n\nYou can never end one section of your life like that because people come to depend on you and you should respect them for it. If there is a sudden need for me to go do something, I'd never leave my employer hanging, even if it was for the people that I love because nobody deserves that. One should tie up all loose ends before starting something fresh and new. It is the responsible thing to to and this film makes the character even more realistic and true to being an NRI by doing so. Because we NRIs not only have a responsibility to the country that gave us birth; we also have a responsibility to the country that gave us support, recognition and shelter. Be it the US, UK, etc."

        "review_title": "The eternal dilemma of an 'NRI' whether to continue with the good life in the US or come back to his land.",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's a bane of any director who makes a really good movie early on in his career that each of his subsequent creations are fated to be compared with the famous one, and Ashutosh Gowariker did have a tough act to follow. But let's talk of Swades without the shadow of Lagaan looming over it. And boy does it impress! The first plus point of Swades is that Shah Rukh Khan acts. He actually appears happy here that he has managed to bag one rare movie where the director has made some use of his acting skills. There are just two-three short instances where he returns to his typical habit of making funny faces, and that's pretty tolerable. Otherwise he does a really good job of the role. I hope he gets a Filmfare for this, not for Veer Zaara.\n\nGayatri Joshi is good too. Better than Gracy Singh. Sorry, we were not supposed to have comparisons. Her dialogue delivery is awkward at places, but otherwise a really nice job in a first movie. Of course having a strong role helped.\n\nThe rest of the actors put up a very competent show too. The lady who plays Shah Rukh's nanny (who I later came to know is named Kishori Balal) keeps away from the typical melodrama seen so often in our movies. In fact there's very little 'filmi' in the movie. Things are very realistic, not exactly real-life, but closer to it. Gowariker makes full use of NASA and we probably have the first rocket-launch in a Hindi movie here. The children are not the obnoxious kind that we typically see in present-day Hindi movies. The village is very authentic. Compare it with Karan Johar's glossy Chandni Chowk in K3G. The situations and people's reactions in those situations are authentic. The songs gel in very nicely with the story and you enjoy them thoroughly. The title-song which is the last song in the movie could be a tear-jerker for NRIs, quite like Chitthi aayi hai from Naam in the 80s. The story (and for a rare occasion in recent Hindi movies we do have one here) is good. The movie has a proper flow, and I don't know if there's a technical term for it. So technically and screenplay-wise Swades is very good. One more point to Ashutosh Gowariker.\n\nBut Swades is not perfect. Far from it actually. One obvious flaw is that the sermonizing gets to you after a point. The movie is close to three-and-a-half hours long and you feel it. And despite having its heart in the right place, the movie starts working against the message it is trying to convey if people get so bored that they start leaving the hall. In fact the songs are so good that at times you wish that a song would come by to relieve you of the rubbing in that the audience is being subjected to. And that is why I feel it's very difficult for this movie to be a big hit. But I would love to be proved wrong. It's the kind of movie that Gowariker couldn't have made with a big star in the lead or couldn't have sold to distributors if he didn't have Lagaan on his resume. There are some other issues like run-of-the-mill cinematography but I think they aren't really important here. What we have here is competent enough.\n\nOn the whole I would say that the plus points far outweigh the negatives. It's no classic (and I consider Lagaan a classic) but probably the best Hindi movie that we've had this year. I say probably only because I am not in the mood to recall the names of other movies released this year. So please go and see the movie, and if possible in a hall. Movies like these should do well. Movies like these should be tax-free. Movies like these should be made more often."

SRK as usual steals the spotlight, but it doesn't matter cuz hes way better then aamir khan and salman khan.

SRK has finally silenced his critics! two thumbs up!\n\nGayatri Joshi is gorgeous and holds her ground as an actor. the dhoti sequence is the most romantic one i have seen in years! (did someone smirk?)people!!!!!!!! there are gorgeous women who are city bred working with NGO's in villages who do dress up and put on lipstick. Rama! why doesthis role have to be played if only you look like Smita Patil or Deepti naval. yes! the characters are clich\u00e9's...so? we have them everywhere (take a look around). though Abdul Kalam hair cuts i have not seen around. (Ashutosh, how could you???) story predictable? i do not think so. it was well researched and fairly well executed.\n\nthe look? Hmmm, Bhanu Athiya does a good job. the clothes look authentically Indian (though they do not subscribe to a set region) but then remember that this is a pan-India mainstream film!!!!!?!on a recent visit to interior Karnataka and Tamilnadu most of the younger women/girls were in Salwar Kameezes...huh? did i think i was in Punjab? Puhleez! same comment for the village. it did not bother me at all. the Maharashtra's straight horned cows could have been avoided. story/screenplay/style: i liked the whole NRI(return of brain-drain)having call of the motherland bit. and then loved the way Ashutosh calls him Mohan. ah ha! there was a Mohan (the bald one!)a few decades ago who came back from across the seas and went on a journey into Indian hinterland met landless laborer and the poor and a changeover happened! do you guys remember that Mohan?\n\nscreenplay:hmmm...bit too long. the Dusshera Bhajan is wonderful music but sitting on hard cinema seats suddenly made me remember that my ass hurts,Ashutosh lost his audience big time here. he did loose a lot of them right in the beginning when too much English happened at NASA. style of film making: you know what, i liked the slow pace a lot. i liked the fact it was not overtly dramatic. does cinema have to be dramatic always? though i thought electricity sequence was dramatic, the 25 paisa water was. the journey was. the fact he gives up his us citizenship. grow up people! the formula is dead! camera work: Mahesh Aney approaches the frame wonderfully. liked the framing. (no usaffir!!!!!!!!!) straight and simple. the lighting lacked! too ainstream. was he playing safe? Hmmm...was it the directors call? was the producer playing safe? Hmmm...this needed to be addressed.\n\nHahn! then comes the music. Rahman, you are god! really! the songs are stunning!'Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera' will haunt people for a long time. but his triumph was in the background arrangement. it was wonderful. understated. beautiful. now i must tell you what i really liked. ha ha ha after a long time i liked the whole socialist approach. the kind of films which were made earlier. 'Naya Daur' do you remember that one? this kind of cinema died years ago. Mr. Gowariker you are a brave man, take a bow! i remembered the cinema from Russia/Cuba/Yugoslavia/etc. thank you for not giving me heaving bosoms,cleavage and g-strings, mustard fields and chiffon Saree's and item numbers. the 'Yeh Tara' song was awesome! beautiful. loved the choreography. completely natural. ah! i really wish the film is a hit(more like this will get made then). people, do go out and see it. will it win an Oscar? Hmmm..no. but then when was it the last word on film-making? p.s. there is an item number: SRK bathes twice. bare-chested. i am told the women in the audience...Hmmm...that is another story! :)"

True, Ashutosh has quiet a ways to go before he can be in the same league, but I think he's taking the right steps! I've read some reviews saying that the movie is too preachy --- I agree, except I don't really think it's a problem. Although there were times when the screenplay could use visuals instead of words, I thought there were other times when the symbolism was brilliant (it worked and was relevant to the plot). Most Hollywood movies (yes, the good ones) have messages and are preachy, so why not an Indian movie? Ashutosh is a smart and gutsy filmmaker and Shahrukh should be commended for signing on. Great acting by the new actress and the villagers and Shahrukh is endearing. I would definitely watch this movie again, and recommend it to people who need a little reminding about the ideals and principles the Indian Independence movement was based on."

        "review_title": "Swades: the heart is at the right place here !",
        "review_detailed_main": "He is the one who gave us the most astonishing and unique motion picture of the 21st century, made in Hindi mainstream cinema, till today. Lagaan came up as a fresh breath of oxygen and revived the silver screen with its sheer cinematic beauty. And now Ashutosh Gowariker is up again with Swades.\n\nAnd yes he beholds all promises. This intelligent and enlightening story is as unique and as fresh as Lagaan, evoking real ( n not Neo) patriotism. Its about NASA's project manager Mohan Bhargav, played by Shahrukh Khan, who's a NRI and his Bhaarat-Darshan.His journey into the heart of rural India, the unprivileged Bhaarat of shattered dreams and grieves,which makes him to walk on Bhuvan's footprints and to light the bulbs of new hopes. And the way he does that,.. makes every frame a gem here.\n\nAdd on to this the perfect casting ( you find your granny in the voice of Fatimaa bee), some of the most beautiful music (including the background score) of his career so far, by the genius A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Javed Akhtar who pens immortal lines as 'Man Se Raavan Jo Nikale, Raam Usi Ke Man Me Hai', 'Yun To Saare Sukh Hai Barse, Par Door Tu Hai Apne Ghar Se' and 'Ye Tara Wo Tara... ' in which stars are used again as a metaphor to denote individuals among the masses, the charming face of Gayatri Joshi and stellar display of his histrionics by Shahrukh Khan which signals that the superstar has actually become an actor. Technically too, the movie is very sound and a quality product. The only disappointment,though,is the picturization of the song Pal Pal Hai Bhaari,which has been childishly choreographed by Saroj Khan. Nevertheless, Swades is as important for Shahrukh as Lagaan was for Amir.It gives him the much needed diversity and an opportunity to break the myth that he can't do any better.His visual presence has got the intensity of a fusion reaction, here. Put aside all his earlier films and watch Swades.It has given him a new horizon.\n\nThe way in which it's different from Lagaan is that Lagaan was a feel-good film and gave us pour entertainment whereas Swades points out at what's going wrong. Off course, there is at it's best optimism to sweeten the pain but due to this difference,regular audience may find it preachy, though this movie will count among the best Hindi movies on rural background with the likes of Lagaan, Do Bigha Jameen, Mother India, Naya Daur, Teesari Kasam etc.\n\nIts a world heritage for its literary style in which it addresses the dilemma of the youth of the most of the third world countries and showcases the noblest idea of what best a man can do to his land. The story unfolds in a very subtle and simple manner yet we feel a current being flowing under the skin. Gowariker uses very basic methodology for his screenplay, yet there is no dearth of similes, hidden meanings and charismatic use of metaphors on the celluloid.\n\nFor example, observe that how poetically the commodity 'water' is used in the narration. Mohan carries his packaged water bottles with him and bathes in his caravan for the first half. Then we see vast waters again where he sits in a boat while his lady love is thinking about him dancing around the village lake. Then in one of the magical scenes of all time, on his return journey, his mind being bombarded with thoughts questioning his own existence and that of a land which he once called his country, he actually drinks regular water from a 'kulhad' watching perplexedly at the child selling it (did you say.. \"my eyes had water in them,too\"?)!\n\nNow, imagine how mahatma Gandhi was thrown of that train in Africa that made him realizes a thing or two about himself and his whole life.. Bingo! They are parallel! All thanks to the book 'Bapu Kuti' by Rajnee Bakhshi whose, in fact, real life instances have made for the actual inspiration behind this motion picture. Moving ahead with water though, then we see Mohan having an 'indianised' bath inside Geeta's house, later Mohan generates Hydroelectricity for the village folks, and in the process, he has to dive in that collector-pond, fight some dead plant root with both hands and emerge out wet! Then there is this shot where he soaks his feet in the lake, offers water to the dying daadaji and ultimately for the last shot, again uses water to get rid of the mud. You see a graph in it? This was him splashing back into his roots! Mohan got drenched in the Indian flavor layer by layer.\n\nThese parallels which can be found here are endless as they were in Lagaan,and this brilliance in the screenplay, calls for a comparison of Gowariker with filmmakers of the Golden-Era like Raj Kapoor, Satyajit Ray, Gurudutt, Vhi Shantaram and Mehboob. He simply doesn't belong to our times as he is someone who can think big, original, Indian and make films which can be as good as those of the old times and even Hollywood (yes.. amazingly, he doesn't fell short on any technical aspect of film making either! Rather, he is superb at it..)!! Swades, though it might not work at the Box-Office ('Business' can be the term for a film but here, we have a piece of art!) is a successful film because those for whom this movie was meant have got it's message. It's is a film on India, by an Indian and for an intelligent Indian but it will cater to all who care for the actual meaning and the philosophy behind a very commonly used word-'patriotism'!!"

It's a good movie to watch and it suits for a lot of the ages, whether your 18 or 80, your going to love this movie. Not only that, after watching it you gain a sense of nationalism and it makes you want to go back home! Living in the States or for anyone outside their home country, we all take our cars, jobs and so forth for granted thinking we have a right to own these things, maybe after watching this \"realistic\" movie you should give yourself a chance to reconsider your opinions!

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of my favorite bollywood movies, and I have only seen the best of them. What endears this film to me most is the sheer likability and charm of the main character, the absence of a definite villain and quiet pathos. Apart from that the director does a fair job of maintaining narrative focus and shooting with a grace that compliments the colors of rural life and India. However, the man who does his job the best is the composer. A.R Rahman delivers a top notch soundtrack thats both catchy, expressive and consistent with the tone.\n\nWhat drags this movie down the most is ,of course, the excessive length. The director, who does maintain narrative focus, should have realized that the scale of the movie is not grand enough to require over 180 minutes of running time. The movie seems to stop at certain conclusive moments in between only to start again with a new dilemma. Other small problems include the mostly unfunny humor, the main female character's expository dialogue, the gooey obligate romance and the tacked on happy ending.\n\nNow to address the summary, traditional Disney animated movies and most bollywood movies have a lot in common. Taking this movie for example, we find in it most of what is needed for a Disney feature, a charming male hero, a charming female lead with a plea for independence, songs that serve as major plot development, no room for an ambiguous ending, a warm hearted and simple message and the hero's emotional arc culminating in his salvation, but what this movie lacks in humor and pace Disney can provide.\n\nStill, however if one thing needs to be said, it's what a lovely movie."

It is hackneyed, clich\u00e9d, re-hashes whatever you've seen / heard ten times before and the actions of the characters are absolutely unbelievable. It tries to be sweet and cute and ends up being fake (along with sickly sweet and sickly cute).\n\nIdealistic films would be more idealistic if they portrayed reality and showed shades of gray in their main characters too. Fairyland movies such as Swades fall woefully short of real idealism."

He also successfully showed an alternative to fight the system.\n\nSwades is not a movie meant for NRI's. Rather, it is a movie meant for the resident Indians. It is a must watch movie for every Indian.\n\nIt is very unfair on my part if I do not mention the name of A.R.Rahman, who gave a beautiful music for this epic movie.

After feeling emotionally stagnant towards both his career and his personal life (or lack there of), Bhargava travels back to his home country of India to bond with his childhood nanny. He soon finds out that she has moved to a smaller village that has been forced out of a properly funded educational system and, above all things, electricity by a corrupt government. What starts out as a simple emotional vacation turns into an life alternating experience after he is unable to resist his impulse to answer the village's plea for help, become a proper role model for local children, and fall in love with a self reliant and progressive female teacher. Ultimately, Bhargava must chose between his duties at NASA in America and his newly surfacing prospective of what is important in life.\n\nThis 2004 Indian film has been hailed as \"one of the most socially relevant commercial Hindi films to have emerged in the last decade\" by Times of India. It is directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, who helmed LAGAAN, which was the first Indian movie to be nominated for an Oscar award. Swades is written by Ashutosh Gowariker and K.P. Saxena.\n\nThis 195 minute masterpiece is filled with wonderful music, laughter, social unrest, and love in a manner that never drags. There is a natural beat in which the conflicts and resolutions play out, and the pace never seems forced into a quick tie-up or dragged out by unnecessary melodrama. Heck, I have seen hour and a half films that have seemed longer than this one. The subtitle work is above average thanks to the addition of quick definitions of common Indian slang and terms that sometimes pop up in the dialog. If you have the chance, do yourself a favor and see this film."

It's a rare movie that can hold my attention that long and that justifies it's length. In general my opinion is that if you can't tell the story in around 2 hours, maybe it shouldn't be a movie, maybe it should be a mini series.\n\nIndian movies are a bit different though. Releasing a mini-series isn't really an option when much of the country barely has electricity, let alone internet/cable... Coincidently Swades touches on that subject.\n\nThe best indian movies though have a certain lightness to them. A lightness that is so very typically Indian, something I've never seen from any other country and something that I can't explain either. A lightness that let's the time just fly by like a breeze. Maybe that's why many of it's country's movies are so long.\n\nSwades isn't the very best of Indian cinema but it's more than decent. It's heart is in the right place. It's a rather shallow story but it does touch on a lot of the nation's issues while telling a personal story as well.\n\nIt's a nice viewing experience."

This is absolutely wrong message. A laymen will like it because he will get one more scientist burning his nights for his benefit in his Mother India but the argument is flawed\n\n1. Scientists are a citizen of the world, they are the torchbearers of a generation.Politicizing them on the basis of country is like politicizing elections on the basis of religion\n\n2.

The direction is lackluster, no grip, no anticipation, everyone knows this loser will come back to India from the very first scene of the movie ( it is obvious he doesn't have a life in the states, here in his village people gave him some attention, and he is so desperate to get it that he leaves everything. Not to mention the girl probably the only one he ever and will ever touch )and still it , drags on and on for unthinkable point of time.\n\n4. This is a cheap, no, pardon me, a cruel attempt to play with the emotions of naive people. not to mention the pain it causes the Indian scientific diaspora and their family members who are actually making a real contribution to science abroad.\n\n5. The emotions of Shah Rukh are not as good under the direction of Asitosh Gowariker, as it were under Bhansali, he can not even touch his performance that he gave in Devdas\n\nPleas people apply some reason and logic instead of emotion to judge an idea.

However, after watching it over 5-6 times, I realise that Swades is a great movie because it highlights the reality of what villagers in India face. Most films which flop often have no storyline but Swades actually has a storyline. The storyline focuses on Mohan Bhargava (Shahrukh Khan) who returns to India in search of his childhood nanny and in the process remembers how much he loves his country.\n\nOne thing that I actually think is good is that critics noticed how well Khan portrayed the title role of the film, more importantly Khan won an Oscar for his performance!"

If anybody had any doubt that 'Lagaan' was simply the result of Aamir Khan's input, then all one has to do is go see 'Swades'- Gowariker's latest offering.\n\nAs one Indian critic pointed out, 'Swades' is actually a sequel in spirit to 'Lagaan'. Both movies are distinctly about the indomitable spirit of the everyday Indian. And both films are about the triumph of that spirit.\n\nIt would've taken a gargantuan effort, and nearly an impossible one, to live up to the success(critical and commercial) of 'Lagaan'. And Gowariker cleverly avoids just that. Here is a director who knows his strengths and uses them to his film's advantage. His attention to detail was evident in 'Lagaan', but with 'Swades' he reinforces it in a big way. Every frame of the film is a tribute to the camera whether it is the mineral-water sipping Khan, the wet sarees laid to dry-out, the crowded second-class compartment of a passenger train, triple-seat scooter-ride, a mystic sage atop a caravan or choppers flying in the sky with the NASA headquarters in the background. Gowariker's style of cinema harks back to the days of Bimal Roy. Plus, he possesses the finesse of David Lean.\n\n'Swades' takes a larger issue than 'Lagaan' and deals with it in the same simplistic manner that made the former so appealing. 'Lagaan' was about an Indian's conviction in himself and the manner in which his will spread contagiously through an entire village. It was a clever retelling of India's freedom struggle, albeit with cricket as a metaphor. 'Swades' is again about an Indian. This time around though, the Indian is free and not under the shackles of the English. But this Indian is far removed from the India left behind by 'Lagaan's Bhuvan! At the end of 'Lagaan', the voice-over mentioned that somewhere in the annals of our history, the story of Bhuvan was lost. In 'Swades', that Bhuvan is India- an India that has been forgotten and neglected by its own son.\n\n'Swades' then is about Mohan Bhargava(Shahrukh Khan), a project manager at NASA, working on a Global Precipitation Measurement(GPM) programme. Mohan decides to go to India and bring Kaveri amma(Kishori Ballal), who took care of him as a child, to the United States and more importantly to a life of comfort. Upon reaching India, he understands that Kaveri amma has made Charampur, a remote little village in Uttar Pradesh, as her home. Here she helps making the children of the village literate individuals with the aid of Geeta(Gayatri Joshi), a teacher and later Mohan's love interest. 'Swades' is a journey of Mohan's transformation from a detached Indian(there is a scene where he refers to his fellow-countrymen as 'you Indians'!), sipping on mineral-water and preferring to sleep in his comfy air-conditioned caravan than a rustic wooden cot, into an individual who is made painfully aware of his country's pathetic state of plight that is in stark contrast to his luxurious life. And we, as audiences- resident Indians or otherwise but equally detached, become a part of this conversion too. In fact, there is a very poignant moment in the film that takes place at a desolate railway-station that arouses such mixed emotions of pain, disgust, guilt and ultimately resolve that it is impossible to control your tears and not feel a block of ache tearing its way down your throat. It is then that you realize that the movie, with this scene, is no longer just cinema. It has transcended into something even greater and important. There won't be a moment like this in cinema for a long time, rest assured.\n\n'Swades' is a cleverly written(Gowariker, M.G. Sathya and K.P. Saxena) movie. What is essentially a preachy, documentary fodder has been packaged with grand aplomb into an entertaining film-script. Much of the film's success owes to its ingenuous characters- be it the US aspiring cook, the postman-cum-postmaster or the cute little kid. Shahrukh Khan pushes all the right buttons in a performance that is worthy of a standing ovation. Here is an actor who has immense talent but has lost himself in the m\u00eal\u00e9e of stupid, commercial Bollywood. 'Swades' gives him a role that he can not only chew into but live as well. Mohan Bhargava is not Shahrukh Khan, and thank God for that. Shahrukh Khan is Mohan Bhargava! Gayatri Joshi exudes confidence, in spite of being a newcomer and pitted opposite the King Khan in a movie directed by an Oscar entrant! But it is Kishori Ballal as Kaveri amma that endears the most. 'Swades' is also as much an achievement of Mahesh Aney. It is his cinematography that breathes India into the reels.\n\nMind you, this is not a popcorn-flick. It requires patience and probably reflection too. But the rewards are very satisfying.\n\nRating- ****\n\n* Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent"

Beautiful music, songs. A good portrayal of all the lives of people living in the villages and how Shahrukh helps in applying his work experience in the betterment of lifestyle of people.

But even fewer movies stay within the confines of this oft-repeated formula, and manage to get the formula right. Swades is one such film. The much-anticipated follow-up to Ashutosh Gowariker's award-sweeping success Lagaan, Swades is a more low-key, rustic affair. Starring the ubiquitous Shah Rukh Khan in what is arguably his most nuanced performance to date, Swades tells the simple story of a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) who embarks on a journey to India's heartland with the sole purpose of bringing back his effervescent nanny to the US. What starts out as a simple mission turns into an eye-opening exploration of the meaning of being an Indian. What separates Swades from other passionately patriotic films (i.e. Rang de Basanti) is its ability to avoid grandiose political statements. Instead, the film's charms are simple... the plight of a small village without basic electricity, a young boy selling water for pennies, a villager with two daughters and no reason to educate them. And who can forget SRK's impassioned speech at the town hall gathering, where he decries India's blind affection for its divisive culture? At the end of the film, you're left with an exhilarating feeling of hope - a hope that comes from making deceptively simple decisions. And the message is clear for every single Indian who once called the subcontinent his home. Go light your bulb!"

Since it was a fantasy, clich\u00e9d dialog and cardboard characters were not a problem. In fact, quite the opposite since they provided comic relief when needed. Swades tries to be a quasi-serious movie and completely fails because no effort has been made to have serious dialog and fully fleshed out characters. (In contrast, see Shwaas for real situations, fully fleshed out characters and normal conversation.) Instead, we have quasi-seriousness imposed on a Bollywood fantasy background which is jarring to say the least. Oddly enough, Shah Rukh Khan delivers a reasonably good, understated performance. The new actress, Gayathri Joshi's nonverbal performance is top notch. Unfortunately, she's all dolled up (well coiffed and manicured at that) and nowhere to go since she's supposed to be living in a poor village which makes her look ludicrous. No attempt was made to make her less glamorous. Instead, we have someone who looks like Queen Elizabeth living in a slum. Finally, while Lagaan had a good screenplay, there's no story here and no payoff in the end. While the cinematography is excellent and the village backdrop authentic, it all amounts to a wasted effort. In summary, Gowarikar has lowered our expectations which is a very good thing for him and hopefully for us as well."

The director uses this to drive the point home and make the audience question their beliefs, values and thinking.\n\nLots of movies have come which have a lot of Jism, a little Murder and lots of Hawas but this one has a soul and is thought provoking. Mkaes you spend at least one minute and stop thinking about self and focus on the society as a whole. Well done Ashutosh, great encore to Lagaan."

Coming from Ashutosh whose pre-Lagaan record was not so great, I went into the cinema without any expectations. I wanted to be surprised. And I was! Watching SWADES was like watching a novel. The journey of one man and his emotions towards his nation. The director hits many chords with this movie - stuff we think we already know about, but are never really brave enough to watch in the eye. Being great followers of escapist movies in Bollywood, we tend to attach the success of a movie at the box office to it's quality. Not true. Mark my words that Swades will bag a lot of awards this time because of the way it was handled. Whoever called it a \"documentary\" or a \"moral science lesson\" is either too ignorant or just another escapist himself who does not want to show the world what India really is. Despite the fact that an Indian is a top notch project manager for NASA at the world's power capital Washington, his roots lie in a place where he has to buy water from a young boy for 25 paise. Could there be a better summary of India? Personally for me that scene at the railway station was the best. Shahrukh almost seems to hold back his tears while making sure his companion on the journey does not see him crying at the state of his country. We all talk big about India and say change CAN happen, but Mohan Bhargava actually went ahead and did his bit in bringing about that change. One of the best last scenes of a movie I have seen lately where he washes himself on the river banks....he is home."

The d\u00e9butante & only one film till now actress is worth watching for, be it her looks or her expressive face or her simplicity, she has kept everything in control,. In fact, Mr. Director scores in assembling so many actors & extracting superlative performances from all of them...

A theme for the people who are leaving their countries / states in search of a better life without realizing the fact that they can create a better living environment at home itself.\n\nAn insight on the problems of India whose underdeveloped part is somehow or other responsible for itself for the underdevelopment. The social jinx in the rural India which should have been broken long before are now hampering the progress of the villages.\n\nThe movie is another Gem after Lagaan in the collection of Ashutosh and Indian Cinema as a whole."

What do audiences want from Shah Rukh Khan? Bollywood fans criticize him for being over the top and hammy, and then stay away in droves when he gives the sort of beautifully nuanced, introspective, and quietly impassioned performance that he delivers in \"Swades\".\n\n\"Swades\" is the sort of film that Jean Renoir, perhaps the greatest filmmaker of all time, would make if he were alive and making Bollywood films. Ditto Satyajit Ray. It gives us village India as seen from the outside by a thoroughly Americanized ex-patriot, a young man who is at first scared to drink the water and condescending towards the \"little\" lives and foolish ambitions of the locals. Gradually, of course, he is drawn into their problems, and rediscovers his identity as an Indian. What is most graceful (and Renoir-like) about this film, is that we are allowed to laugh at both young Mohan and the unsophisticated villagers, even as we grow to know and love them. That kind of tenderness and humanity, something that transcends notions of political correctness and national identity, is very rare in movies from any country.\n\nI could have done without the love story--as I could also have done without the love triangle in \"Lagaan\". Love interest seems to be a requirement in Bollywood, though (as it used to be in Hollywood, which once put a woman in \"Moby Dick\"!), and I can live with it. \"Swades\" is such a quiet, introspective sort of film, and so realistic, that I also was a bit jarred when the musical numbers came bouncing in. On repeated viewings, however, the numbers serve the film well, and they are in themselves quite beautiful.\n\n\"Swades\" is a film to treasure, and I certainly hope that no one involved (especially SRK) regards it as a failure."

        "review_detailed_main": "As I was watching this movie yesterday night in the theatre I started to feel ashamed of myself being an Indian. This shame was not the result of the hard reality shown in the movie, but it was because of the way the critics in India wrote this movie off on the very first day of its release. I certainly did not expect this from Taran Adarsh and Co. For once they should look beyond the box office collections as the criteria for a good movie. One the other hand I also realise that people living in a country like India see at this reality in their every day life and wouldn't want to spend three hour refreshing their wounds. But here is the question! Can you go away from this reality by watching a romantic flick like Veer-Zaara (no criticism of the movie, it was brilliant), when you know that you have to go back to face the same situations. I think when Mohan tells villagers on dashera night that they have come to love the situations and that's why they don't want to do anything about it holds right for the Indian moviegoers and critics.\n\nWell better get at the movie, what can I say. Everything was just perfect. I feel comparing it with Lagaan is unjust as both belongs to different movie genre. While, Lagaan was about the triumph of the human spirit, Swades is all about us, WE, THE PEOPLE. Personally I feel Swades stands a better chance of winning an Oscar than Lagaan. Indian Government should send this movie as the official entry from India this year. Ashutosh has done wonders directing and writing this movie, so have done every individual involved in making of this movie.\n\nOnly one criticism of this movie though, why Mohan had to go back to India in the end. I would have preferred the ending if he had stayed at America. I also felt that Ashutosh should have showed a bit of positive attitude towards the people who are working abroad and helping Indian government in building huge foreign currency reserves. After all it was because of Mohan's hard-earned money in America that helped him in building the electricity generator in the village.\n\nLeaving above criticism the movie is a gem coming out of Bollywood. Acting is first rate, it was so refreshing to see Shahrukh playing such a role and that's right to say that with this movie a Star became an Actor. Music by AR Rahman is brilliant, although some of the songs did hampered the pace of the movie. Background score was the life of the movie in my opinion. In the end all the commemoration to Ashutosh who dared to make such a movie. I think he truly deserves the ovation public gave when movie finished yesterday at the theatre.\n\nA must see. 9/10"

If your answer is 'yes', then 'Swades' is not for you.\n\n'Swades' is a self exploring journey of Mohan Bhargava(Shahrukh Khan) who is a smart & successful project manager in Nasa's Space Kennedy Centre who after a span of solitude years feels the urge to meet his nanny Kaveriamma and convince her to spend the rest of her life in more pleasures & comforts with him, she has been a motherly figure to him and many. Search of Kaveriamma lands him in a small village of Charanpur in India where she lives with Gita(Gayatri Joshi), a school teacher by profession and choice. Mohan is in a total contrast situation from where he came and his short stay extends when he comes across many vital unsolvable realities of that village, which help to form a ladder to his inner evolution. And of course Gita's simplistic & idealistic personality helps in develop a loving bond between the two.He takes on himself to provide the basic need of Electricity(generate) thru Water and even tries to open the innocent/ ignorant eyes of many to the unknown and known facets of the world. Mohan's every move, every word gets him closer to the rest and himself . Mohan is capable enough of taking any sound decision at this juncture of his life, so does he fall prey to a comfortable lavish lifestyle layering it in the name of career progression and loosing his real identity or does he want to go beyond the norms and return to his roots and make his life more worthwhile?\n\nThe soulful music and the intertwining of songs in the script keeps you absorbed through out. The movie at no point goes overboard in conveying the thoughts of the director(Ashutosh Gowariker),his penchant for detailing and apt characters placement are worth experiencing. I forgot to mention SRK, this is what you'll feel too cos here Mohan Bhargava is at forte which says a lot about the actor himself and even the director who has the capability to extract effective performances from one and all.\n\nThe only downside maybe the duration of the movie, but the sincerity of the movie will gently glide you all the way.\n\n'Swades' will be remembered for several firsts(or in a long time) to its credit: * The title of the film. * The promo pictures of the film very different which doesn't emphasise the hero, but the people. * First Indian Cinema to be shot in Nasa. * Subtle romantic moments between the lead actor & actress. * Debut of a senior veteran director Lekh Tandon. * A main-stream cinema not following a rigid path of 'entertaining' cinema.\n\nSomeone correctly said 'It is difficult to be simple', but its not at all difficult to watch and muse over this simple piece of work!"

He is a very good actor no doubt .. but i have never been a very big fan of him as he was never the versatile actor. In Swades he proves that he can act if given something besides lover boy masala roles. No matter what the box office response to this will be , those who have the mind to think, will know this movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It is not really for the masses, but i suggest all the NRI's watch it. I am a NRI and honest to GOD, this might make some of you laugh but me at the age of 16 before this movie came out had decided to go back to India and do somethin for the nation. India is booming and we should go empower that boom. Remember this is the story of ONE village in India and this is not what the country is exactly like . The country has been progressing at a very fast rate and is surely going to be a power in the next decade. This movie has just made my decision stronger to go back after completing education. Gayatri Joshi is the best newcomer this year, without a skin show she impresses. She is simply sexy, she is beautiful and is an amazing actress. Her sexiness lies in her attitude, expression and body language. All in all Swades is one of the best movies made in a long time but it is nothing like any other Bollywood movie. This One DESERVES AN Oscar! Ashutosh Gowariker is a great story teller and making movies from his heart will for sure drive him to the Oscar as it is Oscar quality after all.\n\nRating : 9.5/10"

This movie will make you think, contemplate and feel from your soul.\n\nThe lead role played by Shahrukh Khan is simply brilliant. Mohan is a very intelligent man and yet simple at heart, benevolent, practical and with a strong resolve. He has no false airs and is totally down-to-earth.\n\nThe movie is definitely a collector's item and I do hope Ashutosh makes more such thought provoking films for a long time to come.

        "review_detailed_main": "Many people, western and Indian, complain that Indian films don't offer anything different, that they aren't grown up enough, but when great films like swades get made and released they either lambasted or ignored. Swades is the kind of film which brings hope to bollywood. As someone who was an ardent supporter of bollywood i have found that since 2001 the quality of films have generally been poor, and my attention turned towards south India, where you get to see truly great films.\n\nAs for the film, it has a novel storyline, which incidentally is based on a true story. Shah Rukh Khan gives a brilliant performance, he becomes his character and it is a welcome change from the screen persona that he has had in so many countless over-rated films. The background music to film adds a real dimension to the film, a lesser musician could have easily made the scenes melodramatic with a poor background score.\n\nWhat prevents Swades from being a truly magnificent film, and in my eyes prevents it from being as good as films like Kannathil Muthamittal and Lagaan, is that the film suffers from an average cinematography and from average editing. With all due respect to Mahesh Aney, he not in the same league as Anil Mehta or Ravi Chandran or Santosh Sivan, you never felt in awe of a scene. The editing I felt was poor, but I believe this was due to a script which turned out to be more than four hours long, and a great deal was done to cut the running time to something respectable but in doing so the importance of certain scenes got diluted, for example when Mohan goes to meet the farmer, his journey there is turned in to a montage for a song, and the impact of the final song in the film is diluted when the song is interrupted with other important scenes.\n\nSwades is a great film and also a great message, and it is a shame that certain reviewers didn't see that. Thankfully the Indian public eventually saw the film and got to see the message the director wanted convey."

Undoubtedly, SRK is one of the best actors to ever grace the Indian screen. He just needs roles like this one to showcase his immense talents.\n\nA great movie, that despite the lukewarm box office in India, was well received overseas and is destined to extremely well on DVD.

It was not difficult to pump edge of the seat ecstasy into scenes like the 'electricity generation' and 'Mohan's change of heart at NASA' but they ended up being lame and predictable.\n\nThe saving grace of the movie were the regular patriotic gushes the story inherently gave. And with those motherland glasses on, it was so easy to overlook the creative mediocrity that the film was replete with. The makers of this movie smartly camouflaged their creative destitution by whipping up sentiments of the nouveau liberalised and identity seeking Indian - just like the politicians of this country do. And they succeeded big time."

        "review_detailed_main": "When the maker of Lagaan and a superstar like Shah Rukh Khan get together in a film, the expectations are obviously soaring high. Thankfully, Swades lives upto the expectations. Though, Swades is distant from the usual Hindi commercial cinema and might not be targeted towards the masses, it has a flair and an artistic touch to it that makes it a movie worth-seeing. The film, about an NRI Mohan Bhargav, who comes to India and discovers the pathetic conditions that prevail in his country, holds the viewer mesmerised till the end. AR Rehman's musical genius is once again epitomised in Swades. The tracks Yun hi chala (by the way, Makrand Deshpande looks cool!), Yeh tara woh tara, and the self-sung title track are melodious and appluadable.\n\nThe film actually wins the hearts of the viewers because of the simplistic touch lent to it. There is something really honest about the way India has been portrayed in the film and Gowariker's choice of cast , as in Lagaan, was perfect as ever. Although the film cant be classified as an entertainer it is one of those rare films that comes straight from the director's heart and reaches till the very depth of the viewer's heart.\n\nIn terms of acting, Swades marks a new achievement in SRK's career. Shah Rukh Khan sheds his Chopra-Johar image in Swades and sets the right tone for the film. He is unarguably the heart and soul of the film and speaks his dialogues with divine perfection. Gayatri Joshi is awesome as a newcomer. What is even more commendable about this damsel is that she never appears to be over-rawed by facing the greatest star of our times(SRK) and matches SRK's acting with equally good performance.\n\nSwades, though might not be successful at the box-office, certainly hits home the desired message with ease."

The acting in this movie does not feel like actors reading from a script, which is what watching any other Bollywood movie feels like. The acting is so good that it recedes into the background. That's what makes me like Hollywood movies and that's what this movie gets right.\n\nI cannot emphasise how important that is to me. No matter how good the story or the production values or the star cast, if the acting is crappy, I cannot tolerate the movie. And even in Bollywood movies where everyone is telling me that the acting in it is awesome, I go to the theatre and find the same tired old over-the-top acting, the sort you see in stage plays.\n\n'Swades' is different.

Its been ever so often that as Indians we have lam blasted the mushy, one track nonsensical movies that were being churned out by bollywood and yearned for something slightly honest and cerebral. And now it seems that the moment has arrived. Swades has finally reached the next level of Indian movie-making with the help of ashutosh, srk and rahman where the execution, the concept and the treatment of the film is at least (i can safely assume) close to world standards. There is no point comparing lagaan (the directors 1st movie) to this movie as his earlier venture was purely fiction with no semblance of realism in it. However this movie has so many ingredients of being a pathbreaker for Indian cinema that its almost scary. The feelings and expectations of an nri set aside, it tells the story of middle and upper class India losing touch with the harsh realities of the sufferings of the less fortunate ones all around us (and the fact that we can do very little to change the ongoing scenario is even more glaring and painful). Besides this the movie also deals with the desires and priorities of humans inspite of the trials and tribulations of daily living.\n\nThe maturity of the script, the actors and the score makes it a journey of epic proportions without it looking epic at all. The normalcy of the movie is something which might (and hopefully will) change the way cinema is seen and made in India in the future. One can only hope."

Given that scale as a standard, Swades was well calibrated. The acting was well controlled and the story compelling. Shah Rukh Khan is a pretty good actor and so is Gayatri Joshi, not to mention stunningly beautiful. The interaction between Mohan (Shah Rukh) and Gita (Gayatri) in many places is really charmingly done and mature such as the eye contact game when she is tying Shah Rukh's \"dhoti\".\n\nThe music is also very good. The song \"Yuhin Chala Chal Rahi\" is an fusion of Indian classical, bollywood and western rhythm which really works. The lyrics of the songs are also meaningful.\n\nThe only negative I would highlight is that the subtitles during the songs are a little overly poetic and \"olde English\" - like which detracts from the real lyrics of the song.\n\nDefinitely recommend it!"

A movie is a tad slow at times, but no masala is added to make it more palatable.\n\nThe story is a bit novel, and deals with the agonies and pains of a NRI engineer. SRK is the NRI engineer who is caught between a luxurious life in US and the calls of his motherland. The way this theme has been handled is quite commendable. There are no efforts to brush the trash under the carpet in the movie. The bleak realities in India are shown very openly , unlike many pseudo Bollywood movies that seek to hide and paint a very misleading picture of the truth.\n\nARR's music adds to the glory and all the songs are quite good. The background score is very apt but sometimes gloomier than the situation warrants. The director Gowariker just excels . SRK acts very well , and is controlled in his expressions. The actress Joshi is quite OK and natural in her acting. The locales are quite beautiful and the village scenes are quite good.\n\nBut some slight flaws still exist like the weaver who changes his profession to farming and is punished for that. The problem of man vs machine is quite old and somehow village economies have coped with that. This is a slight exaggeration. Are there villages where no one is aware of the internet? I heard that in every village in India you have mobiles now. But the reviewer may be wrong. SRK comes with his caravan and how does he get water for his caravan van and what about electricity and power for his super-sized vehicle ? Again Iam not an automobile expert and maybe Iam wrong.\n\nBut brushing these slight defects aside , the movie comes out as a great creation of Bollywood. Personally it would have touched many NRIs hearts as they would have immediately identified with the theme of the movie. The pangs suffered by SRK seem so real when one is placed in a similar situation.\n\nTo summarize a great movie worth a watch"

        "review_detailed_main": "Swades is a good film and the writer-director Ashutosh Gowarikar does a handy job of somehow making a long film not only watchable but also endearing. An Indian scientist returns back home and rediscovers his roots- this is the basic synopsis but the film is a lot more nuanced and features some good performances. The lead actor Shah Rukh Khan is a big star in India but here he plays it subtle which is what the performance desires. Gayatri Joshi doesn't have much to do but she is ravishing. This is one of the rare Bollywood films that makes one sit and ponder."

Though the film again revolves around a village, this time its Charanpur instead of Champaner. A modern setting, depicting the brain drain in India, the film addresses issues like electricity, education and poverty.\n\nIt looks at all these things in a very interesting story. Kudos to Ashutosh, as he has incorporated light moments in the film, without making a serious arty kind of an issue- based film. The issues are looked at in a micro perspective."

        "review_detailed_main": "Swades is a refreshingly welcome breeze of novelty and experimentation in Indian cinema. Perhaps the only glaring flaw is the unnecessary length of the film \u0096 I thought 2 songs could definitely have been omitted from the final picture. But having said that it is an opening to a wonderful new era in our films that we had all but given up on. The story of an NRI visiting India, mixing with the people who are the true representatives of rural India, his emotions, his silent observations and western outlooks, his experiences and ultimate dilemma. Shahrukh Khan has underplayed his character to near perfection and for a change he is presented as a human rather than a demi-God. There is no overacting, no unnecessary histrionics and the 'gyan' is also restricted to the minimum. One or two scenes like where the heroine is in conversation with her prospective in-laws could have perhaps been less pedantic and more toned down. But otherwise the Lagaan director is very visible in the Swades flick. It is not a groundbreaking film in its songs or choreography but it is one of the most sensible and down-to-earth films that you can hope for in Indian cinema. While we can hum and dance to the romances filmed by the Chopras and Johars it is very rare to see reality presented in such a positive and inspirational manner by a Bollywood director. Coming post Yuva it is heartening to know that influential people in India are thinking of our country as a possibility for real prosperity. The interest and effort put into this movie cannot be for profit alone. It is moving to see filmmakers moving beyond the usual song/dance sequences and slapstick comedy and delving into serious movie-making. You can't make a Swades if you are not touched by the India we live in today. And for that we need to make films like this successful, commercially viable. It is serious cinema because the subject is serious. Full marks to Ashutosh Gowriker for going beyond one's petty sense of self and looking at the larger picture and understanding just how small we really are on the face of the earth. Do go to the theatres and make this movie a hit so we can encourage these social thinkers. Like the director himself says \"It is not a call to only the NRIs to come back home, it is a call to resident Indians also to look at the India that is and give something back.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Very rarely do we get to see meaningful and thought provoking films in Bollywood. Swades comes out as a breath of fresh air to an industry that's been churning out ridiculous nonsense for decades.\n\nFirst things first, Swades is no Lagaan. In fact, in some instances it's way better than Lagaan.\n\nSwades's biggest plus point is it's script. The storyline is so real, touching and moving you hardly ever notice the length of the film. By the time the first half was over, I was eagerly looking forward to the second half of this cinematic brilliance.\n\nThe main protagonist's journey from being a successful NRI working at NASA, to helping a village in UP generate electricity is well portrayed and captivating.\n\nAll characters are simply brilliant, and they gel so well together. You have a school teacher who is a whiz at mathematics, a postman who is also a wrestler, a cook who dreams of opening a small restaurant on a freeway in America and many such characters who play small but significant roles in Swades.\n\nSwades has emotions aplenty, the scene where Mohan goes to collect rent from a tenant and finds out that he can't even afford one meal for his children is striking.\n\nThe scene where you see a boy selling water for 25 paisa is so poignant. You wont be able to hold back your tears when you see the harsh reality.\n\nComedy has been handled well in Swades. It's not loud or over the top in any way.\n\nThe screenplay is gripping, holding the viewers rapt attention throughout. Cinematography is stunning, each and every shot is breath-taking. Background music was simply amazing. At times the background music was so expressive and striking, I actually got goose pimples. Dialogues are outstanding!\n\nThe songs itself were melodious and went well in-sync with the theme of the film. They were also picturised well and didn't seem out of place.\n\nA star has definitely become an actor. Shahrukh Khan as Mohan Bhargava has delivered an extraordinary performance. He slides effortlessly into the character and emerges victorious. For once you don't see him sporting designer blouses, (thankfully) throughout the film he wears plain checked shirts and looks good in them too. SRK has finally silenced his critics. In my opinion this is his best performance too date.\n\nGayatri Joshi has given a great performance. She has handled her role with immense maturity. For a moment you forget that this is her first film. Gayatri looks comfortable in front of the camera, her expressions and dialogue delivery is competent. Overall a great debut.\n\nOff the support cast, Kishori Balal played the part of the Kaveri amma well. Dayashanker Pandey and Rajesh Vivek were good.\n\nAshutosh Gowariker proves once again that he's creative, talented and one of India's finest film-makers. Full credit goes to him for excellently writing and directing such a remarkable film.\n\nAll in all Swades is truly a path-breaking film. It entertains as well as spreads an important message to all Indian's everywhere. Hindi cinema at it's best! 9/10."

But then I realized that the impression the first scene gave was spot on.\n\nStereotyping scientists, scientists who work for NASA are not this dull they have great lives. NASA is a collaborative effort if you don't have great social skills you will not fit in, nobody does anything on their own.\n\nI am sorry but it is the directors DUTY to make the viewer sympathize or at least care for the protagonist as quickly as possible and starting with a \"I am so smart\" scene(which by the way was not at all cleverly executed, I would have had questions after his little speech because some of the points were cyclical) which is not fun and bland is no way to do this. If you are going to have a speech which is to sound \"smart\" from a guy in NASA you have to have some actual physics talk and some real precise science on what the plan is. I won't even talk about how predictable the plot is...\n\nI am only giving 4 stars instead of 2-3 because I did not finish it, and it could be that the next two hours are the most epic hours in film cinema."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Swades: We, the People",
        "review_detailed_main": "I'm been very much impressed by the films of Ashutosh Gowariker with his epics like Jodhaa Akbar and Lagaan, that it's a no brainer for me to continue seeking out his earlier films, especially so when they have been scored with music provided by A.R. Rahman. Swades: We, the People struck a common chord in some aspects of the story with Delhi-6, but only just, and I found it strangely compelling to dwell a little on some similarities between the two.\n\nWell for starters both had an NRI (Non-Resident Indian, or jokingly mocked as Non- Returning Indian) returning from the United States, only to find themselves in a small town/village/district where the ways of their lives are a little backward, and the protagonist has to find time to get used to the slower pace, and life without its luxuries, even what we deem as basic like electricity. Email? Internet? Unheard of, naturally. There's also some time in both narratives dedicated to the well known story of the three way tussle in Lord Ram, Sita and Ravana, though the one in Swades benefited from Rahman's wonderful music enveloping the stage play, in more complete terms than that in Delhi-6 (also scored by Rahman by the way).\n\nAnd when it's a blast to the past, some common themes that seem to find themselves a staple in a Gowariker film are the tackling of caste (Lagaan), as well as religion (Jodhaa Akbar), with the need to see the bigger picture and to overcome these issues and put aside differences for the greater good. Arranged marriages too have no place amongst women who are strong, independent and self-reliant, but I guess such tradition and customs are still quite commonplace and widely practiced, for movies from then until now still featuring such arrangements in the plot, as if to mirror some frowning of the deliberate, and sometimes forced practices of culture and tradition, just because.\n\nLIke how Abhishek's character echoed in Delhi-6, \"India works, the people make it work\", it's like a wake up call to the community as seen in Swades too, that while there are niggling issues like corruption and the reliance of social crutches in tradition or culture, things really work when everyone rolls their sleeves and get down to doing things. In Swades, everyone complains about the lack of electricity and the frequent disruption, but it takes one guy to wake them up and show them the way to progress. Aamir Khan took on such a role in Lagaan, and in Swades, Shah Rukh Khan plays that equivalent in Mohan Bhargav, a project manager in USA's NASA who journeys back to India in search of his foster mother Kaveriamma (Kishori Balal) because he's feeling guilty of abandoning her.\n\nClocking in at just over 3 hours (which recent Gowariker film isn't?), it allows plenty of space for a number of themes to be explored. The narrative also took advantage of the run time to inject the staple romance and exploration of Mohan in his new environment, and the vast myriad of likable characters here also add to the film's endearing approach.\n\nRunning central in the story is Mohan's tussle with his lady love Gita (Gayatri Joshi, in her debut and only role to date?) for his foster mother who's now also the only family of the latter and her brother Chikku (Smith Seth). Mohan wants to bring Kaveriamma back to the US to enjoy the last stage of her life amongst luxuries, while Gita wants her to stay in India. Both have their selfish reasons, and needless to say, falling in love just complicates matters. If affairs of the heart is not your cup of tea, then Mohan's one man crusade to fight for what's correct, and galvanizing support at the grassroots and community level, do make it a little moving as he sees what everyone doesn't, or choose not to, unless you go on the ground like he did.\n\nOne of the more poignant scenes, which also provides the opportunity for Rahman's Yeh Tara Woh Tara theme song for Swades, takes place in a community outdoor screening. With the screen set up in the middle of the field, the upper caste folks get to sit on the right side, with benches too for VIPs, while the lower caste folks sit on the opposite side of the screen, and obviously the incorrect side, having to view the movie in its mirror image, separated and out of view from the higher caste. In one fell swoop, Mohan uses the downtime of electricity interruption to demolish the unhealthy practices through children, who are always colour/race/creed-blind, and through them, hopefully, educating the older generation on the spot, while bringing about reasonable change of mindsets amongst the new generation. This scene alone sticks, amongst many others thanks to Gowariker's strong story, and direction.\n\nAt its basic level, with Hindi movies travelling the world for its global audience, the film seeks to call out to the NRIs to remember their roots, and to make that contribution back to their homeland, given that while there are problems that might have contributed to push factors, with the success, knowledge, capabilities and resources now ploughed back, they would effect some change no matter how small, and progress will always be made with that single small step in the right direction. The film isn't as heavy as it might seem, and that's the beauty of it, working itself on many levels.\n\nI've yet to be disappointed by a Gowariker film, and am going to continue seeking out even earlier films, while waiting with bated breath for his next."

A Fantastic Human-Story, along-with an Outstanding Performance by Shahrukh!\n\n'Swades' Synopsis: A successful Indian scientist returns to an Indian village to take his nanny to America with him and in the process rediscovers his roots.\n\n'Swades' is Masterfully Written & Directed. The Entire Journey, its Protagonist Mohan Bhargava goes through, comes across as Real, Moving & Inspiring. Though 193 Minutes long, 'Swades' turns out to been a boon for its viewer, because its so simple & yet so moving.\n\nAshutosh Gowariker's Screenplay & Direction, Both, are Masterful. He's in Top Form! 'Swades', without a shed of doubt, is his Finest Film to Date! Mahesh Aney's Cinematography is Excellent. Music by Academy-Award-Winner A. R. Rahman, is soothing.\n\nPerformance-Wise: As Mentioned, Shahrukh is simply Outstanding as Mohan Bhargava. The Superstar sinks his teeth into the character & performs astonishingly. It's a Hall-Mark Performance, that very deservingly Won him a Best Actor Filmfare-Award. Gayatri Joshi is superb. Kishori Balal is perfect. Dayashankar Pandey & Rajesh Vivek are flawless in supporting roles.\n\nOn the whole, 'Swades' is Priceless Cinema! Two Big Thumbs Up!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I would like to tell Swades is the best & only sensible movie of Indian cinema in the year 2004 after \"Lakshya\". 'Swades' is not exactly a drama, neither it's a romance.it is a theme, I'd say, not story. It's about what we the people are, what we do and what we should do instead of what we do.The execution you must go to the cinema and experience for yourself .\n\nShahrukh Khan performs his career best in all respect .No overacting this time in any scene of the movie this time (No shaking while crying). All credits to the director off course.I think only Ashutosh has the caliber to pull out best from Him up till now. The female lead character can be a dream role for any actress and Gayatri Joshi live it very strongly in her debut.she is so pretty ,simple& talented. Technically screenplay is good, though there are some possibilities of improvement,specially NASA shot, but the movie keeps the hold. The location, the costumes are not bad. Music of Swades is truly the best last year.A.R.Rahman's background score is involving, blended and great as usual touches your heart easily. In songs I liked 'Yeh Tara', 'Suno Jara' and 'Swades Theme' very much. Direction is a brilliant effort Ahutosh Gowariker Clearly shows his philosophy & its quite sensible .I like the way title begin , that theme on instrument will do good. amazing tune it is. one Blopper in the movie was In the phase 2 of GPM, , NASA is supposed to launch a satellite. But guess what they launch instead? A space craft!Even though making a main line movie out of a theme is just not easy and Ashutosh Gowarikar has a done great job.\n\nSome reviewer comparing this movie to Lagaan.Why does one want same kind of movies from the director each time? I mean I can't really differentiate Karan Johar and gangs' movies from one another. Honest! We regard movie maestros like Satyajit Ray, guru Dutt, Basu Bhattacharya because they made movies for the sake of art, the medium of silver screen and for their own satisfaction. That's why they are great and their movies are all time excellent!\n\nI say 'Swades' is a great movie. A movie that belongs to me. & will be with me through my life time. we Hesitate to act because whole vision might not be archived is the thinking that only hinders our progress what a comment by Mahatma Gandhi. & the movie live it up. HeartLy Thaks to Ashutosh Gowariker! for his whole different brilliant attempt .\n\nShubham Nigam Satyam ,Chennai"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have never been so sad for a movie failing at BO as i am for Swades.But BO needs some mas-ala,fast pace and some dramatic moments, it may have lacked these things.\n\nBut it have the \"soul\" which is not found in most of the movies.\n\nSwades is about self realization,about our roots,many cultural aspects: both positive and negative.But i loved Swades cause it was absolute realistic.\n\nRemember the scene in beginning when he says about Kaveri Amma that 'Mai Unko Bhul Gaya Tha'(I had forgotten her) this is among the finest moments.We realize that sometimes we forget people with whom we were once closely associated with, we get so much busy in our daily life that we tend to forget them.But sometime when we remember we like to speak to them, meet them, we miss them.It happens, we forget many of our childhood friends, few of our relatives,few of those with whom we were close.\n\nThe scene when SRK goes to search Kaveri Amma and finds that she is not there and just when he is turning back the old lady says \"she is very lucky that someone came to take her,that day she came..today you,else who ask for old people\".Very true.Old people are very much ignored.\n\nSRK's entry in the village and the background music \"Aayo re...Aayo re\" one of the most beautiful music ever.\n\nThe narrow old roads of village, people running after Srk van....surprised,stunned that who had entered our village in such a big van is damn realistic and gives \"an essence of our rural India\".\n\nSRK's entry in the house...wo aarti ki thaali lana and chandan and all gives an essence of our culture.\n\nIn the night when SRK says sorry to Kaveri Amma: \"I didn't took care of you\" that lady who is like mother figure to him and he had not taken care of her in all these years and now he is realizing his fault.....absolutely touching.\n\nSRK's arguments with Gayatri Joshi at dinner about politics...\"Sab Ek Dusre Ki Taraf Ungli Uthate Hai\" (everyone keeps pointing fingers on one another). Ye Tara Wo Tara Song and the lyrics \"Bund Bund Milne Se Banta Ek Dhara Hai'.\n\nHis discussion when he is asked to speak about America.....and his burst up on culture that how can we say that America culture is bad....we have our culture and we respect our culture...they have their too....and \"Jis Culture Aur Parampara,Sanskriti Pe Hum Garv Karte Hai Wahi Hume Ek Dusre Se Baate Rakhta Hai\"(the culture and tradition which we are proud of is keeping us divided) on the name of caste,religion etc then how come we should be proud of our culture.\n\nActually the whole scene above was just amazing and deeply touching.\n\nThen the whole scene when Srk goes for \"paisa vasooli\" and his story was quite touching.\n\nThe train scene: An NRI who never touches anything else than mineral water....looking after the plight of the boy he drinks that water, shows he was deeply sad in his heart to the plight of the country.And the way scene was handled and SRK's portrayal can't be put in words.\n\nThe scene when SRK is leaving the village and Maya ram refuses to go with him and says \"Apne Aangan Ka Diya Giving Light To Neighbours House\"...i can just clap.\n\nAnd the song \"Ye Jo Desh Hai Tera\".....specially the lines \"Mitti Ki Jo Hai Khushbu,Tu Kaise Bhulayega...Tu Chahe Kahi Jaye...Tu Laut Ke Aayega\".... I have so much respect for this song.\n\nAnd in the climax when John says \"Mohan you could have gone places.\" And Mohan replies \"I am going places\" Well bringing electricity was just to show that every individual can do something for his country and society.....Mohan Bhargav comes....he was alone...then he united many people....and result was for their own benefit......for their literacy,electricity and all.\n\nWhat Mohan Bhargav gets??....nothing??.\n\nBut its not....he gets something which is out of the world.....self realization...self respect....an honor.....not by others but in his own heart.....that he had done something good for his society and country.\n\nAll bow to Ashutosh Gowarikar...from child marriage to illiteracy, from caste-ism to poverty, Swades covers all aspects and issues of rural India. Realization and self journey of ones own mind and a heartfelt message of changing our country for good was never delivered in as realistic manner as it was in Swades. Hats off to SRK as well for coming up with one of the finest performance of his career.\n\nMohan Bhargav's journey from Space Shuttle to Boat....from the glittering lights of America to the lantern of India.....from the mind and money to his heart and soul......incredible....simply incredible.\n\nAs the saying goes: \"The Greatest Journeys Are The Ones That Bring You Home\""

        "review_detailed_main": "In an interview with Karan Johar Sanjay Leela Bhansali said that he would prefer Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar to Ashutosh and Farhan Akhtar. I personally that SLB is a very good director, but his statement does not makes sense to me. Anyways talking about Swades, one may like, don't like it, find it too preachy, too lengthy, too boring, may also find it not real or too realistic to digest, but it is one movie which no one can/should ignore.\n\nEvery thing about this movie is near perfect. The sense of hope and disappointment, the humor and tragedy and humor in tragedy, the hopelessness that nothing can be done and the strength evolving from that very hopelessness, the love as a strength and the love as shackle, the characters as hackneyed and the characters as individuals, the characters without motive and characters becoming motive. This movie is the epitome of irony and contradictions in our society. A movie, which tells that get up from the slumber that, we are in for centuries. It is as much for the Resident Indians as it Non Resident Indians. This movie says by all means come home for love but also come home for honour. All the marks to the Directors, Cast and Crew. And a special mention for the maestro A R Rahman. Who ever said that he is not happening must see this movie wherein he comes with the bang. He does not give the regular popular music but it adds to the punch of the movie and hits you in your guts. Especially the title song, which ironically does not appear with credits. Performance wise after seeing the movie I don't think SRK can be replaced with Amir. He seems to belong wherever he is. Gyatri Joshi makes a appearance in a flop but will go a long long way, not like Gracy Singh who is no where now after giving three hits. Other cast comprising of Rajesh Vivek, Dayashankar Pandey and Nanny is played to perfection and the sense of humor is evolved from the situations and not with the dialogues. The chemistry of SRK and GJ is exceptional. All credits to the director again. The dialogues are simple yet so very profound. And the journey of Mohan Bhargav to the peasant to get the rent and on his return purchasing water for 25 paisa summarizes the movie. I think no one would have directed that sequence better than AG.\n\nUltimately can be summarized from one of its own dialogue \"Apne pani main ghul jana barf ka muqqadder hota hai\". \"Its destiny of ice to dissolve in its own water.\" Hope people do get message.\n\nFrom me its 10/10if not more"

Also this happens to be the first Indian film to be actually shot inside the NASA research center at the Launch Pad 39A of the Kennedy Space Center of NASA in Florida. To add to the authenticity of his film, Gowariker actually shot a scene in the NASA space center rather than on a Filmcity Set. Shahrukh works on a rainfall monitoring satellite known as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) in the film, which is lifted into an orbit aboard a Space Shuttle. (GPM is an actual NASA mission, currently scheduled to launch in 2007). However this techno-savvy movie is not a sci-fi attempt by Gowariker but a sensible thought-provoking film about an intelligent Indian who leaves his country for a better life abroad but later rediscovers his roots and turns back."

The romantic scenes between Shahrukh and Gayatri have been written very well and I loved them. They portray innocent love...something diminished in bollywood movies due to all the vulgar item numbers and ugly, non-desirable sex scenes. In short...Ashutosh Gowarikar has lived up to his expectations and created another masterpiece. One of the must-see and classic movies of the year...and great acting by Shahrukh...restored my faith in his capabilities which was diminishing due to movies like main Hoon Naa."

There are few scenes in a movie that would affect someone as much as the scene wherein SRK talks about the things wrong with India. You should not miss this movie. Gayatri Joshi does a good job for a newcomer. Her costumes are very well designed and a very good character role essayed beautifully.

Gayatri Joshi stand by with the best actor of bollywood here with her performance and it is itself an achievement. Screenplay was very well executed. Dialogues were simply mind blowing specially that festival one by Shahrukh khan about the caste system and country.\n\nMusic of A.R.Rehman was awesome yet cheerful.

But after seeing Swades I must give him positive credit for the well done work. Every little thing in he movie is well made in details. The movie is very simple with no Disumb Dismub or Glamorous Bollywood Flavers. The comedy and the emotional scenes does catch you, and when you get out of the cinema you will feel very happy and in a good mood, and think of the life and that we do have a nice and good life compare to many people who doesn't even have food on the table.\n\nNow lets talk a little about the much hyped actor Shahrukh Khan. Many movies has been well made for SK, where we have the old Bollywood recipe with Big Houses, Lots of money,Many songs with Glamorous Flavers, but still good acting by SK. Swades is a opposite of all those SK movies. SK has always been a good actor, but in this movie he shows his various skills, and everyone who sees this movie are gonna fall in love with SK's acting. SK is sure the best actor in India by the time, and is the only to lift the Throne after Big B. I wont tell the story of the movie, thats is you to see, but its a guaranteed beautiful movie that you cant stop loving. The only minus in the movie is the songs, they could have been better."

Of amazing brilliance here is the haunting, some times melodious and rightfully traditional music score by A.R. Rahman. Critics will beg to differ on grounds that is a tad to long, sometimes contrived and resembling a documentary.... They can keep on begging! Shah Rukh Khan has finally proved to be an amazing versatile actor, finally capable of doing subtle romance and displaying solemn emotions. This movie is a lot about soul-searching and finding a purpose to life. Well, it's ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Nothing reminds one of doing something for your country more than \"Swades\". It's another master piece by Ashutosh Gowrikar after his international fame for \"Lagaan\". Swades is a effort from his heart and it's true to the last bit of every human emotion we possess. Being a NASA scientist coming over to India from the USA, the hero realized that certain things that he took for granted are a luxurious commodity .People in his village didn't even have the means to what we would call basic commodity. He recognized the need to do something about it and he does for the betterment of his village and its people. Its a movie with India in heart and spirit. It could be analyzed as a movie for all Indians staying abroad to give something back to your country, for you are its children.It surely brings out the patriot in you."

The film does, in places, look like the director picked up too many issues at the same time, but the net sum is a movie that is very, very inspiring and thought provoking. So if the proof of the lemon is in having it, this one definitely takes the cake. AR Rehman's music is definitely class. The cinematography is also excellent. I was particularly impressed by the way the Turbine shots were taken and edited. You can definitely find traces of Lagaan here and there. But I guess that is to be expected when half the team working on the project is the same. All in all a good movie."

As a new comer leading lady of the film has done a fantastic job. I must say Swades is a very good movie with heart catchy storyline. I have seen this movie several time. I am not really able to review such a class but will admit this film as one of the best movies I have ever seen.I think this one Shahrukh Khan's best movie till date.

Sure, the movie loses a little of its tone after the middle, trying to add political thoughts to mix in a shallow way.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first heard about this movie, I wasn't too sure what to expect. But when I watched it in the cinema, I realised that one of the best things about it was that it had reality in it.\n\nMohan Bhargav, a NASA engineer, returns to his homeland, India and goes in search for his governess, Kaveri Amma and finds her in a village where people do not have basic facilities, such as electricity on a regular. On requesting her to go with him to the USA, he is informed that she can't as she also helps one of his childhood friends, Geeta by looking after her house and her younger brother. He realises that Kaveri Amma, will not leave Geeta until she is married and settled and that the school that she is operating gets a full approval form the seniors in the village for a new plot of land to build it into a college. He then decides that he will do whatever he can to help and then take Kaveri Amma with him.\n\nSha Rukh Khan, as Mohan Bhargav, is just brilliant as is Gayatri Joshi in her first film. The music by A.R. Rehman is also worth listening to as are some songs such as \"Yeh Tara Woh Tara,\" \"Yuhi Chala Chal Rahi\" a duet by Udit Narayan and Kailesh Kher, and \"Yeh Jo Desh Hai Tere\" and finally \"Saawariya.\" Directed by Ashtosh Gowariker, the movie depicts life in villages today and is very much patriotic.\n\nThis is a movie that does not have the glitz and glamour, such as the dressing and jewellery that we see nowadays in almost every movie. Instead it shows reality which is rare to see in any movies these days."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"You have to come to India and experience it. Then you will probably know what I am saying \", says Mohan Bhargava (Shah Rukh Khan), a project manager for Global Precipitation Measurement in NASA to his associate. He knows the beauty which lies inside the culture of India and the importance of being an Indian. Swades: We the people, directed by Ashutosh Gowariker is all about developing a new outlook towards patriotism and also dealing with the relevant issue of brain drain.\n\nShah Rukh Khan plays Mohan Bhargava; an Indian NASA scientist migrated to America as he finally manages to shed off his star persona, enacting a subtle but powerful performance, thanks to director's marvellous vision and excellent story-telling. The film starts with American-based Mohan feeling a deep regret over not being able to take care of his nanny (Kaveri amma), while she was old. He expresses his feelings to his associate Vinod (Rahul Vora) as in how Kaveri amma was next to his mother and how she took good care of him when he was a child.\n\nFilled with an urge to find Kaveri amma, Mohan takes a leave for a week from NASA and sets off to India only to find Kaveri amma in a village called as Charanpur. The fictitious village Charanpur (assumed to be 200 kms near Delhi) broadcasts an Indian rural life which is full of loving, caring and affectionate people but is simultaneously plagued with problems of illiteracy, caste system, child labour and child marriage. As India enjoys urban development, technological leaps, and the software boom, here villagers still struggle to accumulate basic needs such as education and electricity.\n\nIn this small village of Charanpur, Mohan finds himself in a world that stands as the polar opposite to his American lifestyle. He tries to convince Kaveri amma to come with him to America much to the dismay of Geeta (Gayatri Joshi), who lives with Kaveri amma. Geeta is the hindrance in Mohan's task to bring his nanny with him to America. She is strong-willed, straight-forward and has immense love for India and its culture. She repeatedly retorts to Mohan's criticism of the government's inability to provide for its people by questioning his contribution to this society.\n\nThe film starts deviating from this a bit as Mohan decides to channelize his energies in making Charanpur a better place to live as he sees the social evils, the village faces. He helps Geeta in persuading more children in the villages nearby to pursue education, thus gradually falling in love with her. Aided by a local postman Dayal Shrivastav and a local dhaba-owner Mela Ram, Mohan sets off on a mission to bring in more children in their local school. Mohan tries to enable greater access to education, especially for girls, and integration of the castes & appeals to the more liberal members of the village except the conservative council members. With time, Mohan becomes more of a diplomat and less of a dictator.\n\nShah Rukh Khan is sincere, takes you through the gamut of the journey his character Mohan experiences, and even brings in shades to Mohan Bhargava's character. I could literally sense a lighting spark in Mohan's eyes to make his country, one of the best nations in the world. He criticizes the people, claiming that they are irresponsible and do absolutely nothing to make their country progress to pinnacle of glory and you can't help but agree to his diagnosis.\n\nOne of the best climax scenes is the part where Mohan, with the help of his brilliant mind and his experience in the field of science, tries to generate electric power in Charanpur. The scene is shot so beautifully in the village showing how Mohan along with the villagers work day and night to introduce electricity in village starts to get lost in its own darkness.\n\nSure, no one doubts the sincerity of the idea behind making Swades. Conceptually, it is totally noble. It is admirable how the director keeps the movie totally grounded and down-to-earth, not retreating to any commercial pressures. In spite of the movie being of 189 minutes long, the movie doesn't feel to be slow as the director keeps it extremely well paced. Swades is a sensitive story of good triumphing over the evil, only this time evil doesn't have a face but is rather equated with regressive ideology. Indeed Shah Rukh Khan's performance as Mohan Bhargava will go down as one of his best and the most genuine performances till date."

        "review_detailed_main": "Today, I saw 'swades' for 2nd time. I doubt if the version I had seen is director's cut or the final one because the movie seems as though the director sat on editing table and that he loved each scene so much that he just couldn't touch it. To my surprise, it is Shahrukh who disappointed with his acting until he reaches the village. From then on, it's a roller coaster ride. There are a few punch dialogs which I liked : 1) Jai Ram Jee Ki which in English means: May Lord Rama be victorious, which is a form of greeting people in India. 2) Wrestler Postman says to Mohan Bhargav: Let us do some wresting 3) Mohan Bhargav to MelaRam: Even your travel to America is difficult. 4) Mohan Bhargav to village people when attender gives weather forecast after seeing sky : I also do the same job in NASA.\n\nGayatri Joshi is good, in fact almost all the characters did well. The child character and the old lady at old age home should have emoted well. Everything's well up to the climax portion. Climax doesn't look different either on content or emotional quotient. It doesn't look like climax, may be the song in the climax diluted the effect, may be.\n\nMusic is excellent. Background score(especially in titles), songs are very good to ears. The best of the movie is Mohan stay in village This part is great.\n\nI think the script should have been revised again to make it look appealing. May be the next 2nd draft would have been better. It would have been great if the movie's time is less and it's narration crisp to have a better reach. Though the movie did not do well on commercial front, movie lovers with a taste for difference will love this one.\n\nPS: This movie is not selected for official Oscar entry from India. India is not that far behind as is shown in the movie."

The director uses elegant filming and does not go overboard by using senseless scenes (like in most bollywood movies). There are plenty of comic scenes, which are in-line with the story and do not use double meanings. This film would not mean much to a person living in India, as it would to NRIs. The tag line is that if you have some sort of skill, then use it to get your own country ahead rather than going to another country and using that skill. Also the most noticeable fact is that Shahrukh Khan actually acted in this movie and gave some new expressions. If you want to see Shahrukh's best acting, you cannot skip watching this movie."

In a series of drawn out sequences, he encounters various charming village figures, gets involved with community politics, falls in love with a teacher, builds a hydroelectric power station and champions the cause of education. If this sounds like four or five different movies smashed into one, you'd be right. Each one is decent on its own and the protagonist's emotional journey to improve the lives of his country is admirable, but it's drowned out by the muted acting and the repeated fact that he was already helping them in his original role in NASA. Somewhere between an epiphany and a charity montage, I have to give this film an average score."

Had it been released now, it would have been a blockbuster. It's a pity that Swades wasn't a hit at the box office. Very few bollywood movies leave a mark on us and Swades hits the right spot. Also, what can I say about the music by A R Rehman. It's the soul of the movie. Acting is done phenomenally by not just SRK but also by the supporting cast. I personally do not like a lot of SRK movies but this would top the list. One can watch this movie anytime and still be left with that feel good feeling."

        "review_detailed_main": "Swades is simply one of those rare gems that once you see them you know they're special, and realise there is so much depth to their beauty.\n\nAshutosh Gowariker clearly demonstrates once again that he is a director in control of his art, and message that he wishes to portray in this art form. His genius here was to chose an A-list actor who would not only do justice to the central character, but also give the kind of exposure an important film like this commands. In my opinion Shah Rukh Khan delivers a career best performance in his role as 'Mohan'. You see SRK stripped of his usual Bollywood fare, and deliver a honest but charismatic performance that is truly trying to make a change in this world. Credit for this performance must not be taken away from the director, who helped extract those extra little nuances and depth from his lead actors.\n\nThe messages in this movie do not instantly throw themselves at you, rather they are conveyed like subliminal images and in the form of body language. The cinematography is original and flows gracefully throughout, and it makes an impact in epic terms when you least expect it. Style is never sacrificed over substance, but nevertheless the film has so much style it goes unnoticed on a first viewing. Characters are given the opportunity to breath a personality which is rare in modern Indian cinema. Both the script and screenplay simply mesmerises.\n\nYou take so much away with you in this movie that it's almost thought provoking. There's a yearning to know what happens to these characters after, and a hope that they do live on in happiness.\n\nOne of the best Indian movies of the decade."

The movie traverses you through the highs and lows Shah Rukh faces while his stay in that remote village and how he finds his unconscious roots is a commendable job that the director has filmed. According to me, it was more like a metaphor where a man comes to realise himself and his roots by browsing his natural inclinations. Overall, this movie can never be replicated in any form and should remain pure as it has been till now.

Great photography, sync sound tech, locales and AR rahman's beautiful music as well as background score just raise this movie over others. I have seen this multiple times and it still moves me. The water drinking scene is the most impactful and have yet to see another scene like that.\n\nForget DDLJ, and other yashraj and johar films, this is the film which defines SRK and his acting!

I've got to say she is beautiful, she's got a nice figure and this was the perfect way to start her career in the film industry.

        "review_detailed_main": "Swades review :\n\nAshutosh Gowariker almost reached the Oscar stage with Lagaan (2001) and missed the ultimate honour by a whisker. Lagaan is undoubtedly one of the finest creations of Indian cinema and many books have already been written on it. Unfortunately, the towering success of Lagaan weighed large on his next Swades which was dismissed by then critics as a three and half hour long lecture on moral science. They had clearly missed the underlying pertinent theme that Gowariker wanted to highlight...\n\nA NASA officer (Shah Rukh Khan) travelling to an Indian village to meet his childhood nanny (Kishori Ballal) and then contributing to its upliftment might have sounded too simplistic on paper but the way Ashutosh treats his subject so tenderly makes Swades a slow burner which hits you only in its climax. Yup, this is like a premium scotch which should be relished with right amount of patience and respect and it will certainly give you a high at the end..\n\nShah Rukh Khan (SRK) is outstanding as Mohan Bhargav and this is a role for which he will attain immortality. It is the best performance of his career and I cannot think of any other star who could've fit in here so seamlessly. Not even Aamir who was approached initally but declined the offer!!\n\nThe best part of Swades is every character - even peripheral one like the local postman (Rajesh Vivek) amazed by this new concept of email - remains memorable. The pretty Gayatri Joshi, cast opposite SRK, is totally convincing as the strong willed Gita. Note her chemistry with SRK when she helps him wear a dhoti.\n\nGowariker and AR Rahman combo works wonders again after Lagaan and all the songs sync in perfectly with the narrative. My personal favourite is \"Yuhi chala chal rahi\" picturised on SRK and Makrand Deshpande playing a fakir he meets enroute his village.\n\nThe dialogues are also a winner. Debating on whether India is a \"Mahaan desh\", SRK states in one scene \"Main nahi manta hamara desh duniya ka sabse mahaan desh hai. Lekin yeh zaroor manta hoon ki hum mein kabliyat hai, taaqat hai, apne desh ko mahaan banane ki\". So very true!!\n\nIn another scene, the film drives its point without a single dialogue. It is on the railway platform where SRK buys water from the poor boy and drinks it. Just see his expressions at that particular moment. It pretty much sums up the message the film wants to convey...\n\nOutstanding stuff, indeed!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

        "review_detailed_main": "Swades is not your typical Bollywood movie. It one ups the Chalte Chaltes and Kabhi Khushie Kabhie Ghams typical to Indian cinema. The storyline is not the usual boy meets girl and they can't be together; it is about an NRI (Non Resident Indian) who goes back home on vacation in search of his elderly nanny/governess. He returns home with a condescending attitude towards the \"backwardness\" of Indian society, but a stay in a small rural village changes his attitude from one of disdain to one of determination.\n\nShahrukh Khan has never given a better performance. Unlike some of his other movies where his acting constantly reminds you that he is, indeed, Shahrukh Khan (which was probably the point), in this one he blends in seamlessly with the other characters. All the characters are three dimensional and deep, and each of them has a heartbreaking story to tell.\n\nThe only thing that prevents me from giving this movie a 10/10 is the obligatory \"Yes I'm in love\" song sequences. Yes, I understand that they are quintessential to Bollywood movies, but this is the only complaint I have about Swades. Otherwise, it is a beautiful film, stripped of glitz and glamour, that tells a profound and meaningful story."

This is not the kind of movie where you can expect action, fun etc., Rather this movie focuses on the grass root level on why India is still a developing nation.\n\nThis movie clearly depicts the true image of India's poverty, caste system etc.,. The story was told in a way that it does not hurt any of the Indian tradition or its culture. After seeing this movie, a urban citizen can understand where the problem really is and what can be done to avoid it.\n\nA Revolution cannot happen within a day or two. These kind of movies could only show what is happening around us. The movie makers' success lies in the small thought they are able to inject into audience's minds.\n\nThe script, the place, the actors, the music - all were just perfect. Still this movie cannot make a significant collection in box office because of the lack of commerciality.\n\nYet i would suggest every Indian to watch this movie. You can really feel that you have gained something after watching this masterpiece.\n\n10 out of 10."

It is a perfect role for SRK, although I feel Veer Zaara is still the most SRK-like film.\n\nThe story is simple and grounded which only makes it more real. It is well directed because it was easy to get carried away with the background of protagonist and some novice filmmaker might have made him fly rockets out of Charanpur! Ashutosh Govarikar showed his expertise of carving out beautiful character arcs with finesse and delivering an astound message for those who ever lose faith and hope in their motherland!"

King khan's acting was like master class and the story of the movie was wonderful. There is no intro or mass scenes just a simple movie that has a message to all.\n\nThe music also has equal importance in the movie, in conveying the emotions of the characters. Although i didn't like all the songs, but it was well placed through out the movie. And romantic scenes had a good chemistry throughout. Kaveri amma, Mohan, Gita and all other characters will be on our minds even after the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr. Gowarikar - I am now a true fan.\n\nI did not much like Lagaan because I was put off by the cricket fantasy component in the film, by the unreal premise. But with Swades Ashutosh Gowarikar has shown that he can make a mature movie on a burning topic, make it in an almost documentary style, yet keep the hearts and minds of the audience engaged. Swades shows the current ills in rural India (which BTW have changed little over the years) in a gentle - nudging us into realization - way. The main point is not that a little reservoir is built and electricity generated, but the fact that given the right catalyst, change can happen from within the confines of this rural society and at the local level. The story is simplistic at best but somehow resonates with young and old alike. The usual trappings are present but are very subdued, the ensemble of characters is so authentic I am convinced that he spent a fair amount of time in a village studying the social structure there.\n\nWhat I loved: The building of the tale - The slow acceptance of rural life by the NRI Mohan - sleeping in camper, then on a string bed (Khatiya), bathing in the camper, then at the well. The village caste and social hierarchy - most authentically portrayed by the open air cinema with the upper castes in front and the dalits (lower casts) behind the screen - subtle! The desire to better one's life abroad - MelaRam was amazing! The Village panchayat, the wrestling, the post office (and postmaster!), the Ramlila - these slices of village life were amazing.\n\nThe portrayals - Mohan - could any one but SRK have done this role as well? I doubt it. With his glam sort of image in the usual fare, you expect certain things in his portrayals - but all I saw was the nerdy engineer Mohan. There was no evidence of the superstar persona - just the simple engineer type, perturbed by all he sees around him, unable to comprehend why things are the way they are, then in true engineer type problem solving way setting out to slowly change things. His breakdown on the rent collection trip ending in buying and drinking water at a small train station is the most intense and yet underplayed performance I have ever seen. I NEVER cry in films and I was looking for the Kleenex in these shots! Kudos to the award deciders, if they had given him an award for Veer Zaara over Swades I would never ever look at these awards for any validation of any kind.\n\nGayatri Joshi as Geeta was good, a bit polished looking, but she was a Delhi educated girl so OK. She held her own in almost every scene and said much using her eyes and expressions.\n\nKaveriamma - we need more mother types roles to go to her, I wanted her to be my Mom! Nivaranji, MelaRam, the entire gram panchayat, what an assemblage of authentic characters.\n\nThe music - I have heard that this is ARR's personal favorite album. It shows - the road song is fabulous, Yeh Tara, Dekho naa, are divine. But the top award goes to Yeh jo des hai tera sung by the Maestro himself. This is some of the best music to come along after a long time and the previous stuff like this for me was - yes you guessed it - ARR and Dil se.\n\nThe bad: The Sanwariya song is beautiful but could be chopped out to shorten the film, ditto for the Ramlila sequence. Some of the stuff was a bit preachy but then in Hindi cinema the obvious often needs to be stated.\n\nOverall this is among my all time favorite movies - I will be watching out for the next one from Mr. G. Above all, thank you for wringing such a career best performance out of SRK, we knew there was good stuff in him, just needed to see it again."

This was SRK at his peak. Cinematography is damn beautiful. Eventhough I never belonged to this time but while watching this, I somehow felt nostalgic and connected. Damn, 00s Bollywood was the real deal. This has to be one of my favourites and I'd recommend everyone to watch this once, doesn't matter if you're an Indian or anyone else."

While Patriotism is the underlying emotion, the stark contrast between wasteful plentiness and abject poverty/hardship is brought out excellently. SRK has done a fabulous job here and scenes where his eyes well up could be a natural reaction to the scene and the background music. He should do these kind of roles more. We also need movie makers like Ashutosh G who go after what their heart tells them rather than ringing cash registers.."

        "review_title": "Laudably Overwhelming",
        "review_detailed_main": "By far, Swades is one of the most emotionally overwhelming experiences I have had while watching a film. And I include all of Hollywood when I say that.\n\nSwades comes home to me as a very real depiction of life. It would be a fool's errand to fixate the film onto patriotism, for it is so much more. The film portrays all the truths of human life through multiple socio-economic strata.\n\nSwades' direction hits that perfect sweet spot, with Gowariker being at the top of his game. Every Camera Angle, every Camera Movement, and even the staging has been done in a way that makes sense to the story. Frequently, we find ourselves in a situation where we are trying to evaluate the reasons why certain directorial decisions were made, but in vain, since there was no intent on detailing. This is where Swades breaks all expectations. Ashutosh's ambitious vision for the project was nailed by the skillset he possesses.\n\nAnd that brings me to directing Shahrukh Khan. By far, after My Name is Khan(2010), this is SRK's best performance for me. Known widely for a slightly over the top portrayal of his characters, SRK makes an archetypical exception in Swades. The subtleties and nuances on the actor's part contribute astronomically to Gowriker's vision of Visual Storytelling. Without an actor like him, it would be hard for a director to convey the story visually, and would have to resort to dialogue exposition. That adds another point to the beauty of Swades which separates it out from its Bollywood contemporaries. Ashutosh trusts you as an audience, and hardly does any spoon-feeding of information.\n\nThe cinematography, editing, and other aspects are right on point, none drawing the attention away from the story's main objective. I don't know if the use of Anamorphic Lenses was a creative call or just a norm for Bollywood at that point, but it made sense nonetheless. The distortion around the edges added a texture to the visuals which went hand in hand with the story. 35mm adds its own character with the grains and organic colors of rural India.\n\nThe Music, of course, needs no validation from me. This film represents AR Rahman at the peak of his game as well, which carries forth to his pieces in Jodhaa Akbar(2008), Gowariker's next project. Just 1 or 2 times I felt like the music was being stretched just a bit, but a)That is the director's call, and b) It can really be forgiven thanks to the cinematography and the performances by the actors.\n\nAnother unique thing I love about Ashutosh Gowariker is that the story practically never halts when music is playing in his films, something that is abhorrently present in peer Bollywood films. This I find to be more or less true with Lagaan(2001), Swades(2004) as well as Jodhaa Akbar(2008), 3 of the veteran director's gems.\n\nOn a story level, the richness of Swades shows the fervency of the writers to create a sense of reality, displaying how Rural India really is. However, it would be a mistake to say that this is the only theme in Swades. It is a highly character driven film, and does absolute justice at the end when the external conflicts of the character have been resolved, yet he must face the internalised issues. There is a whirlwind of emotions, from Light Hearted comedy, to enthralling visual moments inducing tears. Every character has been crafted till it was fully discovered.\n\nI recommend this film to each and every person reading this review. Might end up being one of the 3 most overwhelming emotional journeys of your life.\n\nHope this helps :)"

Movies that were dismissed on their release and ended up as box office disasters sometimes do return back to make the list of ' Cult Classics.' With due respect to Lagaan and Jodha Akbar, this AG's masterpiece inspite of being a failure at the box office will continue to shine like the biggest Tara out of his constellation of stars."

This movie realised me love your family and culture and shouldn't compair our traditional with western culture. Music of movies is very beautiful. My favorite song of this movies ye jo desh h mera. I'm also big fan of AR rhman music. India is best country all over the world. I love my mother and my motherland. When mohan ( SRK) watch one child who sell one cup water in just few rupees. I was cried that scene many times. Jai hind ( sorry for my bad english)"

Scenes that pull at one's heartstrings, this is a film that leaves the viewers with something memorable & poignant. I marked this review as 'no spoilers' so I don't want to give away too much. But I would like to point out how beautifully water is used as a motif throughout the film. Was originally going to take a star off due to the length of the film, originally felt that it dragged in parts. But I decided to award the 10 stars because it all tied in well."

After watching the first 30 minutes, I could predict how the story was going to go. And, as expected there had to be a pretty woman (who looked very incongruous in a rural setting with her plucked eyebrows, boutique-style dresses) to keep the Hero interested. In spite of these flaws, this movie is definitely worth watching. The movie has several stereotypes, many of which are true (ignorant village leaders, caste-ism, etc), but others, like that of the dumb compliant villagers, are somewhat irritating. When Shah Rukh Khan wants build a dam, all the villagers stand around and help in an extra-ordinarily orderly manner. Indians are never this orderly ! I read some reviews calling this one of the best Indian movies ever...not true. Its a merely a good movie, not a great one."

Sharu Khan is an inspiring actor! Yes he can act very well and his rendition of \"Waiting For A Girl Like You\" by Foreigner is funny! Director Ashutosh Gowariker has done a tremendous job.\n\nSwades deals with real issues and tries to bring a conclusion to them through a beautiful coming of age tale of the main character Mohan (Sharu Khan). TRUE - It doesn't have the Bollywood formula. And people expected that - but its a slow story that needs to unwind and does unwind well to help you get to know the characters and relate. Its simply a tale about India. Its beauty. Its mystery. Its people.\n\nLike the first reviewer Sabsinha say \"Thank god for Swades.\" I am in strong agreement. It was only sooner or later that something this ground breaking would find its self a leader in new wave of films coming up for air. This film is simply stunning.\n\nAsif Kapadia's \"The Warrior\" is beautifully directed like this film. Different content yes, but technically its cinematography, music, direction and script are matured enough for for foreign awards.\n\nBolly\"would\" seems to be emulating the foreign market with silly Blockbusters. I hope its own home grown talent can flourish and Inspire.\n\nInspired I am indeed. I hope you will be too.\n\nHope this helps, Ricky"

Also the scene just before interval is too good.\n\nSRK finally gets a chance to prove the actor inside. Debutant Gayathri Joshi has a bright future ahead. With this movie, Ashuthosh joins the class of directors like Mani Ratnam and Rajkumar Santhoshi. Swades will certainly get some awards at the National level (A R Rahman's music is a sure bet) and will surely be India's Oscar nomination next year.\n\nBut it is heart-breaking to see such a nice movie heading for a failure at the Box Office.

It shows how much the ordinary upper and middle class can do, but fail to do. There is a feeling of helplessness about it. Some people can point to the whole lighting the bulb as being all too filmy but u guys are missing the point.

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the most important spirit lifting and patriotic films of the last decade.\n\nIt follow the John F. Kennedy's line \"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for the country\". Apart from working in a job, be it private or government, then going home to have a wife/husband, so to take forward the legacy, producing population and calling it as our babies, what are we doing for the country? Setting up institutions is not enough we must be doing something to make this a better place to live, I want to do something but before I begin, I need money so I must earn money good enough to be able to spare for a few outside my very own family. It brings the questions like should I be contributing to the huge population by producing one or should I adopt and fight for removing orphans and make my place a better place to live in.\n\nWho would agree to my thoughts in a society as hypocritical as ours is what I always ask myself, having said all about my thoughts, this is a movie that I always loved since the first time I saw it in Sangeet Theatre with a big group of my friends. It made a few of us say \"Bijli, Bijli\" at the climax, like Lagaan made us say \"Bhuvan, Bhuvan\". Ashutosh Gowariker had proved with this film, that films can be long enough if there is a real need for it, this was extremely long and it had to be long because there are so many issues within a country as diversified as us. The prime purpose that I love the film is it lifts by spirit and fills in the \"can do\" spirit that is vaguely missing.\n\nNow, the technical departments except for editing are sublime. A R Rahman, gave a score that stood even today as a great. One can never get bored of \"Yunhi Chala Chal\" or \"Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera\" and the whole of background score is just apt to the visuals. The writing and screenplay are meticulous, be it keeping off the glass when offered in the beginning and then taking a sip at the railway station and feeling the water for the first time, or be it the nuances of love between Geeta (Gayatri Joshi) and Mohan Bhargav (Shahrukh Khan).\n\nPerformances are exemplary from each and specifically, Shahrukh Khan gave the most composed performance of his life, his emotions were natural, when I saw this in theatre, I was very apprehensive coz I do not like Shahrukh's choice of movies, but went for this solely because of Ashutosh and ARR. I was happy and in the process of the movie, I learnt that actually Shahrukh is a good actor who is spoilt by his choices of films. This is the only film that Gaytri Joshi was a part of, and she made Geet her own, by becoming the character. She is the epitome of a perfect Indian women who is traditionally progressive. She knows the traditions and she knows the purpose of her life too. Rare to find a strong willed woman like her. Also, Kishori Balal as Kaveriamma and the huge supporting cast did an excellent job.\n\nAh, so proud to have seen this so many times and I love this movie each time I saw it. It's not flawless, no one simply agrees to hand over 100 men for work. You cannot produce electricity just like that, creating some basic apparatus. Yet, the energy behind it, the resolve, the spirt are what made this movie a great one. With nearly 3 and half hours running time, it makes us ask so many questions to ourselves.\n\nFinally, I am again asking myself the same question, am I born, to earn a job, marry, have kids, work for their school fees and education, pass on my assets to my kids and die. Or is there a bigger purpose to life, if so am I doing it?\n\nA 5/5 for this, no less than that ever to one of my favourite movies ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are good Bollywood movies, great Bollywood movies and then there is Swades! For me, this movie is simply perfection. Even though Swades did not receive approval from Indian critics, this movie for me was one of the best things to come from Indian cinema.\n\nThe story is quite simple and something which all of us NRIs relate to - being abroad, lonely for long and craving for that companionship and love which we all grew up with back in India. Childhood back in India was full of fun, with cousins, friends, neighbours, relatives and living abroad deprives you of all that. So I could relate this movie soo much to my circumstances, especially when the final song arrives, I thought it was time to pack my bags and head home for good. Sadly, life does not work this way. Still, this movie reminds me of all those golden days, long gone now and puts a smile on my face every time I watch it.\n\nComing to the movie, it is full of sweet nothings and strong social messages. The film makes a strong case of people coming together as Humans and not to distinguish or discriminate! Such a simple message and it is shown in the most simplistic but very effective way in the movie. The love story between the lead characters was subtle but very sweet and effective. The songs, they elevate the movie onto a new level altogether!\n\nAll the songs are masterpieces and no one other than A.R.Rahman could do full justice for this film. Just listen to \"Yeh jo desh hai tera\", it surely makes you feel nostalgic. \"Saawarya\" and \"Dekho Na\" are excellent love ballads, whereas \"Yuhi Chala\" and \"Yeh Tara\" provoke the sense of fun, enjoyment and unity! \"Aahista\" is one of the best lullabies ever composed and \"Pal pal hai bhari\" tells an episode from Ramayana in a convincing way.\n\nSwades is one of my favourite Bollywood movies and I still own a pristine collectors edition DVD of this film and watch it time to time, whenever I am feeling home-sick."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ashutosh Gowarikar has done it again! Being an NRI, I can relate to SRK's yearning to live in India. Very subtle images are used to communicate extremely powerful messages. For example, Shahrukh is traveling in crowded buses and second-class non-air-conditioned trains in India. In the US, he is riding in his spacious, luxury Jaguar with Cherry wood panels. However, all SRK feels in those cold leather seats is loneliness as he imagines seeing his love waving goodbye to him in the rear-view mirror. Thus, he can attain all the material wealth being a top-notch engineer working for NASA in the glitzy and glamorous US, but he can never be happy away from his homeland and loved ones. A.R. Rehman has composed outstanding music--I think one of the best of 2004. This movie has several, beautiful tear-jerking scenes. The only part of the movie that isn't that great is that it is stretched out and quite long in the middle where SRK is putting his engineering skills to work, but other than that, this is a great movie."

It gave me a \"this one was made for me\" feeling and I didn't feel like watching any other movie for several weeks ! I doubt if any other movie will take its place in my heart for a long time to come.\n\nThe movie is NOT TOO LONG, by any means. The subject matter is heavy, so the length is quite justifiable. In fact, if you get the original DVD set with both the DVD's, you'd be surprised to see how many scenes have been deleted, including the song \"Aahista, Aahista\". The length of the movie is just right, and they could have retained many of the deleted scenes including that song, in my humble opinion. If you still think the movie is too long, think of it this way - it is an EXCELLENT TV serial, ultra-compressed to ~3 hours for the big screen. Everything in the movie looks so real, there is nothing that is unbelievable.\n\nAR Rahman is at his best. The more I listen to the songs and the background score, the more I realize how brilliant it is. Shahrukh - well, there is no Shahrukh in this movie - only Mohan Bhargava. I doubt if any other contemporary actor would have done better.\n\nI can go on and on. Email me if you want to discuss this movie. I would love to talk about it.\n\nHow about a sequel (Swades II), that shows Mohan Bhargava really succeeding back home in his endeavor ?"

Shahrukh takes a break from his usual no-brainer movies to try and make an impact on the viewer and proves he has not lost his agility to the so called masala films.Beautiful music scoring by the Mozart-of-Madras Rehman makes the viewing experience even more fulfilling, especially \"yeh jo des\". Even though the runtime is well over 180 mins the plot doesn't let you down.Overall a wonderful movie, a thumbs up to ashutosh and shahrukh."

Githa, as his spirited romantic liaison has given a convincing performance regarding that it is her debut film and that too with a superstar.

Gayatri has done really well given her first movie.I gave it a 8 though the concept is awesome n superb presentation though lacked a bit of impact. It also tries to inculcate a sense of moral responsibility between us which we really lack(to be honest). All in all this movie cannot be missed..."

It has helped me understand that we are privileged to receive a good education, job, etc., but we should and must give back to society by sharing with the underprivileged the knowledge we have gained! Shah Rukh Khan is an excellent actor, the best in the world, and I am glad he was chosen to do this film. It is great seeing him in everyday clothes instead of costumes. It also gives much insight into the man, his ability to mimic and his interaction with children. It gives us some insight into the humanitarian work he does for the underprivileged in India. Truly a great movie with a new movie actress Gayatri Joshi!"

Sequence at the railway station was really touchy and when Shahruk went to take rent from old man.Songs were just amazing.A.R Rahman music is excellent.And NASA shooting didn't take viewer attention from main focus of the story.Ashutosh once again proved that he is master director.Shahrukh pulled out a memorable performance and proved that he is the best actor now.Lets finger crossed for Swades for Oscars Swades...Oscar is waiting for you..BEST OF LUCK."

It shows same feeling such I was feeling at that moment of time. I didn't know when movie ended. It has manifested many messages to the people of India. If you think carefully than it has shown many hidden messages. Though mostly the film's message is for NRIs but there are many good messages to take note for residents of India.People of India must unite to solve the problems of the country and to make developed nation otherwise there is no point to blame each other.This is to be understand by NRIs' that we are very selfish so that we always think about our progress but we don't take care about the betterment of our own motherland and our own brothers and sisters.Actually it is considered to be good if we should know our history first and take care of our culture and our country.Nowadays girls are running behind the NRI guys for marriage by leaving their motherland. Actually they should take proud of their own work or job in India and should think that they are working at the grass-root level of country which can make very good progress of your own motherland. They should not leave their mother to serve other country. They must take note who are serving in foreign country that all you are working is only for your betterment by leaving your motherland and ignoring your brothers, sisters, culture and history. It has one very good hidden message. We can take outside wind to make grow our tree but we can not cut our root and plant it in neighbour's field. If you do so than future tree will be neighbour's tree and it will never consider as your tree. This message explain everything behind the scene. Thanks and salute to Asutosh and Team of Swades. JaiHind."

        "review_detailed_main": "Swades is one of the finest Indian movie made which was very well directed, well scripted and a powerful performance given by Sharukh Khan A NRI comes back to India in search of his nanny and in the process re- discovers the grass root issues like untouchable , caste systems division , proper education etc which was existing in the same village where his nanny stays. What follows next is the measure taken up by him to improve the electricity in the village. Swades is directed, scripted and story told by Ashutosh Gowarikar (Lagaan). Ashutosh has chosen the story which is completely different from his previous venture. The direction is impressive handling actually many sequences with perfection. One of my favourite scene is the sequence in train where Sharukh Khan tries to hold his emotions after buying water from akid in kullar for 25 paise. He is marvelous and has given his career best performance. The story of NRI coming back to his roots and doing something worthwhile is equally absorbing with amazing cinematography capturing the beautiful locales of Indian villages. Dialogues are inspiring. Music by the legend is A.R.Rahman is soul- riveting. Each and every song has some message to tell with beautiful lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. Coming to the performance , I couldn't have imagined anyone but Sharukh Khan playing Mohan Barghav. As I mentioned , the actor has given his career best and very well deserved performance. The complete change in his character from NRI who taunts at the weak Indian systems to a person who starts caring for the village and goes one step to implant the 24 hour electric supply is superbly handled. I loved his sequence in the train where he couldn't control his outburst after observing the struggle and poverty of the villagers. Gayatri Joshi is fine but Kishori Balal as Sharukh's nanny is splendid. Swades , overall , is an amazing movie with a very well-intentioned message to do something for the country. Excellent \u2013 4.5/5"

In the process he, a man who has seen technology at its forefront at NASA, comes face to face with the ground level problems in rural India.\n\nThe acting is marvellous. You get to see Shah Rukh Khan in a different role, and his facial expressions in the film are fantastic. Gayatri Joshi is unbelievable for a beginner. The rest of the supporting cast, be it the nanny, the postman, the man who wants to go to America or the children. One and all are perfect in their roles.\n\nBut the best acclaim definitely goes to Ashutosh Gowariker. The man is the only one in Bollywood to actually pay attention to details in his films. The NASA bits are actually filmed there, the NASA details and projects are correct, no American speaks Hindi, and every bit about the rural India realistic. The film is based on real issues, and is very thoughtful, contrary to most Bollywood films that hit the market today. And it tackles them in a thorough way.\n\nThis film is a real gem in Bollywood, and so is Ashutosh Gowariker. There is hope for Bollywood as long as there are people like him around with the courage to make films like he does, not purely for entertainment, but as a thoughtful work of art..."

It takes great courage to even attempt to make a movie like this. I would like to say 'hats off !' (literally) to director Ashutosh Gowariker's effort.

Movie's pace is slow but depicts real India. But in an attempt to address so many issues movie never seemed to have a single purpose from the start. The movie fails to give any concrete solution for the problems.Shahrukh was quite brilliant and so was Gayatri for a new comer."

She left her old age home in Delhi to live in a remote farming community of Charanpur. In the village, he finds a cast of quirky folks, old caste prejudice, dire poverty and school teacher Gita. Gita's school is threatened with downsizing as the girls and the poor rarely get education, at least no more than 4th grade. Her arranged marriage future in-laws demand she stop working outside of the house. Mohan is moved to improve the villagers' lives.\n\nThis is the most compelling Bollywood movie I've seen so far. The rom-com part is fun and endearing. The romance is solid rom-com gold. For me, the social justice is a little heavy-handed. I find a lighter touch is often much more effective. There isn't as much dancing as the normal Bollywood affair but the songs are beautiful. This is a well-written rom-com dripping with social justice sincerity."

It is a brilliant original piece of work no doubt but those words do not do justice to the feelings that Swades conjured in me as I watched it.\n\nComparing it with Lagaan is - for the lack of a better phrase - like comparing apples to oranges. Swades is one of the most passionately and practically patriotic viewing experiences of my life. It is the patriotism that some of us feel and the rest of us should.\n\nI do not remember hearing a single musical composition, dialogue or seeing a visual that talked about desh-bhakti or bharat. In fact, I do not remember seeing the Indian flag even once. But since watching a little gem of a movie called Dhoop, I have not seen a film that is more intrinsically Indian in its emotional content.\n\nIn Swades the villain is the enemy within and not a country, organisation or group of people. The enemy is us. And the ability to influence and hence destroy that this enemy possesses is far greater than what the aforementioned entities could ever hope to have.\n\nI remember reading somebody's comment here that there is no brand name clothing, no grand entries, no sermons on country and duty, no breathtaking visuals - because villages don't have any breathtaking visuals. They are at times congested and claustrophobic and at best minimal and clean.\n\nThe most brilliant directors of our time break through with that uniquely brilliant film that is not a Hollywood rip-off and that actually has a prepared and detailed screenplay. Varma with Shiva, Ratnam with Roja, Bhansali with Khamoshi, Santoshi with Ghayal, Kukunoor with Hydrebad Blues, Farhan Akhtar with Dil Chahta Hai and Gowariker with Lagaan. And just like all of them have proved with their subsequent efforts that they are here to change the direction of cinema and are not just one-film flukes, Gowariker has proved with Swades that he is truly our filmmaker and one of our finest. 10/10."

The person who really stole the show was Gayatri Joshi who you would never think was her debut role. Shah Rukh naturally played himself, although performance wise i thought he did an outstanding job in Veer-Zaara. This film explores culture, values, and tradition which are the main elements of India. I wasn't a big fan of Veer Zaara. I think Yash Chopra is overrated. I was pleased to have watched Swades following Veer Zaara just to so i know that there's still hope for Indian cinema."

But, I definitely believe we have the potential of becoming one of the greatest nations in the world' said Mohan Bhargava in a sequence while arguing with a bunch of orthodox villagers. This film is probably one of the best films SRK has done in terms of social relevance and storytelling. The screenplay has been drafted superbly and the casting is the actual strength of this film. This film is surely gonna stir up a sea of emotions in the NRI Indian diaspora abroad. It will definitely appeal to people who have at some point in their lives left their motherland/home in search of a better life elsewhere. The film has all the ingredients that make it a commercial success as well. In short, this movie offers something somewhere for every Indian who has grown disillusioned of the ways/system of their own country. India deserved a film such as this for a long long time and finally, we have a piece of cinema which boasts of patriotism in an unconventional manner. Jai Hind!"

And it wasn't a hit when it came out it flopped badly. Since the first time I saw it in 2012 till today in 2020, I have seen this a dozen times and it still hurts. I only curse myself why didn't I watch it sooner, probably because I didn't have the maturity at that age to understand this kind of cinema. This movie hits where it hurts. An absolute brilliant cinematic experience. No one else could have portrayed the character the way SRK did. Just fabulous, this kind of acting is why SRK is aptly called King of bollywood. The story, the acting, the music and the basic root level issues of our country are so beautifully brought out in this piece of art. It's just amazing. A must watch to know what Indian cinema is capable of."

I'd read, a leading director who commented on him, that he comes in a package with best designers, director, music, best locations on shoot etc. etc, I strongly recommend him to watch this movie, and would like to know what he could say to this. It was good and a big change to see SRK dancing with children. Star SRK has transformed into character, good!!!. AG has carried simplicity in every angle of the film.\n\nAnother good thing is the casting, Ashutosh deserve a big applause for this, all faces were apt for the character. Visuals, music, cinematography in short the whole crew a big applause, you guys had done a wonderful job.\n\nTruly anticipate seeing such movies ."

Well done to Ashutosh Gowariker, who doesn't complicate the plots with anything unnecessary and also sticking to a wide variety of emotions and stories unlike the usual love stories which are differentiated however very few film makers can be dependant upon unique scripts and for some reason can't make a movie without adding that bit of romance in, yeah love is cool but life is full of many more wondrous things to learn from, Mr Ashutosh keeps his movies straightforward and simple, Swades is a must see movie, exceptionally stimulating if the moral message is understood correctly. I hope he continues to make these kind of movies and sod the people who think they're boring, just shows how set some people can be in their ways."

It beautifully captures the simple joys of life, the bonds we share with others, and the deep connection we have to where we come from. Watching it feels like returning to a memory that's both sweet and a little sad, but in the best way.\n\nWhat makes Swades so special is how it speaks to the heart. The touching love moments lend a delicate appeal that's difficult to forget, and the powerful emotional episodes have an enduring effect. Additionally, there's a certain brand of clever comedy that makes people laugh and lifts their spirits. The emotions in the movie feel real and relatable, pulling you into the journey in a way that feels personal. There's a softness in every scene, a sincerity that makes you reflect on your own connections to home and loved ones.

The subcontinent is struck with poverty, and with careless leaders, is these cases, an educated and thoughtful countryman and hope is all you need. This movie tells us that leaders are not the ones that should be doing everything for us, we should also do something for ourselves. Instead of asking them for our rights and just depending on them, we must find our own leader and help that leader in making us live a better life. THIS MOVIE DID WONDERS. The songs were perfect, Yunhi challa chal raahi and Ye taara woh taara are two of my favourite songs of all time. Gayatri Joshi portrayed her role perfectly, i am surprised this was her first and last movie. SRK was brilliant yet again, this time, in a simpler role but much deserving for the film fare he won due to his performance in Swades. Brilliant movie, hats off."

It encourages us to be the change we wish to see in the world. Don't miss the opportunity to embark on this soul-stirring journey; watch \"Swades: We, the People\" and let it awaken the patriot within you."

Rural communities have long been arranged on the basis of castes - the upper and lower castes almost always lived in segregated colonies, the water wells were not shared, Brahmins would not accept food or drink from the Shudras, and one could marry only within one's caste but this movie is not feared by any caste mafia and shown our caste system and how much we can achive if we conquer caste discrimation."

The background score by Rahman is absolutely stunning.The song\"ye Jo Des he Tera\" is really heartwarming.\n\nShah Rukh Khan once again proves why he is the best in Bollywood. Certain scenes are brilliantly enacted by him and it is a shame that he is churning out more commercial potboilers today than subject-oriented films.Gayatri Joshi gives a wonderfully restrained performance>She does a brilliant job for someone acting in her debut film.The supporting cast is outstanding too.All in all a Superb and must watch film for all Indians."

The film is long, more than 3 hrs but will capture your interest. Its songs are heart touching, by AR Rahman. But you will feel that it's a film only crafted with perfection.\n\nMohan, an NRI comes to India for personal issues, gets hard hitted when he sees the plight of Indians. The poverty ridden society plagued by the casteism deeply moves him. He changes from heart and choose to be one his countrymen. During the endeavor he undergoes other experiences like love life, social service, professional work etc. The film is highly optimistic. Narratives are slow paced, progresses by unfolding social issues through urban rural conflicts. But the issues managed in the film is less, considering the 3hrs + runtime. Towards the end it becomes draggy, really felt the runtime. Despite this the film gives a positively vibed experience.\n\nThere are flaws too. It didn't really aim to inspire anti casteism, rather social service through modern education and in the process speak out against social problems. Flaws like Mohan was a Brahmin who spoke against injustices. Had he been not he would have ignored perhaps persecuted and that would have the true picture of caste ridden society.\n\nThe film satisfies the fantasy of a perfect indian couple, bride having the exquisite beauty with intellect, the groom having the most desirable and respected job along with the sense of romance and sympathy for the poor. The family and rural lives having well-framed social hierarchies and beliefs that are pristine and optimistic. It was felt that the film is narrated from a NRI perspective who feels the plight but not in touch with the inner fear of the social regulations. It showed the patriotic tone positively without aggression and it wins the mass sympathy. Climaxing in love birds being united and return to native the film gives some visuals of both advanced scientific situations and rural lives\n\nWell designed that teaches us the beauty of film making. A. Gowariker's best after Lagaan. A 94/100."

        "review_detailed_main": "Socio-economical development is a familiar term in developing countries. These countries have a large section of people living under the poverty line. Though in developing countries, many many initiatives are being taken every day regarding development, nothing new found in their lifestyle. They are yet to come out from the curse of poverty. There are many reasons for this. When it comes to a country of multi-racial people like India, people having conservative thoughts hinders working together with all. They think upper-caste should avoid lower castes' people to uphold their caste identity. Thus, the proper development lags due to inter-caste conflict. Moreover, here, a comparison is seen between urban and rural life. Indeed, urban life has many advantages. So, people always tend to settle in urban areas to get a more stable life. Nobody is ready to serve his village after graduation. Exceptions are rare. The movie depicts an efficient way to bring development in a country through an educated village belle Gita and a young man Mohan living in abroad. Unless we began to work from the grass-root level with taking proper efforts, we can't think of mass revolution of development like Renaissance. Without eradicating deadly superstitions remaining in our mind and working all together, we can't bring tranquillity in society let alone proper development.\n\nPlot in a nutshell: The story starts with a young man named Mohan, a NRI (Non-resident Indian), working in NASA, all on a sudden, he felt homesick for her caretaker Kaveri amma and decided to bring her back in America. So, taking a break, he went to India. There he met various persons & faced many weird incidents. Gita, another attraction of the movie unveiled herself as a progressive lady contributing her nation through working in grass-root level (teaching in a primary school) nothing but for the betterment of living standard of villagers, in other words, the ultimate development. Besides, conservative thoughts of the villagers, inter-caste conflict, degrading western culture, degrading women education, so-called modesty and so forth. Mohan was determined to bring a change in their outlook and make them overcome these obstacles. Some people, close to him, helped to meet the goal. How did they reach the goal?\n\nConclusion: I forgot to mention earlier that the plot deals with a true event. Movies based on true events have a different taste better than typical stories. Besides, enjoy a soulful soundtrack composed by AR Rahman sir. Despite having a long duration, the movie won't make you bore for a single moment. Moreover, you will get the taste of pure patriotism. Rather than saying \"I love my country\" all the time, a true patriot always loves to show his love towards his motherland, in other words, patriotism through his actions in every phase of life. So, enjoy an educative drama movie with soulful music. To conclude, I must say that you will also find a sweet and sour relationship between Mohan and Gita. No more today. So, watch it to crack the rest. Happy watching!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The star cast of the film includes renowned actor Shahrukh khan and d\u00e9butant actress Gayatri Joshi.The film is based on patriotism and brain drain. The plot is about an Indian who leaves his country for a better life and job. The Indian named Mohan works as a scientist in NASA. While his stay in abroad he always regrets of not being there for his childhood caretaker 'Kaveri' who raised him. So he finally takes a two week leave so that he can correct his mistake and bring Kaveri to USA with him so that she could live her remaining life in comfort. So he finally starts his journey to heartland of rural India which completely transforms him to a different person.\n\nThe movie clearly depicts the contrast between the developed world of abroad and the backward rural India with poverty, illiteracy, superstition and caste system. Above all it shows the conservative nature of society where people are ready for passive acceptance of injustice. The movie beautifully pictures the problem of child labour by showing small boys working in dhabas and railway station in very poor conditions. During his stay he uses his scientific experience and practical nature in helping the villagers to better their lives. His journey helps in rediscovering himself.\n\nThe d\u00e9butant Gayatri Joshi performed her role as a simple school teacher exceptionally well and thus deservingly won the award for the best female debut. And Shahrukh Khan too has done justice to his role which was completely different from his regular image. The songs of the movie were beautifully integrated with the script. Though the movie is a bit slow and long, one hardly loses interest in the film. It is one of the best bollywood movies and a must watch."

The film talks about many things just above the surface because each and everything has its own potential for the making of another movie or something a creative work. So, it is the collection of all the nuances across the conservative section on the outskirts of India. The film talks about Caste discrimination, free education, good infrastructure development and many more. In attribute, Swades is not about the patriotic feeling about our Mother Land but also it lit our thoughts to the betterment of our daily lives."

I don't recall any references in the film. But I loved it. I have never been into a Bollywood movie (or tried), nor have I ever really watched a full length (3hr+) Indian film but this one made me happy. This is one of the greats, where I come in, not knowing a thing about the movie. Not reading the Synopsis and I am blown away.\n\nAt first the subtitles were annoying, because I could hear the characters talking, speaking English, and the subtitles said the wrong thing. It was funny and silly at first but then just unprofessional of Netflix. At first I thought (knowing nothing of the movie, even the year it came out) \"Ohh now, what have I gotten myself into.\" because the main character is sitting on a couch telling his best friend about why he is sad. And from the camera angle, and the score, and the background music, it can be conceived/predicted=\"Ohh no, he is going to tell us a flashback\" and then once that thought spawned in my head I was bracing for impact, waiting for the movie to change to childhood flashbacks. Then, to my surprise, the next seen. We have our main character and a friend singing. Dancing in the most Clich\u00e9 Indian way. Making me so happy I turned the movie on. I don't know the director nor the actor but I do know that they stroke...striked?...struck gold with this movie. I have never lived in poverty-ridden-India and I doubt I ever will, but I feel as though I have experienced the culture of this to Charanpur. Not only that, but the characters were so... simply complex that I felt as thought these characters really do live in this village, also, I know everything to know in the movie about these characters.\n\nTheir struggles as a town with the cast system and working into diplomacy and how our main character affects them really, made me laugh at the progress of these people.\n\nAlso, the epic dance numbers. Usually when I say epic, I would mean multiple people all doing the dances, but no. With this, one person was dancing and singing, but the story being told through song, or the moral that the main character has learned and now we have learned displayed through the song, filled me with joy. Just as our main character falls deep in love with this Indian village, we do as well. Thank you India, for long-ass movies; surprisingly good:\n\nSilverRating: 8/10"

Shahrukh Khan has give justice to his role as well as Gayatri Joshi who plays Gita has done, indeed a good job. This film delivers a strong message in the favor of women of India that they should live with self-esteem,independence and self-reliance.It teaches the Indian women to stand up and fight for their rights. This movie has sent a strong message to the people of India that they should be capable of doing their own work and stop blaming the government. This movie teaches us that education should be imparted to each of us so that we can secure our future.Each one has to a little bit from his side at the grass root level to make the weaker sections come at par with rest of the society. So,i would like to conclude by saying that this amazing has set an example, a very small example but meaningful which shows the hardships and the problems that our country India is facing and it will take the co-operation and the effort of all the people to free the country from theses problems. I would like to thank the director-Mr. Ashutosh Gowariker making such a movie .Hats Off to SWADES-WE,THE PEOPLE"

        "review_detailed_main": "Undoubtedly the best performance by Sharukh Khan. Shahrukh would have got more praises for his performances in Kuch kuch hota hais and Kal ho na hos. But this film truly utilizes his potential to the fullest. He was close enough in Chak De for his best performance but truly Swades was at another level. The number of instances that give you goosebumps and wets your eyes are too many. I truly hope King Khan to do more roles like this that explores his true capabilities though u personally think this will stay his best. Ashutosh will be remembered for creating this movie. Rahman's music was again at its best - for someone who has a lot of fascinating works to his credit - I can't possibly pin his as his best but definitely one of his best - rising the patriotism in you each time you hear the music. The BGM again was outstanding. I have watched it many times and I still don't fail to get a goosebump watching it's many thought provoking sequences. Gayatri was a perfect fit and all the villagers gave their best performances. I personally rate Lagaan one notch below Swades for its intensity, performances and feel factors though both will be at a perfect 10 rating by me. Deep and original portrayal of India's villages, culture and traditions"

Comic timing, anyway most of the Bollywood movies are not known for that so that can be spared. A must watch! Taking us through internal conflicts of a person, how emotionality and rationality fight to take centre stage every now and then.."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is not a musical. Its not a typical \"masala\" Hindi film. But, it is a wonderful film with a message. It is different from the usual Hindi film package, but is a must-watch for all who love meaningful cinema. The movie depicts the story of an NRI Mohan Bhargav played by the biggest star of Bollywood, Shahrukh Khan. The factors that make the film a must-watch are the top notch Direction by Ashutosh Gowariker, Music composed by Academy Award winner A.R Rahman, and above all, excellent performance by its lead actor Shahrukh Khan. The lead actress Gayatri Joshi is a very good actress and its sad that she had not been seen anywhere after this movie. The performances by all other actors are good, but, the movie belongs to none other than Shahrukh Khan. He does not dance or swing around trees, but delivers a performance that remains within everyone for a long long time. He proves yet again why he is called the King Khan and why he is always rated as the best and above all other superstars in Hindi Cinema. After watching the film, one can never forget the scene where Mohan Bhargav notices a small boy selling water for living. Just notice the way how he carefully looks at the boy with tears in his eyes. Or in that scene where he hears the story of a poor man who lives in a neighboring village, Shahrukh shines in all the scenes. He brings to life Mohan Bhargav performing the role with utmost sincerity. Overall this movie is a must watch for all those who love meaningful cinema."

Film shouldn't be just about Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge or Kuch Kuch Hota Hai or Dil To Pagal Hai. If you are a filmmaker, get the message out. There are so many issues to talk about. Not just in India, but globally. I also appreciated Revathy for a film like Phir Milenge. BUT make sure you recover your Money :-) Good job Ashutosh. Will be waiting for your next release. -Krunal"

I watched this movie in 2004 at theater with handful of people as 90% hall was empty.Even though its Shahrukh khan movie it was flop movie at that time. It is not necessary always that flop movie is not good movie.\n\nin this Shahrukh plays very simple role of NASA scientist which is against his lover boy image. He looks very mature & he underplayed his role. Gayatri joshi, the heroine of the movie matches him well as she performed brilliantly.These is only movie in her career. But the main aim of the movie is country needs more skillful people who can contribute to their own country instead of working in other countries. All characters in the movie played their role brilliantly, The music of the movie is very good because of AR Rahman.\n\nI love this movie for two people, first is Shahrukh Khan & Second is director Ashutosh Gowarikar. These is their best work. Watch these movie For these two."

Ashutosh Gowarikar executed the direction and screenplay with a good blend of songs and emotions. AR Rahman cannot be compared to any of the present generation music directors and I would give him a bow for his music and background score in this movie. He asserted that he is a legend of Indian cinema music. Gayathri Joshi showed natural expressions and really simple&beautiful in this movie. Some great scenes like kid selling water cups, haridas who is mocked by the society on regard of his caste, old woman expressing grief for no one caring about them in the ashram etc are overwhelming. Over all it's purely Indian and fresh movie."

This movie does not waste time in things like how he started his career in foreign country and how all those things led him to such feelings. It starts with Shah Rukh Khan suddenly facing immense emotions for his maid-mother living in India.\n\nThis movie brings us a picture of underdevelopment of some regions in India and how they are themselves responsible for this. The false superstitions and believes hampering the progress of these regions are depicted so beautifully in this movie. However this movie has no so called very dramatic climax and suspense but still the message delivered is so noble and inspiring.\n\nHowever this movie was not great at box-office collection but it is worth giving a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr.Ashutosh Gowarikar, thanks for a concept well conceived, a script well prepared and most of all a feature film very well made. The recent editorial columns in the dailies allover India have inspired him and that reflects in his creation from the top to bottom. The theme of \"Brain -Drain\" is a very significant one for the generation of India today, but sadly it didn't appeal to many Indians. Most of the people I have come across have either labelled it a documentary or rather boring. The fact that Shahrukh starred in it had its own downfalls right from the days of Post production. People had come to see the Shahrukh they are used to seeing off late (K3G, Main Hoon Na). What everyone has failed to realise is that he is an actor and thats what made him a star. So lets acknowledge the decent performance he has given inspite of knowing the fact that its not one of his regular romantic affairs. The ones who have liked the movie should stand up and support the movie in whatever way its possible. A lot of guys I have actually studied with and who are now either in US or any other country have appreciated it,more than the ones I have here in India. Okie so we can sum it up by saying that half the purpose is served. But what is even more important is the other half realising it that something should be done about the country when we know we can. Talking about the movie, I believe the soundtrack, locations, performances were in proper sync with each other. It should have been a cult movie but instead its a topic people would like to discuss in their dining tables and then forget it as soon as they hit the sack. People in India need to change and change for the better.\"TAB TAK MAIN NAHIN MANTA, MERA DESH DUNIYA KA SABSE MAHAAN DESH HAIN.\" (Till then I would deny to believe that my country is the best country in the world)- M. Bhargava (Swades)"

From staging to cinematography to the music composition, everything blended so well with realism the filmmakers wanted to portray. Apart from making us cry buckets of tears , Swades does it's part in soothing our hearts with brilliant and eternal Music compositions like Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera and Yuhi Chala Chal Rahi.

        "review_detailed_main": "Swades is the story of Mohan Bhargava, a man working in NASA. Mohan is actually from India, and comes to USA for his career. In the busy of work he forgets totally about India and his people there, and it takes few years before he feels that he is neglecting his people, especially one woman who has brought him up when his parents died. So he decides to go to India and meet her. Her name is Kaveri Amma. After going to India, he inquires her address, and finds that she lives in a small village. So he embarks on that journey. In the village of Charanpur she lives, after going to that village and meeting her, he decides to stay a few days there and take her back with him.\n\nIn Charanpur, Mohan discovers his culture, rejoices the festivals, gets along with people. But he also discovers the problems faced by the villagers, the frequent power cuts, the caste divisions, the poor conditions of people, children working for food, and these problems shake him mentally. Instead of willing to help people in the village, he goes away to US, for his work needs him. But in US he cannot stop thinking of India, the thoughts of India haunt him day and night, until he decides to quit his fabulously luxurious life and come to his country , to this small village and help the people there, and live there.\n\nArtists performance, Shahrukh Khan gives one of his best performances ever. Other cast has less to do, for this is a biographical sort of movie, but everyone does good. Direction is original, and inspiring. Other Departments do a good job. Especially the Theme Song by AR Rahman is very good.\n\nAlthough this movie is a great fare, yet it could not be a big hit at the box office. For this movie has no glamor of Bollywood, nor a dream world of damsels. This movie depicts the conditions of India, the story of Indians.\n\nYou would like this movie very much, unless you are addicted Bollywood type Masala and glamor."
